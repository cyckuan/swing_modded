<HEADLINE>  Hurricane Threatens Bahamas, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis buffeted fragile  
Bahamian islands with gale-force winds on Friday and kicked up high 
surf hundreds of miles away off North Carolina's Outer Banks. 
Forecasters warned it could strike the east coast of Florida as 
soon as Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor of North Carolina put state troopers on alert and  
National Guard troops prepared for storm duty in South Carolina as 
a hurricane watch was posted for Florida's eastern coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Gale-force winds whipped around Harbour Island in the Bahamas  
and waves from a choppy Atlantic crashed over roadways on the 
island of Eleuthera, residents said. Locals and tourists alike 
huddled behind boarded-up windows, said Sharon Rolle, owner of the 
Coral Sands Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	As the brunt of the storm drew near Friday night, Abaco  
islanders huddled behind battened down windows or rushed to 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (shelters) are very much full,'' said Leeland Russell,  
assistant superintendent of police at Marsh Harbour on Abaco. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds from the storm's weaker side bent trees and tossed around  
outdoor furniture in the northwest Bahamas, but the hurricane's 
powerful 80-mph winds threatened to directly strike the Abaco 
islands, according to meteorologist Todd Kimberlain of the U.S. 
National Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``That portion of the northern Bahamas is going to be under the  
gun,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m. EDT, Dennis was centered 20 miles east of Great  
Abaco, a sliver of an island no more than 10 miles at its widest, 
and 290 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	It was expected to resume its west-northwest track near 7 mph  
overnight and sidle along the Florida coast sometime Saturday. Then 
it was expected to head further north, near the Carolinas, within 
three days, Kimberlain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was projected, however, to turn north sometime later  
Saturday, taking it further from the U.S. coast, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	People began preparing for the storm from the Bahamas to the  
Carolinas, banging wood over windows, battening down roofs and 
stocking up on supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Gov. Jim Hodges ordered 1,000 National Guard  
troops and 500 state troopers to prepare for duty, but no decision 
was made yet on any possible coastal evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, emergency planners urged 150,000 coastal  
residents to get ready for the storm. State troopers and emergency 
management personnel were placed on alert. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was expected to strengthen over the next 24 hours,  
bringing up to 10 inches of rain and tides up to 8 feet above 
normal. That would threaten fragile coral reefs and trees on 
islands such as Eleuthera, which already suffered widespread damage 
from Hurricane Andrew in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night in the Abacos -- a 130-mile chain of sparsely  
populated islands that were settled by loyalists from New York in 
1783 -- black clouds unleashed sheets of rain and wind gusts reached 
55 mph. Ham radio operators in the Abacos reported gusts up to 78 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Club Soleil Resort owner Rudy Malone on Great Abaco island said  
all the tourists at his hotel had flown out Thursday, but others 
might be stranded since the island's airport closed Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone said he saw a group of American tourists among shoppers  
stocking up on supplies Friday. ``Some people think it's exciting, 
but that's probably because they've never been through (a 
hurricane),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahamasair, the national airline, canceled service to the Abaco  
islands and most of Eleuthera and telephone operators said some 
lines were done and other circuits overloaded by traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winds have been fierce ... the oceans have been very  
raging,'' said hotel owner Sharon Rolle on Eleuthera island. ``It's 
difficult for cars to pass by because there are waves coming over, 
straight over, the main road so it would cover your cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane center director Jerry Jarrell said Dennis still  
``could become a major hurricane, a borderline Category 3, assuming 
landfall in South Carolina.'' Category 3 hurricanes have winds of 
111 mph to 130 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberlain said the ``saving grace'' was that Dennis was  
projected to approach Florida with an unusually weak western side, 
which Jarrell projected might carry winds of 96 mph to 110 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``We're not letting anyone off the hook anywhere along  
the coast,'' Kimberlain said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, the approaching storm prompted many surfers to skip  
school and work to catch unseasonably good waves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the surfers that are here from all over Florida --  
Tampa, Fort Lauderdale,'' said Bill Kokotis, owner of the beachside 
Blueberry Muffin restaurant in Indialantic, 50 miles southeast of 
Orlando. ``The hurricane passing by out there creates a nice surf 
and they're all loving it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane watch stretched along 200 miles of Florida's east  
coast, from Sebastian Inlet north to Fernandina Beach, and was 
accompanied by a riptide warning. 
</P>
<P>
	At Marineland of Florida, 30 miles north of Daytona Beach,  
employees prepared to protect the park's 19 dolphins, two sea 
lions, three penguins and hundreds of tropical fish and sea turtles 
from the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our staff will make sure there's no debris that could go into  
the tanks,'' said general manager David Internoscia. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lily, 44, and Nellie, 46, were unfazed by all the commotion.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've been through many hurricanes,'' Internoscia said of  
two of his oldest dolphins. ``They'll stay in their own 
environment.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Mich. Hoops Star Got Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Former Michigan basketball player Louis  
Bullock received more than $50,000 from a Detroit man who had been 
banned from contact with the basketball program, a newspaper 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources identified as being familiar with a federal  
investigation of Ed Martin told The Ann Arbor News that the booster 
loaned the money to Bullock in anticipation of being repaid with 
Bullock's future earnings as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock, a guard, completed his four-year career in March as the  
Wolverines' third highest scorer. The Minnesota Timberwolves 
drafted him in the second round last June, then traded him to the 
Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, a retired Ford Motor Co. electrician, emerged in 1996 as  
the central figure as the university and the NCAA investigated 
allegations of rules violations and other improper conduct within 
the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	He was banned from contact with the program in March 1997. But  
sources told the News that most of the money Bullock was said to 
have received from Martin was paid afterward, during his junior and 
senior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Louis Bullock has been interviewed by the federal authorities.  
He has cooperated completely with them,'' his attorney, Steven 
Fishman, said Thursday. ``I refuse to divulge any further details 
of what has been said, but I can assure you the subject of the 
interview had to do only with loans allegedly made by Mr. Martin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock himself would not comment on the allegations, Fishman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Convertino -- investigating  
Martin's activities -- declined comment earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents are investigating  
whether Martin and his son, Carlton, were ringleaders of an 
extensive gambling operation at Ford plants. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials have said the FBI told them that no  
evidence of gambling on Wolverines games has been uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
	If the NCAA finds proof that Bullock took money from Martin  
after Martin was banned, the university could face another inquiry 
or further sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Tom Goss told the News that players were  
sternly reminded to avoid Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to make sure people are informed and to share with  
them ... that it will not be tolerated and it's unacceptable,'' 
Goss said. ``But if a person says, `I'm not doing (anything 
wrong),' you have to accept what they say.''

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Swing 3-Way Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Steve Francis got his trade wish, and the Houston  
Rockets got a young dynamo they hope can help their three aging 
superstars return to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	In an 11-player deal that was the largest in NBA history,  
Vancouver added some much-needed depth in return for the rights to 
Francis, picked No. 2 overall in the June draft but adamant in 
vowing not to play in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel so relieved and so at peace because I've always thought  
about playing on a good team,'' Francis said Friday night in an 
interview with KRIV-TV. ``With three Hall of Fame players on the 
team, I'm in a position to help myself and not have a lot of 
pressure on me to come in my first year and do a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockets vice president Carroll Dawson said the team hadn't  
spoken with Francis as of Friday night, but that he and coach Rudy 
Tomjanovich were confident of signing the former Maryland star. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think in Steve Francis we're probably going to get the most  
exciting player in the draft,'' Tomjanovich said. ``Very explosive, 
great in the open court. Real hard to contain, just a super 
athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the coaches he's been invovled with just love him as a  
kid. He's unselfish, but he's talented. I think he's a very big 
piece looking toward our future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis said the last few days before the trade were difficult  
because so much was made of his desire not to play for Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been called everything from a head case to a type of  
person who is ungrateful, and that's something that's not even 
related to me as a person. As the people of Houston and all over 
the United States get to know me, they'll know I'm a real sensitive 
person, and the things I do come from the heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he brings the Rockets, Francis said ``intensity, a  
defensive presence, an offensive presence and someone willing to 
fit in and not to be the spectacular player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver also sent journeyman forward Tony Massenburg to  
Houston for forwards Othella Harrington and Antoine Carr and guards 
Michael Dickerson and Brent Price. The Rockets also owe the 
Grizzlies one first-round draft pick over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal evolved over two weeks but took a turn Friday morning  
when Orlando got involved, Dawson said. Orlando sent Don MacLean 
and a future first-round draft pick to Houston and got from the 
Grizzlies Michael Smith, Lee Mayberry, Rodrick Rhodes and Makhtar 
Ndiaye. The Magic also dealt its 2002 second-round pick to 
Vancouver to round out the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis is projected as the Rockets' starting point guard, with  
Cuttino Mobley possibly moving over to the other guard slot. 
They'll join front-court players Hakeem Olajuwon, Scottie Pippen 
and Charles Barkley, who is expected to re-sign soon with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just see him (Francis) fitting in with all of our players,''  
Tomjanovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson, who rejoins former University of Arizona backcourt  
mate Mike Bibby, will give Vancouver an outside shooting threat. He 
hit over 43 percent of his 3-point attempts -- tied for fourth in 
the NBA -- in his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington, who was Barkley's heir apparent entering his fourth  
season with the Rockets, is expected to bolster the Grizzlies' 
rebounding. Price will fill Mayberry's shoes as back-up point 
guard, while Carr will get some time coming off the bench as a 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``This deal gives us two young talented players and two veteran  
NBA experienced players,'' said Stu Jackson, Grizzlies president 
and general manager. ``We improve our outside shooting, athleticism 
and provide overall team depth and add some veteran leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On draft night, Francis showed he was unhappy at being picked by  
Vancouver. He later explained his initial reluctance was because he 
didn't want to move so far away from his Maryland home and his 
grandmother, who has raised him since the death of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Contract talks between Francis' agent, Jeff Fried, and Vancouver  
were termed as being ``heated'' by Jackson, who said he made 
numerous attempts to deal the disgruntled prospect since draft day. 
Francis was expected to announce at a news conference this week 
that he would refuse to play for the Grizzlies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies, who finished with an NBA-worst 8-42 record last  
year, addressed a number of their needs in the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver also signed veteran free agent forward Dennis Scott in  
an unrelated deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dennis is a proven NBA long-range shooter. In addition to his  
great knowledge of the game, Dennis has the ability to pass the 
ball which will help our team.''

<HEADLINE> Western Fires Roaring in Six States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- More than two dozen major fires are  
burning across the West, charring thousands of acres and forcing 
the California governor to call out the National Guard to help. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts feared that firefighting resources were being stretched  
thin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is escalating and it's getting to the point  
where we're concerned about being able to respond to all the fires 
adequately,'' said Janelle Smith of the National Interagency Fire 
Center in Boise, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	By early today, 27 fires have burned 121,000 acres of grass,  
brush and timber in six states: California, Nevada, Oregon, 
Montana, Washington and Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday declared fire emergencies in four  
Northern California counties, allowing them to recoup the costs 
being spent fighting the blazes. He ordered California National 
Guard personnel to assist firefighters -- some of whom have been on 
the job for more than 30 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Western fires have roared out of control since last weekend,  
with many fires sparked by lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	Thick smoke has blanketed Reno, Nev., and cities in California's  
Central Valley, including Sacramento, where authorities warned 
residents to avoid unnecessary outdoor activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like I have a freight train sitting on my chest,''  
said Tina Munoz, a severe asthmatic who runs a coffee cart near the 
state Capitol. ``This reminds me of the air when Mount St. Helens 
blew its top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few structures have burned and there have been no mandatory  
evacuations, but one death in California was blamed on the fires. 
Investigators said Michelle Bruno, 36, became disoriented in 
wildfire smoke in Butte County and made a wrong turn. She was found 
dead Tuesday beside her burned truck. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kern County in Southern California, two blazes that burned  
across 400 acres of forest land were contained late Thursday. No 
injuries were reported. The fires were sparked by lightning from 
dry thunderstorms. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of firefighters are on duty, including 11,000 in  
California alone. Many are battling heat exhaustion and smoke 
inhalation.

Bahamian islands with gale-force winds on Friday and kicked up high

<HEADLINE> Democrats: Bush's Gun Stance Empty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, campaigning in  
an area beset by recent gun violence, voiced support Friday for 
modest new controls on firearms including a higher minimum age for 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush told reporters he backed raising the legal age to 21 from  
18 for handgun possession and outlawing imports of certain 
high-capacity ammunition clips -- two of the measures in gun control 
legislation that the Senate passed but the House rejected earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support them all,'' Bush said when asked about the proposals  
during the wrap-up of a three-day southern campaign swing for the 
GOP presidential nomination. ``These are all reasonable measures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has previously spoken in favor of the Senate bill but  
campaign aides said he had not been asked about its specific 
provisions. Endorsing them helped Bush better articulate his 
openness at least to some new controls in the wake of mass killings 
that have fueled the debate over gun violence in America. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats said Bush's gesture was empty.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know the election cycle has begun when Bush tries to hide  
his real record with tempered rhetoric,'' said Roy Romer, general 
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ``In every key gun 
safety vote as governor of Texas, Bush has sided with the gun 
lobby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have long attacked Bush as being soft on gun control,  
noting he has spoken against government-mandated gun registration, 
signed legislation barring cities in Texas from suing gun makers 
for the costs of violence, and deemed mandatory child safety locks 
on firearms impractical to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also has been criticized for backing wider background  
checks for gun show sales only after letting a similar proposal die 
in his own state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican front-runner stumped in South Carolina and North  
Carolina before coming to Georgia, enjoying throughout the trip a 
respite from a battery of questions about whether he had ever used 
drugs. Bush last week denied taking drugs at least in the last 25 
years.

<HEADLINE> WR Tony Martin Ready To Help Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Tony Martin eagerly returned Friday to the  
drudgery of training camp, where freedom meant 90 minutes of 
practice in 90-degree sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
	The workout was Martin's first with the Miami Dolphins since his  
acquittal on federal charges of laundering drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a different feeling, knowing I had the weight lifted  
off my shoulders and I could go out and practice and not worry 
about anything,'' the veteran receiver said. ``It's a big 
blessing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the verdict in, Martin can now focus on the more trivial  
matter of winning a Super Bowl. The jury's still out on how much 
the 10th-year pro wide receiver will help his new team, and 
Saturday night's exhibition against the Detroit Lions should offer 
some evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's participation in practice has been sporadic since his  
trial began Aug. 2, but he'll likely see a lot of action against 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to going the whole game if I have to,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The passing attack has sputtered in the first two exhibition  
games for Miami (1-1), with three quarterbacks going 28-for-64 for 
298 yards. Dan Marino is 10-for-27 for 118 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem has been a wave of injuries at receiver and  
the limited availability of Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need that timing down, and it's not yet,'' receiver Oronde  
Gadsden said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions (1-1) should provide a good test for the Dolphins'  
offense. After giving up 35 points in their exhibition opener at 
Atlanta, the Lions bounced back last week by beating Cincinnati 
16-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals had just nine first downs. First-round draft pick  
Chris Claiborne led the Detroit defense with a sack and a 
team-leading five tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all starting to learn each other more,'' Claiborne said,  
``and I know we're going to keep getting better and be a good 
defensive team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals are coming off a 3-13 season, but the Lions still  
found reason for encouragement. The preseason shutout was their 
first since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something to build on,'' linebacker Stephen Boyd said.  
``Miami's going to be a good test. That's a team that wants to run 
the ball, and then you've got a guy like Dan Marino.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins anticipate that Martin will give Marino the deep  
threat he has long lacked, and with the defense stretched, Miami's 
ground game should improve. 
</P>
<P>
	But to this point, that's just a theory. Now that Martin can  
focus on football, the Dolphins will try to put the plan into 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 33, isn't far behind in preparation for the season,  
coach Jimmy Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony has been in the league 10 years, he was with us in the  
offseason, and he stays in tremendous shape,'' Johnson said. ``He 
has missed practice time, but I don't think it's the end of the 
world for Tony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who helped the Atlanta Falcons reach the Super Bowl last  
season, signed a four-year, $14.2 million contract with Miami in 
April that was contingent on his availability. When he was 
acquitted Thursday, he returned to the Dolphins complex and greeted 
his teammates in the locker room, shaking hands with nearly every 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great reaction to see the guys rally around me,''  
Martin said. ``I feel like I owe them something for the support 
they've given me. I'm going to do everything I can to help the team 
win games this year.''

<HEADLINE> Plane, Bodies Recovered in Virginia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Rescue crews today found three bodies near  
a small airplane that smashed into the rocky face of a mountain and 
were searching for a fourth person. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-seat Cessna 172 was found around 8:30 a.m., two days  
after it crashed. It was about 10 miles from its destination, the 
Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport at Weyers Cave, said Randy Frank 
of the Appalachian Search and Rescue Team. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff William Morris said the plane sheared the tops of trees  
and nosed into the side of a mountain, and the impact had ``an 
accordion effect'' on the aircraft. The cause of the crash had not 
been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot of the plane was Robert Spencer, a 30-year-old  
volunteer firefighter and paramedic from Gloucester. Passengers 
were Cathy Turner, 38, and two children, his son and her daughter. 
Authorities did not immediately say which of the four was still 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer took off Wednesday morning from the Newport  
News-Williamsburg International Airport. He told Federal Aviation 
Administration controllers after takeoff that he was flying by 
visual flight rules and had not filed a flight plan.

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- B.F. ``Sandy'' Coggan, who led the Convair  
Division of General Dynamics during the aerospace boom of the 1950s 
and went on to advise the Defense Department and United Nations, 
died Sunday from complications of Alzheimer's disease. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Bernard Frederick Coggan in Gary, Ind., he grew up in  
Michigan and earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering 
at Michigan State University. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1952, Coggan moved to San Diego to become  
vice-president-general manager of Convair, which had a work force 
of 45,000 designing and manufacturing aircraft and missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	As a consultant to the Department of Defense in 1961, Coggan  
conducted worldwide audits of military hospitals and radar 
installations. As a United Nations adviser in 1966, he was part of 
a team assigned to audit a five-year economic plan of Indian Prime

	TENAFLY, N.J. (AP) -- Joseph Gold, the nation's oldest living  
Marine and one of the few remaining World War I veterans, died 
Wednesday of pneumonia. He was 107. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold, who served with the American Expeditionary Force in the  
Battle of Belleau Wood in June, 1918, was one of two servicemen to 
receive France's Legion of Honor award last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few weeks ago, interviewers from the U.S. Marine Corps  
Research Center arrived at Gold's nursing home to record his 
thoughts on the war he fought and his service in the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold was the oldest living Marine and one of only a few who  
remembered fighting during World War I, according to Marine 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Stabbed in the hand by a German bayonet, Gold nonetheless stayed  
with the Marines in Europe. He remained until 1919 to help with 
postwar reconstruction.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- David Graham, who led the Oxford University  
students' hugely controversial vote against fighting ``for king and 
country'' in the year Adolf Hitler came to power, died Aug. 12, 
according to newspaper reports. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	While a student at Oxford in February 1933, Graham drafted the  
pacifist debating motion that ``this house will in no circumstances 
fight for its king and country.'' The Oxford Union passed the 
matter by 275 votes to 173, causing an uproar among conservatives 
in the British Parliament and the press. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to The Daily Telegraph, Graham was not so much a  
pacifist as an ``independent spirit fond of controversy.'' The 
Times said Graham primarily wanted to ``stimulate a lively evening 
in the union.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham joined the British Broadcasting Corp. shortly after his  
graduation from Oxford and his career there spanned four decades. 
His first task was to adapt Leo Tolstoy's ``War and Peace'' for 
radio, The Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	When World War II broke out, Graham, eager to use his fluency in  
German and knowledge of the country to support Britain's war 
effort, became part of a small BBC team that broadcast to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a daughter and two sons.

	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Dr. George T. Harrell, the founding dean of  
medical schools at the University of Florida and Pennsylvania State 
University, died Thursday. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrell was an innovator in physician training, emphasizing  
understanding and caring for the patient as a whole. He advocated 
training students in small groups to prepare them for work in 
health teams and created the first medical school programs in 
humanities, family and community medicine, and behavioral science. 
</P>
<P>
	Most medical schools offer programs in the humanities today.  
</P>
<P>
	Harrell was recruited by the University of Florida in 1954 to  
develop its college of medicine. The school opened with a new 
college of nursing in 1956. He left Florida for Pennsylvania in 
1964 after chocolate magnate Milton S. Hershey pledged $50 million 
for a hospital and medical school to be affiliated with Penn State.

<HEADLINE> Beautiful Pleasure Wins Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Beautiful Pleasure, enjoying an  
11-pound weight concession, went to the front early and then held 
off favored Banshee Breeze by 2 1/4 lengths Friday to win the 
$400,000, Grade I Personal Ensign Handicap at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jorge Chavez and carrying 113 pounds, Beautiful  
Pleasure still led by five lengths with a furlong to go in the 
1 1/4-mile race that was run on a muddy track. 
</P>
<P>
	Banshee Breeze finished 1 1/2 lengths in front of Keeper Hill,  
while Manoa, Tap to Music and Unbridled Hope completed the order of 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Beautiful Pleasure and Banshee Breeze last met in the Go For  
Wand Handicap at Saratoga on Aug. 7. The race was a furlong longer 
and the weight difference the same, but Banshee Breeze prevailed by 
a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weight just broke the bridge today,'' said Carl Nafzger,  
Banshee Breeze's trainer. ``It was very muddy out there. At least, 
she beat all the others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Ward, Beautiful Pleasure's trainer, credited the early lead  
for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they had much choice but to let her be on the  
lead,'' he said. ``She has a nice, long stride and a light weight. 
Nobody could chase her; they could just pray that she didn't have 
enough strength to finish it up. It all comes down to timing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beautiful Pleasure covered 1 1/4 miles in 2:02:2 and earned  
$240,000 for John C. Oxley with her second win in five starts this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner returned $11.40, $4.30 and $2.90. Banshee Breeze paid  
$2.70 and $2.10, while Keeper Hill was $2.80 to show.

<HEADLINE> Personal Income Rises in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' income crept up in July, while  
consumer spending rose faster but not at the frenzied pace of 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said Friday that personal income -- which  
includes wages, interest and government benefits -- rose a 
slower-than-expected 0.2 percent last month, the smallest gain this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The shortfall from expected growth ``was totally due to the  
timing of farm disaster relief subsidy payments, which plunged 54 
percent in July after soaring 105 percent in June,'' said First 
Union's chief economist David Orr. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the effects of those payments, income would have grown  
0.5 percent in July -- in line with many analysts' expectations, Orr 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wages rose a solid 0.7 percent in July, following a 0.5 percent  
gain in June. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, overall personal income shot up 0.7 percent, boosted by  
wage gains but mostly reflecting that hefty increase in disaster 
payments to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer spending, meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent last month,  
slightly less than many analysts had expected but a little more 
brisk than the 0.3 percent increase in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, July's spending increase was less exuberant than gains  
earlier in the year. In February, spending rose 0.9 percent; in 
March and April, it went up 0.6 percent; and in May 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a bit of a slowdown in the pace of spending. How many  
cars can a person buy?'' said Richard Yamarone, senior economist 
with the Argus Research Corp., an independent research firm. ``But 
consumers aren't tapped out, they'll continue to spend but at a 
slower pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates by a  
quarter of a point for the second time this summer, making 
borrowing more expensive. The Fed did this to slow the economy and 
keep inflation in check. The Fed also hinted that no additional 
rate increases may be needed this year unless the economy showed 
signs of overheating or if inflation flared. 
</P>
<P>
	Because consumer spending has repeatedly outpaced incomes, the  
nation's savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income 
-- has set a string of record lows this year, with the lowest a 
negative 1.5 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the savings rate was better: minus 1.4 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	A major reason for the negative savings rate, economists say, is  
the strong stock market is boosting Americans' net worth and making 
them more comfortable about dipping into savings to pay for their 
spending sprees. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on durable goods -- big-ticket manufactured items  
expected to last at least three years, such as washing machines and 
cars -- rose 0.2 percent in July, compared with a 0.1 percent gain 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	And, spending on nondurable products, such as food and fuel,  
went up 0.1 percent, slightly less than the 0.2 percent increase 
the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the government reported that the nation's economic  
growth slowed in the second quarter of this year, held back by a 
swollen trade deficit. But consumers continued to spend briskly, 
though not at the torrid pace that they did in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer spending in the second quarter rose at an annual rate  
of 4.6 percent. That was brisker than estimated a month ago, but 
slower than 6.7 percent pace of spending in the first quarter. 
Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total economic 
activity.

<HEADLINE> Activity Trays Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some 100,000 activity trays and toy nets were  
recalled Friday because four small children have choked on suction 
cups used to attach them to surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled the trays and  
nets -- the Stroller Snack and Activity Trays, Bathtime Activity 
Trays and Bathtime Toy Netting -- sold by Graco Children's Products 
and Children on the Go. The commission said children can easily 
detach the suction cups and choke on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Graco has received reports of four choking incidents, one each  
in Wisconsin and Ohio and two in New York, said commission 
spokeswoman Nychelle Fleming. In the Ohio incident, the suction cup 
was dislodged from the throat of a 7-month-old. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled items can be used with toys from the Mix 'N Move  
line and attached to strollers, bath tub tiles or other smooth 
surfaces. They were sold nationwide at discount, department and toy 
stores from January 1998 until this month for $10 to $15 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should call (800) 446-1366 to receive a free repair  
kit that will permanently attach the suction cups to the trays.

<HEADLINE> Home Depot To Limit Wood Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In announcing a new policy banning the sale of  
wood from endangered areas, Home Depot chief Arthur M. Blank called 
on competitors to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Home Depot, the nation's largest home-improvement retailer,  
announced Thursday that the phase-out of sales of so-called 
``old-growth'' wood will take effect in 2002. In addition to 
cutting out sales of lumber from threatened forests, Home Depot 
said the action also would cover the whole range of wood products, 
from brooms to doors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to do this so that 25 years from now we can keep  
going,'' Blank said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've wanted to do this for a long time, but it takes time to  
make something like this to work,'' Blank said at a news conference 
as the company's store managers met in conjunction with its 20th 
anniversary. ``We used to be a voice, but now we're a force ... now 
we can move the needle a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenpeace representative Scott Paul praised the move. ``With  
Home Depot throwing down the gauntlet to its competitors, we now 
anticipate that other U.S.-based home improvement retailers will 
soon follow suit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the endangered areas that could be covered by the ban  
include redwood and cedar forests in the Pacific Northwest and rain 
forests in South America and Southeast Asia that produce lauan, 
according to the Certified Forest Products Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco-based Rainforest Action Network and other  
environmental groups have held demonstrations over the last two 
years at several Home Depot stores. Protesters have also picketed 
several local zoning commission meetings where Home Depot building 
permits were being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not in response to ... any extreme group,'' Blank  
said. ``It's in response to our opportunities, and moreover our 
responsibilities, in this regard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry analysts had questions about the Home Depot  
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``How are you going to make sure someone in South America is  
meeting the same standards as in British Columbia,'' said Joe 
Parraton, owner of a Canadian Web site that represents more than 
500 forestry and wood-products companies. ``Wood is practically 
free down there, and what do they do with those countries is going 
to be a big question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Home Depot officials said sales associates will be trained in  
environmentally friendly alternatives to hardwood, and the company 
is looking to stock up on such alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Blank had a confrontation with environmentalists last year at  
the annual stockholder meeting, where shareholders overwhelmingly 
rejected a resolution that would have forced the company to stop 
selling old-growth wood within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``From all indications, this is a great victory for the  
forests,'' said Michael Brune of Rainforest Action Network. ``Home 
Depot is a linchpin in the industry, and if they are truly phasing 
out old-growth wood, I could not possibly overstate the importance 
of this victory.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mavericks Re-Sign Ceballos, Trent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Forward Gary Trent, who coach Don Nelson wooed  
with a family vacation to Hawaii ``to rub his belly and let him 
know we love him,'' on Friday signed a two-year, $4.2 million 
contract to remain with the Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
	The salary cap-strapped Mavericks also signed swingman Cedric  
Ceballos to a two-year, $7.4 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few weeks ago, it appeared the Mavericks would lose both.  
Re-signing the veterans was quite a coup for the team that's had 
the worst record of all pro sports teams in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Trent, whom the Mavericks signed before last season as a free  
agent, averaged 16 points and 7.8 rebounds last season But league 
rules prevented the Mavericks from offering him a long-term deal 
that exceeded salary cap restraints because he hadn't been on the 
roster long enough. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Nelson paid for Trent, his fiancee, infant son,  
parents and future mother-in-law to spend a week in Maui, all paid 
for by the Mavericks. The NBA made it an even more expensive trip 
by fining Dallas $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Trent reportedly rejected a three-year, $12 million package from  
Seattle. The Mavericks were more than happy to take him back, with 
Nelson promising to make him a go-to guy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ceballos tested the free agent market last year, but ended up  
signing a one-year deal with Dallas at a league-minimum $725,000. 
He was playing well until breaking both his wrists and having them 
surgically repaired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The SuperSonics also went after Ceballos, reportedly offering  
him a six-year deal. The Mavericks got him to agree to a pact that 
will pay him $3.5 million in 1999-2000 and $3.9 million in 2000-01.

<HEADLINE> BellSouth Gives Away Some Web Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- As the competition for Internet customers  
intensifies globally, BellSouth has gone local with its Buzz Web 
site, a portal to scores of community Web pages that BellSouth 
gives away for free. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-state Internet service provider is adding to the 62  
community sites by offering free Web pages to any nonprofit 
organization that meets minimal requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize it is not our place in the market to compete with  
national companies like Yahoo,'' said Ted Creech, director of 
marketing and business for BellSouth Buzz, the company's Web 
service. ``We have created a portal that reflects our localness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internet users who arrive at the BellSouth Buzz portal see a box  
that prompts them to choose one of 62 possible cities. Upon 
selecting the city, a BellSouth Buzz Web site specific to that city 
pops onto the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site contains local news, calendars and discussion  
groups, plus national news, stocks, sports scores, weather and 
search engines. One site feature, Community Source, has links to 
the free community Web pages. 
</P>
<P>
	It's good advertising for BellSouth.  
</P>
<P>
	While anyone can log onto BellSouth Buzz without subscribing to  
the company's $19.95-a-month Internet service, the company hopes 
the local sites will draw more attention to BellSouth's services 
and grab more Internet customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like you're giving away a service, and that's  
inherently not what a corporation is looking for,'' Creech said. 
``Whenever an organization creates a free web (page), they're 
basically creating extra advertising space for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven North Carolina cities -- Arden, Asheville, Cape Hatteras,  
Chapel Hill, Charlotte, Durham, Greensboro, High Point, Raleigh, 
Wilmington and Winston-Salem -- can be accessed from BellSouth Buzz. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few nonprofit North Carolina groups have logged in a free  
Web page since the program began June 1, and the company wants to 
give away hundreds more. 
</P>
<P>
	So, two weeks ago, BellSouth hired Linda Anderson, a  
Charlotte-based employee who will try to convince local North 
Carolina organizations they could benefit from free Web exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenda Scofield, executive director for the Western North  
Carolina HIV/AIDS Consortium in Asheville, took up BellSouth's 
offer as soon as one of her board members heard about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're non-profit, and we really have to watch our dollars,''  
Scofield said. ``We knew we wanted a Web page. We definitely would 
have discussed it a little more if it wasn't free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she's already seen results since the page was posted a  
few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have gotten calls about it, people e-mailing us from it,''  
Scofield said. ``We've actually had someone contact us from out of 
state about our services because he was moving here. It has made an 
impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Requirements for the free page are minimal, Creech said  
Thursday. The organization need not be a federally recognized 
nonprofit, but only show it doesn't plan to sell or promote goods 
and services through the Web site for a profit. School groups, 
local clubs and governmental organizations would be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Once approved for a Web page, an organization can create its own  
page by following online instructions, using one of five 
BellSouth-provided templates. It can add its own graphics and 
photos. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sites are very easy to build. You don't need to know any  
code or HTML,'' said Tim Hart, community manager for BellSouth 
Buzz. Hart oversees the 12 employees, like Linda, who add new Web 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Company representative Sue Holub said the sites have hometown  
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to go to the Yahoo search engine, but who cares  
what's going on in Boise, Idaho, if you live in Raleigh, North 
Carolina?'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Suspect on Bus Day Earlier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A man charged with stabbing three people on an  
Amtrak train had been removed from a bus by Illinois State Police a 
day earlier after complaining that other passengers were 
threatening him with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	When the officers searched Aaron Hall for weapons, they found a  
pocketknife with a 2 1/2-inch blade, Illinois State Police Master Sgt. 
Lincoln Hampton said. Police believe the same weapon was later used 
in Thursday's attack on the train. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, 41, of Ontario, Calif., is accused of stabbing two  
conductors and a passenger as they tried to subdue him on the Lake 
Shore Limited run from Chicago to New York. Two of the men remained 
hospitalized Friday but were recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	The train was near Cleveland when the attacks occurred.  
Authorities said Hall claimed he acted in self-defense and that a 
porter had threatened him with a gun. No gun was found on either 
the train or the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall is being held in Ohio on three counts of attempted murder.  
His appointed attorney, Gerald Piszczek, was unavailable to comment 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was harmed on the Greyhound bus, which was near  
Princeton, Ill., about 100 miles west of Chicago, when the 
disturbance began Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police allowed Hall to keep the pocketknife because carrying a  
small pocketknife is legal. The driver still asked that Hall be 
removed, and another bus took him to Chicago where he boarded the 
train, Olmsted Township Patrolman Matthew Vanyo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hampton said Hall had boarded the bus in Iowa and was headed to  
Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Cover Gal Scores at Del Mar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- Cover Gal, ridden by Kent Desormeaux,  
moved in front early and went on to take a three-length victory in 
Friday's $107,800 Generous Portion Stakes at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
	A winner at 22-1 odds in her debut on July 31, Cover Gal was  
sent off as the 1-5 favorite this time. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner fought off a challenge by Excessively Hot in the  
upper stretch, then pulled away in the 5 1/2-furlong race for 
2-year-old fillies bred in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Cover Gal carried 117 pounds and was clocked in 1:04 2-5 in the  
feature race run before a crowd of 13,908. 
</P>
<P>
	Excessively Hot finished second, 3 1/2 lengths in front of Wingless  
Flight, in the race contested by seven fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Cover Gal, a daughter of Falstaff and Video Menu, paid $2.40,  
$2.20 and $2.10. Excessively Hot returned $2.60 and $2.10, and the 
show payoff on Wingless Flight was $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Owned by Bill Peeples and trained by Lance Stokes, Cover Gal  
earned $64,680.

<HEADLINE> Greene, Miller Take 200M Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Maurice Greene did his best imitation of  
Carl Lewis. Inger Miller did her best imitation of Marion Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	By doing so, the two training partners won the 200-meter dashes  
at the World Championships Friday night, giving the United States a 
sweep of the short sprints. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, winner of the 100-meter title earlier, became the first  
sprinter to win the 100 and 200 at a major global meet since Lewis 
swept both at the 1984 Olympics. His time was a season-best 19.90 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller outshone the more renowned Jones, winner of the 100 who  
was missing in the 200 after pulling up in the semifinals with back 
spasms and cramps, winning in 21.77. It was the world's fastest 
time this year and the best of her career. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, the two teammates embraced warmly, with both in  
tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inger and me got very close this week,'' Greene said. ``We  
came here to do a job. She stood by me when I won the 100. We 
achieved what we came here to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The emotional Greene also embraced his coach, John Smith, and  
manager Emmanuel Hudson, and was hugged by the championships' 
mascot, dressed in a green cartoon costume. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene then was handed a bag of T-shirts bearing his picture and  
his nickname, ``phonoMOnon.'' As he took his victory lap around the 
track, he tossed the shirts into the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene had a couple of other emotional moments. The first was on  
the victory stand, where he broke down during the national anthem. 
``Those were tears of joy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene also cried on the podium in 1997 when he won his first  
100 title. He was even more emotional this time ``because for me to 
come here and win the 100 was great, but to try something I had 
never done before (the double) and put my body in a place it's 
never been before was exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second time Greene became emotional Friday was in the  
interview room. ``I'm still crying inside,'' he said. ``This is 
something I've been dreaming of as a child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he treasured his 200 gold more than the 100 because it  
was his first at that distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``After I saw Inger win, I knew I had to go out there and do it  
for the team,'' Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene was helped by the absence of two of the world's top  
sprinters. His teammate, Ato Boldon, the 1997 world champion, and 
Namibia's Frankie Fredericks, the Olympic silver medalist in the 
100 and 200, were both out with injuries. Fredericks made the final 
but withdrew with a nerve injury in his left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller showed her emotions on the track. When she realized she  
was the winner, she rotated her hands back and forth like a boxer, 
then lay down on the track and went into a series of bicycle kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect to run that fast,'' Miller said after lowering  
her personal record by .33 seconds. ``My goal was to win gold, and 
I did that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I ran an exceptional PR. I looked first to make sure it  
was me. It's unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a one-woman show anymore.''  
</P>
<P>
	That was a reference to Jones, who had dominated the sprints  
until she was injured. Jones was No. 1 in the world in both the 100 
and 200 last year, and had the fastest times this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller showed she was coming on fast in the 100 at the World  
Championships, running three PRs, including 10.79 in earning the 
silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think she made any mistakes,'' Greene said about  
Miller's 200. ``She was phenomenal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen what she's been through. She had to leave her  
father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was coached by her father, Lennox, the 1968 Olympic  
silver medalist and the 1972 bronze medalist in the 100 while 
representing Jamaica. His daughter won a gold in the 400 relay at 
the 1996 Atlanta Games, making them the first father-daughter 
Olympic medalists in track and field. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller decided last year to join the Smith group, which also  
includes Boldon and sprinter Jon Drummond. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father and I made the decision together,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity to train with these guys was exciting, but I  
had to carry my weight. Basically, I'm the only woman on the 
circuit with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said she stumbled early in the race but quicklly  
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard John's voice inside me saying, `Do it, do it, do it,'  
'' she said, referring to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference now is atmosphere and intensity. Before, I used  
to train by myself. Now I train with these guys and it's fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's other finals, Italy's Fabrizio Mori, who was at  
first disqualified in the semifinals of the men's 400 hurdles and 
then reinstated, won in 47.72, the world's fastest time this year; 
Romania's Gabriela Szabo retained the women's 5,000 title at 
14:41.82, a championship record, and Hongyu Liu led a 1-2 Chinese 
finish in the women's 20-kilometer walk at 1:30:50. 
</P>
<P>
	Mori's victory was protested by the French team, which claimed  
the Italian ran out of his lane and should have been disqualified. 
The protest was rejected. Had it been accepted, France's Stephane 
Diagana, the second-place finisher and Olympic champion, would have 
been the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Ludmila Engquist, the inspirational story of the  
championships, continued her remarkable run toward a second 
straight title in the women's 100 hurdles. Engquist, who had 
undergone four chemotherapy treatments for breast cancer and has 
two more remaining, won her semifinal heat at 12.50, the 
second-fastest in the world for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The emotional Engquist collapsed into tears when she saw the  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Devers, the 1993 and 1995 champion, won the other semifinal  
at 12.70.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Eases Out of Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- After struggling through its deepest recession  
in years, Hong Kong's economy started growing again in the spring, 
the government said Friday, offering a fresh signal that Asia is 
recovering from its financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The return to growth -- an increase of 0.5 percent in the second  
quarter -- was a far cry from the economic booms that converted Hong 
Kong into one of the most congested and expensive cities on earth, 
but a welcome relief to officials who had been looking for an end 
to the economic contraction. 
</P>
<P>
	The GDP numbers for the three months ending June 30 surpassed  
the expectations of private economists who had been predicting 
further shrinkage of 1 percent to 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Another struggling Asian country, the Philippines, also had  
promising news Friday, as the government announced 
greater-than-expected economic growth during the second quarter. 
The country's GDP rose 3.6 percent, boosted by strong gains in 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang proclaimed a  
``very robust recovery'' and predicted the economy can keep 
expanding. 
</P>
<P>
	The GDP figures, which represent the value of Hong Kong's  
production and services, were up by 0.5 percent when compared with 
the second quarter of 1998, but on a seasonally adjusted 
quarter-to-quarter basis, they represented growth of about 3 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, officials cautioned the early signs of growth were  
fragile and more troubles could develop. The outlook remains 
clouded by various uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time officials were announcing the territory had  
pulled out of recession, Hong Kong banks raised interest rates by a 
quarter point, in a move that followed the U.S. Federal Reserve but 
could hinder recovery prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic bust sent Hong Kong's unemployment to record highs,  
devastated the crucial property market and threw consumer prices 
into a spooky downward spiral of deflation that economists predict 
won't go away any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Hong Kong people voiced doubts Friday evening about the  
pace of recovery from the 15-month recession that cast a shadow 
over the former British colony in its first two years under Chinese 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hong Kong's recovery will be very slow, maybe one or two  
years, but the Hong Kong people are very hard and very 
intelligent,'' said Terence Li, sales manager of a Chinese hotel 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Others agree it will take time before well-heeled Hong Kong  
people are confident enough to go back to their free-spending ways 
on the fanciest French wines, luxury cars and wallet-busting dinner 
banquets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not see a return to the happy days -- not until mid  
2000,'' said William Lau, a Jaguar automobile dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard times forced Hong Kong to seek new ways to build a better  
future, including proposals to lure more high-tech firms to the 
territory, a plan to turn Hong Kong into a global center for 
Chinese and herbal medicines and negotiations about building a 
Disney theme park to lure more tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong has seen much of its industrial base crumble as its  
old manufacturing jobs were moved to cheaper locations in mainland 
China, although it is a huge banking and shipping center and 
retains a vital role as a conduit for Chinese exports to the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the rebound was attributed to a rise in exports, but  
they could run into troubles depending on economic conditions in 
key markets: the United States, Japan and Europe, government 
economist K.Y. Tang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions in the Taiwan Strait, as China and Taiwan square off  
over Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui's recent affirmation of 
statehood, could also aggravate Hong Kong's effort to recover.

<HEADLINE> Prozac Advocate Gets License Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WENATCHEE, Wash. (AP) -- A psychologist dubbed the ``pied piper  
of Prozac'' for his aggressive promotion of the antidepressant has 
temporarily regained the right to practice, two months after it was 
stripped by a state licensing board. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the board yanked James Goodwin's license, accusing him  
of failing to comply with the terms of a 1996 disciplinary order. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thursday, a judge gave it back, at least temporarily, until  
Goodwin's appeal of the Examining Board of Psychology's 10-year 
revocation of his license is decided this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelan County Superior Court Judge John E. Bridges also said he  
expected Goodwin to win that appeal, which will be heard by another 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm relieved,'' Goodwin said after the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin first made a name for himself in the early 1990s in a  
rash of media appearances advocating the benefits of 
antidepressants, such as Prozac and Paxil. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin takes medication for his own depressive illness. He  
antagonized licensing board members by suggesting some of them were 
mentally ill and could use it as well. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Goodwin sent a packet of information to the board  
with a photocopy of his left hand, middle finger extended. He later 
it was merely a physical illustration of part of his therapy, he 
said, where fingers are used to represent self and self's 
relationship to others. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the board accused him of breaching patient  
confidentiality, diagnosing patients without adequate evaluation, 
pressuring patients into taking Prozac and retaliating against a 
psychologist who protested his treatment methods. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were settled in 1996, with Goodwin required to enter  
into a contract with an adviser to review patient diagnoses for as 
long as three years. He refused, saying the contract imposed other 
restrictions.

<P>
	THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- Martin Lawrence was in serious but  
stable condition Friday after awakening from a three-day coma 
brought on by a jog while wearing heavy clothing in summer heat. 
Doctors remained concerned about his kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence, upgraded from critical a day earlier, was expected to  
remain the same for the next few days, said Kris Carraway-Bowman, 
spokeswoman for Los Robles Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's definitely not out of the woods by any means, but this  
was a man who was near death who has made a miraculous comeback,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The star of the old Fox sitcom ``Martin'' and such movies as  
``Life'' and ``Bad Boys'' was alert, focusing his eyes and able to 
follow doctors' commands. He remained on a ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence, 34, was trying to lose weight for a movie role when he  
went for a jog Sunday in 100-degree weather. His girlfriend found 
him collapsed on the doorstep an hour later and called 911.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Hurts Surfing Mecca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- On a typical trek to ``Surf  
City, USA,'' visitors would see well-oiled bodies spread out 
towel-to-towel in the sand, swimmers frolicking in the water and 
board-toting surfers hitting the waves. 
</P>
<P>
	But the usual party atmosphere at Huntington Beach has been  
crashed by something new surfing in the water this summer -- 
thousands of gallons of bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly eight weeks, health officials have closed section  
after section of the 8-mile beach trying to find the source of a 
sewage leak. The problem has come at peak beach season, resulting 
in disappointed tourists, financial losses to merchants, and 
layoffs among beach workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just moved down here and was telling my friends they had to  
come visit and check it out. It's disappointing,'' said Mike 
Canihan, 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The mystery has set off an expensive and exhaustive  
investigation that has brought together politicians, scientists, 
environmentalists, residents and even a psychic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've received more calls than I can count from people in the  
community wanting to know what they can do to help or asking if we 
have checked certain things,'' said Michelle Tuchman, spokeswoman 
for the Orange County Sanitation District. ``This psychic even 
offered to help, saying she knew where the leak was. But she wanted 
money. Needless to say, we didn't hire her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem surfaced in late June when sanitation officials  
found unhealthy levels of bacteria, including extremely high levels 
of enterococcous -- known to cause gastrointestinal and respiratory 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 1, health officials closed the first section of beach to  
inspect restrooms, which at the time were thought to be leaking 
sewage into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, beach pollution problems are identified and fixed in  
days, if not hours. But the restrooms here turned up clean. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the level of bacteria intensified and spread. Since Aug. 6,  
officials have closed six more sections of the coast. It now 
threatens Bolsa Chica State Beach to the north. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really kind of eerie,'' admits Larry Honeybourne of  
Orange County's Health Care Agency, which ordered the beach 
closures. ``It's believed to be some sort of raw or untreated 
sewage, but we haven't even confirmed that yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly $500,000 has been spent draining and inspecting sewage  
lines, using ground-penetrating sonar equipment and hiring boats 
equipped with sonar -- all to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, investigators were injecting chemical dyes into sewage  
lines and using infrared devices designed to detect irregularities 
in the flow of ocean water. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, himself a surfer, has requested help from  
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Peter Green believes the pollution problem has damaged the  
image of Huntington Beach, immortalized as ``Surf City, USA'' in 
the 1950s Jan and Dean rock classic. The title was reinforced in 
the 1960s in several Beach Boys hits. The town is also in Orange 
County, the heart of the lucrative surf industry where professional 
surfing was launched in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're probably going to have to take out full-page ads in the  
newspapers when this is all over to tell everybody to come back,'' 
Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, it's become a financial nightmare for small  
businesses that depend on the lucrative four-month beach season for 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Jack Clapp used the cash register at Dwight's  
Concessions, one of the oldest beachfront stores in the city, as an 
arm rest as he surveyed the near-empty beach cordoned off with 
yellow police caution tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, he laid off 10 employees.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told them I wouldn't be needing them. I can't employ them if  
I can't pay them,'' he said. ``It was a bad winter, a nonexistent 
spring and now this. It's going to be meager this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A moment later, a tourist inquired about the empty beach.  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know the beach was closed. We'll just go to another  
one,'' said 16-year-old Harley Hall of Bullshead City, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Clapp shook his head.  
</P>
<P>
	``They are all going to other beaches,'' he said.

<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- A relay anchor leg by world record-holder  
Michael Johnson will cap the World Championships on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who set the world 400-meter record of 43.18 seconds  
Thursday night and owns the 200 world record of 19.32 from the 1996 
Olympic Games, will run the final leg on the U.S. 1,600-meter relay 
team, the final event of the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson might even run in Saturday's semifinals.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've spoken to the U.S. coaches,'' Johnson said Friday. ``If  
they need me in the preliminary, I will run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Americans win, Johnson would pick up his ninth career  
World Championships gold medal, more than any other athlete in 
history. Johnson's record-setting 400 victory here gave him his 
eighth gold, tying him with Carl Lewis atop the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
	The other 1,600 relay runners will come from a pool that  
includes quarter-milers Antonio Pettigrew, Danny McCray and Jerome 
Davis, and hurdlers Joey Woody and Angelo Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Woody was a last-minute addition to the group, replacing the  
injured Jerome Young. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. men's coach George Williams also has a six-man pool for the  
400 relay, but said Friday he will run Jon Drummond, Tim 
Montgomery, Brian Lewis and 100-meter world record holder and 
two-time world champion Maurice Greene in the final in that order. 
</P>
<P>
	The others on the team are Tim Harden and Tony McCall.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. women's coach Lance Harter's plans were scrambled when  
100-meter champion Marion Jones was injured during the 200 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	That left him with Gail Devers, Inger Miller, Nanceen Perry,  
Cheryl Taplin, Andrea Anderson and hurdler Miesha McKelvey for the 
400 relay pool, and Anderson, Jearl Miles-Clark, Maicel Malone, 
Michelle Collins and Suziann Reid for the 1,600 relay. 
</P>

	 *HIGHLY RATED:* Michael Johnson's drawing power in Europe is as  
impressive as his speed on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-two percent of the British television viewing audience  
tuned in to the BBC Thursday night to watch Johnson shatter the 
oldest existing men's track mark. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was pointed out to Johnson that his record race wasn't  
shown on live television in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad my fans can see it (on tape),'' Johnson said.  
``We're just not to the point in the U.S. where we are worthy of 
live television. Hopefully last night's race will help change 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BBC figures showed 8.6 million Britons saw Johnson's 400 final,  
500,000 more people than the peak viewing audience for this year's 
Wimbledon men's final. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also outdrew Wednesday's 110-meter high hurdles final in  
which Colin Jackson earned Britain's first gold medal at a global 
championships since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the Grand National, the annual horse jumping race which  
registered a peak viewing audience of 10.1 million, has attracted 
more viewers on BBC television for a 1999 sports event broadcast.

	 *ON YOUR MARKS, GET BLESSED, GO:* The first marathon of the new  
century will start at noon on Jan. 1, 2000, in Vatican City. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF Rome Millennium Marathon was conceived to ``carry  
through the streets of Rome and throughout the world a message of 
peace and brotherhood,'' International Amateur Athletics Federation 
president Primo Nebiolo said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pope John Paul II will provide a pre-race blessing, Nebiolo  
said, and St. Peter's Cathedral will be the backdrop at the 
starting line. 
</P>
<P>
	The finish location has not been decided yet, Enrico Castrucci,  
head of the marathon's organizing committee said, but it likely 
will be near the Colosseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebiolo said he hopes to attract 50,000 entrants, including at  
least one from each of the 210 IAAF member countries.

<HEADLINE> More Violence in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- More violence broke out in East Timor  
today, despite angry U.N. demands that the government rein in 
militiamen who don't want the territory to break away from 
Indonesia. A vote on independence is set for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 800 militiamen attacked the village of Memo, near the  
militia-controlled town of Maliana. Earlier, pro-independence 
supporters clashed with a smaller group of paramilitaries driving 
through the village. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said two people were stabbed to death by the  
militiamen. Another was shot dead. KIPER, a local monitoring 
agency, said nine houses were burned before the villagers took 
revenge and burned cars carrying the assailants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ready and waiting for them,'' villager Anacleto Lopes  
said. ``We have been told they are coming in to attack us and we 
will fight them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attack came one day after a rampage in Dili, the provincial  
capital, that left six people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.N. mission chief Ian Martin said today that neither  
incident will dissuade the United Nations from going ahead with 
Monday's election. 
</P>
<P>
	Many more were injured Thursday after militiamen who oppose East  
Timor becoming independent from Indonesia swept through Dili and 
fired shots at crowds of pro-independence supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said police did nothing to stop the gun-toting  
militiamen and even helped them. In response, Martin warned that 
the world will be watching Indonesia during the vote, and there 
will be ``serious consequences'' if the government doesn't 
dramatically improve security immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have not responded to the accusations.  
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, military commander Gen. Wiranto said he has ordered  
Indonesian police to capture anyone who incites violence. He called 
on both sides to hand over their guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The police are ready to safeguard the implementation of the  
ballot, and take action without discrimination,'' said Wiranto, 
who, like many Indonesians, uses one name. ``We have no intention 
to delay or to lengthen the preparation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plebiscite will give East Timorese a choice between staying  
part of Indonesia as an autonomous region or becoming fully 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the escalating violence appeared designed to frighten  
independence supporters away from the poll, Martin believed East 
Timorese would show ``courage and determination to exercise their 
democratic rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The militia were carrying guns, weapons. And once again,  
heavily armed and equipped police failed to intervene when that 
militia violence was carried on in front of them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged Indonesia  
to ``control the militias, who it is increasingly clear, are intent 
on disrupting the popular consultation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dili was quiet today. Many shops and offices were closed and  
most residents stayed off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, jailed East Timor separatist leader Jose Alexandre  
``Xanana'' Gusmao, called on his guerrillas not to launch 
counterattacks against anti-independence gangs. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead he pleaded for the United Nations to deploy armed  
peacekeepers to replace unarmed police advisers and military 
observers stationed across the half-island territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appeal to the U.N. Security Council for an immediate  
deployment of a peace enforcement force in East Timor,'' he said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations has resisted calls to send peacekeepers.  
Instead, the Security Council is expected today to nearly double 
the number of police advisers and increase the number of military 
liaisons by six times. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao condemned Indonesia for breaking a U.N. agreement to  
guarantee law and order before and after the ballot. He accused 
Wiranto of being behind the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia, he said, ``is clearly demonstrating that not only  
does it not want peace in East Timor, but it is intent on pursuing 
a strategy of instability and chaos in the territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has said that Gusmao, who is now under house arrest,  
will be released on Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975,  
triggering years of guerrilla warfare and human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-Indonesian leaders have warned that a civil war could erupt  
if East Timor becomes independent.

<HEADLINE> Quick Pay-Offs Hurt Credit Card Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Savvy consumers like Barbara Hoffman helped bring  
Wall Street's wrath down on the credit-card industry this week. 
</P>
<P>
	All it took was a pair of scissors and a bit of financial common  
sense. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspired by the rosy U.S. economy, Hoffman carved up four credit  
cards this year, refinanced her debts and paid off the 
high-interest accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should I support the credit card companies when I should  
be looking out for my own finances?'' Hoffman, a Chicago jewelry 
saleswoman, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of other Americans are thinking and acting similarly,  
paying off their credit-card bills more swiftly than ever -- often 
with the aid of lower borrowing rates from refinancing a mortgage. 
Others have become accustomed to switching balances every few 
months to competitors that offer low introductory ``teaser'' rates 
for the first few months of service. 
</P>
<P>
	But with one of the nation's dominant banks raising a warning  
about such teaser rates, analysts wonder if consumers may soon see 
the end of rates as low as 2.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-based Bank One Corp.'s stock lost 23 percent of its  
value on Wednesday after it warned its annual earnings will fall at 
least $530 million short of expectations because of slowing growth 
in its First USA credit card business. First USA is the 
second-largest issuer of credit cards after Citibank, the giant 
banking unit of Citigroup. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One executives acknowledged First USA's problems came as  
existing customers defected to rivals offering better interest 
rates and after cardholders were alienated by the elimination of a 
one-day grace period for late payments. The bank said that in 
trying to remain competitive, it cut rates too far and endangered 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	That could mean repercussions for consumers. Credit-card issuers  
are likely to respond to those shopping around by bumping up their 
low introductory rates, said analyst Robert McKinley, president of 
credit card research firm CardWeb.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the nation's No. 2 card issuer says ``We surrender --  
we're not going to play this (super-low interest rate) game any 
more,' it undoubtedly means a retrenchment in the industry,'' 
McKinley said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for card issuers, however, say it's too early to say  
whether rates will no longer be as low on the introductory 
offerings that pour into consumers' mailboxes each week. Teaser 
rates can run as low as 2.9 percent, while regular rates can run to 
20 percent and more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a few months before we see a reaction,'' said  
Linda Echard, president of Independent Community Bankers of 
America, which represents 2,000 smaller banks that issue credit 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, the jewelry saleswoman, chided credit-card issuers for  
their enticements. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so easy to get swept up by their wonderful offers,'' she  
said. ``It's so easy to spend, and they make it seem so easy to 
pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say that strategy is likely to be re-examined as Wall  
Street pummels the stock of credit issuers. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are learning the rates battle may win new business,  
but the way to keep it and make a profit is more attentiveness to 
customers once they're on board, McKinley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of fighting over the same customers, and  
you can't grow that way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the news isn't all bad for credit-card issuers. Recent  
government reports have revealed Americans are going deeper into 
debt and saving even less. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve said this month that consumers' credit  
outstanding advanced at a 2.5 percent annual rate in June to $1.347 
trillion. Demand for revolving credit, primarily credit cards, rose 
at an annual rate of 8.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a Commerce Department report said consumer spending  
had climbed 0.4 percent in July, leaving the nation's savings rate 
near an all-time low -- minus 1.4 percent of after-tax income. 
</P>
<P>
	And increases in mortgage interest rates this summer also may  
slow or end the nationwide wave of refinancing that has whittled 
away huge chunks of debt. 
</P>
<P>
	When bank rates retreated last year, many Americans refinanced  
their home mortgages at an astonishing total of $750 billion. With 
some of that money, many paid off debt from credit cards that had 
far higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Any downturn of the economy could lead to increased reliance on  
credit cards to make ends meet, resulting in a rise in debt 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody's Investors Service says bad debt, or credit card  
charge-offs for unpaid bills, has fallen for 16 straight months. 
That may indicate that consumers are getting better at managing 
their finances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoffman family is among those debt-sensitive consumers who  
are finding cheaper borrowing rates and increasingly paying off 
credit card bills as they come due each month. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will go to the 'nth' degree to save a dollar and then  
have 20 percent interest on their credit cards,'' Rebecca Hoffman, 
28, Barbara's daughter, said. ``What's the point?''

<HEADLINE> Downey Jr. Back in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORCORAN, Calif. (AP) -- Robert Downey Jr. is back behind bars.  
</P>
<P>
	Downey, 34, arrived Thursday at Corcoran State Prison, where he  
will be housed with other inmates in a dormitory setting, said 
prison spokeswoman Belle Call. He'll be treated at the prison 
substance abuse unit, along with about 7,000 other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the actor will receive special treatment, Call  
responded: ``Negative. He's an inmate. That's what he is to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Municipal Judge Lawrence Mira sentenced  
Downey to three years for a probation violation stemming from a 
1996 drug conviction. The judge refused the actor's request to 
remain on parole, saying Downey had manipulated doctors and 
psychiatrists during seven court-ordered drug rehabilitation 
programs.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government announced rules Friday that  
will give the FBI and other law enforcement agencies new electronic 
surveillance capabilities, enabling them to keep up with such 
technology as cellular phones and conference calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission's order, implementing a  
1994 law, will let police and other authorities obtain a cellular 
phone user's location at the beginning and end of a call -- as long 
as a court approves. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy groups objected strongly to the decision, saying it  
effectively turns cellular phones into tracking devices. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the location rule -- which had been proposed by  
the industry -- the FCC also imposed some additional standards 
sought by law enforcement authorities. For example, the FBI would 
be able to listen in on the cell and ordinary telephone 
conversations of all parties to a conference call, even if some are 
put on hold and are no longer talking to the target of the legal 
wiretap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our actions today will help ensure that law enforcement has  
the most up-to-date technology to fight crime,'' FCC Chairman Bill 
Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules help implement a 1994 law that requires companies to  
make digital wiretapping technology available to law enforcers. The 
commission stepped in after the Justice Department, FBI and the 
telecommunications industry failed to agree on a plan after years 
of negotiations. The Justice Department and FBI got much of what it 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the order, the companies have until March to set equipment  
standards that integrate the added requirements and until Sept. 30, 
2001, to implement them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said the FCC's order addressed its major  
concerns and would aid officers in fighting terrorism, organized 
crime and illegal drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The continuing technological changes in the nation's  
telecommunications systems present increasing challenges to law 
enforcement,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said in a statement. 
``This ruling will enable law enforcement to keep pace with these 
changes and ensure we will be able to maintain our capability to 
conduct court-authorized electronic surveillance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy groups said these requirements overstep the 1994 law and  
are an attempt by the government to broaden its wiretapping powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply disappointed that on all the issues that  
mattered, the commission ruled against privacy and in favor of 
expanded FBI surveillance,'' said Jim Dempsey, counsel at the 
Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology, a privacy 
advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry groups said they were pleased the FCC order did not  
include all of the FBI's requests in setting the long-awaited 
standards. But they also warned that companies will have a hard 
time meeting the deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real time crunch and resource drain,'' said Grant  
Seiffert, vice president for government relations at the 
Telecommunications Industry Association. The group, which 
represents major equipment manufacturers, called the framework 
unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Wheeler, head of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry  
Association, said he hoped law enforcement authorities would 
``provide carriers with the flexibility necessary to implement 
these capabilities in a way that makes sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the order, police can obtain information based on the  
cellular tower, or ``cell'' site, where a call originated and 
ended. The FCC rules also enable authorities with a court order to 
determine when a subject is using call-forwarding, three-way 
calling or other features, and what digits the subject has dialed 
after completing a call setup, for example through a long-distance 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The requirements also will be costly for the nation's local  
phone companies, said the United States Telephone Association, 
which did not provide an estimate.

appointment before Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her outstanding intellect, her personal integrity and skills  
as a consensus builder make her an ideal person'' for the job, 
Cellucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall, 54, said she was ``deeply honored'' and recognized the  
``unique place of the Supreme Judicial Court in our nation, and 
beyond our borders.''

<HEADLINE> Rookie Sets Pace in IRL Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOUNTAIN, Colo. (AP) -- Two months after nearly winning here  
despite crippling injuries, rookie Scott Harrington served notice 
again, posting the fastest times in both practice sessions Friday 
for the Colorado Indy 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington, threatening to scramble the Indy Racing League's  
tightly bunched driver standings, turned a lap of 175.234 mph in 
the morning session on Pikes Peak International Raceway's one-mile 
oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Schmidt was next at 173.972 mph and Jeff Ward at 173.871.  
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, Harrington went 174.258 mph, bettering Robby  
McGehee, at 172.538 and Ward at 172.166. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifying was scheduled for Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Scott Goodyear leads the driver standings with 193 points, but  
eight are within 50 points, which is what the winner of Sunday's 
race will receive. The contenders include Greg Ray, who has won two 
of the last three IRL races, with 191 points, and Kenny Brack with 
179. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear, Ray and Brack posted modest practice speeds on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``The way the point structure is, it changes so drastically, so  
quickly,'' said Ray, who won the June race here. ``One guy can have 
a bad weekend and he can go from second to eighth. Or you can go 
from sixth to first real quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The three of us might wind up in the infield on Sunday,''  
Goodyear noted, ``and it might be three different people you're 
looking at at Texas,'' the final race on Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago on this track, Harrington was poised for a  
top-three finish -- and possibly a victory -- when he brushed the 
wall with 17 laps to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were reeling in Sam (runnerup finisher Schmidt) and Greg,''  
Harrington recalled. ``I feel like we should have won that one. I 
definitely feel we let that one get away from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He challenged for the lead despite driving with a broken right  
leg, torn ligaments in his left knee and three cracked ribs as a 
result of a crash two weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Harrington still wore a brace on his left knee, but  
said he was significantly improved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, I'm way better,'' he said. ``Probably the biggest  
thing I'm dealing with now is the physical conditioning. I had a 
pretty regular routine of working out. Then I had injuries to both 
legs, and the ribs prevented me from doing much upper-body work. 
The conditioning definitely has suffered, but in the last four 
weeks I've been able to do a lot more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His car, meanwhile, remains in superb condition.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're using pretty much the same setup we had in June,'' he  
said. ``Very minor changes. This afternoon, we got close to where 
we were this morning. We figured we knew what we needed to know so 
we decided to park it and skip the last part of the session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just got a great race car this weekend. This is  
definitely the fastest car we've had all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington, 35, of Indianapolis, admitted that his team remains  
basically a shoestring operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've run one engine since Charlotte (May 1),'' he said. ``We  
rebuild it every weekend. It's kind of hard for us to practice pit 
stops because we only have two guys who work for us. The rest of 
the guys are volunteers and weekend help. It's hard for me to sit 
in the car and plug the air jack in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Kite lost an engine during the morning session and didn't  
practice in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyce Carlson caused heavy damage to the rear of his car when he  
hit the wall in Turn 4. Carlson wasn't hurt, and he turned several 
laps in his backup car in the afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Meets Iraq Inspector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Richard Holbrooke met Friday with the  
acting chief U.N. weapons inspector for Iraq, familiarizing himself 
with one of the most contentious issues he'll face as America's new 
U.N. ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke spent about a half an hour with Charles Duelfer,  
acting head of the U.N. Special Commission, to discuss the stalled 
process of disarming Iraq of its banned weapons, a U.S. official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke was paying another round of courtesy calls to the  
Security Council president before flying to the Balkans for a 
whirlwind tour of U.S., NATO and U.N. operations. He is expected to 
take the U.S. seat in the council chamber on Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	In a meeting Friday with this month's president of the Security  
Council, Martin Andjaba of Namibia, and Namibia's Foreign Minister 
Theo-Ben Gurirab, who will be president of the next U.N. General 
Assembly session in September, Holbrooke promised to make Africa 
one of his priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to working with both of you,'' Holbrooke told  
the two. ``Working on the issues of Africa here in New York will be 
one of my ... top priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the two days since he was sworn in, Holbrooke has been paying  
courtesy calls to U.N. officials and meeting with staff at the U.S. 
Mission to the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq May Use After-Hour Trades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With more investors now able to trade stocks  
after the close of traditional exchanges, Nasdaq is considering 
whether to use those after-hours deals when compiling each day's 
``official'' closing stock prices, a move that would have a huge 
impact throughout the financial services industry. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the world's second-largest stock market said  
Friday that a decision has yet to be made on whether to change the 
traditional 4 p.m. Eastern time determination of the official 
``last price'' of a stock, which is used in calculating mutual fund 
prices and the benchmark Nasdaq composite index. The stock prices 
also appear in most newspaper stock tables. 
</P>
<P>
	``The matter is under discussion,'' said Scott Peterson, a  
spokesman at Nasdaq's Washington offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to now, price changes in stocks traded after exchanges close  
are not considered official for the purposes of calculating that 
day's mutual fund values and stock indexes. Stock tables also do 
not include the after-hours trades. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision is expected by Oct. 1, when the Nasdaq Stock Market  
plans to make its trade reporting and quotation systems available 
through 6:30 p.m. Eastern time to trading networks that operate 
after the close of stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said Nasdaq will be soliciting comments in the meantime  
and ``revisiting the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think there can be a solution found that meets everyone's  
needs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq said Friday that its systems that track stock prices and  
trading volume will keep operating longer to help provide more 
information to investors who trade after hours through electronic 
networks. These fledgling systems, known as ECNs, have drawn 
criticism for their lack of liquidity. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq's move means that price and volume information on  
after-hour trades on all ECNs will become available at one central 
source -- the Nasdaq Trade Dissemination Service. Currently, 
after-hours investors only can see trades conducted on the networks 
they use. 
</P>
<P>
	As the ranks of ECNs grow, and their hours of operations expand,  
concern also has risen that the market has become too fragmented 
and investors will have difficulty finding the best price to buy or 
sell shares. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, an electronic trading system called MarketXT began  
allowing individual investors to trade as late as 8 p.m. for the 
first time. Datek Online Brokerage Services currently allows small 
investors to trade until 5:15 p.m., and other large online brokers, 
including ETrade Group, are planning similar forays into 
after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of after-hours trading have argued that investors could  
face extremely volatile markets in after-hours trading because the 
trading volume is expected to be thin, which could lead to wide 
price swings in short periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, only the market's biggest, most sophisticated  
players -- institutional clients such as pension funds and mutual 
funds -- have participated in after-hours sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees  
the Nasdaq Market, is hoping to reduce that risk by providing 
access to its central trade reporting system. The move is intended 
to provide ``a fair and transparent market to protect investors'' 
during after-hours sessions, according to a NASD statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The after-hours market presents special risks to the investor,  
including volatility and widely scattered prices of varying 
quality. We are pleased that Nasdaq has taken steps to make these 
prices visible to after-hours investors,'' said Arthur Levitt, 
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the 
government's stock trading watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said Nasdaq's move also will help brokers execute  
investors' orders accurately, ``which is crucial to the protection 
of investors in this still uncharted territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Junius Peake, an economics professor at the University of  
Northern Colorado, and a former member of the NASD's board of 
governors, said: ``Steps that will make the market more transparent 
and maximize the amount of information available to investors are 
good and will tend to increase liquidity and, presumably, reduce 
volatility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NASD emphasized that the Nasdaq is not yet extending its  
trading hours. The Nasdaq and the larger New York Stock Exchange 
are working with the Securities and Exchange Commission to figure 
out the smoothest process for extending trading at the United 
State's two largest stock markets, something that is expected next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASD's systems are being kept open so that investors can be  
assured they are operating in a regulated environment, Frank Zarb, 
the chairman and chief executive of NASD, said in a statment. But 
Zarb cautioned investors that ``there may be different risks in 
this market such as potential lack of liquidity as well as 
potential volatility that may not be present during traditional 
trading hours.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Under Fire for Russian Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House cast it as standard operating  
procedure: Top administration officials, including Vice President 
Al Gore, were not told of a Justice Department investigation into 
allegations of Russian money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Standard or not, the lack of knowledge left Gore vulnerable to  
criticism by his Republican rivals in the 2000 presidential 
campaign. Steve Forbes' campaign taped radio ads on Friday, 
criticizing Gore as ``out of the loop'' and insisting he owes 
American taxpayers an apology. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long-standing practice that law enforcement authorities  
make the judgment about when to brief the national security team,'' 
White House spokesman David Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno and national security officials at  
the White House were not briefed until Thursday and Friday on the 
investigation into accusations that Russian mobsters and 
politicians laundered money, possibly including diverted U.S. funds 
from the International Monetary Fund, through accounts at the Bank 
of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually such briefing decisions are based on a determination of  
political or foreign-policy consequences. This one was made because 
of press interest stirred by Gore's rivals, said one administration 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president and his aides have long spoken of Gore's  
unique and hands-on role in U.S.-Russia diplomacy, particularly as 
chairman of a joint commission on bilateral ties with former 
Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
</P>
<P>
	As for U.S. policy, Gore and other administration officials have  
a record of pressing Russia to crack down on corruption and 
implement economic reforms as a condition of continued aid from the 
IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to make clear that Russia must have the  
credibility and fairness and strong mechanisms to prevent this kind 
of financial crime,'' said Leavy. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole circulated a statement  
to reporters on Friday saying that Gore ``has failed in his only 
major foreign policy effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After seven years of his foreign policy stewardship and  
cultivation of Moscow's 'revolving door' leadership, Russian 
organized crime is threatening the social fabric of Russia,'' Dole 
said. ``The Dole administration will take this issue on directly 
with (Russian President Boris) Yeltsin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was airing his radio ads on stations serving President  
Clinton's next vacation stop, Skaneateles Lake in upstate New York, 
a hub for national political reporters during the president's stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing reports of Russian corruption, Forbes said Gore should  
apologize to the Russian people and American taxpayers for the 
``economic and political time bomb'' in Russia. ``Vice President 
Gore co-chairs the commission which oversees U.S.-Russian 
relations, but his aides say he was out of the loop,'' read the 
script of Forbes' ad. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes called for an immediate halt to all foreign aid to Russia  
until officials have rooted out ``the corruption of Russia's robber 
barons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the vice president and his family summering on a North  
Carolina island, and his campaign and White House offices emptied 
of vacationing aides, press inquiries were referred to Leavy, 
President Clinton's national security spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Gore spokeswoman Jodi Sakol: ``The vice president will not  
have a statement until he has more facts.''

<HEADLINE> Bank of New York Fires Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Bank of New York has fired Lucy Edwards, one  
of the two executives it had suspended amid allegations that 
Russian mobsters had used accounts at the bank in a major money 
laundering operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Giacalone, a spokesman for the Bank of New York, would not  
elaborate on the bank's decision Friday to dismiss Ms. Edwards, 
saying only ``we can confirm she was let go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones Newswires, quoting sources close the matter, reported  
that Edwards was fired for alleged gross misconduct, violations of 
the bank's internal policies, falsification of bank records, and 
failure to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	So far no one has been charged with any wrongdoing in the  
affair, in which up to $15 billion was reportedly funneled through 
the Bank of New York by Russian mobsters. Authorities in the United 
States, Russia and Britain are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards was a senior official at the bank's London office in  
charge of Eastern European operations. Her husband, Russian 
businessman Peter Berlin, reportedly had authority over some of the 
suspect accounts at the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Bank of New York official suspended pending the  
investigation, Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, is a senior vice 
president in New York who also supervised the bank's business in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement authorities reportedly are investigating the  
activities of Ms. Kagalovsky's husband Konstantin, who was Russia's 
representative to the International Monetary Fund from 1992 to 1995 
and later worked as a senior executive at Russia's Menetap bank. He 
now is vice president of Russian oil giant Yukos. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple released a statement Thursday denying any wrongdoing  
and dismissing reports of Russian mob involvement as an 
``anti-Russian campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Konstantin and Natasha wish to state unequivocally that they  
have never been involved in money laundering in any way, shape or 
form,'' the couple said in a statement issued by their lawyer. ``We 
are highly confident that at the conclusion of these 
investigations, this will be abundantly clear.''

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Urges Close Eye on Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve needs to pay closer  
attention to what happens on Wall Street, Chairman Alan Greenspan 
said Friday, since Americans reaping the rewards of the high-flying 
stock market are using those paper profits to justify spending and 
other financial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists interpreted his comments as a signal that the  
Fed may further raise interest rates this year. Two previous 
increases -- this week and on June 30 -- have failed to dampen the 
Wall Street stock-buying ``exuberance'' that Greenspan has 
expressed concern about. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices were down slightly after his speech.  
</P>
<P>
	``We no longer have the luxury to look primarily to the flow of  
goods and services, as conventionally estimated,'' when evaluating 
broad economic conditions, Greenspan told colleagues at the Federal 
Reserve's annual retreat in Wyoming's Grand Tetons. The text was 
distributed in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's recent interest rate increases have been aimed at  
easing inflationary pressures that central bank policy-makers fear 
are building in the economy as U.S. consumers continue a protracted 
spending binge. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the announcement on Tuesday of this year's second  
quarter-point increase in the influential federal funds rate -- the 
interest rate at which banks lend each other money -- the Dow Jones 
average of industrial stocks hit a record high of 11,326 on 
Wednesday before declining a bit the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concern is this: The major driver of consumer spending  
right now is the stock market. Until and unless we can reduce some 
of that unwarranted enthusiasm in the stock market we are not going 
to be able to slow consumer spending for a soft landing,'' said 
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist with Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	There has long been a debate in economic circles over whether  
financial markets should be taken into consideration when the Fed 
sets interest rate policy. Since a primary goal of the central bank 
is to keep inflation in check, some argue, it needs to focus mostly 
on price changes in the real economy, looking at such things as 
whether commodity prices or wages are rising too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, however, in Friday's speech, said that given the  
larger percentage of household wealth that is now accounted for by 
investments, the central bank needs to watch financial markets more 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 44 percent of American households owned stock  
either directly or through retirement plans in 1998, up from 20 
percent to 25 percent about a decade earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are important -- but extremely difficult -- questions  
surrounding the behavior of asset prices and the implications of 
this behavior for the decisions of households and businesses,'' 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The difficulty for economic forecasters, Greenspan said, is that  
despite all the sophisticated economic models at their disposal, it 
still is virtually impossible to predict when a financial market 
becomes overvalued and a crash is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	``To anticipate a bubble about to burst requires the forecast of  
a plunge in the prices of assets previously set by the judgments of 
millions of investors, many of whom are highly knowledgeable,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Fed chairman said central bankers must put more effort  
into determining the links between stock-market values and the real 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	He specifically said that further study is needed on something  
economists call the ``wealth effect,'' the link between rising 
investment holdings and consumer spending. Such spending accounts 
for fully two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was implied in his speech is that central bankers have to  
watch asset price inflation to a greater degree now than ever 
because consumers are spending based on at least perceived 
permanent gains in their stock portfolios and perhaps home 
prices,'' said economist David Jones, with Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said Friday that Americans' personal  
income -- which includes wages, interest and government benefits -- 
rose 0.2 percent in July but was outpaced by a spending increase of 
0.4 percent. The nation's savings rate is at negative 1.4 percent, 
a near-record low.

<HEADLINE> E-mail Calls You a 'Big Stupid Jerk' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Fuji Bank Ltd. inadvertently sent out a  
virus-tainted e-mail that makes computers display a message calling 
the recipient a ``big stupid jerk,'' the bank said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bug was transmitted last week to investors worldwide via a  
memo detailing Fuji Bank's alliance with two other major Japanese 
banks, spokesman Hiroshi Takahashi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident did not damage computers, and the bank has  
apologized to all recipients, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus, which also changed some of the names in the memo to  
``Dr. Mountain Dew,'' was sent from a personal computer temporarily 
in use by the company, Takahashi said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the bank had ``done everything'' to eliminate the  
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuji announced last week it would merge with Industrial Bank of  
Japan Ltd. and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. in the fall of 2000 to 
form the world's largest financial operation.

<HEADLINE> No Link Between Ammo, Gulf Illness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A presidential panel looking into Gulf War  
illnesses said Friday that it can't pinpoint causes of the ailments 
and recommended further studies into whether there are genetic 
reasons for why some troops got sick when others did not. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interim report, the Special Oversight Board on Gulf War  
Illness ruled out one suspected cause -- exposure to depleted 
uranium used in U.S. munitions. The panel agreed with independent 
studies that found no evidence for the uranium link. 
</P>
<P>
	The board, headed by former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., issued a  
series of recommendations designed to keep better track of those 
with diagnosed and undiagnosed Gulf War illnesses, make clearer 
information available to the public and lead to better federal 
coordination. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Defense Department ``has conducted a credible  
investigation into the causes of Gulf War illnesses,'' the board 
``has not been shy about pointing out areas needing further 
improvement,'' Rudman said. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, the report suggested that the Pentagon office on  
Gulf War illnesses had engaged in ``mission creep,'' expanding its 
responsibilities and publishing ``information papers'' that didn't 
relate directly to Gulf War illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The board also suggested declassifying certain intelligence  
reports on the war that might bear on the illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of what it called ``observations,'' the panel said:  
</P>
<P>
	-- More extensive study into whether genetic predisposition to  
certain illnesses may explain why some Gulf War veterans with 
similar exposures are ill while others are not. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The government should try to correlate signs and symptoms of  
Gulf War illnesses with ``an age- and gender-matched general 
population sample.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- For future wars, the Pentagon should consider fitting soldiers  
with electronic identification badges so that satellites can track 
and record battlefield movements. 
</P>
<P>
	The report sought to settle the debate over the danger of  
depleted uranium, which coats U.S. artillery shells and bombs 
designed to penetrate tank armor. On impact, the shells create an 
airborne dust. 
</P>
<P>
	Some veterans groups have suggested hundreds of thousands of the  
men and women who served in the Gulf War had come in contact with 
depleted uranium. Some claimed to suffer from unexplained illnesses 
or increased cancer rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But studies by the Pentagon and Rand Corp., an independent  
research organization that specializes in military affairs, failed 
to find a link between depleted uranium and these illnesses, 
suggesting radiation levels in the substance are relatively low. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board agrees with the conclusion that the available  
evidence does not support claims that depleted uranium is causing 
the undiagnosed illnesses some Gulf War veterans are 
experiencing,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	One veterans' group, the National Gulf War Resource Center,  
denounced the panel's findings on depleted uranium as ``incomplete 
whitewash and failure.'' The panel ignored research suggesting that 
the material ``settles in the bone, brain, kidney, lung, liver and 
testicles,'' the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel was also criticized for not reaching any conclusions  
on whether contaminants from oil well fires in Kuwait contributed 
to the illnesses. The panel said it would deal with that issue in 
its final report. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 30,000 veterans of the war have complained of  
mysterious maladies, including fatigue, joint pain and memory loss, 
that they claim are related to their service in the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	A final report is due in May.

<HEADLINE> Report: Frankel Companion Calls Ex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A man who says his ex-wife has been  
traveling with fugitive financier Martin Frankel said she called 
this week from Brazil, The Hartford Courant reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Gustavo said his former wife, Adriana Gustavo, called  
Wednesday and said she and Frankel had been in Sao Paolo recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have reportedly been concentrating their search for  
Frankel in Europe, where they believe he fled in May after 
allegedly bilking millions of dollars from insurance companies. 
Estimates of the losses have ranged from $50 million to as much as 
$3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, a 44-year-old money manager who had a mansion in  
Greenwich, reportedly lived in Rome for several weeks in May and 
June before authorities began searching for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Adriana Gustavo, who is Brazilian, is described by friends as a  
one-time companion and employee of Frankel's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know exactly where she was calling from, but she said  
Marty was no longer with her,'' said Gustavo, whose marriage fell 
apart in 1995 after his wife met Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	Gustavo said that she did not leave a phone number where she  
could be reached. He said he telephoned a law enforcement agency to 
tell them about the call.

<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Martin H. Ruby, chief executive and  
chairman of ARM Financial Group Inc., resigned Friday from the 
company he helped form six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruby's resignation comes a few weeks after the company reported  
$174 million in second-quarter net losses, a drop of $7.30 per

</P>
<P>
	Three class-action lawsuits were filed last week alleging the  
Louisville-based company misrepresented or omitted information 
about its financial condition, artificially inflating the value of

<P>
	Ruby, 49, could not be reached for comment Friday. A spokesman  
for the company called his resignation ``a mutually agreed upon 
decision between him and the board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following his resignation, the board created a three-member  
``office of the president'' to oversee operations consisting of 
John R. Lindholm, president, retail business division; John R. 
McGeeny, executive vice president, general council; and William H. 
Panning, executive vice president and chief investment officer. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Russia To Raise Oil Export Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian government will sharply raise export  
taxes on oil and gasoline in October to boost revenues and 
guarantee enough gasoline for domestic markets, an official said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An increase in global oil prices this year has prompted Russian  
oil companies to funnel production to lucrative foreign markets, 
instead of domestic markets where prices are lower. The trend led 
to severe gasoline shortages in some parts of Russia and sharp 
price increases. 
</P>
<P>
	With parliamentary elections due in December, the government  
wants to avoid public anger over rising gasoline prices and has 
threatened to restrict oil exports to guarantee enough gasoline for 
domestic markets. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko announced  
that the government has decided to rise export taxes on crude oil 
from about $5 to $10 per metric ton starting Oct. 1, the Interfax 
news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will also introduce ``prohibitive taxes'' on the  
export of gasoline, and raise fuel oil export taxes from about $9 
to $14 per metric ton, Khristenko said. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures are likely to reduce exports, leaving more fuel for  
domestic markets -- while ensuring at the same time that the 
government doesn't lose too much tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow's finances remain in a sad shape, despite the recent  
boost provided by the increase in global oil prices. The Russian 
economy relies heavily on exports of raw materials, especially oil 
and gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest problem for Moscow is paying off its foreign debt,  
which will grow to $166 billion on January 1, up from $156.6 
billion a year before, according to the government's estimates 
cited by the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The debt will grow to $177.6 billion by the start of 2001,  
according to the government report to parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has missed several foreign debt payments over the past  
year, while negotiating new loans from the International Monetary 
Fund and the World Bank -- which means that both principal and 
servicing fees are accumulating.

<HEADLINE> Williams Sisters Ready for Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When they first showed up to play for pay,  
sisters Venus and Serena Williams were quick to state their goal: 
They would be No. 1 in women's tennis -- or No. 1 and 1a. 
</P>
<P>
	They had plenty of confidence, even though they lacked  
experience. And their upfront attitude didn't always go down easy 
with the other players. 
</P>
<P>
	It almost seemed too easy when Venus reached the U.S. Open final  
in her debut in the tournament in 1997. Then reality set in -- for 
her opponents. She was that good. 
</P>
<P>
	And if that wasn't enough, along came baby sister Serena. Their  
father, Richard Williams, who taught her daughters how to play, 
proclaimed that Serena would be the better of the two. 
</P>
<P>
	In just the 13th and 14th matches of her professional career,  
she defeated two players ranked in the Top 10. And last year, the 
5-foot-10 right-hander had the fifth fastest women's serve at 
Flushing Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
	When the U.S. Open begins its two-week run at the National  
Tennis Center on Monday, the 19-year-old Venus will be playing in 
America's premier tennis tournament for the third time. Serena, 17, 
will be making her second appearance on the hard courts in Flushing 
Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
	And they would love to play each other in Arthur Ashe Stadium.  
</P>
<P>
	That, however, can only happen in the singles final because the  
third-seeded Venus is in the top half of the draw while Serena, 
seeded seventh, is in the bottom half. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, neither sister would be surprised if it happened.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked if she felt she could be No. 1, Venus recently said:  
</P>
<P>
	``Should I say `yes?' I'm not thinking about everyone else. I  
don't even know who's out there. My game's improving. I'm getting 
older and stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I'm at my best, I make important shots. I improvise. I  
make shots that my opponent thinks I shouldn't be able to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike two years ago, it wouldn't surprise many if Venus was  
playing on ``Super Saturday'' in two weeks when the women's title 
match will be sandwiched between the two men's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	She has won four tournaments this year, two fewer than  
top-seeded Martina Hingis and the same as defending champion 
Lindsay Davenport, who is seeded second. Serena has three titles on 
her resume, all this year, and beat Hingis handily on hard courts 
in Key Biscayne, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was always a step faster and quicker than me,'' Hingis  
said of Serena. ``I was all of a sudden just standing there, didn't 
know what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After beating Hingis, Serena ran into Venus, whom she's never  
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the same player I was last year,'' Serena said. ``I've  
worked really hard to improve some things and get better. And it's 
showing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serena beat Hingis again in the Acura Classic in Los Angeles and  
won the event by stopping Julie Halard-Decugis in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was unbelievable,'' Halard-Decugis said. ``She is  
improving a lot. She played like No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serena isn't there yet, but it's her foremost goal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely trying to be the best I can be and that's the  
top spot,'' she said. ``I'm pretty serious about that. I definitely 
feel it's in reach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters have not played in the same tournament since Key  
Biscayne -- until now. If they do meet in the final, it will be only 
the 10th time in history that sisters have faced each other in 
singles in the U.S. championships. None of those matches has been 
after the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus will take on a qualifier in her first-round match, while  
Serena will face Kimberly Po of Rolling Hills, Calif. Po won their 
only other meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis will open against Kveta Hrdlickova of the Czech Republic  
and Davenport begins the defense of her crown against Corina 
Morariu of Boca Raton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	One major player who will be missing is Steffi Graf, a five-time  
U.S. Open champion. After winning the French Open in June and 
reaching the final at Wimbledon, where she lost to Davenport, Graf 
retired, saying she had lost her desire to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, who won the Australian Open in January for the third  
straight year, fell apart after losing the French Open title match 
to Graf, then was shocked in the first round at Wimbledon by 
Australia's Jelena Dokic. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 18-year-old Swiss right-hander is back on the right  
track, winning the du Maurier Open, a U.S. Open warmup event. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport, somewhat of a surprise when she won a year ago, added  
the Wimbledon crown earlier this summer. And while she hasn't 
dominated the hard court circuit this year as she did in 1998, she 
comes into the Open full of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	And confidence is something the Williams sisters know all about.

<HEADLINE> Compromise on 10 Commandments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALTOONA, Pa. (AP) -- Hoping to avoid a fight over a proposal to  
post the Ten Commandments in schools, a committee proposed on 
Friday that officials create an elective in comparative religion 
and allow student Ten Commandment Clubs instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident that what we have before you today is something  
that can withstand any challenge,'' said the school district's 
attorney, David Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
	A Baptist pastor had suggested posting the Ten Commandments in  
every school in the district as a counterbalance to the use of 
metal detectors and guards in the 9,400-student district that 
spends about $300,000 a year on security. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Gary Dull had also asked the school board to offer an  
elective on the Ten Commandments and allow his congregants to give 
students bookmarks spelling out the religious rules. 
</P>
<P>
	A school board committee that included Dull and a rabbi worked  
on the compromise, which must be approved by the board. It wasn't 
known Friday when the board would take up the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, high school students would be able to take  
a new comparative religion class, the Ten Commandments and other 
religious documents would be available in the libraries of every 
school and students would be able to start after-school Ten 
Commandments Clubs to further discuss them. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also would allow religious groups to distribute  
literature to students outside schools, though that's already 
allowed on public property. 
</P>
<P>
	The district carefully couched the proposal in secular terms in  
an attempt to avoid legal challenges, calling it an effort to build 
the characters of students. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court barred schools from posting the Ten  
Commandments in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's to challenge?'' Superintendent Dennis Murray said.  
``How can you be against character building? I'm sure somebody will 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the recent spate of school shootings that included the  
slayings at Columbine High in Littleton, Colo., members of the 
clergy, elected officials and lawmakers nationwide are pushing the 
Bible as a solution to school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky and West Virginia, school attorneys are worried  
about lawsuits after several school districts posted the Decalogue 
in every school this month.

<HEADLINE> Microworkz President To Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The chief executive and president of  
Microworkz.com, the low-priced computer maker overwhelmed by 
orders, is vacating those posts to make way for ``more seasoned 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Latman, who led the company into the national spotlight  
with the recent launch of its Webzter line of PCs, said Thursday 
he'll step down by Nov. 15 to become chairman of the privately held 
company's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	No replacement has been named.  
</P>
<P>
	The publicity generated by the Webzter line, priced between $299  
and $699, quickly swamped the fledgling company, which was deluged 
with more orders than it could handle. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints from customers angered by late orders and other  
issues began flooding into the Washington Attorney General's Office 
and the Better Business Bureau serving Oregon and Western 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The volume of complaints ``definitely hasn't slowed down from a  
couple of months ago,'' said bureau spokeswoman Angela Gamba. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working closely with this company to help them, and  
I think they're trying to make a good-faith effort, but we'd like 
to see the complaints decrease,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Latman admitted he blew it with the Webzter launch but asserted  
in June that ``every single consumer complaint has been 
addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With enough work space and computer assemblers to produce  
200,000 machines a month, the company appears better-equipped to 
deal with the launch of its latest bargain-basement PC, the 
iToaster, which began shipping this week. 
</P>
<P>
	At $199.95, the Pentium machine comes with keyboard, mouse,  
monitor and free Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, based in Lynnwood, Wash., plans to go public before  
year's end.

<HEADLINE> French Officials Debate Bank Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French banking authorities deliberated late into  
the night Friday, struggling to reach an agreement on whether 
Banque Nationale de Paris can keep shares won in its hostile bid 
for its unwilling target, Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Committee of Credit and Investment Institutions, headed by  
Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet, has said it would make 
the long-awaited decision late Friday on whether BNP can keep its 
37 percent Societe Generale stake. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision authorizing BNP to keep its stake would allow BNP to  
move further toward its goal of a three-way merger with Societe 
Generale and Paribas, which BNP already has acquired. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed bank -- which BNP calls the SBP -- would be the  
biggest in Europe in terms of assets. 
</P>
<P>
	French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, interviewed on  
French television late Friday, took a neutral stance on the 
takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever the outcome will be, it'll be a good thing for French  
economy,'' Strauss-Kahn said on TF1 television. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, several hundred Societe Generale employees  
demonstrated in front of the Bank of France headquarters in Paris, 
saying they feared the merger would lead to wage and job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Societe General protesters, dressed in suits and ties, held  
up banners that said ``No to the BNP raid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Guegan, a union delegate from Societe Generale, said the  
merger could lead to cuts of up to 15,000 at the bank. ``This can't 
be allowed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP launched a two-pronged, $37 billion hostile takeover for  
Societe Generale and Paribas in March. While BNP won control of 
Paribas, it obtained only a 37 percent stake of Societe Generale, 
leaving the final outcome with regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP has claimed it has enough shares for effective control over  
Societe Generale. But Societe Generale has countered its rival has 
only enough shares to block decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Paribas and Societe Generale had hoped to merge, but their plan  
was foiled when BNP launched its bid for both.

<HEADLINE> Showtime Presents Thomas-Hill Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Like the man said, the process stinks.  
</P>
<P>
	That was perhaps the only thing everyone could agree on during  
the Senate confirmation hearings for Judge Clarence Thomas. Those 
10 stormy days in October 1991 left the nation polarized and the 
nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court, in his own bitter words, dying 
``a thousand deaths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Showtime presents ``Strange Justice,'' a drama of the  
campaigns waged to save, and to sink, the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Premiering Sunday at 8 p.m. EDT, this splendid film, based on  
the book ``Strange Justice, The Selling of Clarence Thomas,'' seems 
a logical extension of the hearings themselves. Broadcast 
gavel-to-gavel, day after day, they unfolded as a galvanizing TV 
event. To view the film is to feel the intervening years evaporate. 
</P>
<P>
	In his performance, Delroy Lindo seems to be channeling Thomas,  
the conservative federal judge nominated by President Bush to 
replace retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall, a liberal champion of 
civil rights and the first black member of the high court. 
</P>
<P>
	And Regina Taylor, best known from the TV series ``I'll Fly  
Away,'' is picture perfect as Anita Hill, the former Thomas 
colleague who reluctantly, forcefully accused him of sexual 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	But the film, directed by Ernest Dickerson, is told from the  
perspective of a not-so-public player, Washington strategist 
Kenneth Duberstein, who was hired by the Bush Administration to 
shepherd Thomas through. 
</P>
<P>
	As depicted by Mandy Patinkin, the likable, relentless  
Duberstein is the focal point of the off-stage drama to land the 
job for a candidate seen by his opponents as unfit and, worse, a 
quota appointment and a traitor to his ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on, Duberstein spells out the challenge: ``To make the  
case that our candidate is decent, honest, qualified, intelligent 
and fair, while the other side's gonna claim he's 
ultraconservative, against women and minorities, and a little bit 
strange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patinkin, a Broadway musical star and a returning regular to  
TV's ``Chicago Hope,'' captures the blunt realism of this political 
pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our job,'' says Duberstein, ``is the same as if we're selling  
a product in the marketplace: Block their message, get ours out, 
while making it look like none of it comes from the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the nomination nearly capsized after Hill stepped  
forward with allegations of her former boss' crude remarks and 
come-ons when they worked together at the Department of Education 
and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	As delivered by Taylor, Anita Hill's testimony at first  
faithfully mimics the real-life scene we viewed eight years ago. 
But in the film's surreal restaging, the cool, composed witness is 
permitted to cut loose, to exhibit the fury we remember her for 
keeping in check. 
</P>
<P>
	The words are Hill's, but here she seethes, she snarls, she  
sheds bitter tears. It's a startling display. 
</P>
<P>
	But no more so than the re-enacted testimony of Clarence Thomas,  
a defiant man who felt cornered and under siege. As with Hill, the 
film lets Thomas put his rage into action. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a circus! A national disgrace!'' he erupts heroically,  
now on his feet before the senators. He rips off his shirt. ``And 
as far as I'm concerned, as a black American, this is a high-tech 
lynching!'' He tugs his necktie skyward, as if hanging by it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bull's-eye!'' says Duberstein, looking on with satisfaction.  
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Duberstein won the high-stakes game he had coached  
so well. The Bush Administration won. And, oh yes, Thomas pulled it 
out, gaining senate confirmation by a razor-thin vote of 52-48. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the film makes clear, Thomas would never concede victory.  
</P>
<P>
	Nor, apparently, has his resentment abated. In a rare speech a  
year ago, he bitterly attacked critics black and white, declaring 
his refusal ``to have my ideas assigned to me as though I was an 
intellectual slave because I'm black.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Strange Justice'' exposes a politicized process of which no  
one could feel proud. It revisits the issues that made everyone 
participating squirm: color and sex. 
</P>
<P>
	But, necessarily, it begs the question that keeps this sorry  
episode from fading away: Who -- Thomas or Hill -- lied under oath? 
Whoever you think, ``Strange Justice'' will only harden your stance 
and reinspire your anger. 
</P>

<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- South Africa's Penny Heyns, racing  
alone in a special 50-meter breaststroke time trial, set her eighth 
world record in 11 swims during the Pan Pacific championships 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meet officials said Heyns received official sanction from  
governing body FINA to go for the record after breaking three 100 
records and four 200 records in the past six weeks, including three 
previously in this meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyns was clocked in 30.83 seconds, breaking the mark of 30.95

<HEADLINE> Autodesk Laying Off 350 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP ) -- Autodesk, the maker of design  
software for architects and engineers, is laying off about 350 
workers, or 10 percent of its work force, after reporting a 99 
percent plunge in second-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock in the world's fourth-largest PC software firm has lost  
about half its value since January amid declining demand from 
customers who have focused their spending on Internet initiatives 
and Y2K preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
	Autodesk stock fell another 5 percent Friday, closing at $23  
9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Income for the quarter was 1 cent per share, or about $400,000,  
Autodesk announced Thursday. The company had posted a 46 cent per 
share profit, or $27.5 million, in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of our financial results, the actions announced  
today, while painful, are necessary to recalibrate the business and 
move forward with our strategic direction,'' Autodesk president and 
CEO Carol Bartz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts, which include 150 jobs in the firm's San Rafael and  
San Francisco offices, will create a leaner company focused on its 
main software business and developing Internet-based products and 
services, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are mindful that our customers are working in an  
increasingly Web-centric world and that means they have to be able 
to actively be involved in a Web-based environment,'' Ms. Bartz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't been oblivious to the Internet,'' Bartz said. ``We  
know that the kind of design our customers do isn't really an 
Internet-biased product. But, yes, it's true we could have had an 
Internet aura around the products some quarters ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Software upgrades aren't a priority for many firms right now,  
says Jennifer M. Smith, a software analyst at Dean Rauscher Wessels 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies are saying I have to get a Web page, a Web strategy.  
That, combined with Y2K, people are saying that if I dont have to 
buy it now, Ill wait.''

<HEADLINE> `Sin City' Gets New Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHENIX CITY, Ala. (AP) -- Thirty students gazed at TV sets in the  
library of Glenwood School, waiting in hushed excitement Friday for 
the final out that would make their team Little League national 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will show America we're not a redneck town anymore! We're  
a baseball town!'' 13-year-old Jeffery Tinkler burst out. 
</P>
<P>
	Caleb Kinsaul quietly corrected his classmate.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, this will show that we're not `Sin City,' anymore,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a place long smeared by a historic reputation for vice,  
Phenix City is getting a new image, thanks to a band of boys whose 
surprise victory over the defending world champions delighted their 
hometown of 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Phenix City beat Toms River, N.J., 3-2 on Friday in the U.S.  
championship game at the Little League World Series in 
Williamsport, Pa. The team plays Osaka, Japan, in Saturday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	``These boys have brought the first positive attention, from a  
national spotlight, to Phenix City in my 25 years,'' said Bill 
Hayes, principal of Glenwood, a private school where five players 
are students and the coach, Tony Rasmus, used to teach chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my mind, the city's past was already wiped out, but this  
can wipe it out of everyone's minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1950s, Phenix City was rife with corruption,  
gambling and prostitution, catering to soldiers stationed just 
across the Chattahoochee River at Fort Benning, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Patterson, the Democratic nominee for state attorney  
general in 1954, vowed to clean it up. But on a trip to Phenix City 
a few weeks later, he was shot to death in an alley. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing led Gov. Gordon Persons to declare martial law and  
prompted a series of investigations, trials and crackdowns that 
finally restored order. 
</P>
<P>
	Things have changed, but the history is too fresh to forget  
easily. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had many positive things happen to Phenix City in the  
years since that time, but that time still lingers,'' said Howard 
Walker, who took over at Glenwood for Rasmus, who resigned in July. 
``But these boys can maybe give us something else to be known 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a sensation familiar in Toms River, where there is still  
plenty of pride in a team that had been on a seemingly unstoppable 
run to another championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``They brought the whole town together for a second straight  
year,'' said Rich Greenberg, who joined fans to watch the game at 
Mugsy's Bar &AMP; Grill, the unofficial clubhouse for Toms River East 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us a lot of pride when you have a good group of kids  
that accomplishes something positive,'' Greenberg said. ``I don't 
think they realize the magnitude of what they accomplished, and 
they probably won't until they're older.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands turned out for victory parades last year for the team,  
and a welcome-home rally is being planned for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar celebrations await the Phenix City team -- regardless of  
how it does against Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 fans went to the city's Amphitheater to watch  
the championship game Thursday night, before it was rained out and 
rescheduled for Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people called in sick today so they could watch the  
game,'' said Donna Ward, an employee at the parks and recreation 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	They're invited back to the Amphitheater for another party  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	From one end of town to the other, signs on roadsides, hotels  
and banks wish the team luck. One, on the median of the road 
entering town, will have to be changed: It reads, ``Welcome to 
Phenix City. Home of the Southern Region Champions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has been behind this team for months, from donating  
funds to help the families go to the games, to making signs, to 
watching the games,'' Hayes said. ``Their win is our win.''

<HEADLINE> Lobeck Steps Down at AutoNation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- In another shakeup at car-dealing giant  
AutoNation Inc., the executive in charge of its rental-car 
business, including the Alamo and National chains, resigned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	William E. Lobeck's departure -- effective immediately and  
announced without explanation -- comes as AutoNation separates the 
rental business from its car sales operations, a move that could 
lead to an eventual spin-off or sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The rental unit includes National Car Rental System Inc. and  
Alamo Rent-A-Car Inc. -- both run globally -- and CarTemps USA, 
formerly known as Spirit Rent-A-Car Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Friday its board still was exploring options of  
how the separation will take place. The move is among several meant 
to boost AutoNation's stock price, which closed Friday at $14.25, 
up 18 3/4 cents, compared to a 52-week high of just over $19. 
</P>
<P>
	Lobeck is the latest in a line of top executives to leave the  
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based AutoNation. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is searching for a new CEO to replace Steven  
Berrard, who last month announced he was leaving to manage his own 
investment firm. And John H. Costello, the company's president and 
chief operating officer, announced this month he had quit after 
eight months on the job to pursue Internet business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation said chief financial officer Michael S. Karsner would  
run the rental business until Lobeck's permanent successor is 
named. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation has 412 automotive franchises and 42 AutoNation USA  
stores in 24 states.

<HEADLINE> Owners Warn Umpires Against Striking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball umpires were warned Friday that they  
will be fired if they strike next week. 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig and NL president Len Coleman sent the  
warning in a memo dated Aug. 25 that many umpires received before 
they worked Friday night's games. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the umpires backing union head Richie Phillips have  
talked about striking over baseball's refusal to allow 22 umpires 
to withdraw their resignations, which are effective Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been several press reports suggesting that the  
Major League Umpires Association and certain major league umpires 
may engage in a strike on or before Sept. 2,'' said the memo, a 
copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you know, the collective bargaining agreement between the  
leagues and the Umpire's Association contains a very broad 
no-strike pledge. ... While we are confident that most, if not all, 
major league umpires intend to honor this no-strike commitment, we 
feel it is important that all major league umpires understand our 
position with respect to conduct in violation of that commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any major league umpire who participates in a strike or any  
other conduct in violation of the no-strike commitment will have 
his employment terminated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips did not immediately return a telephone call seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because they sent us a letter doesn't necessarily mean  
that what's in the letter is gospel,'' said union president Jerry 
Crawford, an NL umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford said that if some umpires do strike, they would have a  
harsh opinion of colleagues who continued to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way you view people is if you go on strike and  
somebody crosses the line, then they're considered a scab. 
Absolutely,'' Crawford said. ``I'm not saying we're going on 
strike. I'm not making that commitment because we've discussed a 
lot of things. All I'm saying is a scab is a person who crosses a 
picket line when he is out on strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some others umps didn't think the memo was significant.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just more reading material,'' said NL umpire Ed Montague,  
a Phillips supporter who is keeping his job. ``We're not real happy 
with what's been going on. We've got a lot of bitter guys. Other 
than that, we're dealing with people that I don't think care about 
the state of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't care about our jobs, obviously. They want to bring  
in a bunch of inexperienced people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL umpire Joe Brinkman, one of the leaders of the anti-Phillips  
faction among umpires, said he didn't take the memo as a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a reminder, I would say, of what our contract  
says,'' said Brinkman, among the umpires keeping his job. ``The 
thing is, we knew a strike is illegal per our work contract, or any 
concerted work stoppage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most umpires submitted their resignations last month, saying at  
the time they wanted to force an early start of bargaining on a new 
labor deal to replace the one that expires Dec. 31. The strategy 
backfired when 27 umpires failed to resign or quickly withdrew 
their resignations. The leagues then accepted the resignations of 
22 umps and hired 25 replacements from the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to keep the 22 umps working, the union filed unfair  
labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners expect the NLRB Board to defer action on the charges and  
say the matter is subject to the clause in the labor contract 
requiring arbitration for disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	If that happens, Crawford said the union may file suit in  
federal court in Philadelphia in an effort to obtain an injunction 
that would prevent baseball from letting go of the 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every moment you're out there you're thinking about this,''  
Montague said. ``They put us in this position, and I think our 
tempers have been a little short on the field, with players and 
managers and such. It's tough on the family life at home. I will 
never forget this.''

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Reviewing Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLMSTED FALLS, Ohio (AP) -- Amtrak will review its security  
because of the stabbings of three people aboard its Lake Shore 
Limited train. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron Hall, 41, of Ontario, Calif., was being held on $1 million  
bail after being charged with three counts of attempted murder. 
Police said he stabbed two conductors and a passenger as the train 
moved across Ohio early Thursday on its way from Chicago to New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The train's 376 passengers were jolted awake outside Cleveland  
shortly after 3 a.m. as Hall and the victims ran through the train, 
leaving a bloody trail in seven cars. Hall was arrested when a 
passenger identified him while leaving the halted train. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacqueline Williams, 43, of Worcester, Mass., who boarded in  
Toledo with her 12-year-old daughter, said one of the wounded 
conductors burst into her car. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as he came in, I heard the worker shout into a  
walkie-talkie: `He's got a knife! He stabbed me! He stabbed me!''' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have cited no motive for the attack, which witnesses said  
happened after Hall became unruly in the train's dining car. Amtrak 
spokesman Ray Lang said the victims were stabbed when they tried to 
subdue him. 
</P>
<P>
	The passenger, John Henry Crotty, was in serious condition early  
today at St. John West Shore Hospital in Westlake, Ohio, after 
surgery for stab wounds to his cheek and jaw, hospital officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Conductor Michael Dwyer, 52, was in guarded and stable condition  
at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland with a head wound, a 
nursing supervisor said. The other conductor, Sean Wilcox, 26, of 
Merrillville, Ind., was released after being treated for wounds to 
his shoulder and chin. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, who police said kicked out a patrol car window, told  
reporters he acted in self-defense when a train porter pulled a gun 
on him. Police said no gun was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Piszczek, appointed as Hall's attorney, would not  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak said it would review the stabbing to determine if  
security is adequate aboard its trains. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is determined that Amtrak needs to modify security  
procedures, changes will be made,'' the company said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	While the railway's police department patrols major stations, no  
security officers ride the Lake Shore Limited, Lang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Eakin, a spokesman for the United Transportation Union,  
whose members include conductors, said the workers ``have the same 
concerns as stewardesses or cab drivers. You just never know when 
these incidents are going to occur,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Railroad Administration officials joined several other  
rail unions in noting the high level of safety aboard Amtrak 
trains. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Burger King Ends West Bank Outlet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Angry Israeli settlers today called for a  
worldwide boycott of Burger King restaurants after the chain 
canceled its franchise in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlers also demanded a halt to Israel-Palestinian peace  
talks over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision announced Thursday followed a threat by  
Arab-Americans to boycott the chain if the restaurant in Maale 
Adumim remained open. A statement from Burger King headquarters in 
Miami did not mention the threat, saying the decision was made for 
``commercial reasons and in the best interests of hundreds of 
thousands of people'' who work for the chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Denouncing the Burger King decision as ``a shame and an  
abomination,'' Maale Adumim Mayor Benny Kashriel blamed 
Palestinians for initiating the boycott threat. ``We are calling on 
Jewish organizations and our friends, Jews and Christians, to 
boycott Burger King,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kashriel, who also serves as chairman of the Yesha Council, the  
body representing Israeli settlers in the West Bank, called on 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to suspend peace talks with the 
Palestinians and ``bring this up before the Americans, and not to 
give in on this, because this is an American company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli government officials had no immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Maale Adumim, located in the desert three miles east of  
Jerusalem, is the largest Israeli settlement in the West Bank, with 
about 27,000 residents. A four-lane highway links the city to 
Jerusalem, where most of its residents work. 
</P>
<P>
	The Burger King restaurant in the Maale Adumim shopping mall  
opened today as usual, said a worker who gave his name as Yossi and 
said he was one of the branch managers. The Burger King statement 
said the restaurant would not have to close, but would no longer be 
allowed to use the company's name. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant opened three months ago, said Kashriel. The  
Burger King statement charged that the Israeli franchise holder, 
Rikamor, falsely stated that the restaurant would be in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released by its public relations firm in Tel  
Aviv, Rikamor chairman Meshulam Riklis hotly denied that charge and 
instructed his officers to take action by ``all legal means 
available to the company'' in Israeli courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Kashriel was militant about opposing the Burger King decision,  
saying it brought back memories of the Arab boycott against Israel 
before the state of Israel was created in 1948. The ban was 
initiated by the Arab world but has been practically canceled in an 
era of Middle East peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned that if the decision remained unopposed, ``this  
surrender could lead to other steps against Israel on each and 
every matter. ''

<P>
	Joe Paterno just about fell off his chair when he heard the  
question: Would he have agreed to play Arizona in the Pigskin 
Classic if the game was in Tucson? 
</P>
<P>
	``In Arizona? In August? Sure I woulda,'' the Penn State coach  
said, his Brooklyn accent dripping with sarcasm as he pondered a 
sweltering afternoon in Arizona Stadium. ``We woulda played 'em 
anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	OK, maybe not.  
</P>
<P>
	That coach Dick Tomey is flying his fourth-ranked Wildcats 1,900  
miles east to play No. 3 Penn State in Beaver Stadium says a lot: 
He must think he has quite a football team. 
</P>
<P>
	Risking a season-opening loss is always scary for a team with  
national championship dreams. Risking one of these games on the 
road against a Top 5 opponent? That just isn't done. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a lot of confidence in their program and a lot of  
respect for the Penn State players to come into this area and play 
us,'' Paterno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Tomey's players have never been closer to Pennsylvania  
than the Rockies. And add a dash of jet lag to the novelty factor: 
The players will have lost two hours by the time they arrive in 
State College today after a five-hour charter. 
</P>
<P>
	As Hawaii's coach for a decade, Tomey knows better than most how  
to handle a football team on a marathon trip, and he said he is 
making no special preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	At Hawaii, ``we traveled west to east quite a bit to play in our  
conference, and those trips are more arduous and difficult than any 
anybody could possibly make on the mainland,'' Tomey said. ``The 
biggest thing is you have to go with a good team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on the opening weekend of the college football season,  
it's Louisiana Tech at No. 1 Florida State, Kansas at No. 18 Notre 
Dame and North Carolina State at No. 17 Texas on Saturday, and No. 
9 Miami vs. No. 12 Ohio State on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	If ever there was a moment for Tomey to pit a bunch of  
travel-weary players against a Top 5 team, this is it. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona has won 16 of its past 17 games, and among its 16  
returning starters are a pair of quarterbacks, Keith Smith and 
Ortege Jenkins, who would both probably start if they weren't on 
the same team. 
</P>
<P>
	Tailback Trung Canidate, who scored on bursts of 80, 75, 71, 67,  
66, 54, 48, 45, 38 and 37 yards in 1998, is a sleeper in the 
Heisman Trophy race. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Marcus Bell is back after putting up similarly gaudy  
number on defense. Last year, he had two 21-tackle games and 
several other games with 11, 12 or 13 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State has as much talent back, at least on defense. All  
three starting linebackers -- LaVar Arrington, Brandon Short and Mac 
Morrison -- are Butkus Award candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	On offense, the Lions will try to counter Canidate with tailback  
Eric McCoo, who had a team-best 822 yards a year ago. Quarterback 
Kevin Thompson and receivers Corey Jones and Chafie Fields are all 
seniors now, and they promise they've left behind a past littered 
with bad routes, overthrown passes and dropped balls. 
</P>
<P>
	For both teams, this is the chance to find whether they can live  
up to their lofty preseason billings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all anxious to see what we can do,'' Short said earlier  
this month. ``I mean, there's no better team to be playing than a 
top-ranked team, somebody that's also in the hunt like yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's players, however, are uncomfortable about putting too  
much emphasis on one game, especially a season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big game that might have national championship  
implications, but that's nowhere in my mind,'' Jenkins said. ``You 
never know how the season will be, and we just want to get 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In truth, more might be at stake for Arizona, a school saddled  
with the Pac-10's lousy reputation -- all offense, no defense. 
Defeating the Big Ten's top team would add a breath of national 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	They've done it before, beating Nebraska 23-20 in the Holiday  
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that Pac-10 people get tired of hearing is that the  
Big Ten is where real football is played, where the real tough guys 
are,'' Tomey said this week. ``We got tired of that before the 
Nebraska game last year, that the Big 12 was more physical. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we proved anything, but we certainly were equal 	
to the test in the physical part of it. Hopefully we'll be again,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
                 *Louisiana Tech at No. 1 Florida State 	
</P>
<P>
	Once again, the Seminoles are loaded. Chris Weinke has recovered  
from a neck injury that sidelined him for the final three games of 
the '98 season, and wide receiver Peter Warrick and running back 
Travis Minor return. Add seven starters from the nation's top-rated 
defense, and it's easy to see why Florida State starts the season 
No. 1 for the fifth time since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 *North Carolina State at No. 17 Texas (Black Coaches Association 	
</P>
<P>
                             Classic) 	
</P>
<P>
	All-American wideout Torry Holt is gone, but Jamie Barnette has  
a sure-handed target in Chris Coleman. The Wolfpack upset the 
Seminoles last season and made it to a bowl for the first time 
since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mack Brown begins his second year at Texas, and this time  
he'll rely more on a passing game. Junior Hodges Mitchell gets 
first crack at stepping in for the departed Ricky Williams, with 
redshirt freshman Victor Ike also expected to get his chance. 
</P>
<P>
           *Kansas at No. 18 Notre Dame (Eddie Robinson Classic)    	
</P>
<P>
	Bob Davie opens his third season in South Bend, Ind., knowing  
four of his predecessors won national titles in their third year. 
That streak will probably end, but the Irish were happy to add a 
12th game to avoid opening on the road against Michigan on Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no suspense to why we did it,'' Davie said of  
scheduling. ``We wanted to open up at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Driver, a strong safety last season for the Irish, has been  
returned to tailback. Two years ago as a freshman, Driver ran for 
125 yards and three TDs. 
</P>
<P>
 *No. 9 Miami vs. No. 12 Ohio State (Kickoff Classic, at Giants 	
</P>
<P>
                             Stadium) 	
</P>
<P>
	In addition to new quarterback Kenny Kelly, Miami replaces  
Edgerrin James with James Jackson and Najeh Davenport, while the 
defense is anchored by linebackers Dan Morgan and Nate Webster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes will rely on tailback Michael Wiley (1,235 yards)  
as a bunch of fresh faces break into the lineup. Wideouts Ken-Yon 
Rambo and Reggie Germany move in to replace David Boston and Dee 
Miller. On defense, Na'il Diggs becomes the top linebacker with the 
departure of Andy Katzenmoyer and Jerry Rudzinski. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost a great amount of good players and now we have some  
guys who want to step in there,'' Cooper said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Tries To Be Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Minutes before Al Gore's turn at the lectern,  
a young aide is scanning the crowd for VIPs worthy of being 
mentioned in the vice president's opening remarks. He is jotting 
down names -- lots of names. 
</P>
<P>
	Recognizing a recipe for another dull address, Gore campaign  
chairman Tony Coelho rushes to the startled staffer, rips the paper 
out of his hands and tears it into shreds. He pulls the vice 
president aside and tells him to forget about the notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just tell the people thank you,'' Coelho whispers to Gore.  
``Then tell them a few stories. And tell them what you believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That scene from an early summer speech underscored the stated  
effort to ``let Al be Al.'' And that imperative is part of a 
broader fall strategy to sharpen the vice president's message and 
reassure jittery Democrats with raw displays of political force. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do now is show that Al has broad-based  
support and that he's ready for a general campaign,'' Coelho said. 
</P>
<P>
	To put it more simply, Gore and his advisers are trying to show  
that they've finally got their act together. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opening months of campaign 2000, the Gore team  
underestimated Democratic rival Bill Bradley, bickered with the 
vice president's White House staff and couldn't get Gore's abortion 
record straight. Gore became the butt of jokes, claiming he created 
the Internet and taking a canoe ride on an artificially raised 
river in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Even President Clinton said he had concerns about the campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	Coelho, hired in May to improve discipline, made several staff  
changes and drew clear lines of authority -- all passing through his 
office. Gore, who had been micromanaging the campaign, gave Coelho 
the keys. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 Democrats in Congress already have announced their  
support for Gore, but campaign aides are rounding up more for a 
wave of fall endorsements. In the next few critical months, they 
want to show that -- despite Bradley's upstart challenge -- the party 
apparatus is firmly behind Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Democrat on Capitol Hill said Gore could expect up to  
120 House members to endorse him in time for a fall announcement, 
though there are still pockets of lawmakers anxious about Gore's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Elected officials amount to about 20 percent of the delegates  
who will determine the nomination at next summer's Democratic 
convention in Los Angeles. Bradley, a former New Jersey senator, 
has few so-called ``super delegates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always believed that people would decide the  
nomination at the polls and understand fully that the bulk of the 
institutional support would be with the vice president,'' Bradley 
spokeswoman Anita Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate Gore endorsement events are scheduled for black and  
Hispanic leaders. Campaign aides speaking on condition of anonymity 
said they were confident Jesse Jackson would endorse Gore this 
fall. They also expected to secure the support of entertainer Bill 
Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
	An AFL-CIO endorsement in October would cement Gore's sometimes  
shaky standing with labor. Aides predict they will get it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gore team spent the summer polling voters -- and rounding  
them up into focus groups -- to devise better language and tactics 
to get his message across. Coelho has ordered staff to put Gore in 
cozier settings with fewer people. No note cards. Fewer lecterns. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times he needs a podium, obviously. At times he needs to be  
-- Whoop! -- vice president,'' Coelho said, holding himself ramrod 
straight to imitate his boss. ``But most of the time he doesn't 
need to be. And I think to a great extent the system hurt him and 
his ability to project what he really feels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Al Gore needs crutches to communicate,'' Coelho  
said. ``And I think the crutches have hurt him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A summer's worth of polling has helped the campaign narrow its  
focus from a laundry list of proposals to a select few that impact 
voters' lives. Gore will expend less effort on 10-point plans and 
more on trying to bring out the human dimensions of one point at a 
time, aides say. 
</P>
<P>
	To highlight his concern about school discipline, Gore might  
talk to a victim of school violence. His hopes for health care are 
best explained over the kitchen table in a middle-class 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got to sit down and talk to people. It's got to be him,''  
said Coelho, munching popcorn in his high-rise office. ``It can't 
be fake. It can't be phony. It can't be the consultants. It's got 
to be our job to put him in venues for him to be able to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's campaign was unimpressed. ``Sounds like they're trying  
to do the Bradley campaign,'' said Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
	The polling also developed specific language -- phrases and  
potential slogans -- that will help Gore drive home his central 
campaign pledge: He will keep the economy strong and help American 
families cope with the rapidly changing times. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Starr Paid $4.2M for Outside Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kenneth Starr's office paid $1.5 million to  
private investigators and spent $843,000 for advice on legal and 
ethical issues, a new accounting of his five-year investigation of 
the Clintons and their associates shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's independent counsel's office listed $4.2 million in  
contract work in response to questions from Democratic Sens. Byron 
Dorgan of North Dakota and Patrick Leahy of Vermont. The 
investigation's total cost has topped $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Payments ranged from $591,915 for computer support to $263 to  
the appraiser who put a value on President Clinton's gifts to 
Monica Lewinsky, the General Accounting Office said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	A single contract for investigative work was $341,703. In all,  
Starr's office reported 10 contracts with outside investigators who 
interviewed witnesses, analyzed evidence and handled other tasks. 
No other details were provided and the investigators' names were 
withheld for ``security reasons,'' the GAO said in letters to 
Dorgan and Leahy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no conceivable way to justify these types of  
expenditure,'' Leahy said Friday. ``This is after he tied up 78 FBI 
agents'' assigned to his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy complained that Starr gave incomplete answers to auditors  
for the congressional watchdog agency and said he would press for 
more details. That GAO accounting was requested by Leahy and 
Dorgan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The taxpayers are entitled to it, so we don't make these kinds  
of mistakes in the future,'' he said. Leahy said accountability was 
a long-standing problem with the independent counsel law under 
which Starr was appointed. The law expired June 30 but the work of 
existing independent counsels continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Ray, a spokeswoman for Starr's office, said the  
office's mandate involved a ``monumental effort'' that ``required 
unusual commitments of resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have conducted ourselves entirely properly and in full  
compliance with existing laws and regulations,'' Ray said. ``This 
office has internal and management controls that meet the federal 
financial accounting standards and we certify this every six months 
to the GAO and every year to the president of the Senate and the 
speaker of the House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the GAO, deputy independent counsel Jay Apperson  
said, ``We are confident that the expenditures cataloged in the 
report were all consistent with applicable laws and regulations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr estimated his office spent $4.4 million on its  
investigation of Clinton's affair with Miss Lewinsky and cover-up 
efforts afterwards, which led to the president's impeachment and 
his acquittal by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also investigated the Clintons' Whitewater business  
dealings; the suicide of deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster; 
overbilling by lawyer Webster Hubbell, a Clinton confidant; the 
firing of White House travel office workers, and allegations that 
White House officials misused FBI files. His probe has led to 
convictions of 14 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the office's 57 contractors were jury consultants paid  
$147,311 for trial work and lawyers who made $373,700 representing 
Starr's office in court matters, including allegations that the 
independent counsel's office illegally leaked grand jury secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr paid $7,500 to a communications consultant for help in  
preparing his testimony before a House committee considering 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	And he paid $300,000 to Samuel Dash, the ethics adviser who  
resigned over that congressional appearance. Dash felt Starr erred 
by becoming an aggressive advocate for his impeachment report. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office paid $66,067 to medical consultants, who helped  
with the Foster investigation and evaluated the health of Susan 
McDougal and former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker when the 
defendants were arguing that their medical conditions should limit 
their prison time. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's salary is set by law at $118,400, and no one in his  
office is paid more. But the office has granted 82 cash performance 
bonuses of up to $8,000. None went to Starr.

<HEADLINE> Wilson Wins Men's Gymnastics Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Blaine Wilson won an unprecedented  
fourth straight national all-around gymnastics title and lost his 
training partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson wrapped up the title with a nearly flawless performance  
in the finals Friday night after Jason Gatson, who led following 
Wednesday's preliminary phase, tore a knee ligament and dropped out 
of the U.S. Gymnastics Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's overall score of 115.300 points made him the first man  
to win four national titles since John Roethlisberger in 1990, '92, 
'93 and '95. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said there would be no immediate celebration. Instead, he  
planned to go straight to the hotel to see Gatson -- who was treated 
and released from a hospital and is expected to have surgery in the 
next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably spend most of my time seeing how he's doing,''  
Wilson said. ``Jason obviously is a big link in our team. He will 
be missed, but he will be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger, 29, less than a year after his own  
reconstructive knee surgery, made a dramatic comeback by finishing 
second with a score of 111.800. Brett McClure was third with 
111.500. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 14 men in the all-around competition qualify for the  
World Championships team trials, to be held Sept. 15-18 in Kansas 
City. That event will help choose the U.S. squad for the World 
Gymnastics Championships Oct. 8-16 in Tianjin, China. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson, a national title within his reach after coming close the  
last three years, injured his right knee while dismounting from the 
horizontal bar. He was leading the all-around competition at the 
time of the injury, in his first event Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury could keep one of the United States' most promising  
male gymnasts out of the Sydney Olympics, though Gatson predicted 
he will return from the injury in time for the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I landed, something popped and I just fell to the  
ground, it hurt so bad. I knew something happened, because it was a 
loud pop. My knee just went out on me,'' Gatson said before being 
taken to UC Davis Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to make me stronger. I am going to get it fixed  
and I am going to come back and be on the Olympic team in Sydney, 
and we're going to bring back a medal to the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger, who competed with a leg brace at the  
championships and had three huge ice packs on his legs during a 
post-competition news conference, said he's also confident Gatson 
will be fully healed before the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be back no problem, I guarantee,'' Roethlisberger said.  
``It's going to be a tough year for him. But for sure he's going to 
be back up here next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson, 18, who finished second in 1996 and '98 and was third in  
the national championships in 1997, held a slim lead over Wilson at 
the start of the all-around finals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But his right knee buckled as he flew off the high bar, and he  
fell to the side of the mat. After getting iced on the competition 
floor, he was helped to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three weeks ago when I was in practice, I was doing a tumbling  
exercise on floor and I kind of tweaked my knee back then. After 
the first day (here) my knee was fine,'' he said. ``I am going to 
get this fixed and I'm going to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson was too young to compete in the Olympics in 1996, but has  
been among the nation's top competitors the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	He was second in the national all-around competition in 1996,  
losing to Wilson, and was third in 1997 behind Wilson and 
Roethlisberger. That third-place finish made him the youngest 
American man to qualify for the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he finished second again in the all-around national  
championships to Wilson, his training partner at the U.S. Olympic 
Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson won the parallel bars event Wednesday with a mark of 9.95  
and placed first in the floor exercise with a 9.8 en route to 
scoring 57.325 points in the preliminary phase of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	That sent him into Friday's finals, which counted for 80 percent  
of the all-around score, with a lead of one-tenth of a point over 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	For the third straight night, there was a small crowd at the  
Arco Arena for the championships. Only 4,867 fans were in the 
stands, which have a capacity of 11,000 for gymnastics.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Pulls Out of Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong's economy grew at an annual rate of  
0.5 percent in the second quarter, pulling out of a severe and 
lengthy recession that brought record unemployment and sharply 
falling prices to the once-booming financial center. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's government report of a modest rise in the territory's  
gross domestic product, the inflation-adjusted measure of all goods 
and services produced for the three months ended June 30, surpassed 
expectations. Most economists had predicted the recession would 
persist with a decrease of an additional 1 percent to 2 percent in 
the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's economy had slipped into recession in early 1998,  
casting a shadow over the bustling territory in its first two years 
under Chinese sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy had contracted at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in  
the first quarter compared with a year earlier. The second-quarter 
expansion, in addition to being 0.5 percent above a year ago, also 
represented a 3 percent seasonally adjusted rise from the first 
quarter, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the first signs of growth, government economist K.Y.  
Tang warned of several potential problems, including a sluggish 
demand for investment and falling consumer prices -- a spooky 
economic phenomenon known as deflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tang said the rebound should continue through the second  
half of the year in the former British colony. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth is another encouraging sign that Asia's financial  
fortunes are turning around. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in a move that could stifle any recovery, Hong Kong  
banks raised interest rates by a quarter point late today, matching 
a move by the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	And not everyone in town is convinced things are getting much  
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all look to the future with optimism, but we are nowhere  
near recovery. The people in Hong Kong are not certain about a lot 
of things, and the government is still perceived as being 
rudderless,'' said William Lau, a Jaguar automobile dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong has seen much of its industrial base crumble as its  
old manufacturing jobs moved to cheaper locations in mainland 
China. However, it remains a huge financial center and retains a 
vital role as a conduit for Chinese exports to the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the current rebound has been attributed to a rise in  
exports, which could run into troubles depending on the economic 
conditions in the United States, Japan and Europe, Tang said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	And Hong Kong's recovery could be stifled by tensions between  
Taiwan and China that were recently exacerbated by Taiwanese 
President Lee Teng-hui's affirmation of statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment has fallen to 6 percent from the record 6.3 percent  
that was recorded for the rolling three-month period that ended on 
May 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer prices have continued to fall, dropping by an annual  
rate of 5.5 percent in July, the ninth straight month of decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market came under serious pressure in mid-1998 as  
well, prompting the government to take the controversial step of 
stepping in and buying billions worth of shares, saying it needed 
to drive out speculators who were trying to harm stock prices and 
the Hong Kong dollar.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Swing 3-Way Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Steve Francis got his trade wish, and the Houston  
Rockets got a young dynamo they hope can help their three aging 
superstars return to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	In an 11-player deal that was the largest in NBA history,  
Vancouver added some much-needed depth in return for the rights to 
Francis, picked No. 2 overall in the June draft but adamant in 
vowing not to play in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel so relieved and so at peace because I've always thought  
about playing on a good team,'' Francis said Friday night in an 
interview with KRIV-TV. ``With three Hall of Fame players on the 
team, I'm in a position to help myself and not have a lot of 
pressure on me to come in my first year and do a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockets vice president Carroll Dawson said the team hadn't  
spoken with Francis as of Friday night, but that he and coach Rudy 
Tomjanovich were confident of signing the former Maryland star. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think in Steve Francis we're probably going to get the most  
exciting player in the draft,'' Tomjanovich said. ``Very explosive, 
great in the open court. Real hard to contain, just a super 
athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the coaches he's been invovled with just love him as a  
kid. He's unselfish, but he's talented. I think he's a very big 
piece looking toward our future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis said the last few days before the trade were difficult  
because so much was made of his desire not to play for Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been called everything from a head case to a type of  
person who is ungrateful, and that's something that's not even 
related to me as a person. As the people of Houston and all over 
the United States get to know me, they'll know I'm a real sensitive 
person, and the things I do come from the heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he brings the Rockets, Francis said ``intensity, a  
defensive presence, an offensive presence and someone willing to 
fit in and not to be the spectacular player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver also sent journeyman forward Tony Massenburg to  
Houston for forwards Othella Harrington and Antoine Carr and guards 
Michael Dickerson and Brent Price. The Rockets also owe the 
Grizzlies one first-round draft pick over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal evolved over two weeks but took a turn Friday morning  
when Orlando got involved, Dawson said. Orlando sent Don McLean and 
a future first-round draft pick to Houston and got from the 
Grizzlies Michael Smith, Lee Mayberry, Rodrick Rhodes and Makhtar 
Ndiaye. The Magic also dealt its 2002 second-round pick to 
Vancouver to round out the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis is projected as the Rockets' starting point guard, with  
Cuttino Mobley possibly moving over to the other guard slot. 
They'll join front-court players Hakeem Olajuwon, Scottie Pippen 
and Charles Barkley, who is expected to re-sign soon with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just see him (Francis) fitting in with all of our players,''  
Tomjanovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson, who rejoins former University of Arizona backcourt  
mate Mike Bibby, will give Vancouver an outside shooting threat. He 
hit over 43 percent of his 3-point attempts -- tied for fourth in 
the NBA -- in his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington, who was Barkley's heir apparent entering his fourth  
season with the Rockets, is expected to bolster the Grizzlies' 
rebounding. Price will fill Mayberry's shoes as back-up point 
guard, while Carr will get some time coming off the bench as a 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``This deal gives us two young talented players and two veteran  
NBA experienced players,'' said Stu Jackson, Grizzlies president 
and general manager. ``We improve our outside shooting, athleticism 
and provide overall team depth and add some veteran leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On draft night, Francis showed he was unhappy at being picked by  
Vancouver. He later explained his initial reluctance was because he 
didn't want to move so far away from his Maryland home and his 
grandmother, who has raised him since the death of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Contract talks between Francis' agent, Jeff Fried, and Vancouver  
were termed as being ``heated'' by Jackson, who said he made 
numerous attempts to deal the disgruntled prospect since draft day. 
Francis was expected to announce at a news conference this week 
that he would refuse to play for the Grizzlies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies, who finished with an NBA-worst 8-42 record last  
year, addressed a number of their needs in the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver also signed veteran free agent forward Dennis Scott in  
an unrelated deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dennis is a proven NBA long-range shooter. In addition to his  
great knowledge of the game, Dennis has the ability to pass the 
ball which will help our team.''

<P>
	ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) -- Shipping company Federal Express has  
closed its office in Antigua amid an employee protest on sick pay.

closed that day. Office employees lost their jobs and will receive 
severance pay, the statement said. It did not say how many were 
employed at the office.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended the week lower  
Friday, with many investors taking profits on the back of an 
overnight slump on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell to  
66.92 points, or 0.38 percent, at 17,599.37 points. On Thursday, 
the average closed down 188.87 points, or 1.06 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei average closed lower amid worries that domestic  
investors could start selling ahead of the end of the first half of 
the fiscal year on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the small rebound in the U.S. dollar against the Japanese  
yen kept the stock market higher much of Friday. An overly strong 
yen tends to hurt Japanese companies that count on exports for 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also got a lift from news that spending by Japanese  
wage earners in July was up 2.6 percent in real terms from a year 
earlier. Economists had estimated that spending would rise 0.4 
percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 111.44 yen by late  
afternoon, up 0.38 yen from its level of 111.06 yen late Thursday 
in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 111.54 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks slumped on profit-taking following the fall on  
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 127.59 
points to 11,198.45 at Thursday's close after setting a record high 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 225.25 points, or 1.67 percent, closing at 
13,383.13. On Thursday, the index gained 129.25 points, or 1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong shares also fell on expectations of a rise in local  
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, Hong Kong banks announced after the closure of the  
market that they were raising their best lending rates to 8.50 
percent from 8.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks also raised their savings deposit rate by a quarter  
point to 3.75 percent in a move to match a quarter-point rate rise 
by the U.S. Federal Reserve earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was thin as many investors stayed on the sidelines to  
await government data on Hong Kong's economic growth in the second 
quarter. The government announced later that the territory's 
economy grew by 0.5 percent in the second quarter, pulling out of a 
drawn-out recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine stocks fell as investors ignored better-than-expected  
second quarter economic data and focused instead on a possible 
increase in domestic interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected companies  
dropped 15.47 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,221.24. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine government announced Friday that the nation's  
gross national product expanded 3.8 percent and the gross domestic 
product grew 3.6 percent in the second quarter, largely because of 
improved agricultural production and a rejuvenated manufacturing 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower for the second consecutive  
session as Thursday losses in U.S. stock markets damped sentiment. 
The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 43.60 points, or 
0.5 percent, to 8,053.97. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices closed lower on concerns over a  
fee-payment scandal involving Bank Bali and the ruling political 
party, and instability in Ambon and Aceh provinces and East Timor. 
The Composite Index fell 1.5 percent, or or 8.846 points, to 
572.667. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly higher. The  
NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 2.72 points, or 0.12 percent, to 
2,147.37. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed broadly lower, with  
losses across mining and energy stocks largely outpacing those in 
other industry groups. The All Ordinaries Index closed at 3,020.2, 
down 25.9 points, or 0.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed. The main Korea Composite Stock  
Price Index edged up 0.40 point to 960.28. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed lower. The Singapore Straits  
Times Index fell 7.91 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,154.63.

trading. The main Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip 
stocks, rose 3.04 points, or 0.4 percent, to 764.79. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Steve Francis Calls Off Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP)-- Disgruntled draft pick Steve  
Francis called off a news conference scheduled for today in his 
hometown of Takoma Park, Md., amid reports that he was about to be 
traded from the Grizzlies to the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman at Edelman Public Relations in New York confirmed  
the change of plans but said she did not know the reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver and the Rockets reportedly have agreed to a 10-player  
trade, believed to be the largest in NBA history. The Grizzlies 
said they would have a news conference this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver picked Francis second overall in June's NBA draft but  
were unable to persuade him to move to Canada, away from his close 
family ties in Maryland and the grandmother who raised him after 
his mother died of cancer in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN, KRIV-TV of Houston and several broadcast outlets in  
Vancouver reported Thursday night that the trade would be announced 
today after it is approved by the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Television reports said the Grizzlies would send Francis, Tony  
Massenburg, Lee Mayberry, Makhtar Ndiaye, Rodrick Rhodes and 
Michael Smith to the Rockets. Houston would give up Antoine Carr, 
Michael Dickerson, Othella Harrington and Brent Price and a future 
first-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis averaged 17 points last season at Maryland, shooting  
52.3 per cent from the field. He also averaged 2.8 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	Massenburg is a 6-foot-9 forward who had to play center most of  
the year after Bryant Reeves showed up at camp out of shape, then 
suffered a season-ending knee injury. Massenburg averaged 11.2 
points and six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayberry, a 6-1 guard, played in only nine games due to a foot  
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-8 Smith played in 48 games last year, averaging 7.3  
rebounds and 4.8 points. Ndiaye, another 6-8 forward, spent most of 
the year on Vancouver's practice roster, while Rhodes, a 6-6 guard, 
came from Houston in exchange for Sam Mack.

<HEADLINE> Forest Service Worker Drops Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Forest Service worker who accused a paint  
company of concealing the presence of banned chemicals in tree 
paint has dropped her lawsuit against the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Carla Tipton of Baker City, Ore., dropped the suit last week, in  
part because the Forest Service has switched to water-based paint 
instead of the oil-based paint that Tipton and other employees said 
was causing health problems for workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a significant factor in the decision not to pursue  
further court action,'' said Adam Berger, an attorney for Tipton. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Berger said some Forest Service officials were  
prepared to testify that the paint met agency standards, while the 
suit alleged that Niles Chemical knew the paint contained chemicals 
prohibited under government specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Niles Chemical Paint Co. officials in Niles, Mich., said the  
dropped lawsuit vindicates the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that Ms. Tipton dropped this matter without any  
settlement from us certainly confirms that the allegations in this 
case were completely groundless,'' said M. Sherman Drew, general 
counsel for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal health study last year concluded that hundreds of  
female Forest Service employees who worked with herbicides or 
special paint to mark trees for logging were at an increased risk 
of miscarriage. But the National Institute of Occupational Safety 
and Health study stopped short of blaming the paint for 
miscarriages or other health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Tipton, a timber sale officer at Wallowa Whitman National  
Forest, filed the federal lawsuit last year in Tacoma, Wash., 
seeking millions of dollars in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	A Forest Service spokesman declined to comment on the case.  
Calls to Tipton's home rang unanswered Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service, citing concerns about possible health risks,  
switched from oil-based to water-based paint in May. Niles Chemical 
makes the new paint for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Forest Service has been slow to ship the new paint  
to forests, leading to a failure to mark trees for harvest. Timber 
sales therefore are running behind schedule by as much as 25 
percent.

<HEADLINE> 4 Amish Released From Iowa Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDEPENDENCE, Iowa (AP) -- Four Amish inmates jailed for  
vandalizing a neighbor's farm were released early in part because 
officials feared they were being spoiled by modern conveniences 
such as plumbing and electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we better get them out of here because they were  
getting too used to it,'' said Buchanan County jail administrator 
Russell West. ``I think we were ruining them here. 
</P>
<P>
	``The TV, the electric light, telephone and running water -- I  
think they were starting to like it here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four pleaded guilty to third-degree criminal mischief and  
were sentenced in May to 90 days in jail. They were released Aug. 
19 after serving 72 days. 
</P>
<P>
	About 400 of Hazleton's 700 residents are Amish -- the  
second-largest Old Order settlement in Iowa. Hazleton is about 20 
miles west of Waterloo. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Order Amish families have no electricity, no telephones and  
no other modern conveniences. They ride horse-drawn buggies instead 
of automobiles and scorn snaps or zippers in their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Kauffman, Andy Herschberger, William Gingerich -- all 19  
-- and 18-year-old Vernon Detweiler vandalized buildings and 
equipment early March 15 at the farm of Roman Raber. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmates were part of a group of young Amish who apparently  
thought Raber had told authorities about an underage drinking party 
that evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies said windows and doors were broken, two  
buggies were overturned and smashed, and curtains, antiques and 
other items in the house were damaged as the Raber family huddled 
in fear inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The four showed no such rowdiness while in jail, leaving each  
weekday for work-release programs and on Sunday to attend church. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hardly knew they were here,'' West said. ``They never  
complained, they never asked for anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West said he typically recommends early release for prisoners  
who do not break jail rules, especially those who are successful on 
work-release programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amish prisoners mixed well with the other inmates, except on  
the jail's basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Amish were good, really good, and some of the other guys  
wouldn't play with them,'' West said.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Certifies 15 Div. I Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The NCAA on Thursday classified 15 Division  
I schools as fully certified and two others, Jacksonville State and 
Sam Houston State, as certified with conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Certification, required for all Division I members, was mandated  
at the association's convention in 1993. Since then, 273 of the 310 
schools in the largest NCAA division have received certification 
that they operate their athletic programs in conformity with NCAA 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	A conditional certification means the school is in substantial  
conformity but has had problems that must be corrected before full 
certification is granted. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA Committee on Athletics Certification said Jacksonville  
State must submit by June 1, 2000, a plan on gender equity and 
minority opportunities in its sports programs. By March 1, 2000, 
Sam Houston State must account for all money raised and spent by 
the university's Lettermen's Association. 
</P>
<P>
	If a school fails to meet the deadline for correcting a problem,  
the NCAA may place it in a restricted membership category for one 
year. If the problem still exists after one year, the school may be 
stripped of active membership in the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools have 15 days to request a hearing before the  
certification committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 15 given full certification on Thursday is Virginia  
Tech, whose status was upgraded from certified with conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The others are Arkansas-Little Rock, California-Irvine,  
Connecticut, Indiana-Purdue-Indianapolis, Indiana State, 
Mississippi, Norfolk State, Northern Arizona, Penn State, Purdue, 
Robert Morris, Toledo, Virginia Commonwealth and Wofford.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 108.28 to 11,090.17 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Friday after Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan voiced concern over the highly valued stock 
market, striking fear in investors who interpreted the remarks as a 
sign the Fed isn't finished raising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the quietest trading day of 1999, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 108.28 at 11,090.17. The Dow ended just 
10 points below last Friday's close, wrapping up a week in which 
the blue-chips soared to record highs on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 13.74 to 1,348.27, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 15.72 
to 2,758.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, speaking at a Kansas City Federal Reserve bank  
meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyo., said the extraordinary rise in stock 
prices the last five years has been mostly inexplicable. He 
suggested the Fed should watch markets carefully, as Americans are 
using their growing stock portfolios to justify spending and other 
financial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not discuss the Fed's Tuesday decision to raise  
short-term interest rates 0.25 percent. The rate increase heartened 
many investors as the Fed hinted that it may be enough to keep 
inflation on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's speech, however, unsettled investors who recalled  
Greenspan's previous concerns about the stock market. In December 
1996 he caused a sharp, brief selloff in markets around the world 
by wondering aloud whether investors were in the grip of 
``irrational exuberance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The presumption is he thinks the stock market is too high and  
is contributing to overheating the economy, which could cause 
inflation,'' said David Orr, chief economist at First Union Capital 
Markets Group in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	But some economists took a different view.  
</P>
<P>
	``Greenspan's comments seemed to be more of a lecture on the  
role of the central bank than a guarantee of what the Fed might do 
in the near future,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at 
Fahnestock &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Greenspan's remarks carried extra weight in a  
quiet session with little other market-moving news. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is especially volatile today due to the light  
volume,'' Ackerman said. ``Many traders are away until after Labor 
Day.'' Composite volume on the New York Stock Exchange came to 
687.98 million shares, well below this year's previous low of 
720.01 million shares that changed hands on Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	A report from the Commerce Department offered a sign that the  
economy is growing moderately. Personal spending rose 0.4 percent 
in July, below analysts' expecations. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal income rose a slower-than-expected 0.2 percent last  
month. The gain, the smallest this year, followed a strong 0.7 
percent increase in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's biggest decliners included AT&AMP;T, down 2 7/16 at 47 1/2,  
American Express, down 2 9/16 at 144 5/8, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, off 
2 1/4 at 102 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett Packard defied the weakness in blue-chips, rising 2 to  
104 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit, a leading maker of personal finance software, rose 8  
3/16 to 91 1/16 after the company said it narrowed its losses in 
the recent quarter to 26 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by First 
Call/Thomson Financial had predicted a loss of 33 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest Airlines shares fell 2 7/16 to 29 1/2 after flight  
attendants late Thursday rejected a five-year contract offer. Also, 
a Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette analyst downgraded his recommendation 
on the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.57 to 432.45.  
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.5 percent.  
Germany's DAX index gained 0.6 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained 
0.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.3 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Denies Brown Threatened Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Domestic violence charges against Hall of  
Fame football star Jim Brown are based on lies his wife made out of 
frustration because she believed he was having an affair, his 
defense attorney said in opening statements Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wanted to get a reaction from Jim. She wanted to do  
something dramatic,'' said William Graysen. ``Monique's whole story 
was made up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Brown on June 15 after his wife, Monique Brown,  
called 911 following an argument with her husband at their Beverly 
Hills home. She later denied she was ever in danger or threatened 
by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	The city attorney's domestic violence unit decided to go ahead  
and prosecute Brown. City attorney's officials said that two-thirds 
of domestic violence victims seen by the unit recant their stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors charge that Brown threatened to kill his wife during  
the argument and that he shattered windows of her car with a 
shovel. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who pleaded innocent, has alleged that police forced his  
wife to say she was abused. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 63, is on trial for one count of making terrorist threats  
and one count of vandalism, both misdemeanors. Four women and eight 
men were picked Friday to serve as jurors in the trial set to 
resume Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Grace Lee countered Graysen's remarks with the  
contention that Monique Brown was abused previously by the 
defendant, but the June 15 argument was the first time she called 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Brown, 25, was choked on one occasion and in another  
sustained a black eye, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of you recognize him as an athlete ... but this case is  
about the private individual Jim Brown and the acts of violence he 
committed,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown told reporters as he entered the court Friday that he was  
being targeted because of who he is. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say they don't give celebrities special privileges. But  
we would not be here over a month if it was anyone else,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Brown sat in the front row of the courtroom during  
opening arguments Friday while her husband sat with his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Brown has said previously she called 911 because she was  
angry and ``was trying to get leverage.'' There was no emergency, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	As she entered the court with her husband Friday she told  
reporters she ``made one mistake'' and ``didn't create all this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Brown could be sentenced to 18 months in jail,  
three years' probation and ordered to complete domestic violence 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown retired from pro football in 1966. He set many National  
Football League rushing and scoring records as a running back for 
the Cleveland Browns. He has also appeared in Hollywood movies, 
including ``The Dirty Dozen'' and ``Mars Attacks!''

<HEADLINE> Packers' Chmura Not Ready To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Green Bay Packers tight end Mark Chmura  
says he's not ready to retire as a result of a neck injury that 
temporarily caused him to lose feeling in his upper body. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, if the doctors said I should retire, then I would.  
But everything I hear is great, so I'm continuing,'' Chmura told 
The Post-Crescent of Appleton in Friday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura has a bulging cervical disc in his neck. The tight end's  
agent, Eric Metz, said he and Chmura's wife, Lynda, have suggested 
to the 30-year-old three-time Pro Bowl selection that he retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Metz has represented former Detroit Lions offensive lineman Mike  
Utley, who was paralyzed in a 1991 game and uses a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm encouraging Mark to retire,'' Metz said. ``But I don't  
think he will. ... Mark is more tough than he is prudent when it 
comes to football. He's a player. He wants to play, but I wish he'd 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys love to play,'' Metz added. ``I guarantee you, if  
Mike Utley could get out of his wheelchair, the first thing he'd do 
is run to the football field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura, an eight-year NFL veteran, lost feeling in his upper  
body Aug. 5 when he was hit by defensive end Vaughn Booker. He 
continued to practice until his back locked up Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking three days off, Chmura experienced the same loss of  
sensation the morning of Aug. 12, when he was on his knees striking 
a blocking sled. Chmura continues to recover and he is not ruling 
himself out of playing in the final exhibition game against Miami 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark has gotten great care and we do trust the Packers,'' Metz  
said. ``But it still makes me nervous. I just don't think he should 
be running around in a helmet crashing into 300-pound guys right 
now with a bad neck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura said he won't start contact until he is sure he is  
healthy. He admitted that retirement was his first thought when he 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Ray Rhodes and general manager Ron Wolf have said Chmura  
won't be pushed to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark will be back when he's ready,'' Rhodes said this week.  
``His health is the most important thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Metz said he doesn't want Chmura to play until he is completely  
ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may still have to retire,'' Metz said. ``He's not out of  
the woods yet.''

<HEADLINE>  Steve Francis Calls Off Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP)-- Disgruntled draft pick Steve  
Francis called off a news conference scheduled for today in his 
hometown of Takoma Park, Md., amid reports that he was about to be 
traded from the Grizzlies to the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman at Edelman Public Relations in New York confirmed  
the change of plans but said she did not know the reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver and the Rockets reportedly have agreed to a 10-player  
trade, believed to be the largest in NBA history. The Grizzlies 
said they would have a news conference this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver picked Francis second overall in June's NBA draft but  
were unable to persuade him to move to Canada, away from his close 
family ties in Maryland and the grandmother who raised him after 
his mother died of cancer in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN, KRIV-TV of Houston and several broadcast outlets in  
Vancouver reported Thursday night that the trade would be announced 
today after it is approved by the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Television reports said the Grizzlies would send Francis, Tony  
Massenburg, Lee Mayberry, Makhtar Ndiaye, Rodrick Rhodes and 
Michael Smith to the Rockets. Houston would give up Antoine Carr, 
Michael Dickerson, Othella Harrington and Brent Price and a future 
first-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis averaged 17 points last season at Maryland, shooting  
52.3 per cent from the field. He also averaged 2.8 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	Massenburg is a 6-foot-9 forward who had to play center most of  
the year after Bryant Reeves showed up at camp out of shape, then 
suffered a season-ending knee injury. Massenburg averaged 11.2 
points and six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayberry, a 6-1 guard, played in only nine games due to a foot  
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-8 Smith played in 48 games last year, averaging 7.3  
rebounds and 4.8 points. Ndiaye, another 6-8 forward, spent most of 
the year on Vancouver's practice roster, while Rhodes, a 6-6 guard, 
came from Houston in exchange for Sam Mack.

	KINCHELOE, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian was transferred  
Friday from a maximum-security prison to a medium-security one, 
given the convicted killer's successful adjustment to life behind 
bars, prison officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without fanfare, Kevorkian was moved from the Oaks Correctional  
Facility in Eastlake to the Kinross Correctional Facility in this 
Upper Peninsula community. 
</P>
<P>
	The retired pathologist has served five months of his 10- to  
25-year sentence for his second-degree murder conviction in last

</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, 71, won't be eligible for parole until May 2007.  
</P>
<P>
	``The prisoner has made a successful transition to confinement,  
based upon his (time) at the Oaks, and better serves the taxpayers 
of the state by being placed at Kinross,'' Michigan Department of 
Corrections Director Bill Martin said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Study: Risk Low From Colo. Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- An exhaustive study on cancer risks from secret  
radioactive and chemical releases at the former Rocky Flats nuclear 
weapons plant found no great danger to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is the risks at Rocky Flats were low, and the  
public was lucky that this was the case,'' said James LaVelle, a 
consulting toxicologist on the study. ``Many of the releases and 
risks could have been much worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, there were information gaps in the nine-year study --  
the result of the defense industry's secrecy and lack of government 
oversight, particularly in the early years of the Cold War, 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't even know where all the stuff is. We don't have a  
record of where they buried some of the barrels,'' said Niels 
Schonbeck, a panel member and biochemistry professor at 
Metropolitan State College in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The study released Thursday is the largest yet of public risks  
from releases at Rocky Flats in the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said people with the highest risk of cancer were  
working outside the plant when smoke spread plutonium during a 1957 
fire. The risk was estimated from as high as one case in 10,000 to 
one in 25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, 15 miles northwest of downtown Denver, began  
producing plutonium bombs and bomb parts in 1952. State officials 
in the 1980s raised concerns about potential health hazards, and 
the plant was closed after the FBI raided it in 1989 to investigate 
allegations of environmental crimes. 
</P>

	The 1957 fire was kept secret until 1969, the same year another  
fire released plutonium into the environment. Also, 1,000 to 5,000 
tons of a chemical solvent leaked through air vents and waste 
barrels during the 1960s, the study found.

<P>
	Members of the state advisory panel that oversaw the study  
cautioned there are still potential risks because of the $7 billion 
state and federal cleanup, estimated to take 12 years.

<P>
	Some grand jurors denounced the government's failure to issue  
indictments, putting out a scathing report on its investigation. 
But the report was sealed. An edited version later became public.

Rockwell to pay $18.5 million in federal fines, but no individuals 
were charged.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Probes Convict's Job Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A waste company that refused to hire a  
convicted murderer may be forced to give him a job if a judge finds 
it discriminated against him because of his criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Turner, called the ``Halloween Killer'' for the sexual  
assault and murder of a 9-year-old in October 1973, has filed a 
discrimination complaint against the Waste Management center. 
Turner said he was refused a job sorting recyclables because of his 
criminal convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigator with the Department of Workforce Development  
found evidence that Turner may have been discriminated against to 
justify a hearing before an administrative law judge on Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``If (Turner) were considered unsuitable for the position of  
sorting recyclables, it would then appear that he could be lawfully 
excluded from every other job dealing with other people and with 
most if not all objects,'' the officer, Charles Phelan, wrote in 
his report. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin is one of 10 states that bars employers from  
considering convictions when hiring, unless the crime is 
``substantially related'' to the job being applied for. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Waste Management noted that students and scout  
troops regularly tour the plant. There were 15 tours by children 
during the last school year. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials also told investigators the job would give  
Turner access to ``dangerous materials and weapons, used hypodermic 
needles, and BB guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Phelan said in his report that Waste Management employs  
other people who had been convicted of battery, robbery and 
disorderly conduct who have access to the same materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management spokeswoman Lynn Morgan said Thursday the  
company could not comment on ongoing litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Waste Management's policy is to comply with all applicable  
employment laws regarding people with criminal records,'' she said. 
``Decisions regarding those individuals are made on a case-by-case 
basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner, 49, was convicted of second-degree murder, child  
enticement and sexual assault of a child in the death of Lisa Ann 
French. He was released from prison in 1992 and remains on parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner was unavailable for comment Thursday, according to an  
official at the halfway house where he lives. His attorney did not 
return telephone calls seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Indians Acquire Baines from Orioles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Needing a left-handed bat as they prepare for  
the postseason, the Cleveland Indians acquired Harold Baines from 
the Baltimore Orioles on Friday for a minor league pitcher and a 
player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians, who tried to get Baines before the July 31 trading  
deadline, claimed both the 40-year-old and right-hander Scott 
Erickson off waivers on Thursday and had until 1 p.m. Friday to 
make a deal with the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland backed off on Erickson because Baltimore wanted too  
much in return and opted to pick up Baines for right-handed pitcher 
Juan Aracena. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harold is a professional hitter who gives us more options,''  
Indians manager Mike Hargrove said Friday before Cleveland opened a 
three-game series against Tampa Bay. ``We were able to bring in a 
veteran hitter with postseason experience. Given our injury 
situation, I think it's a very good deal. I think he'll be a big, 
big plus for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baines, whose plane arrived just 1 1/2 hours before game time, was  
in the starting lineup at designated hitter and batting fifth. He 
barely had time to get dressed before he batted in the first 
inning, and he hit a two-run single off the wall in left-center to 
put the Indians up 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said he would work Baines into a rotation with Richie  
Sexson, David Justice and Jim Thome at DH for the rest of the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a platoon situation,'' Hargrove said. ``We'll rotate  
them and they'll all get their at-bats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baines, a 19-year veteran, has made the most of his 345 at-bats  
with the Orioles this year. Used exclusively at DH, he's hitting 
.322 (111-for-345) with 24 homers and 81 RBIs in 107 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harold is a great person who doesn't talk a lot but goes about  
his business. He just hits,'' said Indians second baseman Roberto 
Alomar, Baines' teammate in Baltimore last season. ``He goes out 
there year after year and quietly just keeps putting up great 
numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baines is eligible to become a free agent after the season, and  
has expressed his desire to remain in Baltimore. So the Indians may 
be just getting him as a postseason rental if Baines decides to 
re-sign with the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	``From our perspective, it's sad to see him go,'' Baltimore GM  
Frank Wren said. ``But this is a great chance for Harold to get 
into the World Series, and we wish him the best of luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With designated hitter/outfielder Wil Cordero still recovering  
from a broken wrist, Cleveland had been shopping for another 
quality hitter for the playoffs. The Indians could face 
right-handers such as Pedro Martinez, David Cone, Roger Clemens and 
Orlando Hernandez in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good hitter but once again, it's going to come down to  
pitching,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``You can have only 
nine guys in the lineup who can beat your brains out. He'll add to 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baines, who began his career in 1980 with the Chicago White Sox,  
is a .292 career hitter with 372 homers, 1,561 RBIs and 2,760 hits. 
He is currently tied with Cal Ripken Jr. for first among active 
players in career RBIs. He's third in games played and fifth in 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been around long enough that I played against him,''  
Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Cleveland's pitching staff decimated by injuries, Indians  
general manager John Hart has been looking for another starter and 
talked with the Orioles about Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said Erickson's $26 million, four-year wasn't an issue, but  
that the Orioles wanted too much talent in return: Jaret Wright and 
Richie Sexson, according to another team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Close doesn't even count,'' Hart said when asked if he nearly  
made a deal. ``Either you do or you don't. We were unable to do 
anything more than Harold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart couldn't pull off a big deal at the trading deadline to  
help the Indians, mainly because of the team's injury problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've added a professional player, a professional bat,'' Hart  
said. ``And as we get healthy it will add a lot of depth to our 
ballclub as we go down the stretch.''

<HEADLINE> Injury Subdues Jordan Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Brian Jordan's first trip to St. Louis as a  
visiting player started out more low key than he had anticipated -- 
until the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who left the Cardinals after six seasons to sign a $40  
million, five-year contract with Atlanta, didn't start the series 
opener Friday night because of a sore right wrist but scored in the 
winning run in Atlanta's 2-1 victory after entering as a pinch 
runner in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job was easy,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who doesn't expect to start until Sunday, wasn't happy  
about getting booed. He had wanted to re-sign with the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard some money comments out there,'' Jordan said.  
``They're not thinking at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game Jordan said he had no hard feelings for the  
Cardinals, who made no effort to re-sign him, citing his injury 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all behind me,'' said Jordan, hitting .295 with 22  
homers and 100 RBIs. ``I've moved on and I've matured as a player. 
I never burn bridges. Maybe I'll be back here later in my career, 
so I wish them well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several hours before the game, Jordan visited with several  
Cardinals players just outside the St. Louis clubhouse. Manager 
Tony La Russa also came out to shake his hand and ask with fingers 
obviously crossed: ``Gonna miss all three games?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said he missed the St. Louis fans.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Atlanta fans are great, but not as good as here,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan had three cortisone shots earlier this week for the  
injury, caused when he was hit by a pitch. He fears the bone is 
chipped. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's an unfortunate thing, but I'll just try to play through  
it,'' Jordan said. ``I've got to get it right for September because 
these are important games.''

<HEADLINE> Organ Network Shelves Liver Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The network that runs the nation's organ  
transplant system is ordering four Midwestern states to put on hold 
a plan to share livers among themselves because they would exclude 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota had agreed  
to share livers among their sickest patients. But national policy 
set by the United Network for Organ Sharing this summer directs 
that livers be shared among all the sickest patients in an 
established region, which in this case includes those states plus 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago, with six liver transplant programs, has many sick  
patients and could easily end up taking many more livers than it 
gives to its neighbors, who have some of the nation's strongest 
organ donation programs. 
</P>
<P>
	In shelving the four-state plan Friday, the network said it  
would impose a system for Illinois to pay back the other states for 
the organs it takes. The states were ordered to go into a ``formal 
conflict resolution process.'' The network did not provide any 
details of the payback system. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute reflects the larger national debate over organ  
policy. The Clinton administration has been trying to force the 
transplant community to send organs to the sickest patients first, 
without regard to the geographic barriers that have governed 
allocation policy since transplants began. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois argues that it has a right to its neighboring states'  
livers, so long as it has patients who are in most need. Wisconsin 
and Minnesota say they will share only if Illinois promises to pay 
back a liver for every one it takes. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of the four-state plan viewed Friday's decision as a  
victory because it would force Illinois to compensate its neighbors 
for the livers it gets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always maintained we were willing to share with  
Illinois, so long as it was fair sharing,'' said Dr. Anthony 
D'Alessandro, the director of multi-organ transplantation at the 
University of Wisconsin. ``We are elated, quite frankly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the four-state sharing policy needed formal approval by  
the network, participants had signaled their plans to move ahead 
with it in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're saying put all that stuff on hold for now,'' said Bob  
Spieldenner, a network spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was made by the network's executive committee, which  
met over a conference call Friday.

<HEADLINE> Founder of Medical Schools Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Dr. George T. Harrell, the founding dean of  
medical schools at the University of Florida and Pennsylvania State 
University, has died. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrell died Thursday at Duke University Hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	He was an innovator in physician training, emphasizing  
understanding and caring for the patient as a whole. He advocated 
training students in small groups to prepare them for work in 
health teams and created the first medical school programs in 
humanities, family and community medicine, and behavioral science. 
</P>
<P>
	Most medical schools offer programs in the humanities today.  
</P>
<P>
	Harrell was recruited by the University of Florida in 1954 to  
develop its college of medicine. The school opened with a new 
college of nursing in 1956. He left Florida for Pennsylvania in 
1964 after chocolate magnate Milton S. Hershey pledged $50 million 
for a hospital and medical school to be affiliated with Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	``His byword was hearts and handbags,'' said Dr. C. McCollister  
Evarts, Penn State's dean. ``He understood the value of family 
practice well before its time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A graduate of the medical school at Duke University, Harrell  
retired to North Carolina in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by two sons and four grandchildren.  
</P>
<P>
	No funeral was planned. Plans for memorial services were  
pending.

<HEADLINE> Cadillac Unveils Redesigned Logo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- For the first time in 36 years, Cadillac is  
modifying its familiar wreath-and-crest logo in another step to 
shake its stodgy image. 
</P>
<P>
	While the changes to the historic emblem are small, Cadillac's  
leader says they show how committed the automaker is to luring 
younger buyers into its showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new wreath and crest depicts a forward-looking and  
youthful image while maintaining distinctiveness and a sense of 
prestige,'' John F. Smith, Cadillac general manager, said in a 
statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The logo's changes include eliminating the six birds, called  
merlettes, in the crest, as well as the crown, or coronet, on top. 
The wreath surrounding the crest also is being streamlined. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is a design that evokes paintings by Piet Mondrian,  
the Dutch abstract painter who used blocks of primary colors. It's 
also meant to evoke the ``art and science'' styling theme from the 
edgy Evoq roadster concept car on display at this year's major auto 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The logo won't appear on passenger cars from the luxury division  
of General Motors Corp. until 2001. But it has already shown up on 
one Cadillac -- the company's entry in this year's Le Mans 24 Hours 
race, its first in half a century. 
</P>
<P>
	The new logo will also be used in some advertising later this  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac's recent efforts to woo young drivers has been less  
than successful. Sales of the imported Catera entry-level sedan 
have been a disappointment, while demand for the larger Seville, 
redesigned for the '98 model year, was down 23 percent in the first 
half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year ended with the ultimate humiliation: Cadillac lost the  
U.S. luxury sales crown it had held for 48 years to rival Ford 
Motor Co.'s Lincoln division -- largely because of Lincoln's popular 
sport utility vehicle, the Navigator. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first half of this year, Cadillac's U.S. car sales  
declined 15 percent while overall luxury car sales increased 7 
percent. Including SUV sales, Cadillac now trails Lexus, 
Mercedes-Benz and BMW -- all of which are benefiting from fresher, 
more innovative models. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac hopes to change that starting with the redesigned  
Escalade, which will debut in 2001 for Cadillac's centennial model 
year of 2002. That will be followed by several new models, 
including an all-new, car-based SUV and the limited-production 
Evoq.

<HEADLINE> Experts Search for Water in Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Having found water in a 4.5 billion-year-old  
meteorite, NASA scientists are searching for more that may have 
been overlooked in other space rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The water, locked in a purple crystalline mineral called halite  
-- or rock salt -- remained uncontaminated by the Earth's atmosphere 
because scientists studied the meteorite quickly, less than 46 
hours after it fell, said Everett Gibson, the NASA scientist who 
retrieved the space rock last year from the West Texas town of 
Monahans. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson said, ``If one can be recovered quickly, please take care  
of it.'' He advised anyone who finds a new meteorite to wrap it up 
and keep it from moisture. 
</P>
<P>
	While some look to the heavens for further signs of  
extraterrestrial water, other examples may be sitting in display 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going around to museums to look for falls from the past  
that were immediately curated in dry laboratories,'' said Michael 
Zolensky of NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Zolensky, who described the discovery Friday in the journal  
Science, said that older meteorites may still contain water trapped 
deep inside. He has already found a Moroccan asteroid called Zag 
that shows signs of containing water. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monahans meteorite dates back to the birth of the solar  
system, when the sun and planets were a condensing spiral of dust 
and gas. The tiny bubbles found inside provide the first close look 
at water not originating on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've known for some time that there was water in the early  
solar system because we've seen evidence for it,'' Zolensky said. 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of salt is even more mysterious than the water,  
since sodium chloride usually forms when large bodies of water like 
oceans evaporate, Zolensky said. 
</P>
<P>
	The meteorite may be a piece of a larger asteroid that had  
liquid water flowing over its surface. An icy comet could have 
slammed into the asteroid, delivering the water which then boiled 
off very quickly, leaving behind the salt crystals with water 
trapped inside. Another theory is that ice inside an asteroid may 
have been heated by radioactive decay, creating the halite. 
</P>
<P>
	While life beyond Earth remains elusive, the presence of water  
improves the odds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we know from this meteorite that there must have been a  
lot of water around for quite a while and the same meteorites have 
organics. That basically says all the conditions were there for 
getting some biology going,'' Zolensky said. 
</P>
<P>
	While halite is normally clear, the purple crystals found in the  
meteorite likely changed color after being exposed to radiation in 
space. This helps confirm the uncontaminated origin of the water, 
said Robert Bodnar, a professor of geochemistry at Virginia Tech, 
who first confirmed water in the meteorite. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of water is too small to be analyzed in complete  
detail, but new equipment being developed should reveal its origins 
-- whether from the solar system or from interstellar space, Bodnar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	First seen as a bright green streak in the sky above Monahans,  
the 2.2-pound meteorite struck about 40 feet from where seven boys 
were playing basketball on March 22, 1998. Worried that it might be 
radioactive, the boys and their families over turned the rock to 
the fire department. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA scientists arrived soon after and borrowed the rock for a  
few days to study it and take samples. After it was returned to the 
town, the boys challenged the city council's claims that the rock 
fell on public property and belonged to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually the city relented and gave the meteorite to the boys,  
who then sold it to Mike Craddock for $23,000 during an Internet 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Craddock said he wanted ``a piece of West Texas history,'' but  
the new discovery has made his potato-sized rock even more 
important. 
</P>
<P>
	He said when he bought it he ``thought this must be the most  
famous meteorite in the United States. Now that it's the first 
meteorite with water in it, it may be the most famous meteorite in 
the world.''

<HEADLINE>  Johnson: 'I Can Run Faster' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Michael Johnson has the record he craved  
his entire career. Now he wants to break it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Just minutes after shattering the 11-year-old world record in  
the 400 meters with an electrifying time of 43.18 seconds, Johnson 
set his sights on running even faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can do better,'' said Johnson, after winning his fourth  
consecutive 400 title at the World Championships. ``I know I can 
run 42 seconds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That certainly seems possible for the athlete they call  
Superman, perhaps the greatest 400 runner in history. 
</P>
<P>
	The only milestone that had eluded Johnson has been the 400  
record. On Thursday night, he not only broke it -- he destroyed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson shaved .11 seconds off the record of 43.29 set by fellow  
American Butch Reynolds in 1988, the longest standing men's track 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always wanted this record,'' he said. ``It completes the  
circle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a dazzling performance reminiscent of the 1996 Atlanta  
Olympics, where Johnson ran 19.32 seconds to break his own world 
record in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	But Johnson said there's more still to come.  
</P>
<P>
	He compared Thursday's record to when he set his first world  
mark in the 200, clocking 19.66 at the Olympic trials in 1996. Two 
months later in Atlanta, he lowered his record by 0.34 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I broke the 200 record ... and later came back and shattered  
it, and I think I can do the same thing in the (400),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His coach, Clyde Hart, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now that he's broken it, I think he'll do it again,'' Hart  
said. ``He did that in the 200. It just might not be this year. It 
might be next year at the Olympics -- that's a pretty big setting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and Hart sat down at the beginning of the season and  
decided to attack the world record in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	When Johnson ran 43.95 seconds in the semifinals, even after  
shutting down several times in the last 60 meters, it was clear 
that he was poised for the record in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night, coming off the final bend with a big lead,  
Johnson powered down the straight, legs churning in his upright 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulling way ahead of the field, he glanced out of the corner of  
his eye at the trackside clock. When he crossed the line and saw 
the time, Johnson punched the air with his right fist. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson got down one knee, head bowed, then dropped on his back  
for a minute. He got up, grabbed an American flag and took a 
victory lap, soaking up the applause from the near capacity crowd 
in the 60,000 Estadio Olimpico. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's splits for each 100 were approximately 10.9, 10.1,  
11.3 and 11.9. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second time in 31 years that the 400 record has  
been broken. Lee Evans' record of 43.86, set at the 1968 Mexico 
Olympics, stood for 20 years before Reynolds broke it. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is only the second runner to hold both long sprint  
records at the same time. The other was Tommie Smith, who owned the 
220-yard record from 1966-68 and the 440-yard mark from 1967-68. 
</P>
<P>
	The record should silence Johnson's critics, who have questioned  
his withdrawals from meets with injuries and even his reluctance to 
sign autographs before competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year I let (criticism) get to me a little more,'' he  
said. ``But I was able to regroup and get back to what I do best, 
and that's keeping my mouth shut and running on the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Hart: ``If this doesn't answer the critics, I don't know  
what will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The record capped a remarkable decade in which he broke two  
records, became the first man to sweep the 200 and 400 at the same 
Olympic Games (1996), and the first to sweep both long sprints at 
the World Championships (1995). He also won four consecutive world 
titles in the 400 and he won world titles in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	``My next goal is Sydney, and I want to defend both titles,''  
Johnson said. ``Now I have the record and I can concentrate on 
Sydney. I'm looking toward the Olympics now because I do have the 
world records now in both events. 
</P>
<P>
	``That pressure is off. I can focus on just winning the race and  
not think time is running out. I'm getting older, this may the last 
opportunity. I don't have to worry about it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first world record broken at the championships and  
earned Johnson a $100,000 bonus, on top of the $60,000 for the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also tied Carl Lewis for the most gold medals at the  
championships with eight. He can break that record Sunday as the 
anchor on the United States' 1,600-meter relay team in the final 
event of the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's other three finals produced two championship records.  
</P>
<P>
	Maxim Tarasov extended Russia's domination of the men's pole  
vault -- Sergy Bubka won the event at the first six championships -- 
by winning at 19 feet, 9 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopia's Gete Wami, the 1996 Olympic bronze medalist in the  
women's 10,000 meters, took 16 seconds off the championship record, 
beating Britain's Paula Radcliffe by more than two seconds at 
30:24.56. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's other final, Australia's Cathy Freeman, who in  
1997 became the first aboriginal Australian to win a world title, 
won the women's 400 again at 49.67, the second-fastest in the world 
this year.

<HEADLINE> Bush Backs Some Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Less than 10 miles from where a distraught  
day trader killed himself after his bloody shooting spree left nine 
dead, Texas Gov. George W. Bush called gun-control measures 
currently being considered by Congress ``reasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate said Friday he agrees with  
banning certain large ammunition clips and raising the legal age 
for gun ownership from 18 to 21. Bush also repeated his support for 
instant background checks on firearms sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are all reasonable measures,'' the GOP front-runner told  
reporters after touring a homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments came after several violent episodes in metropolitan  
Atlanta over the past three months, culminating in Mark O. Barton's 
shooting spree in two Atlanta office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, a sophomore wounded six classmates in a suburban Conyers  
high school, and just two weeks before Barton's rampage a man 
killed two women and four children in their Atlanta home before 
killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has been criticized by Democrats as being soft on gun  
control. He has previously spoken against government-mandated gun 
registration, signed legislation barring cities in Texas from suing 
gun makers, and deemed mandatory child safety locks on firearms 
impractical to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Bush stressed that he still believes in gun rights.  
``I believe innocent people, law-abiding citizens, ought to be 
allowed to own a gun. I believe they ought to be allowed to hunt 
and protect themselves,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that current gun restrictions should be enforced  
more stringently. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ought to be consequences, and those consequences ought  
to be called jail,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Bush picked up approximately $250,000 in campaign  
contributions from a $1,000-a-plate luncheon in nearby Smyrna.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Futures Dip  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Natural gas futures sank Friday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange after storms that had threatened offshore production areas 
moved on or petered out. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil prices rebounded for a second straight day after  
taking a big hit earlier in the week. On other markets, soybean and 
cocoa futures gained. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas saw its first big price dip since June after the  
last immediate storm threat, Hurricane Dennis, was reported to be 
headed for the East Coast and not the Gulf of Mexico as feared. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other storms also were deemed to pose little threat.  
</P>
<P>
	``The weather threat is gone,'' said Bill O'Grady, an energy  
analyst for AG Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis, explaining 
Friday's price falloff. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy, upgraded to a hurricane again late Wednesday, was far out  
in the Atlantic. And Emily -- which sprang up at near-hurricane 
strength Tuesday -- began to lose strength and was downgraded to a 
tropical depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas for September delivery fell 36 cents to $2.87 per  
1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude advanced past the $21-a-barrel level again after falling  
to $20.58 on Wednesday on an industry report that gasoline 
inventories had fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	October crude fell 32 cents to $21.27 a barrel; September  
heating oil rose .05 cent to 55.99 cents a gallon; September 
unleaded gasoline gained 1.88 cents to 66.11 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude for delivery in October rose 19  
cents to $20.76 a barrel at the International Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures pushed higher on the Chicago Board of Trade,  
partly on the strength of forecasts for dry weather for most of the 
soybean belt next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also were buoyed by continued market talk that China is  
in the market for U.S. soybean products and may have bought between 
250,000 tons and 350,000 tons of soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	November soybeans rose 4 1/4 cents to $4.71 a bushel. Grain prices  
were mostly down -- wheat for December delivery fell 4 cents to 
$2.79 1/2 a bushel; December corn rose 1/2 cent to $2.15 1/4 a bushel; 
December oats were unchanged at $1.14 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures rose amid fears that Ivory Coast's moves toward  
free-market policies will result in trouble for growers in 
negotiations with traders. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa officials say that after similar moves Ghana and Cameroon  
have experienced problems with agents pressuring them to harvest 
too early, causing quality to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	September cocoa rose $23 to $895 a ton on the Coffee, Sugar &AMP;  
Cocoa Exchange division of the New York Board of Trade.

<HEADLINE>  500,000 Turks Could Be Homeless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Turkish officials acknowledged for the  
first time today that the number of those left homeless by last 
week's earthquake could top half a million. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is now projecting it will need to build about  
100,000 to 120,000 new homes for quake victims, said Harun Aslan, 
spokesman for the Ministry of Housing and Public Works. With about 
five people per household, that works out to between 500,000 and 
600,000 displaced people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added those figures were still preliminary. Up until now,  
the government has said only that quake homeless numbered in the 
tens of thousands, ranging up to 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	New signs also emerged today that the quake has exacerbated  
friction between Turkey's secular government and religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, highly sensitive about the activities of Islamic  
groups, especially radical organizations that want to topple it, 
froze the bank accounts of two Islamic groups that have been active 
in quake-relief efforts. The two groups -- the Muslim-oriented 
Mazlum Der and another called Human Rights and Freedoms -- 
complained they were being targeted because of their faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction and safety issues remained in the spotlight today.  
The Daily News, a nationally circulated Turkish newspaper, reported 
that three-quarters of Istanbul's buildings, most of them in 
shantytowns ringing the city, are unlicensed and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The monstrous Aug. 17 quake, which killed at least 13,472 people  
and injured 27,164, has focused the public's attention on the 
dangers of shoddy construction. Substandard building has been 
blamed for the collapse of thousands of structures across the quake 
zone and on the outskirts of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva, Ross Mountain, the head of the U.N. humanitarian  
affairs department, said foreign search and rescue teams had been 
``appalled'' by the poor quality of cement and lack of 
reinforcement in collapsed buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Thursday whether unsafe buildings should be torn down  
preemptively, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit seemed wary, saying: 
``It's not that easy to destroy all existing (unsafe) buildings in 
Istanbul entirely.'' However, he said, it is important to prosecute 
those who had previously built unsafe structures, and to improve 
inspections for buildings under construction now. 
</P>
<P>
	Worry that quake-damaged buildings could cause new deaths and  
injury boiled over into violence in at least one case, the Anatolia 
news agency said. It reported Thursday that a shootout left two 
people dead after two families got into a bitter argument because 
the quake-wrecked home of one was leaning onto the home of the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	In the quake zone, a team of at least 400 architects and  
engineers was dispatched to help local authorities decide which 
quake-damaged buildings should be torn down first. In the town of 
Golcuk today, crews marked buildings slated for demolition with a 
large red X. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have urged those whose houses were declared safe to  
return home. But with aftershocks and new quakes continuing to 
rattle the region, the tens of thousands of quake-damaged buildings 
still looming over the city were prompting safety fears. 
</P>
<P>
	Small quakes kept rocking Turkey. A 3.7-magnitude temblor hit  
the ravaged town of Adapazari at 8:35 p.m. Thursday, followed 14 
minutes later by another with a 4.1 magnitude, the Anatolia news 
agency said. There were no reported injuries or damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, a 3.7-magnitude quake shook the central city of Corum  
without causing any reported damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The death toll from the huge quake was expected to climb.  
Thousands of people are believed still buried under the rubble, and 
few if any survivors are expected to be found after this long. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the government announced Thursday that rescue crews  
were still looking for more survivors. It said 621 people had been 
saved from the ruins since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	On Istanbul's volatile stock market, worried investors sent the  
index down by some 10 percent on Thursday -- the first day of 
trading since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to raise part of the estimated $20 billion needed to

percent on corporations, the self-employed and wealthy wage earners 
and adding a 25 percent monthly surcharge on cellular telephones as

<HEADLINE>  500,000 Turks Could Be Homeless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Turkish officials acknowledged for the  
first time today that the number of those left homeless by last 
week's earthquake could top half a million. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is now projecting it will need to build about  
100,000 to 120,000 new homes for quake victims, said Harun Aslan, 
spokesman for the Ministry of Housing and Public Works. With about 
five people per household, that works out to between 500,000 and 
600,000 displaced people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added those figures were still preliminary. Up until now,  
the government has said only that quake homeless numbered in the 
tens of thousands, ranging up to 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	New signs also emerged today that the quake has exacerbated  
friction between Turkey's secular government and religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, highly sensitive about the activities of Islamic  
groups, especially radical organizations that want to topple it, 
froze the bank accounts of two Islamic groups that have been active 
in quake-relief efforts. The two groups -- the Muslim-oriented 
Mazlum Der and another called Human Rights and Freedoms -- 
complained they were being targeted because of their faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction and safety issues remained in the spotlight today.  
The Daily News, a nationally circulated Turkish newspaper, reported 
that three-quarters of Istanbul's buildings, most of them in 
shantytowns ringing the city, are unlicensed and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The monstrous Aug. 17 quake, which killed at least 13,472 people  
and injured 27,164, has focused the public's attention on the 
dangers of shoddy construction. Substandard building has been 
blamed for the collapse of thousands of structures across the quake 
zone and on the outskirts of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva, Ross Mountain, the head of the U.N. humanitarian  
affairs department, said foreign search and rescue teams had been 
``appalled'' by the poor quality of cement and lack of 
reinforcement in collapsed buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Thursday whether unsafe buildings should be torn down  
preemptively, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit seemed wary, saying: 
``It's not that easy to destroy all existing (unsafe) buildings in 
Istanbul entirely.'' However, he said, it is important to prosecute 
those who had previously built unsafe structures, and to improve 
inspections for buildings under construction now. 
</P>
<P>
	Worry that quake-damaged buildings could cause new deaths and  
injury boiled over into violence in at least one case, the Anatolia 
news agency said. It reported Thursday that a shootout left two 
people dead after two families got into a bitter argument because 
the quake-wrecked home of one was leaning onto the home of the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	In the quake zone, a team of at least 400 architects and  
engineers was dispatched to help local authorities decide which 
quake-damaged buildings should be torn down first. In the town of 
Golcuk today, crews marked buildings slated for demolition with a 
large red X. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have urged those whose houses were declared safe to  
return home. But with aftershocks and new quakes continuing to 
rattle the region, the tens of thousands of quake-damaged buildings 
still looming over the city were prompting safety fears. 
</P>
<P>
	Small quakes kept rocking Turkey. A 3.7-magnitude temblor hit  
the ravaged town of Adapazari at 8:35 p.m. Thursday, followed 14 
minutes later by another with a 4.1 magnitude, the Anatolia news 
agency said. There were no reported injuries or damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, a 3.7-magnitude quake shook the central city of Corum  
without causing any reported damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The death toll from the huge quake was expected to climb.  
Thousands of people are believed still buried under the rubble, and 
few if any survivors are expected to be found after this long. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the government announced Thursday that rescue crews  
were still looking for more survivors. It said 621 people had been 
saved from the ruins since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	On Istanbul's volatile stock market, worried investors sent the  
index down by some 10 percent on Thursday -- the first day of 
trading since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to raise part of the estimated $20 billion needed to  
repair the damage, the government has proposed raising taxes by 5 
percent on corporations, the self-employed and wealthy wage earners 
and adding a 25 percent monthly surcharge on cellular telephones as 
well as additional taxes on motor vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals are widely expected to be approved by the full  
assembly, where the coalition government has a strong majority. But 
they have already stirred controversy among those wondering whether 
the new tax money would actually be spent in the quake zone.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks End Down / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen in  
mid-afternoon trading Friday, while Japanese stocks closed lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 111.58 yen in the late morning, up 0.52 yen  
from its level of 111.06 yen late Thursday in Tokyo and also above 
its late New York level of 111.54 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed down 66.92  
points, or 0.38 percent, at 17,599.37 points. On Thursday, the 
average closed down 188.87 points, or 1.06 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was supported by talk in the  
market that deputy finance ministers from the Group of Seven 
nations are set to meet this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are reluctant to sell the dollar aggressively ahead of  
the weekend with vague talk (of) a G-7 deputies meeting,'' said 
Shuji Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO 
Bank in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Upcoming events helped bolster such speculation: Haruhiko  
Kuroda, Japanese vice finance minister for international affairs, 
is planning to attend a meeting of Asian and U.S. finance deputies 
on Sunday and Monday in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the yen's outlook against the dollar remains  
uncertain amid a tug-of-war between continued demand for the 
Japanese currency among global investors to invest in markets here 
and fears of central bank intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has entered the market to buy dollars in  
recent months to stem the yen's rapid rise against the U.S. 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
thus less competitive, cutting into earnings of export-oriented 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 116.96 yen in  
mid-afternoon trading, up from 115.72 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei average closed lower amid  
concern that domestic investors could start selling ahead of the 
end of the first half of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, said Chuck 
Lambert, market analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the small rebound in the dollar against the yen kept the  
stock market higher much of Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also got a lift from news Friday morning that  
spending by Japanese wage earners in July was up 2.6 percent in 
real terms from a year earlier. Economists surveyed had estimated 
on average that spending would rise 0.4 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average fell  
127.59 points to 11,198.45 at Thursday's close after setting a new 
record high Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 2.70 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,478.38. 
The TOPIX closed down 13.72 points, or 0.09 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.9350 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.9400 
percent, driving its price up to 99.70 yen from 99.66 yen.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Creeps Toward the Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis loomed 150 miles east of  
the Bahamas today, stirring up winds and rain that knocked 
furniture into swimming pools and left people fearful for fragile 
trees and plant life that had just begun to recover from Hurricane 
Andrew in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2 a.m. EDT today, Dennis was still packing 80 mph winds as it  
moved west-northwest at about 7 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters predicted that by later today the storm would come  
within 40 miles of Eleuthera island, a 110-mile-long strip of pink 
sand that 8,000 people call home. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, the National Weather Service in Miami  
expanded a hurricane warning to include the entire central Bahamas, 
Eleuthera and the Abacos Islands in the northwest Bahamas. A 
tropical storm warning was in effect for New Providence, Grand 
Bahama and the Berry Islands. Andros and Bimini were under a 
hurricane watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``People still remember Hurricane Andrew here from 1992, so  
we're keeping an eye out for it,'' hotel owner Harcourt Cambridge 
said in the Bahamian capital of Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
	The service also warned residents from Florida to North Carolina  
to ``closely monitor the progress of Dennis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew blew off much of Eleuthera's topsoil and some trees had  
only just begun bearing fruit again, said Gilbert Kemp, local 
government chairman at Hatchet Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Boats in Nassau were hauled out of the harbor, and the governor  
general's official residence was boarded up before a light rain 
started falling Thursday night. One resident, 25-year-old Brian 
Deal, said he had bought lumber to cover his windows but was 
waiting to see how the storm would progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters expected a weather system moving east across the  
United States to force Dennis away from Florida. The National 
Hurricane Center in Miami said Dennis might never hit land. But it 
also could turn and strike near South Carolina as early as Sunday, 
when it could be packing winds up to 109 mph, said forecaster 
Robert Molleda. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not letting anyone off the hook anywhere along the  
coast,'' said another meteorologist at the center, Todd Kimberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis became a hurricane late Wednesday as its winds reached 75  
mph. Forecasters said it could strengthen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Club Eleuthera Resort said it had decided against flying 180  
Italian guests to a Cuban resort and told them to prepare for the 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the guests are a little nervous because they've heard  
all the stories about hurricanes,'' said manager Shawna McCarthney. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other nearby storms posed little threat Thursday,  
forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy, upgraded to a hurricane again late Wednesday, was far out  
in the Atlantic. And Emily -- which sprang up at near-hurricane 
strength Tuesday -- began to lose strength and was downgraded to a 
tropical depression.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Modifies Purchase Circles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Concern over consumer privacy has prompted  
Internet retailer Amazon.com to make changes in its new service 
designed to help gift buyers find its most popular products among 
certain demographics. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Thursday it was modifying its new Purchase  
Circles feature to allow employers to opt out of the 
company-specific listings and let customers have their purchases 
excluded from the anonymous listings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Privacy is of utmost importance to our customers and to us,''  
said Warren Adams, director of product development. ``While the 
vast majority of feedback from our customers indicates that 
Purchase Circles have been well received and are extremely valuable 
..., some customers have expressed concerns, so we're letting 
people decide individually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the changes will be implemented ``as soon as  
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The service is designed to help purchasers find the 10 hottest  
products in 3,000 different cities, universities and workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
	Purchase Circles debuted on Amazon.com's Web site last Friday.  
The Seattle-based company uses technology to collect consumer data, 
which it makes available in searchable databases, where online 
shoppers could see which books or music CDs are most popular with 
people in a certain area code, employer or military branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com had already found great success with a service that  
suggests merchandise to suit shoppers' own interests. Under the 
Purchase Circle plan, a customer also is able to track everything 
from the most popular CDs ordered in Miami to best-selling books at 
Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	To create a Purchase Circle, Amazon.com collects buying  
information based on what products it ships to a particular Zip 
code. It also tracks goods bought by people with the same e-mail 
address.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Golfs With Prince Andrew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton golfed with Prince  
Andrew today and jokingly bet the island of Martha's Vineyard on 
the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the Duke of York teed off at Farm Neck Golf Club  
where the president, with the prince as a passenger, stopped his 
golf cart in front of a gaggle of reporters and photographers and 
introduced his royal guest. 
</P>
<P>
	The dukes of York, he asserted, were hereditary owners of  
Martha's Vineyard, located in the Atlantic off the Massachusetts 
coast, in the 17th century. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what the bet is? If he beats me we have to give him  
back the island,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you want the island back, sir,'' a reporter shouted.  
</P>
<P>
	Andrew smiled.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you when I've won,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The prince was heard to say that the play would be without a  
handicap, ``flat, no strokes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the foursome were Sir Evelyn Rothschild of London  
and a man preliminarily identified by the White House as Tony 
Fisher of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The golf outing came after Clinton ended two days of seclusion  
at his borrowed summer house with a burst of vacation activity on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He went horseback riding. Then he played golf, twice, 34 holes  
in all. Then he threw on a sweater and, accompanied by first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter Chelsea, joined friends 
at a clambake on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The clambake at the home of Mattel executive Bill Rollnick and  
his wife, Nancy Ellison, is an annual event. The Clintons were 
there two years ago when an aide told them Princess Diana had been 
killed in an automobile crash in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The clambake provided a quiet conclusion to what otherwise was a  
busy day for Clinton. In a stark turnaround from the seclusion he'd 
been in for the two previous days, the president arose early and 
headed to the Blue Heron Farm for a morning of horseback riding. 
</P>
<P>
	A squadron of wild geese flew over a nearby field as Clinton and  
Chelsea rode on sandy narrow paths through groves of oak trees at 
the 40-acre farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton left after an hour and spent the rest of the day at the  
Farm Neck Golf Club playing golf with two sets of college friends. 
During the first round with Warren Spector, Tom Flexner and Ken 
Iscol -- all of New York City -- Clinton sent his first shot into the 
woods, a well-traveled territory for Clinton golf balls. 
</P>
<P>
	During a later round with Clare O'Callahan, Maurie Flanagan and  
her son, Sean, Clinton paused after his first shot and asked: ``Is 
it OK?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Hit one more. Go ahead,'' replied Sean. So Clinton did.  
</P>
<P>
	``Much better,'' O'Callahan offered.  
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons are scheduled to leave Martha's Vineyard off the  
Massachusetts coast on Saturday for a round of fund-raisers in the 
posh Hamptons district of eastern Long Island. Beneficiaries will 
include the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton's 
expected campaign to win an open U.S. Senate seat in New York 
state.

<HEADLINE> Military Computers Vulnerable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Department computer systems  
controlling critical operations from weapons design to soldiers' 
payrolls remain vulnerable to hackers, government auditors said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office said ``weaknesses in DOD  
information security continue to provide both hackers and hundreds 
of thousands of authorized users the opportunity to modify, steal, 
inappropriately disclose and destroy sensitive DOD data.''

<P>
	While some corrective efforts have been undertaken in response  
to earlier recommendations, the GAO said progress has been 
``inconsistent across the various DOD components,'' including 
controls over who can physically or electronically access sensitive 
computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Users were granted access to computer resources that exceeded  
what they required to carry out their job responsibilities,'' the 
congressional watchdog agency said in a report. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Hansen said the GAO report was  
welcomed as a way of helping to raise awareness of the problem and 
that it was ``right in line with the types of things that we are 
ready to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department, perhaps the largest user of such  
information systems in the world, spends roughly $1 billion a year 
on computer system security, and has requested more money from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put the kinds of corrections in will require consistent  
efforts, and those cost,'' Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Defense Secretary William Cohen's office and other  
operations within the Pentagon had recently set up additional 
firewalls and password protection for information systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen also said a department-wide effort aimed at consolidating  
such computer security efforts throughout the military is on 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO report noted that it was too early to assess the success  
of this program.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan's Assets Down in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan knows  
more about what makes the economy tick than most people, but he 
apparently lost some money last year. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Greenspan's most recent financial disclosure form,  
the value of his assets in 1998 ranged from around $2.5 million to 
$6.4 million, less than the range of around $3.4 million to $7.3 
million he reported for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures are not precise because the value of each asset is  
reported using a wide range, not a specific amount. 
</P>
<P>
	So where does Greenspan -- who once warned of ``irrational  
exuberance'' in financial markets -- put his own money? He shuns the 
stock market for the safest investment of all -- short-term Treasury 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan -- who made $136,700 last year in his government job --  
didn't have any stock holdings, reflecting his desire to avoid any 
conflict of interest, Fed officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The words and actions of Greenspan and his Fed colleagues, who  
set interest rate policies, can send stocks soaring or make them 
plummet. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his holdings, Greenspan listed one Treasury bill valued at  
more than $1 million and three Treasury bills worth between 
$500,001 to 1 million, according to the financial disclosure 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The form also showed that Greenspan sold a Norfolk Southern bond  
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan has filed financial disclosure forms every year since  
he was sworn in as Federal Reserve chairman in August 1987. But 
until last year, they said simply that most of his assets were in a 
blind trust worth more than $1 million. He liquidated the trust 
after his 1997 marriage to NBC-TV correspondent Andrea Mitchell so 
the couple could make joint financial plans, Fed officials have 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Greenspan's holdings, his wife's portfolio is weighted  
heavily toward stocks, including holdings in Abbott Laboratories, 
H.J. Heinz Co., American Greetings Corp. and Anheuser Busch Cos. 
Inc.

<HEADLINE> SNET Criticized Over E-Mail Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- SNET Internet is being criticized for  
the way it has handled a two-week-old problem that is still causing 
long delays in the delivery of e-mails to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The delays are affecting incoming messages being sent to 130,000  
SNET customers statewide, but are not affecting SNET e-mail 
messages sent to other systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Wirth, a business customer, said Thursday that the snafu  
has hurt his business. He said Southern New England 
Telecommunications Corp. has bungled its communications to 
customers about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisory messages posted on SNET's Web page are inadequate, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wirth, managing director of the Institute for Business  
Technology in Stratford, said SNET should have been more candid 
about the problem so he and other affected customers could have 
made other arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like hanging by your thumbs every day,'' Wirth told the  
Connecticut Post. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company Thursday received 15 messages that were five  
days late. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's worse than the United States Postal Service,'' Wirth  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even non-SNET customers are being affected. John Watson, a  
Westport stockbroker, is not a SNET customer, but has sent e-mails 
to SNET customers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he received them back two days later, but had no way of  
knowing why they were ``undeliverable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not working I'd like to know,'' Watson said.  
</P>
<P>
	SNET said it has been updating customers via its website.  
Customers who call the company's customer service line hear a 
recording stating that there is a problem with the service. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial problem -- a hard drive that overheated on Aug. 10 --  
has been fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the delay it caused in the receipt of e-mail has  
created a backlog that multiplies every time messages don't get 
through and systems or people resend them. 
</P>
<P>
	SNET spokeswoman Beverly Levy said the company cannot offer any  
timetable to customers for when the service will be back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	SNET customers with the company's long distance service pay  
$18.99 a month for unlimited Internet access.

	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- People began preparing for Hurricane  
Dennis from the Bahamas to the Carolinas today, banging wood over 
windows, battening down roofs and stocking up on supplies. By early 
evening, Dennis was 315 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral on 
Florida's east coast. It could near the Carolinas within days. In 
South Carolina, Gov. Jim Hodges ordered 1,000 National Guard troops 
and 500 state troopers to prepare for duty, but no decision was 
made yet on any possible coastal evacuation. In North Carolina, 
emergency planners urged 150,000 coastal residents to get ready for

early Saturday, bidding farewell to the 13-year-old Russian space 
station in preparation for its abandonment next year. Next spring, 
the Mir is scheduled to leave outer space and burn up in the 
atmosphere. The crew's departure was a low point for the Russian

as the first man and first woman -- and now has no cash, no new

	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Columbia/HCA Healthcare Inc., the  
nation's largest hospital chain, has removed about 900 doctors from 
its payroll as part of a restructuring brought on by a federal 
fraud investigation into the company. Columbia once owned physician 
practices that employed 1,500 doctors. Like most hospitals, 
Columbia lost money owning physician practices. Hospitals largely 
found when they put doctors on salary, the physicians tended to

elephant. Veterinarians prepared enough anesthetic to knock out 70 
humans, readied some 130 gallons of glucose and lactose and 
gathered dozens of mammoth-sized dressings to stem the bleeding 
from Saturday's surgery. Motola, the three ton cow elephant, trod 
on a land mine nearly two weeks ago as she foraged for food at a 
logging camp along the Myanmar-Thai border, the scene of a 
half-century of insurgencies.

	Greenspan: Market Has Larger Role  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve needs to pay closer  
attention to what happens on Wall Street, Chairman Alan Greenspan 
said today, since Americans reaping the rewards of the high-flying 
stock market are using those paper profits to justify spending and 
other financial decisions. Some economists interpreted Greenspan's

not dampened the Wall Street stock-buying ``exuberance.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists Say Polygraphs Scare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) -- The intent is to catch spies. But the  
effect of polygraph tests at Energy Department weapons labs will be 
to scare off new researchers and demoralize those who remain, 
scientists there say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you'll find very many people who are in favor of  
polygraphing,'' says Betty Gunther, who works in the computing 
division of Los Alamos in New Mexico. ``What we're talking about is 
destroying a very good research institution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tests are proposed as part of a new spy-fighting initiative  
prompted by allegations that a Los Alamos scientist passed nuclear 
secrets to China. The investigation, which found the man had 
downloaded thousands of files of super-secret codes into his 
unclassified computer, brought accusations the labs aren't doing a 
good job of keeping nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Energy Department announced its plans earlier this  
year, scientists at the nation's three nuclear weapons labs, 
Livermore in California and Los Alamos and Sandia in New Mexico, 
have made it clear they're worried about hanging their careers on 
the squiggly lines of a polygraph machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern here is that it will actually undermine, not  
bolster, national security,'' said Alan Zelicoff, a senior 
scientist at Sandia. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the tests have a very low ``true positive'' rate,  
meaning they won't be very efficient spycatchers, but probably will 
be effective at putting off bright young recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Come to the DOE labs, we'll pay you a third of what you'd get  
in Silicon Valley and, by the way, you're guilty until proven 
innocent.' That's counterproductive,'' Zelicoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	National weapons lab scientist Patrick Weidhaas likened the  
situation to anti-Communist sweeps of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was America at its worst, and we do not need another  
witch hunt,'' he wrote in a newsletter this month to colleagues at 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the tests -- who must take them and when -- are still  
being worked out. The first of four public hearings on the issue 
will be held Sept. 14 in Livermore. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests consist of only four work-related questions --  
``basically, are you a spy,'' says Jim Danneskiold, Los Alamos 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents worry about the possibility of ``false positives''  
from the polygraphs, which are generally not admitted in court 
because of questions about their reliability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once that red flag goes up, it won't go down,'' Weidhaas said  
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Department officials say the tests should have a very  
small error rate. The department's security head, Eugene Habiger, 
who passed one last month, said the tests should have fewer than 
one error in a thousand. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees who fail can take a second, more detailed, test. A  
second failure triggers an evaluation that also includes such 
things as work history. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing is supported by the University of California, which  
manages Los Alamos and Livermore. 
</P>
<P>
	``National security now is of the utmost importance and with new  
technologies out there ... new ways of penetrating security 
systems, it is just more important than ever to make sure that 
those people in those sensitive positions are completely reliable 
and understand their responsibilities,'' said UC spokesman Rick 
Malaspina. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandia President C. Paul Robinson issued a statement saying the  
lab's manager, Lockheed Martin Corp., has a policy of asking 
employees to take polygraphs if so requested by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	At Livermore, spokeswoman Susan Houghton said officials respect  
the employees' feelings, ``but the bottom line (is) that we have to 
do what is right for the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weidhaas doesn't agree that polygraphs are the way to achieve  
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``The polygraph introduces a totally new element,'' he said,  
``that basically, we're all suspects.''

<HEADLINE> Phelps Dodge Bids for Asarco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Phelps Dodge Corp. launched a $2.5 billion  
hostile bid Friday to acquire Asarco Inc. and Cyprus Amax Minerals 
Co., soliciting shareholders directly after being rebuffed by the 
companies' boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we continue to prefer negotiated transactions, we are  
committed to this compelling three-way combination and are taking 
all necessary steps to complete it,'' said Douglas C. Yearley, 
chairman and chief executive of the Phoenix-based Phelps Dodge. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Asarco and Englewood, Colo.-based Cyprus Amax,  
two of the world's leading copper and metals producers, have 
already agreed to merge to form the nation's largest copper 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	In a filing Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  
Phelps Dodge said it was undertaking the hostile bid and rejecting 
the two companies' counteroffer, made Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyprus Amax and Asarco had indicated they were interested in  
discussing a deal, but wanted $650 million more in stock than what 
Phelps Dodge was offering. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge's offer Friday remained unchanged from its offer  
last week, except that shareholders would receive cash for any 
fractional Phelps Dodge shares if they accept the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Vahid Fathi, a mining and metals analyst at ABN Amro Inc. in  
Chicago, wasn't surprised by Phelps Dodge's refusal of the 
counteroffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paying up the asking price Cyprus and Asarco are currently  
insisting on would completely take all the economic benefits of the 
deal away from Phelps Dodge shareholders,'' said Fathi. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge is asking Asarco and Cyprus Amax stockholders to  
vote against the proposed merger of Asarco and Cyprus, but said it 
would not bid further if shareholders of those two companies 
approved the combination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phelps Dodge is making a very smart move ... that they would  
walk away if the merger goes through,'' Fathi said. ``That behooves 
shareholders of Asarco and Cyprus Amax to think twice before voting 
for this merger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an enticement to shareholders, the two companies have said  
they will pay them an extra $5 per share if the merger is approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyprus Amax declined comment. Asarco could not immediately be  
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate action, Phelps Dodge also sued the two companies  
and their directors, alleging they breached their financial duties 
by not allowing directors to learn more about a possible 
third-party purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge recently slashed its production by closing mines,  
smelters and refineries throughout the Southwest, laying off about 
1,650 workers in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The industry has 
suffered in the wake of falling copper prices and lower copper 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of all three companies fell slightly Friday during  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Phelps Dodge dropped 6 1/4 
cents to $56.62 1/2, Cyprus Amax fell 25 cents to $17.56 1/4 and Asarco 
fell 6 1/4 cents to $22.68 3/4.

mid-grade. Now, I've got to go with the cheapest. I have to buy 
food, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Motorists across New England are exasperated by a sharp rise in  
gas prices over the last month. Nationally, the average increase in 
self-service unleaded this month was the biggest since 1990, 
following Iraq's attack on Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, I don't even look anymore they're so bad,'' said  
Tony Zeppieri, who filled his tank Thursday at a Mobil station in 
Richmond, R.I., where the price for unleaded was $1.27 per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut has the highest prices in the region -- an average  
$1.37 per gallon for regular unleaded self-serve -- after a 9-cent 
increase during the last month, according to the most recent survey 
by the American Automobile Association. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rhode Island, the average price is $1.28 per gallon, followed  
by Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire, at $1.22. 
Connecticut was already stinging from a 12-cent jump in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The association said the national average price of unleaded has  
risen 8.1 cents per gallon in the past month. The increase -- to 
$1.255 a gallon -- is the biggest from one month to another since 
prices soared 11.4 cents after Iraq attacked Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the pre-Labor Day average price was $1.08 a gallon.  
</P>
<P>
	With Labor Day coming up, motorists said they are particularly  
concerned about the gas prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it continues to increase, I will have to limit my trips,''  
said Lewis, a software trainer from Stamford. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts and representatives of the petroleum industry say they  
cannot predict whether prices could go up again before Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been a variety of reasons offered for the rising  
price at the pump -- improving economies in Asia, the Organization 
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' plan to cut crude oil 
production and refinery explosions on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Some motorists aren't buying any of it.  
</P>
<P>
	``The claims of a shortage are not true. It doesn't seem to me  
that we're going to run out of gas,'' said Paul Caston, a computer 
consultant from Chicago who filled up his rental car in Stamford. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute, which represents about 400 oil  
companies, said increases in crude oil costs are behind the 
increases at the pumps. In December, refiners were paying an 
average of $9.84 per barrel. Now, they are paying close to $20 per 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Planting, an analyst for the institute, said there also is a  
seasonal factor. When demand is weaker in January, prices tend to 
be lower. As demand increases in the summer months, prices tend to 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the price increases, AAA said most motorists are not  
expected to curb their travel plans for the holiday weekend. The 
association is predicting that nearly 34.8 million Americans will 
travel 100 miles or more during the weekend, an increase of 2 
percent over last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think at this level that we're talking about  
people being discouraged or willing to forego that trip because of 
where the gas price stands today,'' spokesman Jerry Cheske said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one motorist agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not to a point where it's prohibitive,'' said Dr. Jan  
Kaplowitz, a retired chiropractor. ``In different parts of the 
world, they pay a lot more for gas.''

<HEADLINE> Anti-Affirmative Action Group Sues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A conservative group has filed a federal lawsuit  
against the city of Atlanta, claiming a program that sets aside 
city contracts for businesses owned by minorities and women is 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southeastern Legal Foundation filed suit Thursday, making  
its latest target the city that is the birthplace of the Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr. and a proud symbol of black economic 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	The group wants the city to abolish the affirmative action  
program, which was started in 1975 under Maynard Jackson, the 
city's first black mayor. It affects up to one-third of city 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has been bitter. Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell, who as a  
child was the first black to integrate a North Carolina school 
system, has likened the foundation to the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The program has strengthened our economy and helped remedy  
past and present discrimination,'' said Campbell, adding that the 
city would vigorously defend it. ``Diversity and equal opportunity 
have made our city appealing and great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation, which has challenged race-based preference  
programs around the country, says the true purpose of the law is to 
``channel public funds to political supporters of defendant Bill 
Campbell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed on behalf of four construction firms.  
</P>
<P>
	Foundation president Matthew Glavin said he was willing to  
negotiate, but insisted any settlement would require that the city 
abolish the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't break the law just a little bit,'' he said. ``The  
program will end either voluntarily or by court order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavin is calling for the city to use a race-neutral program to  
give a percentage of contracts to local or small and disadvantaged 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we'll settle,'' said state Rep. Billy McKinney,  
D-Atlanta. ``We'll just let Matt Glavin and that bunch of racists 
file their suit and do the best they can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta area has been an economic success story for blacks,  
with a thriving black middle class. About two-thirds of the city's 
400,000 residents are black. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the Supreme Court curtailed the federal government's  
freedom to give special help to racial minorities. Affirmative 
action foes argue that set-asides award work on the basis of race 
and are therefore unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, the court struck down a Richmond, Va.,  
affirmative-action plan and made it far more difficult for 
communities nationwide to set aside certain percentages of jobs, 
construction contracts or other sought-after treatment for 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	In several recent battles, communities have given in to the  
foundation's demands rather than risk a long, costly court battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the threat of a lawsuit from the foundation  
forced the DeKalb County school board to abolish a voluntary busing 
program that allowed blacks to attend primarily white schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the foundation forced Atlanta's school system to  
agree to a two-year ban on mandatory racial hiring goals. And in 
Florida, the group successfully challenged Jacksonville's set-aside 
program for contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation won perhaps its biggest victory earlier this year  
in a suit against the Clinton administration over its statistical 
sampling plan for the 2000 census. The Supreme Court disallowed the 
plan, which was expected to increase the number of minorities 
counted.

	Hurricane Expected To Hit Bahamas  
</P>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis buffeted fragile  
Bahamian islands with gusty winds today and is threatening to 
strengthen into a major storm that could imperil the eastern 
seaboard of the United States by Sunday. The U.S. National Weather 
Center predicted today the hurricane will hit the northern Bahamas 
tomorrow morning. From hundreds of miles away, Dennis is kicking up 
waves off the Outer Banks of North Carolina, prompting the governor 
to put state troopers on alert. National Guard troops are preparing 
for storm duty in South Carolina and a hurricane watch has been 
posted for Florida's east coast.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Opposition lawmakers today broke  
through crowds and climbed over the capitol building's fence in 
defiance of a constitutional assembly's order that virtually shut 
Congress down. Police and the National Guard fired tear gas and 
water cannons to control clashes between supporters and opponents 
of President Hugo Chavez. Six people were injured. Chavez, a former 
paratrooper who led a failed 1992 coup attempt, says a major 
shakeup of Venezuela's institutions in needed to root out some of 
the world's worst political corruption.

	Board Issues Gulf Illness Report  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A presidential oversight board concluded today  
there is no evidence to link mysterious Gulf War illnesses to 
exposure to depleted uranium used in U.S. munitions. In so finding, 
the Special Oversight Board on Gulf War Illness joined conclusions 
reached in other studies. In an interim report, the presidential 
panel issued recommendations designed to keep better track of those 
with diagnosed and undiagnosed Gulf War illnesses. But the panel 
shed little new light on the causes of the diseases. A final report 
is due in May.

	Mir Crew Prepares To Head Home

	MOSCOW (AP) -- The crew of the Mir space station prepared today  
to head back to Earth and leave the orbiter unmanned in 
preparations for its abandonment next year. Russian cosmonauts 
Viktor Afanasyev and Sergei Avdeyev, along with French astronaut 
Jean-Pierre Haignere, are scheduled to move from the station to the 
Soyuz escape capsule today. The decision to abandon the 13-year-old 
Mir came after the government decided to stop financing its 
operation. Attempts to attract private funds failed.

	Albright Upbeat on Mideast Accord

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met  
today with two senior Palestinian officials and gave an upbeat 
account of talks with Israel on a timetable for a West Bank 
pullback. ``We are looking forward to the conclusion of this aspect 
of the peace process,'' she said, standing outside her home with 
negotiator Saeb Erekat and Yasser Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas. 
The agreement taking shape calls for Israel to resume a pullback 
from 13 percent of the West Bank that was halted after 2 percent 
was surrendered. Israel would give up 7 percent in October and the 
final 4 percent in January.

stopped his golf cart in front of reporters and introduced his 
royal guest. The Clintons are scheduled to leave Martha's Vineyard 
tomorrow for a round of fund-raisers in the Hamptons district of

	Personal Income Rises in July  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' income crept up in July, while  
consumer spending rose faster but not at the frenzied pace of 
earlier this year. The Commerce Department said today that personal 
income rose a slower-than-expected 0.2 percent last month, the 
smallest gain this year. Because consumer spending has repeatedly 
outpaced incomes, the nation's savings rate has set a string of 
record lows this year, with the lowest a negative 1.5 percent in 
May. In July, the savings rate was better: minus 1.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Most Schools Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As children stream back into schoolhouses,  
four out of five Americans say in an Associated Press poll that 
schools in their communities are relatively safe. But two-thirds 
say posting police officers in hallways would help cut violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted for the AP by ICR of Media, Pa., also  
indicates many people feel cutting back on television and movie 
violence would help. 
</P>
<P>
	People have had the summer to assess their feelings on school  
violence after two students killed a dozen classmates, a teacher 
and themselves last April at Columbine High School in Littleton, 
Colo. A sheriff's deputy was on duty at the school when the 
shootings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	While 65 percent felt a police presence in schools would cut  
violence, 33 percent felt it would not. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the idea of a human being, someone the kids could go  
to'' if there was trouble, said Mary Beth Corvati, a mother of two 
children in Harford County, Md., one of 1,016 surveyed in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers were a popular option, but Americans were less certain  
that metal detectors would help. Fifty percent said they would 
help, 47 percent that they would not. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like for my children to view a police officer as  
someone who could help preserve their safety, be a role model -- 
someone they could look up to,'' Mrs. Corvati said. ``I don't think 
my children could look up to a metal detector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reducing violence in TV shows and movies was cited by one-third  
of those surveyed as the most effective way to stop school 
violence. Women, Republicans and older Americans were most likely 
to choose that option. Another 22 percent said increased counseling 
for teen-agers would be most effective. Stricter gun laws and 
putting metal detectors in schools were chosen most effective by 16 
percent each. 
</P>
<P>
	In another AP poll in May, 23 percent chose metal detectors as  
the most effective curb of school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest poll, taken Friday through Wednesday, had an error  
margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrie Clark, a mother of two young children from Dover, N.H.,  
feels that violent entertainment is harmful to children, and ``the 
parents have ultimate control of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We watch PBS, and I have the Disney movies,'' she said, noting  
she also keeps toy guns away from her children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't let them play with toy guns, but they build Legos into  
guns,'' she said. ``My daughter's play hairdryer is a gun. When I'm 
in another room I hear them (say), `Bang, bang. I'm going to kill 
you,' or shooting their stuffed animals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Littleton shootings and other high-profile cases of  
violence in schools, only 14 percent of Americans consider their 
schools unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks were more likely than whites -- 30 percent to 10 percent --  
to say schools in their community were either ``not too safe'' or 
``not safe at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School administrators around the country have been working for  
months on security plans but are moving cautiously on putting 
police in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the administrators' association don't have a firm  
count of schools with officers, but Bruce Hunter, spokesman for the 
American Association of School Administrators, said he doesn't 
think a majority of high schools have them yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado shootings struck a nerve, however, in rural and  
suburban districts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest effect of Columbine was that it affected districts  
that never had to deal with it,'' said Paul D. Houston, the group's 
executive director. While there were other school shootings before 
Columbine, the Colorado carnage got the attention of all officials 
in all districts, rural and suburban. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston recalled a meeting with 200 suburban superintendents  
from all over the country who were asked how many had bomb threats 
after Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every hand in the room went up,'' he recalled.  
</P>
<P>
	The idea of police officers in schools draws a mixed reaction  
from educators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people express concern over how (a police presence)  
changes the atmosphere in the building, see it as too intrusive,'' 
said Steve Pratt, executive director of the Colorado Association of 
School Executives. He said those people prefer good communication 
links with police, ``but others say it offers peace of mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Mrs. Clark, the full-time mom from New Hampshire, the whole  
debate over school violence makes her long for the peace and 
tranquility of the rural mountains where she grew up. 
</P>
<P>
	``This scares the hell out of me, frankly,'' she said. ``I would  
love to move back up into the mountains, move far away and get away 
from all of this.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Officials Find $80M in Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE ARROWHEAD, Calif. (AP) -- Agents have seized $80 million  
worth of marijuana -- 23,000 plants -- in a remote section of the San 
Bernardino National Forest, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers found the plants on a four-acre plantation near Lake  
Arrowhead, sheriff's spokesman Chip Patterson said Thursday. No 
arrests have been made, 
</P>
<P>
	``It's by far the largest growing operation we've ever seen in  
terms of sheer numbers. It took a couple dozen deputies two days to 
cut down all the plants,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plantation, hidden by heavy brush and inaccessible by road,  
was discovered several weeks ago by deputies patrolling the area by 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers watched the area for two weeks, then seized the plants  
Tuesday, hoping also to capture six to eight men believed to have 
been living in tents and harvesting the crop. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the suspects fled shortly before we arrived. They may  
have heard us coming,'' Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the remoteness of the location, law enforcement  
officials had to be airlifted in by helicopter.

<HEADLINE> HUD Challenges Proposed Budget Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly 100,000 people would be deprived of new  
jobs and thousands more locked out of affordable housing under GOP 
proposed budget cuts, the Clinton administration says. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released Thursday by the Department of Housing and  
Urban Development details how $1.6 billion in budget cuts proposed 
by the House Appropriations Committee in July would affect 
communities because of the number of jobs that won't be created and 
housing that won't be available to low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 97,000 people who wouldn't be employed, the  
report said 156,000 families would be locked out of affordable 
housing and 16,000 families and individuals who are homeless or who 
have AIDS would lose housing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This nation is doing extraordinarily well ... but that's not  
to say everyone, everywhere is sharing in the success,'' housing 
secretary Andrew Cuomo said. ``That makes the cuts all the more 
onerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., chairman of the House  
Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, issued a 
statement in response to the HUD report accusing HUD officials of 
``trying to score political points at the expense of our most 
vulnerable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio said a Government Accounting Office study found HUD had  
requested $700 million for 18 new programs ``instead of focusing on 
its core mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While residents of assisted housing properties were faced with  
the threat of losing their homes ... HUD's budget reduced new 
housing construction funding for senior citizens, our 
fastest-growing and most vulnerable population,'' Lazio's statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton had proposed a $2 billion increase for the  
department in fiscal year 2000, up from $28.5 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has threatened to veto the committee's spending plan  
because of the cuts, but Republican budget writers say they had to 
make them to stay within spending caps that were imposed two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Appropriations Committee spokeswoman Elizabeth Morra said the  
cuts were made in specific programs, rather than across the board, 
and that ``some tough choices had to be made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo attributed the need for severe cuts to the HUD budget to a  
10-year, $792 billion tax reduction that the GOP-led Congress 
approved earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress shouldn't rob the poorest Americans to provide  
reckless tax cuts and create a new deficit,'' Cuomo said. ``Now is 
the time to invest in a brighter future for people and places left 
behind.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Looms East of Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis loomed east of the  
Bahamian capital of Nassau today, marooning some vacationers, 
increasing the peril for Florida and threatening to strike South 
Carolina as a major storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of the Bahamas expanded a hurricane warning to  
cover much of the northwest Bahamas. Dennis was packing 80 mph 
winds as it moved west-northwest at 7 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. National Weather Center predicted today the hurricane  
would hit the northern Bahamas on Saturday morning. It urged 
Bahamians to rush their preparations to protect life and property. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the National Hurricane Center put the east  
coast of Florida on hurricane watch and urged coastal residents 
from central Florida up to North Carolina to watch the storm 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	A weather system that was supposed to steer Dennis away from the  
Florida coast had not. At 2 p.m. EDT, Dennis was centered about 335 
miles southeast of Cape Canaveral, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not letting anyone off the hook anywhere along the  
coast,'' said another meteorologist at the center, Todd Kimberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	Although forecasters had been talking about a glancing blow for  
the U.S. mainland, hurricane center director Jerry Jarrell said 
Dennis could make a direct hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``That ups the ante a little bit for central Florida,'' said  
Jarrell. ``It's too close for comfort right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was expected to strengthen over the next 24 hours and  
bring five to 10 inches of rain and tides 3 to 6 feet above normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``People still remember Hurricane Andrew here from 1992, so  
we're keeping an eye out for it,'' hotel owner Harcourt Cambridge 
said in the Bahamian capital of Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew blew off much of the topsoil on Eleuthera island, where  
some trees had only just begun bearing fruit again, said Gilbert 
Kemp, local government chairman at Hatchet Bay. Eleuthera is a 
110-mile-long strip of pink sand where 8,000 people live. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp said it had rained through the night and the wind was  
picking up, bending some smaller trees, as residents rushed to 
board up their homes. Boats in Nassau were hauled out of the 
harbor, and the governor general's official residence was boarded 
up before a light rain started falling Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis kicked up surf in the Carolinas, where people began  
stocking up on storm supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Gov. Jim Hodges ordered 1,000 National Guard  
troops and 500 state troopers to prepare for duty, but no decision 
has been made on any possible coastal evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, emergency planners urged 150,000 coastal  
residents to get ready for the storm. State troopers and emergency 
management personnel were on alert. 
</P>
<P>
	While surfers off the Outer Banks rode huge waves generated by  
the far-off storm, some residents of the Wilmington, N.C. area went 
to supply stores for plywood, batteries and lanterns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're starting to sell plywood and a lot of propane,  
batteries, lights,'' said Troy Green, a clerk at a Carolina Beach 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, the approaching storm prompted many surfers to play  
hooky from work and school today to catch some unseasonably good 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
	``On my way in this morning, I was following someone that had  
two or three boards on their car,'' said Heather Lewis, marking 
director for Ron Jon Surf Shop on Cocoa Beach, about 40 miles east 
of Orlando. The shop has been getting deluged with calls for surf 
reports, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis became a hurricane late Wednesday as its winds reached 75  
mph. Forecasters said it could strengthen. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other nearby storms posed little threat, forecasters said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cindy, upgraded to a hurricane again late Wednesday, was far out  
in the Atlantic. And Emily -- which sprang up at near-hurricane 
strength Tuesday -- began to lose strength and was downgraded to a 
tropical depression.

<HEADLINE> LA Groups Scramble for NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The NFL expansion merry-go-round continues  
with a group from suburban Carson trying to move back into 
contention while the Los Angeles Coliseum group is floating a new 
idea before the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Houston clearly has the inside track for the league's  
32nd franchise, groups backing prospective sites in the Los Angeles 
area are scrambling to impress NFL officials by the league's Sept. 
15 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we're continuing to work as hard as we can in  
finding a solution to our stadium problem in Los Angeles,'' 
spokesman Greg Aiello said Friday from the league offices in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL earlier chose the Los Angeles Coliseum over Carson as  
the potential home for the new team, but the league later asked for 
$150 million in public funds and for new parking structures to be 
built at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	After state and local officials said there would be no tax money  
spent on the proposal, the league announced it would no longer deal 
exclusively with the Coliseum group and opened the door for new 
prospective sites and owners to come forth. 
</P>
<P>
	Carson jumped back into the picture, and the city recently sent  
a letter to the NFL outlining its proposal to provide $180 million 
in public funds for a stadium that would be built on a former 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We approved that many months ago; it's still hanging out there  
in the wind,'' Carson Councilman Daryl Sweeney said of the funds, 
$150 million of which would be from the sale of bonds and $30 
million in cash and infrastructure improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want them to know we're still interested,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Carson idea had been backed by Hollywood dealmaker Michael  
Ovitz, but he joined the Coliseum backers after the NFL said that 
stadium was its first choice for the expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coliseum group, meanwhile, has presented a preliminary  
proposal to the NFL for using tax revenue generated by the new team 
to provide the public funding the league seeks. That proposal, 
backed by Los Angeles Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, is in the 
early stages and would be expected to meet opposition from some 
local and state officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Aiello said NFL officials were looking at the idea and meeting  
with Ridley-Thomas, but wouldn't elaborate until after a Sept. 9 
expansion committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Aiello emphasized that the league wants teams both in Houston  
and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commissioner (Paul Tagliabue) has stated previously that,  
long-term, we would like to have teams in both cities,'' he said. 
``Our immediate project is considering expanding to a 32nd team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league also has been approached by billionaire Marvin Davis  
about building a stadium at Hollywood Park in Inglewood, by 
representatives of a proposed stadium in Irvine, and by San Diego 
Padres owner John Moores about the possibility of putting a team in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the NFL expansion committee meeting in Washington,  
D.C., representatives from Los Angeles and Houston are scheduled to 
meet Sept. 13 with league officials in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the league's self-imposed deadline for dealing  
exclusively with Los Angeles is Sept. 15, the next full meeting of 
the league's team owners isn't scheduled until Oct. 6 in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Illinois St. Player Going to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- The one Illinois State football player  
to stand trial for a 1998 fraternity house brawl has been found 
guilty and faces a minimum sentence of six years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Ramsey, 23, was convicted of two counts of home invasion  
and one count of mob action in a bench trial Thursday before 
Circuit Judge G. Michael Prall. The home invasion charge carries a 
prison sentence of 6-to-30 year. The minimum sentence for mob 
action also is six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey, a defensive halfback, sobbed audibly after Prall  
announced the verdict. He will be sentenced Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ramsey led a group of 30 to 40 current and  
former ISU football players who broke into the Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
fraternity house on March 22, 1998. He was among eight players 
accused of attacking about 40 fraternity members in retaliation for 
a fight the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said as many as six fraternity members were injured  
in the fracas. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey's attorney, Paul Welch, said it was ``horribly  
inappropriate'' that no fraternity members involved in the fight on 
March 21 were charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges were dropped against football player Aveion Cason this  
June due to insufficient evidence. Robert Boyd, who pleaded guilty 
to misdemeanor battery, received 24 months' probation and was 
ordered to pay a share of $9,000 in restitution to fraternity 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Five other players who earlier pleaded guilty to more serious  
charges were sentenced to 90 days in the McLean County Jail and 
also ordered to pay restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	McLean County Assistant State's Attorney Michael Stroh said  
Ramsey's punishment would send a message to those who chose to take 
the law into their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are proper ways to deal with conflict, and the path that  
Kenneth Ramsey and the other members of the football team chose 
that night was the wrong path,'' Stroh said. ``We cannot have 
citizens exacting retribution on their own -- vigilantism.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Golfs With Prince Andrew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton golfed with royalty  
Friday and jokingly staked the island of Martha's Vineyard on the 
outcome. The game was rained out before he had a chance to win or 
lose. 
</P>
<P>
	The president joined Britain's Prince Andrew, the duke of York,  
on the links at the Farm Neck Golf Club. He noted that in the 17th 
century the ground on which they stood -- indeed all of this island 
off the Massachusetts coast -- was owned by the dukes of York. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Andrew has held the title since his mother, Queen  
Elizabeth, conferred it in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what the bet is? If he beats me, we have to give him  
back the island,'' Clinton said, stopping his golf cart near a 
gaggle of reporters and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you want the island back, sir,'' a reporter shouted.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you when I've won,'' said the grinning prince, a  
passenger in the president's electric cart. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither the prince nor the president won before a heavy,  
steady rain turned the course to puddles. The party quit on the 
15th fairway, and the prince soon splashed across the parking lot 
toward a black Land Rover. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked the game's outcome, Andrew pulled a crumpled wad of  
American bills from his pocket and replied: ``I have still got a 
little money in my pocket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the question of the ownership of Martha's Vineyard hadn't  
been settled by the American Revolution, its 14,000 permanent 
residents and the scores of thousands of vacationers who visit each 
autumn might have had reason for worry: 
</P>
<P>
	The prince's first shot sailed down the middle of the fairway;  
the president's veered radically off course. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't go way over there,'' he implored.  
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, with the ball still in the air, there was a loud  
crash. A staff member in the nearby clubhouse had dropped a tub of 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton usually gives himself the luxury of a mulligan or two  
when he tees off, taking advantage of the extra shots that some 
golfers grant their partners. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the prince made do with his initial shot, Clinton  
followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was evidently played without handicap.  
</P>
<P>
	``No strokes. ... All flat,'' Prince Andrew decreed.  
</P>
<P>
	The royal golf match was the highlight of Clinton's last full  
vacation day on Martha's Vineyard, the seventh time he has spent 
summer weeks here during his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	The vacation's second half will be at the Finger Lakes region of  
upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton are set to  
leave Saturday for the posh Hamptons region of Long Island for a 
series of fund-raisers intended to raise money for Democratic 
campaigns in general and for Mrs. Clinton's likely New York Senate 
campaign in particular. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night at East Hampton the Clintons are hosts at the  
airport terminal to a buffet reception of the young Democrats' 
``Saxophone Club.'' At $250 per person, some 800 people are 
expected to turn out for the Clintons and comedian Jon Stewart to 
net about $200,000 for the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, it's on to a $1,000 per plate barbecue dinner at a  
private East Hampton residence. Singer Phoebe Snow will entertain 
the 300 people contributing jointly to the DNC, Mrs. Clinton's 
anticipated Senate race and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the Clintons star at a $5,000 per person lunch for 80  
at a South Hampton home. The first $1,000 of every ticket price, a 
party official said, will go to Mrs. Clinton's race with the 
remainder being shared by the DNC and DSCC. 
</P>
<P>
	In the priciest of the galas, rocker Jon Bon Jovi provides the  
music at a Bridgehampton dinner on Sunday night solely benefiting 
the DNC. At $25,000 per couple, the event is expected to bag 
$900,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes worked Friday to  
cram the airwaves at Skaneateles Lake, the Clintons' final stop on 
their half-recreational, half-political tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forbes campaign bought five days' worth of spots on three  
Skaneateles-area radio stations in upstate New York -- WSYR, WSEN 
and WNSS -- to hammer at the president's opposition to Republican 
tax cuts legislation pending in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sign the tax cut, Mr. President,'' Forbes says in the ad. ``I  
would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the American Conservative Union purchased television time  
in the upstate region to criticize Clinton's decision to offer 
clemency to 16 Puerto Rican militants. Those ads are scheduled to 
run next Monday through Friday.

<HEADLINE> Auburn Receiver Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn receiver Clifton Robinson, who  
pleaded guilty earlier this month to a reduced charge of 
contributing to the delinquency of a minor, has been suspended from 
the Sept. 4 season opener against Appalachian State. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was originally suspended from the team last spring,  
when he was charged with second-degree rape after allegedly having 
sex with a 15-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	He avoided a trial by pleading guilty to the misdemeanor charge  
earlier this month and was ordered to serve 200 hours of community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tommy Tuberville welcomed him back to the team after the  
plea agreement, but said he was considering some sort of punishment 
for the junior receiver. He decided Thursday to suspend him for one 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson led the Tigers last year in all-purpose yards with 943.  
He was also second on the team with 42 catches for 672 yards.

<HEADLINE> Separatist's Conviction Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- An appeals court overturned the organized  
crime convictions of Republic of Texas leader Richard McLaren and a 
top aide, saying it found insufficient evidence against them. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate but nearly identical opinions issued Thursday, the  
Texas 8th Court of Appeals entered judgments of acquittal for 
McLaren and associate Robert ``White Eagle'' Otto. 
</P>
<P>
	McLaren, leader of a group that believes Texas is an independent  
nation, is serving a 99-year prison sentence and Otto received a 
50-year term in a kidnapping that sparked an armed standoff with 
state police in April 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The El Paso-based court said ``there was no showing that McLaren  
abducted Joe and Margaret Ann Rowe.'' Prosecutors had argued that 
while McLaren was not present at the Rowes' home, he had plotted 
and directed the kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it boils down to is if you allege it you've got to prove  
it,'' said Otto's attorney, Mike Barclay. ``The evidence was 
insufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barclay said he plans to ask for bail for Otto as early as  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unlikely McLaren would be released from prison any time  
soon. In addition to the state term, he was sentenced to 12 1/2 years 
in federal prison for participating in a fraudulent scheme to 
distribute $1.8 billion in worthless Republic warrants, which 
resembled cashier's checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Albert Valadez said an appeal was in the works. He  
also said McLaren and Otto could face additional charges stemming 
from the same incident, such as burglary or aggravated assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the possibility of additional charges, McLaren  
attorney Frank Brown said: ``We'll have to litigate the issue of 
double-jeopardy at that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rowes refused comment on the overturned convictions when  
reached at their home Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony in McLaren's trial in October 1997 in Alpine showed  
that three of his followers in the Republic had stormed the Rowes' 
home in the Davis Mountains Resort and taken them hostage on April 
27, 1997. The couple, who lived near Republic members and had 
quarreled with McLaren, were taken hostage, allegedly in 
retaliation for the arrest of another Republic member, Robert 
Scheidt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rowes were held hostage in their own home for more than 12  
hours before they were exchanged for Scheidt. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't end the problem. The hostage-taking touched off  
a standoff between McLaren and other Republic members and scores of 
state troopers, who laid siege to the remote resort 175 miles 
southeast of El Paso until the group surrendered a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Months later, McLaren and Otto were convicted of engaging in  
organized criminal activity, essentially participating in a 
conspiracy, to commit aggravated kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Republic members contend the U.S. annexation of Texas in 1845  
was illegal and refuse to recognize Texas' statehood and 
institutions, including the court system. 
</P>
<P>
	At their trial, McLaren and Otto represented themselves and  
treated the proceedings as a sham. After the prosecution rested, 
they asked their standby court-appointed counsel to file motions 
for a mistrial and for directed verdicts of acquittal. The judge 
denied both and a jury eventually took less than two hours to 
convict.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Teen's Shooting Reopened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Justice Department has reopened an  
investigation into the 1994 shooting death of a 16-year-old Hasidic 
student following would-be Senate candidate Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's interest in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron Halberstam was killed and three other people were wounded  
when Lebanese immigrant Rashid Baz opened fire on a van filled with 
Jewish students on the Brooklyn Bridge. The shooting was in 
apparent retaliation for the slayings of 29 Muslims in a West Bank 
mosque. 
</P>
<P>
	The slain youth's mother, Devorah Halberstam, has led members of  
the Hasidic community in urging the case be reopened, both to seek 
other suspects and to explore whether it could be prosecuted under 
federal civil rights or terrorism statutes. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement by the office of U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White and the  
FBI attributed the decision to reopen the case to requests from the 
Halberstam family, U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer and Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	But White House spokesman Joe Lockhart confirmed today that Mrs.  
Clinton also had expressed interest in the case. He said the first 
lady asked a staffer to inquire ``if it was appropriate for some 
kind of meeting to take place'' about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	He said she asked her staffers to relay the question to the  
office of White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff, and he passed it 
on to the Justice Department, telling staffers to handle the matter 
as they saw fit. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of further investigation has been important to some  
members of New York's Jewish community -- a key voting bloc. Playing 
a role in reopening the case could be a political plus for Mrs. 
Clinton and Giuliani; both are considering a run for the U.S. 
Senate from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Baz is already serving a life sentence for the crime. He was  
convicted on state charges by a jury that rejected his claim that 
he opened fire because he was having a flashback to his troubled 
past in war-torn Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Suit by Family of 'Marlboro Man' OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARSHALL, Texas (AP) -- A federal judge has refused to dismiss a  
lawsuit against the tobacco industry by the family of the actor who 
appeared for years as the Marlboro Man. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 lawsuit by Lilo McLean, wife of David McLean, named  
several tobacco companies, including Marlboro cigarette maker 
Philip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	The case, which seeks unspecified damages, alleges that every  
cigarette maker in the United States conspired to hide facts 
regarding the addictive nature of nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McLean says her husband suffered from emphysema in the late  
1980s because of his nicotine addiction and later was stricken with 
lung cancer. David McLean died in October 1995 at age 73. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants asked U.S. District Judge David Folsom to throw  
the case out, saying Texas law doesn't allow for lawsuits involving 
addiction. But Folsom refused in an Aug. 13 ruling, said Don 
Howarth, a Los Angeles attorney representing the McLean family. 
</P>
<P>
	Folsom certified his ruling for immediate appeal to the Fifth  
Circuit Court of Appeals. If the appeals court upholds the ruling, 
trial could begin early next year, plaintiffs attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco industry representatives couldn't immediately be reached  
for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	David McLean began his role as the rugged Marlboro pitchman in  
the early 1960s, shortly before the U.S. Surgeon General's 1964 
order that cigarettes be labeled with health warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the labels warning that the product ``might be  
dangerous to your health'' were printed, he had been smoking for 
more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims that David McLean sometimes smoked five packs  
of cigarettes while posing for a single commercial.

<HEADLINE> Parents of White Supremacist Puzzled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The parents of a white supremacist who killed two  
and injured nine others during a two-state rampage said their son 
grew up in a loving, diverse environment that belied his racist 
views. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first public statement since their son's Fourth of July  
weekend shooting spree and suicide, Kenneth and Beverly Smith said 
their 21-year-old son, Benjamin, was raised in a household where 
they ``had friends from diverse racial and religious groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the couple said he severed ties with the family and  
they were unable to contact him for two months before the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very painful to first lose him to a viewpoint we found  
abhorrent and then lose him in such a horrible and final way,'' the 
couple said. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they have searched in vain for an explanation for the  
shootings. All the victims were members of minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like the parents of other good children who became criminal,  
alcoholic, drug-addicted or mentally ill, we found no answer,'' the 
couple said. ``We were loving parents to Benjamin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not share or understand the beliefs our son adopted  
near the end of his life,'' the couple said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting spree began July 2 in the Chicago area. Smith  
killed Ricky Byrdsong, a former Northwestern University basketball 
coach, wounded six Orthodox Jews and shot at an Asian-American 
couple, who were not hit. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 3, Smith fired at Asians and blacks in three other  
Illinois cities, Springfield, Decatur and Urbana, wounding three 
people. On July 4, Smith killed Won-Joon Yoon, an Asian student, in 
Bloomington, Ind. Smith had attended college in both Urbana and 
Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that day, Smith shot himself while struggling with police  
attempting to arrest him in Salem, Ill. On Thursday, a Marion 
County coroner's jury formally ruled that Smith's death was a 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsy results read to the jury revealed that Smith shot  
himself once in the chin with a .38-caliber pistol, then used a 
.22-caliber handgun to shoot himself in the chest and thigh.

<HEADLINE> Govt To Address Blood Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is taking the first small steps  
to address fears that serious, nationwide blood shortages could hit 
as early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Certain blood banks will be allowed to use blood from people  
with a genetic disease called hemochromatosis that causes them to 
build up too much iron, the Food and Drug Administration said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving blood regularly alleviates iron buildup. That blood is  
healthy, but today it's thrown away because it's a medical 
treatment patients pay for -- donations must be altruistic. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said any blood bank that offers free bleeds to  
hemochromatosis patients can apply for exemptions from federal 
regulations forbidding use of hemochromatosis blood. Under the 
exemption, hemochromatosis patients would be treated like any other 
blood donor. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts have estimated the change could provide up to 300,000  
more pints of blood a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the National Institutes of Health is beginning a program  
to monitor how much blood the nation has on hand each month, 
something not currently tracked. Experts hope the program could 
offer better information about pending shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	The steps, announced at a federal blood meeting Thursday, come  
amid increasing worries that blood donations are steadily dropping. 
The National Blood Data Resource Center predicts that next year, 
Americans will donate just under 11.7 million units of blood -- but 
that hospitals will need 11.9 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern increased last week, when the FDA banned donations by  
people who lived or traveled frequently to Britain during that 
nation's ``mad cow disease'' crisis, a ban estimated to cut the 
blood supply another 2.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Personal Income Rises in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income rose in July but  
their spending climbed much faster, leaving the nation's savings 
rate near a record low. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal income -- which includes wages, interest and government  
benefits -- rose a slower-than-expected 0.2 percent last month, the 
Commerce Department said today. That was the smallest gain this 
year and followed a strong 0.7 percent increase in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending, however, went up 0.4 percent in July, slightly less  
than many analysts had expected. In June, spending rose 0.3 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve on Tuesday bumped up interest rates on for  
the second time this summer by a quarter of a point, making it more 
expensive for millions of Americans to borrow. The Fed did this to 
slow the economy and keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the Fed hinted that no additional rate  
increases may be needed this year unless the economy shows signs of 
overheating or if inflation flares. 
</P>
<P>
	Because consumer spending has repeatedly outpaced incomes, the  
nation's savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income 
-- has set a string of record lows this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But in July, the savings rate was minus 1.4 percent, better than  
the record low of negative 1.5 percent in May. Previously, a record 
low of negative 1.2 percent was set in April. 
</P>
<P>
	A major reason for the negative savings rate, economists say, is  
that the strong stock market is boosting Americans' net worth and 
making them feel more comfortable about dipping into savings to pay 
for their spending spree. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's report also said wages rose a solid 0.7 percent in July,  
following a 0.5 percent gain in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a big increase in federal disaster relief subsidy  
payments to farmers caused farm proprietors' income to surge, 
boosting overall personal income. In July, those payments decreased 
causing farm proprietors' income to fall sharply and slowing 
overall income growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on durable goods -- big-ticket manufactured items  
expected to last at least three years, such as washing machines and 
cars -- rose 0.2 percent in July, compared to a 0.1 percent gain in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on nondurable products, such as food and fuel, went up  
0.1 percent, slightly less than the 0.2 percent increase the month 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the government reported that the nation's economic  
growth slowed in the second quarter of this year, held back by a 
swollen trade deficit. But consumers continued to spend briskly, 
though not at the exuberant pace that they did in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer spending in the second quarter rose at an annual rate  
of 4.6 percent. That was brisker than estimated a month ago, but 
slower than the torrid 6.7 percent pace of spending in the first 
quarter. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total 
economic activity.

<HEADLINE> Storm Disrupts Amtrak Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Passenger rail service on Amtrak's Northeast  
Corridor was shut down between Washington and Baltimore for several 
hours because of track flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak spokesman Russ Hall said trains were delayed from around  
9 p.m. Thursday until midnight after up to six inches of rain, and 
then mud, covered the rails about two miles south of Baltimore's 
Penn Station. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said 14 trains were affected. The last southbound train,  
No. 177, arrived in Washington at 1:59 a.m. today, 48 minutes 
behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was worse news for some passengers traveling north.  
Hall said train No. 66, due in Boston at 6:55 a.m., was five hours 
behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Some trains were held at Washington's Union Station and in  
stations north of Baltimore. But other trains were stopped on the 
tracks, where passengers had to wait for hours before they began 
moving again. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said the bad weather made it impossible to get buses to  
transport the stranded passengers.

<HEADLINE> Little League Stadium Name for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- The name of the stadium that will open  
for the 2001 Little League World Series is for sale -- not, however, 
to Gatorade, Nintendo and Foot Locker, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
	Little League Baseball kicked off a campaign Thursday to raise  
$15 million to complement $5 million already in the bank for 
projects including a stadium alongside Howard J. Lamade Stadium in 
Williamsport. Lamade, whose family published The Grit newspaper, 
owned the land where the field now sits. 
</P>
<P>
	The new field will be needed for simultaneous games when the  
series expands to 16 teams in two years. A donor can have his or 
her name on it for $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new stadium will not be named for a corporation. Other  
things we can talk about,'' said Howard G. Paster, chairman of the 
fundraising campaign and former legislative affairs director in 
President Clinton's administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will also go toward fields and offices in Kutno,  
Poland and Waco, Texas, and boosting Little League programs in 
American cities. Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Palmer did a public 
service announcement, and former baseball commissioners Bowie Kuhn 
and Peter Ueberroth are on the board of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone can have their name on a new administration building in  
Williamsport for $1 million, a scoreboard for $250,000 and a small 
sporting goods mall near the stadiums for $200,000. Also up for 
grabs are Little League schools in Kutno ($3 million) and Waco ($2 
million) and three fields in Poland at $150,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Donors so far include the major league's charity wing, CNA  
Insurance and Myteam.com, an Internet sports business. 
</P>
<P>
	A gift of $250,000 can start a Little League in a city where  
baseball, which hogs space, might have been pushed out by the iron 
rims of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with baseball in the cities is not money,  
surprisingly enough,'' said W. Dwight Raiford, a Little League 
board member whose wife, Iris, founded the Harlem Little League in 
1989. ``It's space. You can imagine what the situation is like with 
real estate in midtown Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Space is not a problem with basketball, but it takes a lot of  
commitment and work to get a baseball field built in a city,'' 
Raiford said. ``We've made a lot of progress in carving fields out 
of city parks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Little Leagues have started in Los Angeles and Chicago in recent  
years. Harlem now has four fields and 52 leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have missed so many children within our own borders who  
want to play ball,'' Raiford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, officials in Poland aggressively campaigned to make  
Kutno the center for youth baseball in Europe. The European final 
was played there this year at a park built out of a wheat field. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted it bad enough,'' Little League spokesman Lance Van  
Auken said. ``When the Iron Curtain came down, there was a desire 
to have things that were Western, and what is more Western than 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Europe will begin sending a team to the series in 2001. The  
continent's representatives are usually children of U.S. military 
dependents or Americans whose companies sent them to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the $20 million raised by Little League will  
be spent in Williamsport. Paster said he hopes to have $10 million 
by New Year's Day.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield-Lewis Rematch May Be Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- There's another report that agreement has been  
reached for a Nov. 13 title unification rematch between heavyweight 
champions Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Panos Eliades, Lewis' promoter, said the fight will be held at  
the Thomas &AMP; Mack Arena in Las Vegas and details will be announced 
in Las Vegas on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Evening Standard reported that the only delay in finalizing  
the deal between Lewis' camp and Holyfield's promoter, Don King, 
was the ticket allocation for British fans. ``But that will be 
sorted out,'' Eliades said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous reports of an agreement between King and Eliases proved  
premature. 
</P>
<P>
	Eliades had said previously that contracts would have to be  
signed by the end of July if a pay-per-view fight was to be put 
together for Nov. 13.

<HEADLINE> Texas Claims Fassero Off Waivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Struggling Jeff Fassero, who has allowed a major  
league-high 34 home runs, was traded from the Seattle Mariners to 
the Texas Rangers on Friday for a minor league player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know its been a rough year for him, but a change of scenery  
sometimes does wonders for a veteran,'' Texas manager Johnny Oates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old left-hander was 4-14 with a 7.38 ERA in 30 games  
for Seattle, allowing 123 runs and 188 hits in 139 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He won 13 or more games each year from 1995-98.  
</P>
<P>
	``He did well the past couple of years for us,'' Mariners  
manager Lou Piniella said. ``This year, he struggled. I'm not sure 
why. He was healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has struggled against left-handed hitters, allowing 76  
homers, the league's third-highest total. Lefties are hitting .283 
against the Rangers, the sixth-highest average in the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	Lefty batters are hitting .252 (32-for-127) against Fassero this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a lot of success against left-handers this year,''  
Oates said. ``The last time we saw him he had a decent fastball, 
and a good split-finger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oates said Fassero would pitch out of the bullpen, but hinted he  
may join the starting rotation in a week. Oates has thought about 
removing right-hander Mike Morgan (12-8, 6.11 ERA) from the 
rotation. 
</P>

	Seattle called up left-hander Robert Ramsay from Tacoma to take  
Fassero's spot on the roster. Ramsay, 25, was acquired from the

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Creeps Toward the Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis loomed east of the  
Bahamian capital of Nassau today, stirring up winds and rain that 
knocked furniture into swimming pools and left people fearful for 
fragile trees and plant life that had just begun to recover from 
Hurricane Andrew in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of the Bahamas expanded a hurricane warning to  
cover all of the central and northwest Bahamas. Dennis was packing 
80 mph winds as it moved west-northwest at 7 mph. At 8 a.m. EDT, 
Dennis was centered about 120 miles east of Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Center predicted today the hurricane would  
hit the northern Bahamas on Saturday morning. It was expected to 
strengthen over the next 24 hours and bring five to 10 inches of 
rain and tides 3 to 6 feet above normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``People still remember Hurricane Andrew here from 1992, so  
we're keeping an eye out for it,'' hotel owner Harcourt Cambridge 
said in the Bahamian capital of Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
	The service also warned residents from Florida to North Carolina  
to ``closely monitor the progress of Dennis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew blew off much of Eleuthera's topsoil and some trees had  
only just begun bearing fruit again, said Gilbert Kemp, local 
government chairman at Hatchet Bay. Eleuthera island is a 
110-mile-long strip of pink sand where 8,000 people live. 
</P>
<P>
	Boats in Nassau were hauled out of the harbor, and the governor  
general's official residence was boarded up before a light rain 
started falling Thursday night. One resident, 25-year-old Brian 
Deal, said he had bought lumber to cover his windows but was 
waiting to see how the storm would progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters expected a weather system moving east across the  
United States to force Dennis away from Florida. The National 
Hurricane Center in Miami said Dennis might never hit land. But it 
also could turn and strike near South Carolina as early as Sunday, 
when it could be packing winds up to 109 mph, said forecaster 
Robert Molleda. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not letting anyone off the hook anywhere along the  
coast,'' said another meteorologist at the center, Todd Kimberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis kicked up surf in the Carolinas, where people began  
stocking up on storm supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges ordered 1,000 National Guard  
troops and 500 state troopers to prepare for duty, but no decision 
has been made on any possible coastal evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, emergency planners urged 150,000 coastal  
residents to get ready for the storm. State troopers and emergency 
management personnel were on alert. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis became a hurricane late Wednesday as its winds reached 75  
mph. Forecasters said it could strengthen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Club Eleuthera Resort said it had decided against flying 180  
Italian guests to a Cuban resort and told them to prepare for the 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the guests are a little nervous because they've heard  
all the stories about hurricanes,'' said manager Shawna McCarthney. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other nearby storms posed little threat Thursday,  
forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy, upgraded to a hurricane again late Wednesday, was far out  
in the Atlantic. And Emily -- which sprang up at near-hurricane 
strength Tuesday -- began to lose strength and was downgraded to a 
tropical depression.

<HEADLINE> Moiseyev Confident at Yonkers Trot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) -- Racing from the outside is nothing new to  
Jack Moiseyev, and that's why the veteran driver is confident that 
Raffaello Ambrosio can win the $273,891 Yonkers Trot on Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-year-old bay colt by Victory Dream-Tishes Dishes drew the  
seven hole in the eight-horse race that is the second leg of the 
Triple Crown for trotters. With a 3-3-2 record in 10 outings this 
year, Ambrosio is the second choice to C R Renegade, which drew the 
No. 6 post position. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a half-mile track you just have to play it by ear when you  
are that far on the outside,'' said Moiseyev. ``My horse has done 
well the last couple of outings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moiseyev was referring to a fourth-place finish in the  
Hambletonian, the opening leg of the Triple Crown in which Ambrosio 
left from No. 10. He also was referring to a Yonkers Trot 
elimination victory in 2:00 flat after leaving from the outside in 
the five-horse race. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Guerflein, trainer of Raffaello Ambrosio and also Self  
Possessed, which set a world record of 1:51 3-5 in capturing the 
Hambo, is a bit on the pessimistic side. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're leaving from too far out,'' said Guerfein, who opted to  
enter Self Possessed in the American National at Balmoral, Crete, 
Ill., Saturday night rather than go for the triple crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``C R Renegade will probably go first over, so we'll find out  
how good a trotter Raffaello Ambrosio is,'' Guerfein said. ``I was 
extremely confident until the draw. Still, he has an excellent 
chance to win his first major stakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Allen, who is driving C R Renegade for his father, Carl, the  
owner, said: ``He was headstrong in winning his elimination (1:59 
3-5). When I tried to get something out of him, he ran. 
</P>
<P>
	``C R Renegade is a real determined horse. What makes him so  
nice is that he is so easy to drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yonkers elimination was the second straight win for the  
brown colt by Troubador-Country Kay and boosted his record to 7-3-1 
in 14 outings with winnings of $415,184 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Hambletonian, the 3-year-old was a badly beaten ninth,  
but Allen said, ``That was just a bad trip. I've forgotten about it 
and now am ready to keep our comeback going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Little Brown Jug on Sept. 23 in Delaware, Ohio, completes  
the Triple Crown.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Falls, Soybeans Rise / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures retreated in early trading today on  
the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn futures were mixed and 
soybeans edged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by concerns about insufficient  
export sales to help reduce relatively large inventories. With 
Canada's competing crop expected to be larger than originally 
forecast, investors are concerned U.S. export sales will suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures were mixed amid uncertainty about the impending  
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were buoyed by continued market talk that China is  
looking to buy some of the U.S. crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 2 cents to $2.81 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn was unchanged at $2.15 3/4 a bushel; December oats rose 
1/4 cent to $1.14 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 1 3/4 cents to 
$4.68 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose 0.22 cent to 66.57 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose 0.18 cent to 79.35 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs rose 0.05 cent to 45.20 cents a pound; February 
pork bellies rose 1.4 cents to 58.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Census Count May Have Missed Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whether it's building schools or day care  
centers, locating clinics or distributing money for school lunches 
and Head Start, if the government doesn't know where the children 
are it can't provide the right amount of aid. 
</P>
<P>
	And billions of dollars in programs have been misallocated over  
the past decade because children were missed in the 1990 Census at 
twice the overall rate, a children's advocacy group contended 
Thursday. They pressed for an added emphasis on counting children 
in next year's census. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 head count missed 3.2 percent of children -- double the  
1.6 percent overall undercount -- with the rate climbing to 4.5 
percent in four states where thousands were overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	William P. O'Hare of the Annie E. Casey Foundation's Kids Count  
Project said the undercount rate was 4.5 percent in Texas, Florida, 
Louisiana and Mississippi, the worst in the nation among the 
states. The District of Columbia's undercount rate was 6.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island came closest to counting all its youngsters,  
missing just 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Census Bureau earlier reported that about half of the  
4 million people missed nationwide in 1990 were children, O'Hare 
refined bureau data to calculate the rate for each state. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Census Bureau expects it to be even more difficult to  
count children next year, because the population includes more 
minorities, more foster children, more children in unstable living 
arrangements and more non-English-speaking families, O'Hare said. 
</P>
<P>
	Census numbers are used to determine how much federal money each  
state should get for a variety of programs. O'Hare noted that the 
General Accounting Office -- an investigative agency of Congress -- 
has estimated that the undercount cost Texas $1 billion and 
California perhaps $2 billion over the course of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Hare noted that in 1998, Census data were used in distributing  
$3.7 billion for foster care programs, $3 billion in women's, 
infants and children's food programs, and $1 billion in block 
grants for child care development. 
</P>
<P>
	Also affected are funds for such things as school lunch  
programs, Head Start classes, school construction, hiring teachers, 
establishing local day care and public transit programs for 
parents, said Jacqueline J. Byers, director of research for the 
National Association of Counties. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the children are missed, how will we know they're there so  
we can target the programs?'' asked Byers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Henderson of the National Education Association said  
failing to count children results in overcrowded classrooms: ``If 
we don't know how many children live in a community, we cannot 
provide adequate school facilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both urged parents, teachers and others to stress the need for  
cooperation with next year's Census so everyone, including 
children, will be counted. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line, said Terri Ann Lowenthal of the Census 2000  
Initiative, is that because of the undercount, billions of dollars 
are misdirected away from states and communities that need it. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Hare, whose group advocates for children, said there are many  
reasons children are missed more often than adults. Foster children 
may not be listed on a temporary caregiver's census form, divorced 
parents may each think the other listed the children on their 
census form, grandparents may not include children staying with 
them, many immigrant families fear providing information to the 
government and many worry the landlord will learn how many people 
are in one apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Census day is next April 1 and the effort has been mired in  
political wrangling over how it will be done. The Supreme Court 
ruled in January that a direct count must be conducted for purposes 
of redistributing seats in the House of Representatives among the 
states, but said modern statistical methods should be used to 
produce more accurate counts for other uses. 
</P>
<P>
	That means there will be two sets of numbers produced, boosting  
the count's cost from the previous estimate of $4 billion to as 
much as $6 billion, Census officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Establishment of some 500 local offices is already under way, as  
are recruiting efforts for the estimated 860,000 temporary workers 
who will be hired to make the count.

<HEADLINE> Bank Fires Seven for E-Mail Misuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- First Union Corp. says it has fired seven  
employees within the last week for sending pornographic and other 
inappropriate e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union, the nation's sixth-largest bank, confirmed the  
firings Friday, but company spokeswoman Sandy Deem would not 
release more details. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank ``will not tolerate conduct that interferes with  
another person's work performance or creates an intimidating, 
offensive or hostile environment,'' Deem said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte Observer reported Friday that employees at the  
University Research Park office circulated e-mail that included 
videos of people having sex and other material of a sexual nature. 
The company stumbled on the e-mail when the volume of messages 
became so heavy it slowed down a server. 
</P>
<P>
	One employee fired within the past week from the bank's  
home-equity division was called into an office, shown a stack of 
e-mail and fired on the spot, an employee told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union, a Fortune 100 corporation, joins a number of  
companies taking swift and severe action for violations of company 
e-mail policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are seeking to protect themselves from legal claims  
that their work environment is hostile. An increasing number of 
lawsuits alleging sexual harassment have based claims in part on 
e-mails taken from company computer systems.

<HEADLINE> Animal Death Video Trial Ordered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST COVINA, Calif. (AP) -- A woman accused of stomping mice and  
rats to death in a fetish ``crush video'' has been ordered to stand 
trial on animal cruelty charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Aileen Chaffin and Gary Lynn Thomason, who authorities say  
videotaped the acts, could face up to four years in prison if 
convicted of three felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were the only people arrested as a result of a yearlong  
undercover operation investigating ``crush videos'' sold over the 
Internet to people who obtain sexual pleasure from the sight of 
women destroying small animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chaffin, 35, of La Puente was the alleged star of ``The  
`Tails' of Charlie's Ankles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors played a few minutes of the grisly videotape at Ms.  
Chaffin's preliminary hearing Thursday. It showed a woman in 
high-heeled sandals and other shoes taunting and then crushing 
mice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come on, ask for it,'' the woman says.  
</P>
<P>
	``Try and get away. Come on, try and get away. I want you to,''  
she adds before stepping on a rodent. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives say a dozen rats and mice, some of them babies, were  
killed in the video. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Public Defender Sharon Lee had argued that Ms. Chaffin  
should face only misdemeanor counts because rodents aren't covered 
by the state's animal cruelty laws. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill introduced in Congress would make it a federal crime to  
create, possess or distribute any ``depictions'' of torturing and 
killing of animals for sale between states or countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics expect a constitutional challenge if the bill passes.  
They say it is so broad it could allow prosecution of those who 
make legitimate animal documentaries and even distributors of 
magazines that contain pictures of bullfights.

<HEADLINE> Waco Filmmaker Finds Satisfaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The government's admission that pyrotechnic  
devices were used the day the Branch Davidian compound burned is 
sweet satisfaction for a filmmaker who has said for years that 
authorities are lying about the Waco tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting answers is satisfying, but it will be much more  
satisfying when the people who are responsible are in prison,'' 
said Michael McNulty, whose six years of digging preceded the 
latest revelations about the 51-day siege. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of this is not about Mike McNulty, or the films that have  
been done, or about selling the films. It's about finding the 
truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNulty's 1997 film, ``Waco: Rules of Engagement,'' is based on  
grainy, black and white videotape recorded by an FBI surveillance 
aircraft circling over the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	The film suggests that after Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  
agents botched the raid of David Koresh's compound on Feb. 28, 
1993, the FBI recklessly attacked the religious group 50 days later 
with tank-driving commandos, intent on avenging the death of four 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The film cast doubt on Justice Department claims it used only  
non-burning grenades on April 19, 1993. McNulty said he found 
physical evidence to that effect -- one pyrotechnic shell and a 
photograph of another shell that had been misidentified -- more than 
a year after the movie's release. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence will be included in McNulty's second film, ``Waco:  
A New Revelation,'' to be released this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, following a former FBI official's  
acknowledgment of the devices, on Wednesday said the incendiaries 
were used and opened a full investigation. Congress now says it 
also will investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Rangers, custodians of the evidence through an  
arrangement with the federal government, earlier this year opened 
an inquiry into evidence identified by McNulty. 
</P>
<P>
	David Thibodeau, a former Koresh follower and one of nine siege  
survivors, said Friday that the latest revelations are ``things we 
were saying for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People automatically just did believe what they were told  
because the government and certain members of the press did such a 
good job of demonizing the Branch Davidians,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has attracted a cadre of researchers, experts and  
lawyers who consider themselves government watchdogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona attorney David Hardy has fought his battles through open  
records laws, repeatedly winning Freedom of Information lawsuits 
against agencies that denied him access to documents about the 
standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Hardy won $32,000 in attorney's fees -- the only  
financial remedy allowable in such suits -- after a judge ruled the 
FBI and ATF had ``stonewalled'' his requests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exhilarating because I've spent three years compiling  
these documents, and to finally have them all, in the space of a 
week, become useful is great,'' Hardy said of the new public 
scrutiny. ``We had to pry those documents away from the government 
one at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others hope the flow of information will pick up.  
</P>
<P>
	``The American public has a right to know the truth,'' said  
Danny O. Coulson, the retired FBI assistant deputy director whose 
statements sparked Reno's admission. ``And we have an obligation to 
tell the truth.''

<HEADLINE>  Another Clemente Plays in Pittsburgh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- When Edgard Clemente singled to right field --  
the opposite field, where Clementes always hit the ball -- few fans 
in Three Rivers Stadium recognized the significance. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the seventh inning of a relatively insignificant 8-4  
Pittsburgh Pirates victory Thursday over the Colorado Rockies, and 
only 12,649 were in the stands. There were no cheers, no ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the first time in 27 years, a player named Clemente was  
playing major league baseball in Pittsburgh. He was catching fly 
balls in the very outfield where Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente 
played, getting two hits from the very batter's box where Roberto 
got his 3,000th hit on Sept. 30, 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	To Edgard Clemente, playing this week in the city where his  
uncle is revered, in the stadium where his uncle played his final 
three seasons, was an ethereal, unforgettable experience. 
</P>
<P>
	So was getting his first hit, then his second in the ninth  
inning, his only hits in eight at-bats in the three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw his statue outside the stadium, I walked across the  
bridge that is named after him,'' Clemente said. ``The park outside 
the stadium is named for him, too. He is still a hero in 
Pittsburgh. How many players have statues? To have a statue, you 
must be a big player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Clemente remains very big in Pittsburgh, where there  
were more ``Clemente 21'' jerseys in the stands Thursday than for 
any current Pirates player. 
</P>
<P>
	The statue. The bridge. The legacy. It's almost enough to make a  
promising young player who has yet to prove himself in the majors 
wish he had another name. Which Edgard Clemente might have next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	He dropped his father's last name, Velazquez, to go by his  
mother's maiden name in tribute to his uncle, who died three years 
before he was born. But he may go back to Velazquez next year, now 
that he has returned the name Clemente to major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe next year, maybe in two years, I will change back,''  
Clemente said. ``But I asked my aunt and my cousins if I could keep 
the name, and they said they didn't mind. As long as I want it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But someday, I want my own identity.''  
</P>
<P>
	Clemente asked permission from Vera Clemente, the late Roberto's  
wife, before changing his name last year in honor of the 25th 
anniversary of his uncle's Hall of Fame induction. Edgard's mother, 
Carmen, who was Roberto's sister, and Roberto Clemente's sons also 
embraced the change. Luis Clemente called Edgard in Pittsburgh this 
week to wish him well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little nervous, I was afraid that if I did not do well  
here that the fans might say something,'' Clemente said. ``But 
they've been good. When they see my name, they are always very 
friendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Rockies teammate, pitcher Roberto Ramirez, didn't realize that  
Edgard Clemente was related to Roberto, thinking he chose the name 
at random because Roberto Clemente is so revered in Latin American 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought I took it like I might have taken the name McGwire  
or Sosa because they are popular now,'' Clemente said. ``Like I 
could have called myself Edgard Sosa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edgard, 23, is not the only Clemente in baseball; Roberto Jr. is  
a Spanish language broadcaster for the New York Yankees, the team 
his father helped defeat in the 1960 World Series. But Edgard is 
the first in the Clemente family to play in the majors since his 
uncle, who died in an airplane crash on Dec. 31, 1972, while 
transporting relief supplies to earthquake-stricken Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies are giving Edgard a 50-game trial in center field --  
not right field, where Roberto played -- and manager Jim Leyland 
likes what he sees so far: a live arm and a lively bat. Clemente 
was 2-for-4 Thursday and has five homers since returning from the 
minors on Aug. 9 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll probably end up as a corner outfielder, not a center  
fielder, and he's a free swinger sometimes,'' Leyland said. ``But 
he can hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Truly, he must be a Clemente.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield-Lewis Rematch May Be Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- There's another report that agreement has been  
reached for a Nov. 13 title unification rematch between heavyweight 
champions Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Panos Eliades, Lewis' promoter, said the fight will be held at  
the Thomas &AMP; Mack Arena in Las Vegas and details will be announced 
in Las Vegas on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Evening Standard reported that the only delay in finalizing  
the deal between Lewis' camp and Holyfield's promoter, Don King, 
was the ticket allocation for British fans. ``But that will be 
sorted out,'' Eliades said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous reports of an agreement between King and Eliases proved  
premature. 
</P>
<P>
	Eliades had said previously that contracts would have to be  
signed by the end of July if a pay-per-view fight was to be put 
together for Nov. 13.

<HEADLINE> Boxing Authority Suspends 4 Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Four of the five judges who worked a disputed  
match in the World Amateur Boxing Championships were suspended 
Friday by the executive committee of the International Amateur 
Boxing Association. 
</P>
<P>
	AIBA general secretary Loring Baker said he was outraged at the  
diversity of scoring by the judges and vowed a complete 
investigation into the entire scoring system of amateur boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear the word corruption ... creeping in and this is a  
policy that it's time to get tough with officials,'' Baker said. 
``This is the toughest position I know of in my 50 years in 
boxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judges awarded welterweight Timour Gaidalov of Russia the gold  
medal Thursday night by a 5-3 margin over Juan Hernandez of Cuba, 
setting off an angry protest and demonstration by the Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban heavyweight champion Felix Savon later refused to enter  
the ring for his fight and the title was awarded to Michael Bennett 
of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	After reviewing the Cuban protest, AIBA reversed the decision  
and awarded the gold medal to Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	The four officials were suspended pending a decision of AIBA's  
34-member executive committee next spring. Cases of this type carry 
a minimum period of four years to life. 
</P>
<P>
	AIBA also suspended Cuban head coach Alcides Sagarra and Jose  
Barrientos, chief of the Cuban delegation pending a meeting of the 
executive committee. The officials were suspended for their 
demonstration following the disputes fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspended judges are from Bulgaria, Estonia, Mongolia and  
Argentina. Their names were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	AIBA president Anwar Chowdhry of Pakistan pledged in a statement  
to continue the investigation. He said scoring papers of each bout 
in the World Championships would be reviewed and serious 
irregularities in judging would be dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
	Chowdhry said AIBA will restructure the duties of its  
Referee/Judges Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision obviously was a bad one and one that I think was  
proper to rectify,'' Baker said of the Hernandez-Gaidalov fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said the Russian delegation filed a complaint, questioning  
the legality of the reversal.

<HEADLINE>  Another Clemente Plays in Pittsburgh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- When Edgard Clemente singled to right field --  
the opposite field, where Clementes always hit the ball -- few fans 
in Three Rivers Stadium recognized the significance. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the seventh inning of a relatively insignificant 8-4  
Pittsburgh Pirates victory Thursday over the Colorado Rockies, and 
only 12,649 were in the stands. There were no cheers, no ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the first time in 27 years, a player named Clemente was  
playing major league baseball in Pittsburgh. He was catching fly 
balls in the very outfield where Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente 
played, getting two hits from the very batter's box where Roberto 
got his 3,000th hit on Sept. 30, 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	To Edgard Clemente, playing this week in the city where his  
uncle is revered, in the stadium where his uncle played his final 
three seasons, was an ethereal, unforgettable experience. 
</P>
<P>
	So was getting his first hit, then his second in the ninth  
inning, his only hits in eight at-bats in the three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw his statue outside the stadium, I walked across the  
bridge that is named after him,'' Clemente said. ``The park outside 
the stadium is named for him, too. He is still a hero in 
Pittsburgh. How many players have statues? To have a statue, you 
must be a big player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Clemente remains very big in Pittsburgh, where there  
were more ``Clemente 21'' jerseys in the stands Thursday than for 
any current Pirates player. 
</P>
<P>
	The statue. The bridge. The legacy. It's almost enough to make a  
promising young player who has yet to prove himself in the majors 
wish he had another name. Which Edgard Clemente might have next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	He dropped his father's last name, Velazquez, to go by his  
mother's maiden name in tribute to his uncle, who died three years 
before he was born. But he may go back to Velazquez next year, now 
that he has returned the name Clemente to major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe next year, maybe in two years, I will change back,''  
Clemente said. ``But I asked my aunt and my cousins if I could keep 
the name, and they said they didn't mind. As long as I want it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But someday, I want my own identity.''  
</P>
<P>
	Clemente asked permission from Vera Clemente, the late Roberto's  
wife, before changing his name last year in honor of the 25th 
anniversary of his uncle's Hall of Fame induction. Edgard's mother, 
Carmen, who was Roberto's sister, and Roberto Clemente's sons also 
embraced the change. Luis Clemente called Edgard in Pittsburgh this 
week to wish him well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little nervous, I was afraid that if I did not do well  
here that the fans might say something,'' Clemente said. ``But 
they've been good. When they see my name, they are always very 
friendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Rockies teammate, pitcher Roberto Ramirez, didn't realize that  
Edgard Clemente was related to Roberto, thinking he chose the name 
at random because Roberto Clemente is so revered in Latin American 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought I took it like I might have taken the name McGwire  
or Sosa because they are popular now,'' Clemente said. ``Like I 
could have called myself Edgard Sosa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edgard, 23, is not the only Clemente in baseball; Roberto Jr. is  
a Spanish language broadcaster for the New York Yankees, the team 
his father helped defeat in the 1960 World Series. But Edgard is 
the first in the Clemente family to play in the majors since his 
uncle, who died in an airplane crash on Dec. 31, 1972, while 
transporting relief supplies to earthquake-stricken Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies are giving Edgard a 50-game trial in center field --  
not right field, where Roberto played -- and manager Jim Leyland 
likes what he sees so far: a live arm and a lively bat. Clemente 
was 2-for-4 Thursday and has five homers since returning from the 
minors on Aug. 9 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll probably end up as a corner outfielder, not a center  
fielder, and he's a free swinger sometimes,'' Leyland said. ``But 
he can hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Truly, he must be a Clemente.

<HEADLINE> Judge Approves Ted Parker Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUMBERTON, N.C. (AP) -- A federal bankruptcy judge has approved  
the $90 million sale of the majority of Ted Parker Home Sales Inc. 
to Champion Enterprises, the nation's largest mobile home maker and 
Ted Parker's main supplier. 
</P>
<P>
	The approval came Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in  
Wilmington, Del., and means hundreds of Ted Parker Homes customers 
may soon be able to complete their sales or request refunds of 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	Champion, based in Auburn Hills, Mich., will buy back all  
Champion inventory owned by Ted Parker Homes and its sister 
company, Carolina Home Sales Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Champion has also agreed to buy the leases of 37 of Ted Parker  
Homes' 42 retail centers in North Carolina, South Carolina and 
Mississippi. The company may eventually buy the leases of the 
remaining five sales lots as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Parker and Carolina Home Sales filed for Chapter 11  
bankruptcy protection on July 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Katz, director of reorganization for Ted Parker Home Sales,  
said the sale also may help about 400 Ted Parker Home Sales 
employees laid off two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with both companies expect the sale to be completed  
next week.

<HEADLINE> French Authorities Rule Against BNP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French banking authorities ruled early Saturday  
that hostile bidder Banque Nationale de Paris cannot keep its stake 
in its unwilling target, Societe Generale, effectively ending BNP's 
hopes of creating Europe's largest bank in terms of assets. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the six-month-long takeover fight may not be over since  
BNP can still contest the ruling with France's highest 
administrative court, the Council of State. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taking into account the results of the takeover bid offer, BNP  
``doesn't hold in a patent manner an effective power of control 
over Societe Generale,'' the Committee of Credit and Investment 
Institutions said in a statement following a marathon 11-hour 
meeting that began Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``In these conditions, the committee decided ... not to  
authorize BNP to hold a stake representing 31.8 percent of voting 
rights in Societe Generale,'' the CECEI said. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking watchdog, headed by Bank of France Governor  
Jean-Claude Trichet, said the ruling came after intense efforts to 
broker a negotiated outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, BNP launched a two-pronged $37 billion hostile  
takeover bid offer for Societe Generale and Paribas, which were in 
the midst of merging their operations to create a banking giant 
called SG-Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP won control of Paribas, though it garnered only a 37.1  
percent stake -- and 31.8 percent of the voting rights -- in Societe 
Generale, leaving the outcome with the regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The CECEI had said that it would intervene in the stock market  
battle if a bank fail to gain 50.01 percent of the voting rights in 
its target. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision allowing BNP to keep its stake would have allowed BNP  
to move further toward its goal of a three-way merger. 
</P>
<P>
	French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, interviewed on  
French television late Friday, took a neutral stance on the 
takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever the outcome will be, it'll be a good thing for French  
economy,'' Strauss-Kahn said on TF1 television. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP had claimed it had enough shares for effective control over  
Societe Generale. But Societe Generale had vigorously opposed BNP, 
saying its hostile suitor would not have the authority to make 
major decisions for the bank.

<HEADLINE> Mir Crew Prepares To Head Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- On a sad day for the Russian space program, the  
crew of the Mir space station prepared today to head back to Earth 
and leave the orbiter unmanned in preparations for its abandonment 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mood here is businesslike, but gloomy,'' said Valery  
Lyndin, the spokesman for the Mission Control center in the town of 
Korolyov near Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev and Sergei Avdeyev, along  
with French astronaut Jean-Pierre Haignere, are scheduled to move 
from the station to the Soyuz escape capsule later today. 
</P>
<P>
	They are to depart from the station at 1:14 a.m. local time  
Saturday and land about three hours later in a deserted steppe in 
the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to abandon the 13-year-old Mir, by far the world's  
longest-serving space station, came after the cash-strapped 
government decided to stop financing its operation and all attempts 
to attract private funds failed. 
</P>
<P>
	In a last-ditch effort to raise cash, the state-run RKK Energia  
company that owns the Mir, decided to postpone discarding the ship 
for good until early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Few believe that money will be found, meaning that the  
government will have to pay for a final mission to the Mir in late 
February or March to safely discard it. 
</P>
<P>
	If that happens, a crew of two will spend about a month aboard  
the station, gradually lowering its orbit. Right after the 
cosmonauts leave, ground controllers will send the 140-ton station 
to burn up in the atmosphere, with any surviving fragments falling 
into the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Mission Control has dismissed fears that the deserted Mir may  
spin out of control and crash on land. ``The Mir's command system 
is reliably backed up to guarantee it from failure,'' Lyndin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the crew leaves, Mission Control will switch off  
most of the Mir's systems, including the central computer that 
keeps the station's solar panels facing the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there will be enough energy left to restart the  
computer, Lyndin said. The station's climate control system will 
keep the station from freezing, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, another official warned that no funds have  
been earmarked yet to build the two booster rockets necessary to 
take the final crew to the Mir and deliver a cargo ship that would 
push the station into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still no money for that, and Energia is seriously  
concerned because it bears responsibility for the safe discarding 
of the station,'' said Yuri Grigoryev, Energia's deputy chief, 
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mir has had a patchy safety record that includes a fire, a  
near-fatal collision with a cargo ship and numerous computer 
breakdowns, but it has been running relatively smoothly in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. space agency NASA has long urged Russia to bring the  
Mir down and concentrate its scarce resources on a new 
international space station that is behind schedule because of 
Moscow's failure to build key components. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russian space officials and cosmonauts have been reluctant  
to part with the Mir, the last symbol of the nation's once-glorious 
space program. 
</P>
<P>
	They fear that without a space project of its own, Russia will  
be left playing second fiddle to the United States in the new 
station.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Transit Riding on Buses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Planning a visit to the 2002 Winter  
Olympics? Officials hope you'll pack comfortable boots and leave 
the car keys behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee and Utah transportation  
officials, who released their draft transit plan Friday, have 
nailed down very few of the details for ferrying the 65,000 
expected Olympic visitors between downtown Salt Lake City and nine 
venues scattered through the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	But they already expect to lean heavily on buses and a string of  
temporary parking lots to handle the thousands who refuse to leave 
their cars at home. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC plans to spend more than $58 million to build seven lots,  
plus another $24 million for infrastructure like shuttle drop-offs 
and pedestrian paths. Nearly $170 million more will be spent 
upgrading roads, intersections, signs and overpasses near the 
venues and a pedestrian bridge near the Olympic Village. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials are still hoping to persuade many spectators to  
stay off the roads. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you get on the bus, you can leave the driving to the  
professionals,'' said Tom Warne, executive director of the Utah 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	And there will be a lot of professionals behind the wheels of  
some 1,400 buses, compared to 900 used in the 1998 Winter Games in 
Nagano, Japan. Most will shuttle spectators from parking lots to 
the venues. Others will run special routes in Salt Lake City, Park 
City, Ogden, and other venue cities, or maintain regular service. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities from across the country have already volunteered 1,000  
buses for the games. Drivers may be a tougher problem. Commercial 
operators will be asked to provide -- and may be allowed to charge a 
fee for -- additional tour buses to move people from Salt Lake to 
distant venues, a hilly trip difficult for public buses. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, if SLOC officials have their way, the games may look a  
lot like the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada, where 609 
local buses and 657 long-range shuttles carried spectators between 
nine sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Calgary, light rail will also come into play. Salt Lake  
City's north-south trolley line is expected to open in December 
with 23 cars, and officials are still hoping a controversial 
east-west line will get approval, which would add 11 more. Warne 
said officials would like to borrow enough cars to bring the total 
to 96 during the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Another big question is cost. Calgary spectators spent $15 to  
ride the long-distance buses. But John English of the Utah Transit 
Authority said they might also find a model in Atlanta's Olympics, 
where ticketholders got free transportation between the venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Though shuttles are likely to be free, SLOC president Mitt  
Romney said he's tempted to institute a fee at the park-and-ride 
lots to encourage carpooling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might charge people a couple of bucks to get them to say,  
`Fill that car to the brim,''' Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney and Warne also said they hope local commuters will make  
an effort to carpool or telecommute in order to keep the roads 
clear. And SLOC is urging businesses to allow employees to work 
more flexible hours during the 17 days of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, UDOT is thinking about bringing in extra snowplows  
to make sure heavy mountain snow dooesn't tie up traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't ever want to be in a position where some world-class  
athlete didn't make it to the venue,'' Warne said. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the concern, however, Warne joked that in some ways  
Olympic transportation may be easier to plan for than Brigham Young 
University football games -- where the same number of visitors cram 
streets around the Provo stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is still in a very general draft form, and each venue  
city is expected to hold public debates before details are 
solidified. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the beginning for us,'' Romney said. ``We put something  
on the table and say, `What do you think about this?' and I'll be 
shocked if it looks the same.''

<HEADLINE> WWII Slave Labor Deal Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- U.S. and German mediators trying to work  
out a deal between German companies and World War II-era slave 
laborers said today the sticking point now is how much victims 
should be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest round in the ongoing talks involving lawyers, company  
representatives, Jewish groups and officials from Israel and 
central European nations ended Thursday without a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties meet again Oct. 6 in Washington, but Jewish groups  
hope that German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder can help break the 
deadlock during a meeting Sept. 6 with industry leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. envoy Stuart Eizenstat and chief German negotiator Otto  
Lamsdorff told a joint news conference today that financial demands 
by victims' lawyers were way too high. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the financial side could be taken care of -- the money --  
then many other problems would resolve themselves,'' Eizenstat 
said. Negotiators need to come up with a figure that the companies 
can handle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mediators did not release what specific figures were discussed  
during two days of talks in Bonn, but one of the victims' lawyers, 
Deborah Sturman, said their demand is more than the $20 billion 
previously reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty billion doesn't sound too high and it's going to be  
more,'' Sturman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Basing a calculation on 2.3 million eligible survivors estimated  
by the lawyers, each would receive about $800, she said. Another 
estimate presented at the meeting put the number of eligible 
survivors at 1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamsdorff said the victims' monetary demands ``are way off the  
mark'' and would scare away other companies thinking of joining the 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 16 companies have agreed to join the fund, but they are  
seeking immunity from future slave labor claims in return. The 
terms for legal protection were still in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat said the U.S. government would take the  
``unprecedented'' step of asking for dismissal of future suits, 
emphasizing to the courts that the so-called industry fund is the 
proper forum for settling claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Considerable progress was made during the talks on determining  
who would be eligible for the fund, the mediators said. Industry 
officials, however, have criticized the victims' lawyers for trying 
to expand the group of eligibles. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel Singer, executive secretary of the World Jewish Congress,  
offered his own criticism today, saying that the fund should be for 
Holocaust victims, not all war victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``One should not try to make every victim a Holocaust victim,''  
Singer said on Berlin's InfoRadio. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides also agreed to include insurance companies, banks  
and former public companies that are now privately owned. 
Additional claims from the formerly public companies could include 
``tens of thousands'' of other workers, Eizenstat said. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier talks, there had been complaints over a proposal to  
pay Eastern Europeans less -- in proportion to local wages -- but 
Eizenstat said the sides agreed this week that where survivors 
lives will have no impact on how much they get. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany has already paid more than $54 billion to Holocaust  
victims for their suffering, but deferred settlement of slave labor 
claims to the companies that benefitted from their labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder's government has, however, pledged to establish a  
second federally administered fund for previously uncompensated 
Holocaust victims, including those who worked for agriculture and 
for companies run by the Nazi SS. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamsdorff told the session that parliament would take the matter

<HEADLINE> Consumer Finance Co. Seeks Chap. 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A consumer finance company ordered by a  
judge to pay $168 million in damages has filed for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection from about 240,000 people who financed home 
satellite systems through the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing allows A.G. Financial Service Center Inc., a  
subsidiary of American General Finance Inc. of Evansville, Ind., to 
keep creditors at bay while it reorganizes its finances. 
</P>
<P>
	All but about $2 million of the $170 million in debts A.G.  
Financial listed in its bankruptcy petition result from the 
judgment pending in a Mississippi state court. A.G. Financial 
reported about $7.2 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	A.G. Financial has not been in operation since it sold much of  
its assets in June, said chairman Bettina Whyte. She said 52 
lawsuits are pending against the company, many of which are related 
to loans it made for consumers to purchase home satellite systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is appealing a May ruling that it must pay 29  
plaintiffs a total of $167.7 million in damages, most of them 
punitive. The plaintiffs all purchased satellite systems that were 
financed through A.G. Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin P. Dempsey, assistant U.S. trustee, said most of the  
240,000 creditors A.G. Financial is seeking protection from are 
residents of Southern states who purchased the satellite systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The court cited instances where plaintiffs paid hundreds of  
dollars on the accounts, but their balances never decreased. The 
company's agents had advertised a monthly financing rate without 
disclosing that it would result in negative amortization, the court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas-based American General Corp., the parent company of A.G.  
Financial and American General Finance Inc., has said A.G. 
Financial acted properly in making credit available for the 
satellite systems.

<HEADLINE> Strike Looming for Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- After more than a year of negotiations, The  
Boeing Co. is prepared to make a final contract offer to its 
largest union, hoping to ward off a strike by thousands of workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks between company officials and leaders of the International  
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers ended late Thursday 
with no agreement. Boeing was to present its offer today. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said he was optimistic, but he  
acknowledged the company has already painted a perimeter for 
picketers around its plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials said it seems likely their 44,000 workers will  
strike the world's largest aerospace company next week, with both 
sides acknowledging a lack of consensus on major issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just going to take a miracle to put all the pieces  
together,'' said Bill Johnson, a member of the union's negotiating 
team. ``I don't see it happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials will review Boeing's offer over the weekend  
before making a recommendation for a rank-and-file vote on 
Wednesday. Since the current contract expires Wednesday at 
midnight, a strike could begin immediately if authorized by 
two-thirds of the Machinists. 
</P>
<P>
	The union wants to preserve jobs, improve medical benefits and  
increase pensions. Boeing is seeking to cut costs through 
subcontracting, paying less for health benefits and adopting a 
flexible work week. 
</P>
<P>
	The average machinist at Boeing earns $40,000 a year before  
benefits or overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The current 44-month contract covers 31,000 workers in  
Washington state, 1,400 in Portland, Ore., and 11,600 in Wichita, 
Kan. In July, Machinists in all three states voted overwhelmingly 
to support a strike if negotiations fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Strikes have resulted during two of the past three Boeing  
contract talks, the most recent lasting 69 days in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Rain Helping Drought in East Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- It will take more than a few rain showers to  
satiate the parched East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Green grass, budding trees and sudden rain over the past few  
weeks are only disguising a lingering, nasty dry spell. It's so bad 
that forecasters say the best solution might be a couple of 
hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``A drought is not something that we can say, `Hey, it's rained,  
now it's over,''' said Mark Tobin, a meteorologist with the private 
forecaster AccuWeather. ``A drought is a big huge monster that 
slowly develops over time, and slowly goes away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rainfall has edged closer to normal this month for most of the  
East, but remains 6 inches to 13 inches below normal for the year, 
the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials and meteorologists say it would take several  
weeks of above-average rainfall to repair current water levels -- 
and to beat the drought, it would take several months of good rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Dennis or another other tropical storm could prove  
welcome rainmakers, should they trek through mid-Atlantic and 
Northeast states as they weaken. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hopeful that these couple of hurricanes will bring us  
some rain,'' said Bob Will, a commissioner in Pennsylvania's 
drought-stricken Somerset County. Forecasters say the storm's path 
is far from certain, and it might not hit land at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the bad news continues to mount.  
</P>
<P>
	Federal agriculture officials on Thursday declared North  
Carolina a drought disaster area, joining Kentucky, West Virginia, 
Delaware, Massachusetts and South Carolina. Similar disaster 
declarations have been issued in parts of six western states and 16 
states east of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	This despite soaking rains in some areas.  
</P>
<P>
	In central and eastern North Carolina, a thunderstorm packing  
65-mph winds overturned a trailer, threw a storage building onto a 
car and damaged three planes at the Craven County airport. No one 
was injured in the storm, which dumped 2 1/2 inches of rain at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	While 3 inches of heavy rain tangled the commute in New York  
City on Thursday, the city was still 6 inches below normal for the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland is still inches short of being out of drought  
conditions, even though 7 inches of rain fell Wednesday in Anne 
Arundel County, Md., and up to 8 inches more poured onto the 
Baltimore area Thursday. The storms left 49,000 people without 
power and almost 14,000 were still affected this morning. Flooding 
also shut down part of the MARC commuter service between Baltimore 
and Washington today. 
</P>
<P>
	Marci Smit of Columbia, Md., said her family sacrificed their  
lawn to save water. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand that we have to do our part,'' Smit said. ``It's  
been looking pretty sad, but ... in the last week, it has started 
to green up a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It rained hard in parts of New Jersey this week, but state  
officials say they aren't yet ready to ease water restrictions 
imposed Aug. 6 
</P>
<P>
	Some parts of Pennsylvania have received up to 8 inches of rain  
this month. On Thursday night, thunderstorms raked across the 
southeastern part of the state, causing local flooding and power 
outages. Rainfall amounts as high as 4 inches were reported in a 
few locations and more than 18,000 homes were without power this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the Susquehanna River is at its lowest point ever,  
western Pennsylvania rivers are being artificially maintained by 
the Army Corps of Engineers and most water suppliers are within a 
few weeks of rationing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't rained enough,'' said Marko Bourne, a spokesman for  
the state Emergency Management Agency. ``We're trying to erase a 
12-month-plus rainfall deficit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the scattered heavy rains are ``a little late,'' said  
Abe Harpster, whose corn crop feeds a 2,000-cow dairy herd in 
south-central Pennsylvania. Many neighbors have already cut their 
stunted corn and the final growth of hay -- if there was any. 
</P>
<P>
	Harpster's farm received more than 3 1/2 inches of rain last week  
and another inch on Thursday afternoon. ``It's helping,'' Harpster 
said. ``But a lot of the damage has been done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the recent showers left him somewhat optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every great drought is followed by great rains,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Golfs With Prince Andrew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton wound down his family  
vacation by playing a jocularly high-stakes round of golf with 
visiting British royalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the game ended badly -- a steady, drenching rain forced  
his party off the course at the 15th hole Friday -- at least Clinton 
didn't lose Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The president joined Britain's Prince Andrew, the duke of York,  
on the links at the Farm Neck Golf Club. He noted that in the 17th 
century the island off the Massachusetts coast was owned by 
Andrew's predecessor dukes of York. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what the bet is? If he beats me, we have to give him  
back the island,'' Clinton said, stopping his golf cart near a 
gaggle of reporters and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game was rained out, the prince came splashing across  
the parking lot toward a black Land Rover. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked the game's outcome, Andrew pulled a crumpled wad of  
American bills from his pocket and replied: ``I have still got a 
little money in my pocket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Clinton returned to the private home where he and his  
family have spent the past week. The family was to leave today for 
a fund-raising weekend at the Hamptons on Long Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the money will go toward Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
possible Senate race in New York. Tonight in East Hampton the 
Clintons are hosts at the airport terminal to a buffet reception of 
the young Democrats' ``Saxophone Club.'' At $250 per person, some 
800 people are expected to turn out for the Clintons and comedian 
Jon Stewart to net about $200,000 for the Democratic National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, it's on to a $1,000 per plate barbecue dinner at a  
private East Hampton residence. Singer Phoebe Snow will entertain 
the 300 people contributing jointly to the DNC, Mrs. Clinton's 
campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the Clintons star at a $5,000-per-person lunch for 80  
at a Southampton home. The first $1,000 of every ticket price, a 
party official said, will go to Mrs. Clinton's race, and the 
remainder will be shared by the DNC and DSCC. 
</P>
<P>
	In the priciest of the galas, rocker Jon Bon Jovi provides the  
music at a Bridgehampton dinner on Sunday night solely benefiting 
the DNC. At $25,000 per couple, the event is expected to bag 
$900,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes worked Friday to  
cram the airwaves in upstate Skaneateles, N.Y., the Clintons' final 
stop on this half-recreational, half-political tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forbes campaign bought five days' worth of spots on three  
Syracuse-area radio stations -- WSYR, WSEN and WNSS -- to hammer at 
the president's opposition to a Republican tax-cut bill pending in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sign the tax cut, Mr. President,'' Forbes says in the ad. ``I  
would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the American Conservative Union purchased television time  
in the upstate region to criticize Clinton's decision to offer 
conditional clemency to 16 imprisoned Puerto Rican militants. Those 
ads are scheduled to run next Monday through Friday.

<HEADLINE> ABC Entertainment President Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jamie Tarses arrived at ABC with the  
reputation of a programming wunderkind, someone who came up with 
monster hits like ``Friends'' and ``Frasier'' for her previous 
employer, NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarses resigned Thursday as president of ABC Entertainment after  
three years of scant ratings success, frequent speculation about 
her job security and ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' as the network's only 
unqualified new hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sweeping changes in the entertainment industry dictated  
necessary, competitive changes at ABC, and I feel that the time is 
right to move on,'' Tarses said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarses, 35, was the first woman to serve as programming  
president at one of the three major networks. But she appeared to 
be undercut by restructuring that added layers of authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Dogged from the start by rumors that her performance was  
inadequate, the speculation intensified after a recent 
reorganization in which parent company Walt Disney Co. merged the 
network and its TV production operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In published reports today, Tarses acknowledged that Disney's  
shuffling prompted her to leave the network. She told The New York 
Times the reorganization led to conflict among executives who were 
``trying to divide up responsibilities and still feel they had some 
autonomy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also said she was tired of the demands the job placed on her  
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been at it for 11 years. At some point, you have to  
wonder, when does your personal happiness factor in?'' she asked. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Lloyd Braun, chairman of Disney's Buena Vista  
Television Productions and Stu Bloomberg, chairman of ABC 
Entertainment, were named co-chairmen of the new ABC Entertainment 
Television Group. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time that Tarses found herself reporting to a  
new boss at ABC. In 1997, Bloomberg's appointment as chairman had 
prompted speculation that her job was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The formation of the new TV group again focused attention on her  
and prompted speculation that she would be asked to resign. Robert 
Iger, ABC Group chairman, called the rumor untrue. 
</P>
<P>
	Media attention on Tarses also heated up in July 1997 after a  
New York Times magazine story appeared with details, many 
unflattering, about how she was perceived in Hollywood and how she 
was coping with her job. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarses told today's Los Angeles Times that the repeated  
speculation about her job status was a major factor in her decision 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``(It was) something that I never signed on for and couldn't get  
away from,'' she said. ``I just don't want to play anymore. The 
work is a blast. The rest of the nonsense I don't need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tarses came to ABC flush with success as senior vice president  
of prime-time series at NBC Entertainment, where she helped craft 
the success of ``Friends'' and ``Frasier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' and critically acclaimed shows like  
``Sports Night'' and ``The Practice'' were launched on her watch, 
ABC couldn't overcome the shrinking audience syndrome affecting 
television generally. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Tarses, however, ABC lost a much smaller percentage of its  
18-to-49 audience last season than first-place NBC. The age group 
is highly coveted by advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Television Network President Pat Fili-Krushel indicated  
Bloomberg and Braun would likely absorb Tarses' role. Bloomberg 
lauded her contributions to ABC and wished her well in ``whatever 
she chooses to do next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tarses told The New York Times she had no immediate career  
plans, but declared: ``I never want to be an executive again.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Said To Oppose FALN Leniency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal law enforcement agencies opposed  
leniency for 16 imprisoned Puerto Rican militants in the weeks 
before President Clinton offered to commute their sentences, The 
New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The clemency petition for the independence activists was flatly  
opposed by the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons and federal prosecutors 
in Illinois and Connecticut, according to government officials who 
spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from the Clinton's vacation spot on Martha's Vineyard,  
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said today, ``All views 
were presented to the president fully and completely and were taken 
into consideration before making the final decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton offered clemency on Aug. 11 to 16 members of the FALN, a  
Spanish acronym for Armed Forces of National Liberation, in 
response to requests from human rights officials who argued that 
their sentences, ranging from 15 years to 90 years, were too harsh. 
The offer came with conditions: that the militants sign statements 
requesting commutation, renounce violence and abide by all 
conditions of release set by law or the Parole Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The FALN members were convicted in a series of bombing attacks  
on U.S. civilian and military targets staged from 1974 to 1983. 
Twelve were convicted in Illinois and four in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Six people were killed and dozens -- including several New York  
police officers -- were wounded in attacks attributed to the group. 
But those offered clemency were not directly involved in attacks 
that resulted in deaths. None of the 16 has yet accepted the 
president's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The imprisoned members of the nationalist group are considered  
political prisoners by many Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	In their recommendations, FBI officials complained about  
granting leniency to members of a militant group that had claimed 
responsibility for terrorist acts at a time when the United States 
was engaged in a worldwide battle against terrorism, the Times 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Bureau of Prisons concluded that if militants  
were released, they might resume their activism, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Republican speculation that Clinton may have acted now  
to help his wife, Hillary, court New York's Puerto Rican vote for 
her possible U.S. Senate bid, Lockart said he was unaware of the 
first lady being involved in any way.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Zimmer Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer missed  
Friday night's game against Seattle after being hospitalized 
because of a heart ailment that flared up. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, 68, was admitted to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center  
on Thursday night for evaluation of a cardiac abnormality, which 
the Yankees described as ``minor.'' The team said Zimmer had been 
treated for the same problem in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer was still in the hospital Friday, and it was not known  
when he would rejoin the team. The Yankees said he also was 
bothered by neck pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Now in his 51st season of professional baseball, Zimmer guided  
the AL East-leading Yankees to a 21-15 record this year as interim 
manager while Joe Torre was recovering from prostate cancer 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer has been slowed by a sore knee, and has said he will  
undergo knee replacement surgery after the season.

<HEADLINE> Support Dwindles for Black Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite a history of inflammatory speech,  
Khallid Abdul Muhammad found the doors to some of Harlem's most 
treasured institutions open to him in the days before last year's 
Million Youth March. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Nation of Islam spokesman held meetings at Sylvia's  
soul food restaurant and press conferences at the Abyssinian 
Baptist Church, the historic center of Harlem's spiritual and 
political life. Many of Harlem's politicians were reluctant to 
denounce an event dedicated to black and Latino youth. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, many of those doors have been slammed shut.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 rally attracted a fraction of the 200,000 people  
Muhammad had hoped for and featured dozens of speakers who 
excoriated Jews and whites. It ended with 28 injuries when police 
in riot gear approached the stage and Muhammad exhorted the 
audience to beat or shoot officers who threatened them. 
</P>
<P>
	Since that September day when Muhammad was hustled off stage by  
his personal security team, Harlem leaders say he has rarely been 
seen in the community and has done little to build grass-roots 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	When Muhammad held a news conference this week to announce plans  
for a second Million Youth March on Labor Day weekend, the event 
was not held at the Abyssinian Baptist Church but on the sidewalk 
outside the Apollo Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Muhammad's backing is at such a low ebb that politicians  
who had been reluctant to criticize him for fear of alienating 
segments of the black community have been taking very public shots 
at him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This march shouldn't take place in Harlem or anywhere but  
hell, and Khallid can go down there with it,'' said City Councilman 
Bill Perkins, who has surfaced as Muhammad's most outspoken critic 
in the black community. ``There is no support for it. Period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We would rather not have the march through the streets of  
Harlem. We don't want that again,'' said Stanley Gleaton, the 
president of the local community board. 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad is also locked in another battle with City Hall. The  
city has again denied him a permit to march and Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani has repeatedly called it a ``hate march.'' Last year's 
march took place only after organizers went to federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys representing Muhammad say they will return to federal  
court again to win the right to march down Malcolm X Boulevard on 
Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad this week vowed to march anyway, declaring that ``no  
devil, racist, cantankerous, constipated cracker like Mayor 
Giuliani can stop (the march).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The obstacles against Muhammad are formidable: Nearly every  
elected official who represents Harlem, from Perkins and Gleaton to 
U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, has denounced him. Many residents and 
business owners in the neighborhood say another march would cause 
too many disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're saying it's a waste of time for people to come out,''  
said Rangel. 
</P>
<P>
	Other residents ask where money they donated to Muhammad last  
year for youth programs has gone. And even Muhammad's former 
colleagues in the Nation of Islam, which offered support last year, 
have chosen to watch from the sidelines this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad, a former top aide to Nation of Islam leader Louis  
Farrakhan, was kicked out of the group partly due to his constant 
verbal attacks on Jews, Catholics, whites and others. He has taken 
to calling black elected officials who do not support him ``Uncle 
Toms'' and ``boot lickers'' for whites. 
</P>
<P>
	The increasing isolation of Muhammad and organizers of the march  
prompted a bizarre confrontation caught by television cameras 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving a Harlem forum where Democratic presidential candidate  
Bill Bradley answered questions from the community, Perkins was 
jostled and called an ``Uncle Tom'' for not supporting the march. 
Someone told him: ``We should kill people like you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins has since been granted police protection.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Nearly Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar remained at a virtual standstill  
Friday as currency traders mulled statements by Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan in which he questioned the value of the 
stock market.

	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0459, up  
from $1.0455 late Thursday. The dollar also was quoted at 111.56 
Japanese yen, up from 111.54. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, speaking Friday at a Kansas City Federal Reserve bank  
meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyo., said the extraordinary rise in stock 
prices the last five years has been mostly inexplicable, pushing 
the Dow lower for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	David Solin, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex,  
Conn., said the concern spilled over into the currency markets. The 
slight dip against the euro was likely caused traders selling 
dollars in fear of a potential stock selloff in the U.S., he said. 
The yen was essentially unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had to be the slowest day of the year,'' Solin said.

<P>
	Furthermore, Monday is a bank holiday in London and many traders  
apparently took a long weekend, which contributed to Friday's quiet 
session.

	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8702 German 
marks, down from 1.8721; 6.2722 French francs, down from 6.2788; 
and 1,851 Italian lire, down from 1,854.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Vent About Bank Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They're angry and they're not going to take it  
anymore. Or at least they're incensed enough to write letters to 
federal banking regulators. In some cases, they've cut up their 
credit cards in an act of commercial disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are up in arms over financial privacy and the  
practices of banks, judging from a sample of recent letters sent to 
the Treasury Department, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and 
other agencies. The sample was drawn from 760 such letters received 
by federal regulators from July 1998 through July 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was utterly shocked to realize my own bank would provide my  
credit card number to what I feel are unethical, if not illegal, 
telemarketers,'' one consumer told the Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency, a Treasury division that oversees nationally 
chartered banks. ``The next day I went to the ... (bank) branch to 
cancel my card.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted overwhelmingly on July 1 to give people the  
right to block banks and other financial companies from sharing 
their personal data with outside firms, such as telemarketers. The 
lawmakers, who stayed up late to pass the measure on the eve of 
their Fourth of July recess, were tapping into an American nerve. 
</P>
<P>
	No comparable measure has cleared the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	Copies of the letters were obtained by The Associated Press  
under the Freedom of Information Act. The names of consumers and 
their financial institutions were blacked out -- to protect their 
privacy, of course. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters weren't prompted by the congressional action; they  
arose from consumers' anger at their financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, the government tried to institute a rule that  
would have required banks to track their customers' transaction 
patterns, the ``Know Your Customer'' rule. That brought a public 
outcry over privacy, forcing federal agencies to scrap the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The House privacy provision was attached to sweeping legislation  
that would lift Depression-era prohibitions and allow banks, 
securities firms and insurance companies to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	It would still allow banks and other financial companies that  
are affiliated with each other to share customer data, such as 
addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and 
checking and credit card account information. Data sharing is a 
major reason why financial companies want to merge, as it opens 
numerous opportunities for the companies to market their range of 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	In the view of many consumers, however, such data sharing is a  
gross invasion of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please accept this letter as total objection to your 'New  
Terms,' which you claim allow you to share information on me or my 
account with anyone. Your bank is the limit on high charges, low 
interest payments and marginal service to your customers,'' a 
consumer wrote his or her bank in February, copying in the U.S. 
Comptroller's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your most recent attempt to share information (on) our  
account, probably at a price and profit . . . is inconceivable and 
reprehensible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another consumer, who tore up his or her credit card and sent it  
back to the issuing bank with the final payment, explained why in a 
letter last September to the chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an ugly trend looming in the banking and credit  
industry which is not in the least bit beneficial to the consumer. 
I have found this bank to be using some of these predatory 
tendencies to abuse the clientele, namely me,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not want my name given to people who want to sell useless  
and inane services which I do not need. I do not want my account 
charged by anybody ... whom I have not authorized to use my 
credit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, Minnesota's attorney general sued U.S. Bancorp, the  
largest bank based in the state, alleging that it illegally sold 
customer data to a telemarketing firm and pocketed $4 million in 
commissions, while promising customers in writing that their 
account information would be kept confidential. And California 
began investigating banks' privacy practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry defends its record on protecting customers'  
privacy and has warned that new laws restricting data sharing could 
deprive consumers of useful financial services.

<HEADLINE> Bush Backs Some Gun-Control Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, bringing his GOP  
presidential campaign to an area stung by episodes of wanton gun 
violence, today endorsed efforts in Congress to raise the legal age 
for gun ownership to 21 from 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also backed proposals in Congress to outlaw certain large  
ammunition clips and repeated his support for background checks on 
firearms sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support them all,'' Bush said when asked about the  
proposals. ``These are all reasonable measures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have attacked Bush as being soft on gun control,  
noting he has spoken against government-mandated gun registration, 
signed legislation barring cities in Texas from suing gun makers 
for the costs of violence, and deemed mandatory child safety locks 
on firearms impractical to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush today stressed his core belief in gun rights. ``I believe  
innocent people, law-abiding citizens, ought to be allowed to own a 
gun,'' he told reporters. ``I believe they ought to be allowed to 
hunt and protect themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said previously he would have voted for legislation defeated  
by the House that would have required a 24-hour background check on 
weapons sales at gun shows. Most Democrats pushed for a longer 
waiting period and argued a 24-hour mandate actually would have 
allowed some gun show sales to move faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was ending a three-day Southern campaign swing in the  
Atlanta area, where several shootings this summer commanded 
national attention. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 29, Mark O. Barton shot and killed nine people at two  
day-trading firms in Atlanta before committing suicide. Barely two 
weeks earlier, a gunman killed two women and four children in their 
Atlanta home before killing himself. In May, a 15-year-old boy 
opened fire at his high school in suburban Conyers, wounding six 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush started the day touring a church-run homeless shelter. He  
held it out as an example of a religious organization that should 
be eligible for government money.

<HEADLINE> Versatile Mulholland Boosts Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A year ago, Terry Mulholland's mere presence on  
the mound seemed to awaken his father from a 12-day coma. 
</P>
<P>
	While nothing quite so dramatic has occurred since joining the  
Atlanta Braves, Mulholland has been a vital addition to the team 
with baseball's best record. 
</P>
<P>
	Start the game? Sure, no problem. Middle relief? That's OK, too.  
The final inning? Consider it done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just show up and do what I can to help us win the ballgame,  
whether it's starting, relieving or picking up the balls in batting 
practice,'' said Mulholland, acquired from the Chicago Cubs along 
with Jose Hernandez just before the July 31 trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mulholland's overall numbers this season (7-7, 4.84 ERA,  
one save) are not very impressive, his value to Atlanta has been 
demonstrated the past two weeks: 
</P>
<P>
	--On Aug. 14, he pitched 1 2-3 innings of relief against Los  
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	--Three days later, he started against Colorado and allowed only  
three runs in seven innings at Coors Field. 
</P>
<P>
	--Two days after that, he was back on the mound against the  
Rockies, pitching the 14th inning to pick up a save. 
</P>
<P>
	--Finally, he started on two days rest against San Diego, giving  
up just two runs in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got Terry, everyone in here realized the importance of  
it, though I'm not sure people outside the clubhouse realized,'' 
Braves starter Tom Glavine said. ``The guy is very versatile. He 
seemingly has a rubber arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland learned to live every day to the fullest when his  
father contracted a viral infection in the brain and lapsed into a 
coma in August 1998. For 12 days, the senior Mulholland (also named 
Terry, though father and son have different middle names) hung 
between life and death. 
</P>
<P>
	Another son, Danny, went to the hospital in Uniontown, Pa., when  
it appeared the father wasn't going to survive. The younger Terry, 
meanwhile, remained in Chicago to play a game with the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Danny was in the hospital room with dad and they had it all  
dark and quiet,'' Mulholland recalls. ``Well, Danny figured if the 
guy was on the way out, he might as well watch one last ballgame. 
He turned on the TV -- we were on WGN -- and as luck would have it, I 
came into the ballgame to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they announced my name on television, dad came out of the  
coma and decided to watch the ballgame. ... He was actually getting 
frustrated with all the doctors and nurses leaning over him to 
check his heart and blood pressure and all that. He was trying to 
watch TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland's left arm also seems blessed with some mystical  
power. 
</P>
<P>
	While many of his younger teammates have to attach a bulky bag  
of ice to their pitching arm after every appearance, the 
36-year-old Mulholland never seems flustered, never seems tired, 
never seems sore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I show up, make my relief appearance or make my start, take my  
shower and go home,'' he said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland has been on the disabled list only twice in his  
13-year career -- and one of those times his body can't be held 
responsible. In 1988, his forearm was broken by a line drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of hard to pitch with a broken forearm,'' he joked.  
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland's durability and versatility have been a blessing for  
the injury plagued Braves, who acquired him shortly after losing 
fifth starter Odalis Perez for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Maddux cracked a bone in his wrist last weekend, forcing  
him to miss tonight's scheduled start at St. Louis. Mulholland, of 
course, will step in, anxious to get back on the mound after four 
full days of rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland also provides insurance behind John Smoltz, pitching  
with a tenuous elbow that already has landed him on the DL twice 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Braves general manager John Schuerholz insisted that Mulholland  
be part of the deal with the Cubs, who didn't want to give him up 
since he still has another year on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Versatility was an attraction, but it wasn't the primary  
attraction,'' Schuerholz said. ``What was most important to our 
scouts was they thought he was a real competitive guy, a real 
warrior. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things get tough in a pennant race, you want to have a  
guy like Terry Mulholland on your team.''

<HEADLINE> Bulls Ready To Re-Sign Armstrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls keep looking for future help  
from their past. 
</P>
<P>
	First, they signed ex-center Will Perdue. Now they're on the  
verge doing the same with guard B.J. Armstrong, who played on the 
first three of six Bulls teams that won NBA titles in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said he had reached a verbal agreement for a deal  
reported to be for one year at $1 million. The Bulls said Friday 
the contract had not been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's partly physical stuff and some i's to dot and t's to  
cross,'' Bulls spokesman Tim Hallam said. ``We're looking at Monday 
or Tuesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was the No. 18 pick in the 1989 draft out of Iowa. His  
best season was 1994, when he averaged 14.8 points and four assists 
per game. After the 1994-95 season he was left unprotected in the 
expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	He was picked by Toronto, which traded him to Golden State. He  
also played with Charlotte, was traded to Lakers and released and 
then signed by Orlando. Last year in 32 games, he averaged three 
points and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's wife was born in Chicago, and he has continued to  
maintain a home in the suburbs.

<HEADLINE> Study: Risk Low From Colo. Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- An exhaustive study on cancer risks from secret  
radioactive and chemical releases at the former Rocky Flats nuclear 
weapons plant found no great danger to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is the risks at Rocky Flats were low, and the  
public was lucky that this was the case,'' said James LaVelle, a 
consulting toxicologist on the study. ``Many of the releases and 
risks could have been much worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, there were information gaps in the nine-year study --  
the result of the defense industry's secrecy and lack of government 
oversight, particularly in the early years of the Cold War, 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't even know where all the stuff is. We don't have a  
record of where they buried some of the barrels,'' said Niels 
Schonbeck, a panel member and biochemistry professor at 
Metropolitan State College in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The study released Thursday is the largest yet of public risks  
from releases at Rocky Flats in the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said people with the highest risk of cancer were  
working outside the plant when smoke spread plutonium during a 1957 
fire. The risk was estimated from as high as one case in 10,000 to 
one in 25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, 15 miles northwest of downtown Denver, began  
producing plutonium bombs and bomb parts in 1952. State officials 
in the 1980s raised concerns about potential health hazards, and 
the plant was closed after the FBI raided it in 1989 to investigate 
allegations of environmental crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1957 fire was kept secret until 1969, the same year another  
fire released plutonium into the environment. Also, 1,000 to 5,000 
tons of a chemical solvent leaked through air vents and waste 
barrels during the 1960s, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the state advisory panel that oversaw the study  
cautioned there are still potential risks because of the $7 billion 
state and federal cleanup, estimated to take 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The citizens around the site are not out of the woods with  
regard to Rocky Flats,'' said John Till, president of Radiological 
Assessments Corp., which helped conduct the study. ``Something 
still could happen. The public needs to be aware of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the FBI raid, a federal grand jury in 1992 returned  
indictments against key officials for plant manager Rockwell Corp. 
and the Energy Department. Then-U.S. Attorney Mike Norton refused 
to sign the indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	Some grand jurors denounced the government's failure to issue  
indictments, putting out a scathing report on its investigation. 
But the report was sealed. An edited version later became public. 
</P>
<P>
	The case ended with a controversial plea bargain that led  
Rockwell to pay $18.5 million in federal fines, but no individuals 
were charged.

<HEADLINE> Sergeant Accused of Sex Misconduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- An Army drill sergeant was placed on  
administrative duty and charged with 25 counts of sexual misconduct 
and other improper conduct with 25 female recruits, a post 
spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The military's equivalent of a grand jury, an Article 32 board,  
is continuing to investigate the allegations against Sgt. 1st Class 
Yoosuf Asad, who works at Fort Jackson, spokesman Doug Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	All the women, who started training June 30, were assigned to  
Asad's platoon, Cook said. One of the recruits complained to 
another drill sergeant Aug. 20, prompting the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no indication any other drill sergeants were involved,  
Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asad, at Fort Jackson for about two years, referred questions to  
his lawyer but hung up when asked to identify him. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven recruits alleged sexual assault and nine cited  
inappropriate physical contact, Cook said. Five recruits complained 
of improper associations, which can include inappropriate remarks, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook would not characterize the nature of the sexual assaults,  
citing the ongoing investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigating board can recommend a court-martial, dismiss  
some or all of the charges, add counts or modify the charges, Cook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, a former Fort Jackson drill sergeant was sentenced to  
eight years in prison for sexual misconduct with female trainees, 
the fifth court-martial involving drill sergeants at the base since 
an Army sex scandal broke the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Jackson is the Army's largest basic training post.

<HEADLINE> Galloway Rejects Seahawks Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Seattle Seahawks receiver Joey Galloway won't  
accept what the team has called its final contract offer, 
Galloway's agent said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave us a Friday deadline to accept the offer and we're  
not going to accept it,'' agent Eric Metz said. ``It's up to them 
now whether or not they want to offer another deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seahawks spokesman Dave Pearson said the team wouldn't make  
another offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway missed training camp as he sought to renegotiate and  
extend a contract he signed in 1995. He led the Seahawks last 
season with 65 receptions for 1,047 yards and 10 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks offered Galloway a seven-year, $35 million deal,  
with a $7 million signing bonus. Galloway wants a five-year, $24 
million contract, with a $9 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway's camp has said the receiver is willing to sit out the  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Holmgren, also the general manager, said Thursday the  
Seahawks would survive without Galloway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next guy steps up and plays,'' Holmgren said. ``We're  
going to do the same stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starting receiver Michael Pritchard is out 2-3 weeks while  
recovering from knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	To add depth, the Seahawks signed receiver Phil Savoy off  
waivers from the Baltimore Ravens on Wednesday. Savoy, who played 
at Colorado, was drafted in the seventh round by the Arizona 
Cardinals in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Reservation Attack Details Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PIERRE, S.D. (AP) -- The man that found a beating victim on the  
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation said there was no rope around his 
neck as the sheriff had said, though the victim's mother on Friday 
said she saw rope burns on her son's neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Details about the assault on Bradley Dean Young, 22, were  
unclear. Neither federal authorities nor Bennett County Sheriff 
Russel Waterbury returned calls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Waterbury had earlier called the assault a hate crime, then said  
he didn't mean that it was racially motivated. Waterbury also said 
Young was found with a rope around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Young was badly beaten but there was no rope around his neck  
when Marlin Fineran first found him in a field on the edge of the 
reservation, Fineran told The Rapid City Journal on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Young's mother, Carol Bucholz, told The Associated Press she saw  
rope burns on his neck when she saw him at Rapid City Regional 
Hospital, where Young remained in a coma on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were rope marks on his neck,'' she said Friday. She also  
said he had been dragged, but not by a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Indians from the reservation have been charged with assault,  
and a juvenile has been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and federal authorities have not filed any hate-crime  
charges, but said they're not ruling it out.

<HEADLINE> Karsay Joins Indians DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Steve Karsay, who a week ago appeared to be the  
Indians' pitching savior, was placed on the 15-day disabled list 
Friday because of a strained tendon in his right forearm. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more of a preventive thing than anything,'' Indians  
manager Mike Hargrove said. ``Every indication we've gotten from 
our doctors is that Steve will come back as strong as ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karsay began the season as the Indians' long reliever, going 8-1  
with a 2.66 ERA in 42 appearances. But after injuries put Dwight 
Gooden, Jaret Wright and Mark Langston on the disabled list, the 
Indians moved Karsay, who began his career as a starter, into the 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 2-0 with a 0.90 ERA in two starts, and Hargrove hinted  
that Karsay might be put in Cleveland's postseason rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	But that all changed Wednesday night in Oakland, when Karsay's  
forearm tightened and he was forced to leave after three innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve was ready,'' Hargrove said. ``This was something he  
wanted to do and looked forward to doing. I'm the one who made the 
call to move him to the starting rotation because we had a need 
because of our injuries. I think it was a logical move, a logical 
transition and for whatever reason, it didn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove isn't convinced Karsay's injury was a result of  
overworking his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a serious problem,'' Hargrove said. ``Steve has a  
history of arm problems. We were very aware of that and cognizant 
of the risk. Steve was more than ready to assume that (starter's) 
role. It just didn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karsay, whose 10-game winning streak is the longest in the  
majors this season and the longest by an Indians pitcher since 
1975, will return to the bullpen once he's activated, Hargrove 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	To fill Karsay's roster spot, the Indians recalled left-handed  
reliever Tom Martin from Triple-A Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	With Karsay on the DL for the second time this season -- he was  
out from July 2-26 with a strained side muscle -- the Indians have 
nine players on the disabled list, including four starters.

<HEADLINE> Gatson Hurts Knee in Gymnastics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Jason Gatson, a national title within  
his reach after coming close the last three years, tore a knee 
ligament while dismounting from the uneven bars Friday night and 
dropped out of the U.S. Gymnastics Championships while leading the 
all-around competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury could keep one of the United States' most promising  
male gymnasts out of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson, 18, who finished second in 1996 and '98 and was third in  
the national championships in 1997, held a slim lead over training 
partner Blaine Wilson at the start of the all-around finals Friday. 
He built that lead in Wednesday's preliminary phase of the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	He was injured on the first of Friday's six events. His right  
knee buckled as he flew off the uneven bars, and he fell to the 
side of the mat. After getting iced on the competition floor, he 
was helped to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson's injury probably cleared the way for Wilson to claim an  
unprecedented fourth straight national all-around title.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Judge Cut Record $581M Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A $581 million jury award in a $1,200  
satellite dish dispute has been sliced almost in half by a judge 
who nonetheless lauded the jury's ``courage and vision'' for the 
initial verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale County Circuit Judge Marvin Wiggins gave little explanation  
for his decision to cut the punitive damages against Transamerica 
Bank to $300 million on Thursday. Compensatory damages remained at 
$975,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial verdict in May raised renewed cries of so-called  
``jackpot justice'' and prompted the Legislature to put caps on 
punitive damage awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins acknowledged the controversy in his ruling, saying he  
recognized the impact the verdict had on ``businesses, society and 
the judicial process. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, our system of justice commands this type of judicial  
system,'' he wrote. ``One must wonder if the jury had returned a 
verdict in favor of the defendants, would there be such a roar to 
overturn it and grant the plaintiffs a just award?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Transamerica, formerly Whirlpool Financial National Bank, had  
asked Wiggins to set aside the $581 million verdict or grant a new 
trial. The bank still plans to appeal the case to the Alabama 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you award people that kind of money for this type of  
situation, what do you do for someone who lost an arm or a leg or 
has been seriously disabled?'' asked Jimmy Gewin, an attorney for 
Transamerica. ``What kind of yardstick do you use to compensate 
those people? You'd have to use trillions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Carlisle and her parents, George and Velma Merriweather,  
sued Whirlpool and Gulf Coast Electronics contending the companies 
tried to gouge them out of $1,200 on the sale of two $1,100 
satellite dishes in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors heard testimony that the company cheated thousands of  
Alabamians out of $8 million by getting them to sign credit card 
deals that required them to pay as much as 300 percent interest, 
though the advertised rate was 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's ruling, the judge called the jury's verdict  
``shocking and unexpected'' -- but also appropriate with a finding 
that Whirlpool engaged in a malicious and predatory sales practice 
that targeted ``poor, undereducated, elderly and African-American 
citizens of Alabama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Transamerica argued that the plaintiffs failed to produce  
evidence of ``mental anguish'' or prove that they were misled by 
the bank. It said the lawsuit was an attempt to hold the bank 
responsible for the actions of an independent retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Gantt, owner of Gulf Coast Electronics, has said his company  
did nothing wrong. He has filed a lawsuit against Whirlpool in U.S. 
District Court in Mobile in an effort to make Whirlpool pay all the 
Hale County verdict.

	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Kings have signed four  
reserve players, including three defensemen. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensemen Jaroslav Modry, Jan Nemecek and David MacIsaac and

<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A handyman charged with beheading a  
Yosemite National Park naturalist and suspected in the deaths of 
three tourists is refusing to give samples of his blood, hair and 
saliva. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner's lawyer filed papers in federal court Thursday  
saying prosecutors should not be allowed to obtain the samples 
without a search warrant and have not provided evidence that such a 
warrant is justified. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors requested the samples but have not sought a search  
warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, 38, who worked at a Yosemite lodge, is charged with  
murdering Joie Armstrong, who led outdoor education programs at the 
park. He has not been charged in the tourists' deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Stayner admitted killing Armstrong July 21  
and also confessed to killing Carol Sund, her daughter Julie Sund, 
and friend Silvina Pelosso. The three disappeared during a 
sightseeing trip in February. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing on the prosecutors' request for blood, hair and saliva  
samples from Stayner is scheduled for Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Mayor's Veto Saves Brothel Nev. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELY, Nev. (AP) -- Only one brothel remains where there used to be  
a row three blocks long here, and a bitterly divided City Council 
voted to shut that one, too. Then the mayor stepped up and rescued 
the Stardust Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Robert Miller vetoed a 3-2 City Council vote on Thursday  
to ban prostitution. He said he thought brothels provided a place 
for safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the brothel cited the tourists it brought in and  
the money spent by the women who work at the Stardust Ranch, all 
that's left of the old `line' of brothels in the town of 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't recall one instance in all those years of the `line'  
giving us one instance of trouble,'' said Sunny Martin, 86. ``But 
TV and the computer can bring filth right into your house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tonja Lemich, 32, a third-generation resident who is raising a  
child, said she took offense at those council members who want to 
legislate morality. 
</P>
<P>
	But supporters of the ordinance said officials can and must  
legislate morality. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not one good thing about a brothel,'' said Councilman  
Stuart Tracy's wife, Joette. ``We have tolerated this negative part 
of this town long enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy said the ban is needed to make Ely a better place for  
families. 
</P>
<P>
	Prostitution is legal in 10 rural Nevada counties, where about  
30 brothels are operate. 
</P>
<P>
	It would take four votes to override the mayor, and the two  
members who voted against the ban said they won't change their 
minds.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Signs With Cardinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pitcher Nick Stocks, one of the St. Louis  
Cardinals' top draft picks, finally signed Friday but it was too 
late for him to join a minor league team this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks, a 21-year-old left-hander from Florida State, was taken  
as a ``sandwich'' pick between the first and second rounds. He 
pitched more than 130 innings for Florida State last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of needed a little break,'' Stocks said. ``A  
month-and-a-half (off) feels pretty good on your arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks, the 36th pick overall, will report to the Instructional  
League on Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals' top pick of the draft, right-hander Chance Capel,  
signed for a $1.2 million bonus on July 15 and joined New Jersey of 
the Class-A New York-Penn League.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Market Has Larger Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve needs to pay closer  
attention to what happens on Wall Street, Chairman Alan Greenspan 
said Friday, since Americans reaping the rewards of the high-flying 
stock market are using those paper profits to justify spending and 
other financial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices declined after his speech, but there was no big  
selloff. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 108 points in 
quiet trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists interpreted Greenspan's comments as a signal  
that the Fed may further raise interest rates this year. Two 
previous increases -- this week and on June 30 -- have failed to 
dampen the Wall Street stock-buying ``exuberance'' that Greenspan 
has expressed concern about. 
</P>
<P>
	``We no longer have the luxury to look primarily to the flow of  
goods and services, as conventionally estimated,'' when evaluating 
broad economic conditions, Greenspan told colleagues at the Federal 
Reserve's annual retreat in Wyoming's Grand Tetons. The text was 
distributed in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's recent interest rate increases have been aimed at  
easing inflationary pressures that central bank policy-makers fear 
are building in the economy as U.S. consumers continue a protracted 
spending binge. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the announcement on Tuesday of this year's second  
quarter-point increase in the influential federal funds rate -- the 
interest rate at which banks lend each other money -- the Dow Jones 
average of industrial stocks hit a record high of 11,326 on 
Wednesday before declining a bit the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concern is this: The major driver of consumer spending  
right now is the stock market. Until and unless we can reduce some 
of that unwarranted enthusiasm in the stock market we are not going 
to be able to slow consumer spending for a soft landing,'' said 
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist with Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	There has long been a debate in economic circles over whether  
financial markets should be taken into consideration when the Fed 
sets interest rate policy. Since a primary goal of the central bank 
is to keep inflation in check, some argue, it needs to focus mostly 
on price changes in the real economy, looking at such things as 
whether commodity prices or wages are rising too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, however, in Friday's speech, said that given the  
larger percentage of household wealth that is now accounted for by 
investments, the central bank needs to watch financial markets more 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's own money is mostly in Treasury bills, not stocks,  
according to his most recent financial disclosure form. It said the 
value of his assets in 1998 ranged from around $2.5 million to $6.4 
million, less than the range of around $3.4 million to $7.3 million 
he reported for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 44 percent of American households owned stock  
either directly or through retirement plans in 1998, up from 20 
percent to 25 percent about a decade earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are important -- but extremely difficult -- questions  
surrounding the behavior of asset prices and the implications of 
this behavior for the decisions of households and businesses,'' 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The difficulty for economic forecasters, Greenspan said, is that  
despite all the sophisticated economic models at their disposal, it 
still is virtually impossible to predict when a financial market 
becomes overvalued and a crash is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	``To anticipate a bubble about to burst requires the forecast of  
a plunge in the prices of assets previously set by the judgments of 
millions of investors, many of whom are highly knowledgeable,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Fed chairman said central bankers must put more effort  
into determining the links between stock-market values and the real 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	He specifically said that further study is needed on something  
economists call the ``wealth effect,'' the link between rising 
investment holdings and consumer spending. Such spending accounts 
for fully two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was implied in his speech is that central bankers have to  
watch asset price inflation to a greater degree now than ever 
because consumers are spending based on at least perceived 
permanent gains in their stock portfolios and perhaps home 
prices,'' said economist David Jones, with Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said Friday that Americans' personal  
income -- which includes wages, interest and government benefits -- 
rose 0.2 percent in July but was outpaced by a spending increase of 
0.4 percent. The nation's savings rate is at negative 1.4 percent, 
a near-record low.

striking fear in investors who interpreted the remarks as a sign 
the Fed isn't finished raising rates. The Dow Jones industrial

Dow lost more than 100 points. Broader stock indicators were also

	Greenspan Urges Close Eye on Stocks  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said  
today that the central bank must pay closer attention to the U.S. 
stock market than ever before because of the investment boom. 
Greenspan said today the extraordinary rise in stock prices the 
last five years has been mostly inexplicable, and he said central 
bankers around the world must focus on changes in asset values in 
formulating monetary policy. Economists have debated whether 
financial markets should be taken into consideration when the Fed 
sets interest rate policy.

	Personal Income Rises in July  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income rose in July but  
their spending climbed much faster, leaving the nation's savings 
rate near a record low. Personal income -- which includes wages, 
interest and government benefits -- rose a slower-than-expected 0.2 
percent last month, the Commerce Department said today. That was 
the smallest gain this year and followed a strong 0.7 percent 
increase in June. Spending, however, went up 0.4 percent in July, 
slightly less than many analysts had expected.

practices that employed 1,500 doctors, but is now unraveling many

	Quick Pay-Offs Hurt Credit Card Cos.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Consumers using financial responsibility -- and  
scissors -- are hurting the credit-card industry. Millions of 
Americans are paying off their bills more swiftly than ever -- often 
with the aid of lower borrowing rates from refinancing a mortgage. 
That's trouble for the big banks that dominate the credit companies 
and count on heavy interest payments to drive profits. Bank One 
Corp.'s stock lost 23 percent of its value on Wednesday after it 
warned its annual earnings will fall at least $530 million short of 
expectations because of slowing growth in its First USA credit card 
business. Credit-card issuers likely will bump their lowest 
introductory rates in response, analysts say.

Russian mobsters had used accounts at the bank in a major money 
laundering operation. Dow Jones Newswires reported that Edwards was 
fired for alleged gross misconduct, violations of the bank's 
internal policies, falsification of bank records, and failure to 
cooperate. So far no one has been charged with any wrongdoing in 
the affair, in which up to $15 billion was reportedly funneled 
through the Bank of New York by Russian mobsters.

	Cadillac Unveils Redesigned Logo

logo's changes include eliminating the six birds, called merlettes, 
in the crest, as well as the crown, or coronet, on top. The wreath 
surrounding the crest also is being streamlined. The result is a 
design that evokes paintings by Piet Mondrian, the Dutch abstract 
painter who used blocks of primary colors. The logo won't appear on

Products can proceed to trial. The FDA ordered prescription diet

appeared for years as the Marlboro Man. The 1996 lawsuit by Lilo 
McLean, wife of David McLean, named several tobacco companies, 
including Marlboro cigarette maker Philip Morris. The case, which 
seeks unspecified damages, alleges that every cigarette maker in 
the United States conspired to hide facts regarding the addictive 
nature of nicotine. Mrs. McLean says her husband suffered from 
emphysema in the late 1980s because of his nicotine addiction and 
later was stricken with lung cancer. David McLean died in 1995 at 
age 73.

<HEADLINE> Hindus Lose Meat-in-Rice Claim </HEADLINE>

	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- A Hindu couple have failed to convince a  
judge that Taco Bell should help pay their way to India because 
they were inadvertently served meat. 
</P>
<P>
	Siva Rama Krishna Valluru and wife Sailaja -- lifelong  
vegetarians -- said they found meat in rice they had eaten at a Taco 
Bell restaurant in November. Eating meat is a sin for some Hindus, 
and the Vallurus wanted the fast-food chain to help pay for a trip 
to India so they could be cleansed in a purification ceremony in 
the Ganges River.

County Small Claims Court, seeking $2,100 each.

<HEADLINE> Judge Reverses Himself on Vouchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A federal judge who created turmoil by holding  
up a state-funded voucher program just as the school year began 
reversed himself Friday, allowing most students involved in the 
controversy to attend private schools with vouchers this year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. ruled that elementary  
school students who participated last year may receive tuition 
vouchers again this year. But children who are new to the program 
this year will not be allowed to get the tuition grants. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,000 students from kindergarten through sixth grade were  
to receive up to $2,500 in tuition vouchers for schools in 
Cleveland. Court records show that 587 students were expected to 
join the program this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver said the new arrangement, which rolls back a ruling he  
made Tuesday, will last only one semester or until a final judgment 
is reached in a lawsuit claiming the program violates the 
constitutional separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver set a Dec. 13 trial date for the lawsuit brought by civil  
liberty and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Oliver granted a request from voucher opponents to  
suspend the program until a trial, saying they had a strong 
argument that the program is unconstitutional because it appears to 
have the ``primary effect of advancing religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 56 schools that participate are religious  
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ruling Friday, Oliver said that because the state  
approved funding for this year's voucher program in late July, it 
was inevitable that a court challenge would come in August as 
schools were set to begin. That also meant his decision was bound 
to cause inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
	``This timing caused disruption to the children previously  
enrolled in the program beyond that normally associated with a 
student's transferring from one school to another,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ruling didn't satisfy either side.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm stunned. There's absolutely no logic to this decision.  
Either the program is right or wrong. Why do you hang the kids out 
to dry?'' said David Zanotti, chairman of pro-voucher group called 
The School Choice Committee. ``He's still jerking around the lives 
of several hundred children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Voucher opponents said they still expect to ultimately win the  
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can understand because the judge was under a lot of  
pressure because the decision came down just before school 
started,'' said Joe Conn of Americans United for Separation of 
Church and State. ``However, his decision made it abundantly clear 
that vouchers are unconstitutional and that the program is unlikely 
to be upheld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general's office, which has appealed the  
suspension to federal court, said it was still deciding whether to 
file another appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	One pro-voucher group, the Institute for Justice, said it filed  
an immediate appeal of Oliver's latest decision to the 6th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, asking that all the voucher 
students be allowed to receive the grants. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old pilot program, which provides tuition money for  
children of poor families, is the only one of its kind in Ohio. It 
has an $11.2 million budget for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Worried parents of voucher students flooded schools with phone  
calls after Oliver's first ruling, wondering if their children 
could still attend private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The voucher schools responded by letting the students into class  
until an appeal was heard or Oliver decided whether to let his 
first decision stand.

<HEADLINE> China Airlines Chairman Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The China Airlines chairman, who was  
brought in to revamp the carrier's operations following a 1994 
crash in Japan, said Friday he offered to resign over this week's 
crash in Hong Kong that killed three people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwanese airline board didn't immediately accept, telling  
the chairman, Chiang Hung-I, it will hold off on any decision until 
crash investigations are finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have taken a lot of measures on flight safety in the past  
year, and we will look closely to see if there are still any 
defects or measures that have not been carried out thoroughly,'' 
Chiang told reporters after a board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the three fatalities, more than 200 were injured  
when a CAL plane, flying from Bangkok to Hong Kong on Sunday, 
flipped upside down and burst into flames after the pilot brought 
the MD-11 jet down in a tropical storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Transport Minister Lin Fong-cheng said early this week he might  
ask the airline to replace its top executives following the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiang said some executives will be penalized after the  
directors decide who should be held responsible. Chiang told a 
newspaper CAL has made great efforts to improve its performance 
since he was put in charge after 264 people died in the crash in 
Nagoya, Japan, but ``apparently we have not done enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiang kept his job after a CAL crash in Taiwan last year killed  
all 196 people on board and six on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, which holds a controlling stake in the Taiwanese  
air carrier, has demanded more reforms to safeguard flight safety. 
Lin has indicated he, too, might be punished, saying he wants the 
Cabinet of Premier Vincent Siew to decide on any penalties for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have yet to say what caused Sunday's crash. A  
Taiwanese aviation regulator has said the pilot was misled by his 
co-pilot about the severity of the cross winds as he tried to land 
during Tropical Storm Sam, which had shut down ferries, most buses 
and some roads and businesses in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	With help from Lufthansa German Airlines technicians, CAL  
reevaluated and retrained all of its 670 pilots, with a focus on 
making older ex-military pilots better team players. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the United Daily News, Chiang said  
Lufthansa technicians have also helped modify and upgrade CAL's 
maintenance plants and ground operations.

<HEADLINE> Charges Vs. Santee Sioux Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- A federal judge threw out civil contempt  
charges against Santee Sioux leaders on Friday that could have 
landed them in jail for failing to close the tribe's outlawed 
casino. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge William Cambridge agreed that the Tribal  
Council was not in contempt because it did not have the power to 
close the the casino as the judge had ordered, since the council is 
bound by the tribe's Aug. 3 referendum to keep the casino open. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said authorities should pursue criminal charges to  
shut the casino. 
</P>
<P>
	If the tribal leaders had been jailed, it would have been the  
first time an Indian had been imprisoned over a gambling dispute 
since Congress first allowed tribes to negotiate gaming compacts 
with states 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was going to jail,'' Tribal Chairman Butch Denny  
said between hugs with tribal members. Inside the courtroom, about 
60 members of the tribe cheered the ruling, while outside others 
broke out in tribal song. 
</P>
<P>
	The court hearing was the latest in a three-year effort by state  
and federal officials to close the casino on the Santee Sioux 
reservation near the South Dakota border in northeast Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe opened the Ohiya Casino in February 1996 without the  
necessary state approval. The state had denied its approval because 
casino-style gambling, including slot machines, is illegal in 
Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 requires states to  
negotiate such agreements with tribes to set rules and limits on 
gambling. The tribe sued the state, alleging it failed to negotiate 
in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Cambridge said the casino is clearly illegal and should be  
closed. U.S. Attorney Tom Monaghan said the tribe will continue to 
be fined $6,000 per day for operating the casino. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe faces $726,000 in fines to date. None had been paid as  
of Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Denny said he hopes the tribe will negotiate a gaming compact  
with the U.S. Department of Interior under new rules that allow 
tribes to negotiate with the federal agency when states have been 
reluctant to talk with the tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santee said the casino's 23 jobs are much needed on the  
reservation where the unemployment rate is 74 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to break anybody's laws,'' casino manager  
Thelma Thomas said. ``We're just trying to make life better for our 
people.''

<HEADLINE> Chiefs' Gonzalez Sprains Ligament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kansas City tight end Tony Gonzalez had  
an MRI on his right knee Friday and it showed there was no 
long-term damage and he could be ready for the Chiefs' season 
opener at Chicago on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-year veteran, who set a team record for tight ends  
with 59 catches last season, was injured in Thursday night's 31-6 
exhibition loss at Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	The MRI showed the 6-foot-4, 255-pounder sprained a ligament.  
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City coach Gunther Cunningham said Gonzalez could be  
ready to go when the Chiefs take on the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks pretty good,'' Cunningham said. ``I'm very  
optimistic. It's the best that I could ever hoped for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez was blocking on a run by Bam Morris in the first  
quarter when his leg was caught in a pileup. He lay on the ground 
for several minutes and then was helped off the field, unable to 
put weight on the leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, on crutches with the leg wrapped in ice, he said it  
was the third time he had such an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once in high school, once when I was a junior in college,'' he  
said. ``I was kidding with the doctor, sounding like an expert on 
it. I said, `It's probably a grade 2 MCL.' With the one I had in 
college, I was out two weeks. I initially thought it was worse. But 
after it calmed down, it was better. I still don't know what it is. 
But I can walk on it. I'm looking forward to a speedy recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez will not have to use crutches while he recovers.  
</P>
<P>
	A first-round pick in 1997, Gonzalez had a terrific training  
camp and was being counted on to carry much of the offensive load. 
He was leading the club in the preseason with five catches for 49 
yards, including a 15-yard touchdown last week against Tampa Bay.

<HEADLINE> 'Fen-Phen' Class Action Suit OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Shares of American Home Products Corp. fell  
sharply on Friday after a ruling by a federal judge that could 
allow patients in up to 44 states to collectively sue the company 
for the cost of monitoring their health after they took two diet 
drugs, known as fen-phen. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home shares fell $3.87 1/2, or 8 percent, to $42.12 1/2 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The ruling late Thursday by 
U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle in Philadelphia conditionally 
certified a class-action lawsuit against the company by patients 
who took the drugs Pondimin and Redux before they were withdrawn 
from the market in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision allows the federal suit filed last year to proceed  
to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Pondimin and Redux, two prescription diet drugs often taken in  
combination, were taken off the market in 1997 at the request of 
the Food and Drug Administration after some users developed 
heart-valve damage. The combination was popularly known as 
``fen-phen,'' a reference to the first syllables of the chemicals 
used to make the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 6 million people took the drugs, though AHP  
contends the majority used them for less than 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,000 lawsuits nationwide have been filed against the  
company by people who say they suffer heart and lung problems 
because of the pills. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home denies any wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia class-action seeks to have AHP pay for checkups  
for people who used the drugs for 30 days or more between 1992 and 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in six other states are excluded from the  
Philadelphia-based suit because similar suits are pending in those 
states, Bechtle ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling comes just as AHP has agreed to pay more than 36,000  
women to settle claims that the implantable contraceptive device 
Norplant caused headaches, irregular menstrual bleeding, nausea and 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	AHP, the parent of Norplant maker Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, did  
not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement, saying Thursday it was 
``purely a business decision.''

<HEADLINE> Injury Subdues Jordan Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Brian Jordan's first trip to St. Louis as a  
visiting player started out more low key than he had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who left the Cardinals after six seasons to sign a $40  
million, five-year contract with Atlanta, sat out the series opener 
Friday night because of a sore right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	He also expects to miss Saturday's game but hopes to play in the  
finale on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said he had no hard feelings for the Cardinals, who made  
no effort to re-sign him, citing his injury history. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all behind me,'' said Jordan, hitting .295 with 22  
homers and 100 RBIs. ``I've moved on and I've matured as a player. 
I never burn bridges. Maybe I'll be back here later in my career, 
so I wish them well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several hours before the game, Jordan visited with several  
Cardinals players just outside the St. Louis clubhouse. Manager 
Tony La Russa also came out to shake his hand and ask with fingers 
obviously crossed: ``Gonna miss all three games?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said he missed the St. Louis fans.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Atlanta fans are great, but not as good as here,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan had three cortisone shots earlier this week for the  
injury, caused when he was hit by a pitch. He fears the bone is 
chipped. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's an unfortunate thing, but I'll just try to play through  
it,'' Jordan said. ``I've got to get it right for September because 
these are important games.''

	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Forecasters expect a weather system  
moving east across the United States to force Hurricane Dennis away 
from Florida, but the Bahamas might not be so lucky. The National 
Hurricane Center in Miami said Dennis might never hit land, but 
that it also could turn and strike near South Carolina as early as 
Sunday, when it could be packing winds up to 109 mph, said 
forecaster Robert Molleda. Dennis is about 150 miles east of the 
Bahamas now, stirring up winds and rain that knocked furniture into

seconds off the record of 43.29 set by fellow American Butch

<HEADLINE> Mori Wins Gold in 400 Hurdles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Fabrizio Mori of Italy, who had initially  
been disqualified in the semifinals, won a controversial 400-meter 
hurdles in the World Championships on Friday, defeating defending 
champion Stephane Diagana of France. Switzerland's Marcel Schelbert 
took the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	France appealed Mori's victory, arguing he had stepped outside  
his lane on the final curve. The appeal was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mori is confirmed as the winner,'' IAAF spokesman Giorgio  
Reineri said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the semifinal, Mori had been disqualified at first for  
running outside his lane but Italy won an appeal, allowing Mori to 
stage his strong comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's final, Mori stormed past Diagana over the last 30  
meters and finished in an Italian-record 47.72 seconds, the best 
time of the season. Diagana, who stumbled at the last gate, was .40 
seconds behind. Schelbert crossed the line in 48.13. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I reached the final bend, I felt my legs going faster and  
faster and so even though Diagana and the Pole (Pawel Januszewski) 
were ahead of me, I knew I would catch them and win,'' Mori said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diagana's chances went at the last hurdle, which he clipped.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so disappointed. I was good until the 10th hurdle, where I  
made a small error. I dragged my foot and it cost me first place 
because Mori was coming back so fast,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The final was hurt by a lot of withdrawals. Pre-championship  
favorite Llewellyn Herbert of South Africa, who had set the 
season's best performance, withdrew on Monday with a left 
quadriceps injury. 
</P>
<P>
	To throw the race even more open, Britain's Chris Rawlinson, who  
owned the season's third-best mark, also had to bow out Monday, 
injuring his ankle in training. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelo Taylor of the United States and Zambia's Samuel Matete,  
two more medal hopefuls, failed to make it to the final.

<HEADLINE> Little League World Series Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSPORT, Pa (AP) -- They lost all three games they played in  
the Little League World Series, but that didn't stop the squad from 
Brownsburg, Ind., from taking a victory lap around the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids were looking sad and down,'' Brownsburg manager Gary  
King said. ``I just told them told them to go out there, take a lap 
and have a good time. Who knows when they'll be back here again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the 2-0 loss Wednesday to Boise, Idaho, the Brownsburg  
boys did their victory lap, waving at the cheering crowd, giving 
each other high fives, and putting a scoop of dirt into their 
pocket as they crossed home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a lot of fun. I'm going to put the dirt in a bottle and  
put it on my bookshelf,'' catcher Austin Nickol said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Nickol and the rest of his team took a boat ride  
with other little leaguers, then traded commemorative pins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating to lose three ball games,'' King said. ``We  
weren't beaten coming into this thing, so we were a little 
shell-shocked. 
</P>
<P>
	``But two weeks from now, we'll look back on this and say we  
were in the show. We had a lot of fun this week, but sometimes 
losing is a bigger lesson in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SLIDING DOWN:* It's become a tradition to see kids of all ages  
sliding down the grassy hill overlooking Lamade Stadium, where the 
Little League World Series is held every year. 
</P>
<P>
	They may have to start sliding managers, too.  
</P>
<P>
	King said that before his last game against Boise, he allowed  
his Brownsburg team to take part in the Little League tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some parents came up and said, `Can they do that before the  
game?''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the manager said he wanted to join them, but didn't  
have the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to have to throw me down that hill now,'' King  
said 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BOYS WILL BE BOYS:* The team from Phenix City, Ala., is a hit  
on and off the field, especially with the female fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Three hours before their U.S. championship game against  
defending champion Toms River, N.J., the Phenix City team lined a 
white picket fence to chat and sign autographs for about 10 girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're at that age now,'' Phenix City manager Tony Rasmus  
said as he watched from a few feet away. ``They're loving this 
stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rasmus said at least one of his players wasn't getting into it,  
though -- his 11-year-old son, Cory. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came up to up me at the picnic table earlier and said `What  
are those guys doing? They're wasting their time.''' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PRE-GAME PREP:* The four finalists in the series took decidedly  
different routes in practicing for Thursday's crucial games. 
</P>
<P>
	Toms River went for a morning boat ride while a light rain  
rendered the practice fields too wet, then went through drills in 
the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	While Toms River sailed the Susquehanna River, the Japanese  
squad worked out in full uniform at a practice field, and Phenix 
City took light batting practice in the morning but relaxed on the 
sidelines the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted them to relax a little bit and have fun. I  
didn't want their mind to be on the game the whole time.'' Phenix 
City manager Tony Rasmus said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team from Yabucoa, Puerto Rico also took batting practice  
about an hour or two before the game before trudging up a short 
hill to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RUSTY ROOTS:* Former major leaguer Rusty Staub has divided  
loyalties when it comes to a rooting interest in the Little League 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Staub, who is originally from New Orleans, caught a World Series  
game for the first time, watching the international championship 
between Japan and Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	His mind though, was on the U.S. championship between Phenix  
City and Toms River. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I don't know. I have friends from Alabama, and being  
that I have New York metropolitan area connections, I have friends 
in New Jersey as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Staub never played in organized Little League while growing up.  
He was impressed by what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that I enjoy the most is the sportsmanship. Although  
winning is important, it's not the only thing,'' he said. ``I hope 
Little League is successful in that approach and not let winning 
become the most important issue, because it really isn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NOTES:* Former Little Leaguers Bill Bradley, Dan Quayle and  
George W. Bush are running for president. Former major leaguers 
Tommy John and Rusty Staub are in Williamsport for the series, and 
Gary Carter was at the series opener Sunday. ... Baseball's 
greatest hits, as played this week on the loudspeakers at Lamade 
Stadium, are ``Centerfield'' by John Fogerty; Alabama's ``Mountain 
Music,'' which has a baseball reference; and ``The Greatest'' by 
Kenny Rogers. ... The Phenix City-Russell County Chamber of 
Commerce was showing Thursday's night's game between Phenix City, 
Ala., and Toms River, N.J., on a big-screen television at the town 
amphitheater. ``This team has put Phenix City on the national 
map,'' Mayor Peggy Martin told the Ledger-Enquirer newspaper of 
Columbus, Ga. ``Those boys are fantastic ambassadors of our little 
community. It's about time some good news came out of our city.'' 
The city only got Little League three years ago -- before that, it 
had Dixie League teams. Chamber of Commerce director Vic Cross said 
he has been watching Kyle Tidwell's game-winning grand slam Monday 
over and over on videotape.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane A Distant Threat in S.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) -- Lisa and Enio DiNardo drove more than  
15 hours from Canada to have fun along the seaside, and on Friday 
they were not going to let the threat of Hurricane Dennis spoil it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to make the best of it,'' said Mrs. DiNardo of  
Stoney Creek, Ontario. ``As long as it's not snow, we're happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Dennis was still more than 300 miles away, churning  
through the Atlantic near the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	People kept their eyes on the weather reports. But with  
forecasts that the storm, if it came ashore here, would not land 
until at least Monday, most people in this tourist city enjoyed the 
sun and surf. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know about the hurricane until we got here,''  
DiNardo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lifeguard Mike Miehm watched as hundreds of people sat under  
brightly colored umbrellas, jumped in the rolling waves and flew 
kites in the gentle breeze on a steamy afternoon. A hurricane was 
not in their plans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not really a huge issue right now,'' Miehm said. ``It's a  
lot of work because people try to get as much surfing before the 
hurricane. It's really dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly every hotel sign said there were vacancies, but that is  
normal for this time of year, said Ashby Ward, president of the 
Chamber of Commerce. He estimated there were about 250,000 people 
in town -- a thinner crowd as the summer winds down and children 
have started school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wait and see right now,'' Ward said. ``There doesn't seem  
to be a panic yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Breakers Hotel, manager Kay Harris said most of 400 rooms  
were filled for Friday night with golfers, tourists and some 
reporters, but the media hype chased the walk-in business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally we have a trail of traffic up Highway 501 and tonight  
there's nothing,'' Ms. Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the weather channels and the Internet, ``it seems we start  
earlier with the worry and warnings,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Captain Admits to Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (AP) -- An Air Force captain will  
serve four months in a military jail after admitting to having sex 
with two enlisted women, including one he later married. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Douglas Bass pleaded guilty to lying to an investigator  
and disobeying orders to end his relationship with Krystal Carr, 
now his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass pleaded guilty to nine counts of violating military law.  
After serving his four-month sentence, he will be dismissed -- an 
officer's equivalent to a dishonorable discharge, his attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass was the commanding officer over Carr and her first husband  
when their affair started in 1998, shortly after Carr's husband was 
deployed to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	Military officials learned about the affair in February 1999 and  
ordered Bass to end it, but he denied the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr also refused to end the affair and she was convicted of  
violating military law. She served 50 days of a 60-day sentence and 
was released early for good behavior in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass also had a relationship with an unidentified staff sergeant  
at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana before he met Carr. The 
woman wasn't under his command.

<HEADLINE> Swimmer Scores Second World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The ``Star-Spangled Banner'' had just  
stopped playing at the Pan Pacific swimming championships 
presentation ceremony when Lenny Krayzelburg began gently clapping. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian-turned-American was saluting his new country and the  
support of the fans who had just cheered him to his second world 
record in three days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an amazing feeling, one that I'll always remember,''  
Krayzelburg said Friday after smashing the 200-meter backstroke 
record. His time of 1 minute, 55.87 seconds was 7-10ths of a second 
faster than the 1:56.57 set by Spain's Martin Lopez Zubero at 
Tuscaloosa, Ala.on Nov. 23, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Krayzelburg broke the 100-meter world record.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking forward to this meet for about a year, and I had  
a good feeling about it,'' Krayzelburg said. ``I guess I went out 
kind of quick tonight, but the crowd really spurred me home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krayzelburg, who became an American citizen in 1995, six years  
after he and his family emigrated from the former Soviet Union, 
said his most important goal remains next year's Sydney Olympics, 
where the swimming competition will be held in the same pool. 
</P>
<P>
	``My time won't matter -- as long as I can get the gold in both  
the 100 and 200,'' Krayzelburg said. But rather than become 
complacent, the 23-year-old Californian plans to use it as extra 
training fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, there will be more motivation because a lot of  
people will be out to try to beat me next year,'' said Krayzelburg. 
``It's an Olympics, so you never know what's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Schubert was Krayzelburg's former coach and is now the  
United States national team coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just worked so hard, he's always there, two hours in the  
morning, three hours in the afternoon,'' Schubert said. ``He never 
misses a session.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krayzelburg, who will have a chance to add a third gold medal  
when he swims for the U.S medley relay team Sunday, didn't miss a 
chance to show his pleasure with Friday's record swim. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Krayzelburg said, some of his friends criticized him  
for not appearing pleased with his world championship wins because 
he wasn't pleased with his time. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after Friday's success, Krayzelburg pointed brazenly to  
the scoreboard with his world record time flashing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't going to be accused of that again,'' Krayzelburg  
said. ``I had been thinking of a way to show my happiness, and I 
figured that would do it.''

<HEADLINE>  Bulls Hire Ex-San Jose State Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- San Jose State coach Phil Johnson was  
hired by the Chicago Bulls on Friday as an assistant to head coach 
Tim Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 42, joins the Bulls after only one season at San Jose  
State. He led the Spartans to a 12-16 record, a nine-game 
improvement over the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel fortunate, in that Phil is an outstanding young  
coaching commodity with an excellent amount of high-level 
experience,'' said Bulls general manager Jerry Krause. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was an assistant under Floyd at the University of New  
Orleans from 1991-1993 and spent five seasons as an assistant coach 
at Arizona before going to San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he was excited to be joining the Bulls, ``who are,  
in my mind, the premier professional sports organization in the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls lost assistant coaches Tex Winter and Frank Hamblen  
over the summer. Both resigned to join former Bulls coach Phil

<HEADLINE> 'Fen-Phen' Class Action Suit OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A federal judge has certified a class-action  
suit by users of the ``fen-phen'' diet drug combination seeking 
payments to have medical checkups for potential heart and lung 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision Thursday by U.S. District Judge Louis C. Bechtle  
allows the federal suit filed last year against American Home 
Products to proceed to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Pondimin and Redux, two prescription diet drugs often taken in  
combination, were taken off the market in 1997 at the request of 
the Food and Drug Administration after some users developed 
heart-valve damage. The combination was popularly known as 
``fen-phen,'' a reference to the first syllables of the chemicals 
used to make the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 6 million people took the drugs, though AHP  
contends the majority used them for less than 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,000 lawsuits nationwide have been filed against the  
company by people who say they suffer heart and lung problems 
because of the pills. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home denies any wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia class-action seeks to have AHP pay for checkups  
for people who used the drugs for 30 days or more between 1992 and 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in six other states are excluded from the  
Philadelphia-based suit because similar suits are pending in those 
states, Bechtle ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the ruling weighed heavily on AHP's stock, which fell  
more than 7 percent in today's trading. The stock was down $3.50 at 
$42.50 a share just before noon on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling comes just as AHP has agreed to pay more than 36,000  
women to settle claims that the implantable contraceptive device 
Norplant caused headaches, irregular menstrual bleeding, nausea and 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	AHP, the parent of Norplant maker Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, did  
not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement, saying Thursday it was 
``purely a business decision.''

<HEADLINE> Cleveland NAACP Leader Reprimanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The head of the NAACP has reprimanded this  
city's chapter president for sending a profane letter to the mayor 
about security for a Ku Klux Klan rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``You embarrassed the NAACP and posed potential harm to the  
reputation of our association,'' Kweisi Mfume, president of the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said in 
a letter to George Forbes earlier this month. ``This cannot be 
tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, a former city council president, accused Mayor Michael  
R. White of coddling the KKK members when he made security plans 
for an Aug. 21 Klan rally. In the letter, Forbes made an obscene 
suggestion to White, who released the letter publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	During the rally, Klan members exchanged insults with  
counter-demonstrators, but no arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland NAACP board member Gregory Clifford said Mfume's  
reprimand carried ``no legal consequences'' for Forbes or the 
chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left at Forbes' law office went answered. The Plain  
Dealer newspaper said he was on vacation.

<HEADLINE> Novartis Announces Stock Buyback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG announced  
Friday it plans to buy back stock worth up to 4 billion Swiss 
francs, or $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it would use about a third of its liquid cash  
reserves to buy the stock and then keep the shares in treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday Novartis reported that its first-half profits rose 5  
percent to $2.45 billion comparfed with the first six months of

<TEXT>
<P>
	Here is a partial list of recent financial scandals involving  
Russia: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Several Russians have been linked to an alleged  
money-laundering scheme at the Bank of New York, where $10 billion 
or more may have passed through accounts illegally, according to 
U.S. newspaper reports. The bank has fired an executive it had 
suspended amid the allegations, but so far no one has been charged 
with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	-- Russia's Central Bank moved large sums to a secret bank  
account on Britain's Channel Islands in the mid-1990s. The bank 
said it wanted to hide the money from foreign creditors who might 
try to seize Russian assets. The bank says no money was 
misappropriated, but critics say there's no information on what 
happened to the profits from the investments. No one has been 
charged with any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	-- Swiss and Russian prosecutors have been investigating whether  
the Swiss firm Mabetex paid bribes in connection with a contract to 
renovate the Kremlin. Swiss prosecutors have asked Swiss banks to 
freeze assets of 22 people suspected in the case, including several 
members of President Boris Yeltsin's administration, according to 
Swiss media reports. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	-- Swiss prosecutors have also been investigating Russian tycoon  
Boris Berezovsky and his involvement in the finances of the Russian 
airline Aeroflot, headed by Yeltsin's son-in-law, Valery Okulov. 
Russian prosecutors issued a warrant for Berezovsky's arrest in 
April on charges of hiding Aeroflot's hard currency earnings in 
Swiss firms. The warrant has been dropped, but Russian officials 
said they were still investigating.

<HEADLINE> Teen Accused of IBM Bomb Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An 18-year-old Panamanian admitted he sent  
e-mail bomb threats to IBM, claiming he would demolish the company 
headquarters unless he was paid $5 million, authorities said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jahair Joel Navarro was charged with threatening to use a weapon  
of mass destruction. The crime, which falls under federal 
anti-terrorism statutes, carries a maximum sentence of life in 
prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Navarro, a legal resident of the United States, was ordered held  
without bail after prosecutors told a judge he had sent a similar 
threat to Microsoft Corp. in Redmond, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	A complaint signed by FBI agent Robert Antonez said Navarro,  
during a search of his home Thursday, admitted sending the threats 
to both companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Navarro allegedly identified himself as ``Shadowmega'' in an  
e-mail sent Tuesday to IBM Chief Executive Officer Lou Gerstner. 
</P>
<P>
	The message said five bombs would destroy the company's  
headquarters in Armonk if he was not paid $5 million by Friday, 
according to U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and police traced the e-mail to an America Online  
account owned by Navarro's stepfather. He could not be reached for 
comment Friday. A message was left at the family's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents who searched the family's apartment in Brooklyn found  
bomb-making recipes and documents relating to terrorist techniques 
that appeared to have been downloaded from the Internet, White 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman Joseph Valiquette said no bombs were ever found.  
</P>
<P>
	An IBM spokesman had no comment except to say the company was  
cooperating with authorities.

</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York on Friday fired Lucy Edwards, one of two  
executives suspended amid allegations that Russian mobsters had 
used accounts at the bank in a major money laundering operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards was in charge of the bank's Eastern European  
operations in London. She was suspended Aug. 18, and her home and 
office were searched by authorities three days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Giacalone, a spokeswoman for the Bank of New York, said Ms.  
Edwards was dismissed on Friday. She would not elaborate on the 
bank's decision, but Dow Jones Newswires reported that the bank 
suspected her of misconduct and falsifying records. 
</P>
<P>
	A second executive suspended by the bank, Natasha Kagalovsky,  
has denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards could not be reached for comment, and has not been  
charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In an ironic twist to the case, Ms. Edwards made a presentation  
on the latest money laundering techniques at a conference for 
financial executives in Riga, Latvia, in June. Her speech was 
entitled ``Money Laundering: Latest Developments and Regulations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Gelin, who helped organize the conference for the  
London-based company Shorex Ltd., invited Edwards to address the 
two-day meeting. ``One of her roles at the bank, in terms of taking 
on new clients, was diligence and the money laundering aspects. She 
was trained by the bank in that,'' Gelin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it would be good to take on someone from a Western  
bank because they were likely to have stricter procedures, more 
than in Eastern Europe,'' Gelin said. ``The Americans are always 
lecturing the world on how fantastic they are, so we trusted 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering is the process of moving ill-gotten gains  
through a series of bank accounts until they appear like legitimate 
profits from legal businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators suspect that billions of dollars were moved  
through accounts at the Bank of New York, partly through a company 
called Benex Worldwide Ltd. Ms. Edwards' husband, Russian 
businessman Peter Berlin, is listed as a director of Benex. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe the total amount funneled through the bank  
may exceed $10 billion, reports have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among evidence found by British police during a search of Ms.  
Edwards's London apartment last week was Bank of New York 
stationery with Ms. Edwards' home address on it, according to Dow 
Jones Newswires. Investigators suspect she may have been conducting 
business from her house using the bank's name, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigations declined to  
comment. A call to the U.S. Attorney's office in New York, which is 
believed to be investigating the matter, was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Bank of New York official suspended pending the  
investigation, Ms. Kagalovsky, is a senior vice president in New 
York who also supervised the bank's business in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement authorities reportedly are investigating the  
activities of Ms. Kagalovsky's husband Konstantin, who was Russia's 
representative to the International Monetary Fund from 1992 to 1995 
and later worked as a senior executive at Russia's Menetap bank. He 
now is vice president of Russian oil giant Yukos. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple released a statement Thursday denying any wrongdoing  
and dismissing reports of Russian mob involvement as an 
``anti-Russian campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Konstantin and Natasha wish to state unequivocally that they  
have never been involved in money laundering in any way, shape or 
form,'' the couple said in a statement issued by their lawyer. ``We 
are highly confident that at the conclusion of these 
investigations, this will be abundantly clear.''

<HEADLINE> Oldest Marine Dies at Age 107 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TENAFLY, N.J. (AP) -- Joseph Gold, the nation's oldest living  
Marine and one of the few remaining World War I veterans, has died. 
He was 107. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold died Wednesday of pneumonia at a Tenafly nursing home, his  
son said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold, who served with the American Expeditionary Force in the  
Battle of Belleau Wood in June, 1918, was one of two servicemen to 
receive France's Legion of Honor award last month. 
</P>
<P>
	At his request, Gold was buried Friday to the trumpeting of taps  
and a Marine honor guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very proud of Joe Gold,'' said Frank Hall, commandant  
of the Gooney Bird detachment of the U.S. Marine Corps League and a 
veteran of World War II. ``He gave us an insight into what the guys 
did before us.'' The Gooney Birds are a local chapter of retired 
Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few weeks ago, interviewers from the U.S. Marine Corps  
Research Center arrived at Gold's nursing home to record his 
thoughts on the war he fought and his service in the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to record him for Marine Corps history, so that  
Marines 100 years from now can listen to him and understand what 
it's like,'' said senior archivist Michael Miller. ``I asked him 
what it was like to be one of the oldest living Marines, and he 
said it made him really proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the interview finished, he sang the Marine Corps hymn  
three-quarters through, lapsing into humming only at the end, 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he sang the Marine Corps hymn, there wasn't hardly a dry  
eye in the place,'' Miller said. ``And his grip was just a Marine 
grip. He grabbed my hand so hard it hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gold was the oldest living Marine and one of only a few who  
remembered fighting during World War I, according to Marine 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Stabbed in the hand by a German bayonet, Gold nonetheless stayed  
with the Marines in Europe. He remained until 1919 to help with 
postwar reconstruction.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Creeps Toward the Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis loomed east of the  
Bahamian capital of Nassau today, marooning some vacationers, 
increasing the peril for Florida and threatening to strike South 
Carolina as a major storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of the Bahamas expanded a hurricane warning to  
cover much of the northwest Bahamas. Dennis was packing 80 mph 
winds as it moved west-northwest at 7 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. National Weather Center predicted today the hurricane  
would hit the northern Bahamas on Saturday morning. It urged 
Bahamians to rush their preparations to protect life and property. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the National Hurricane Center put the east  
coast of Florida on hurricane watch and urged coastal residents 
from central Florida up to North Carolina to watch the storm 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	A weather system that was supposed to steer Dennis away from the  
Florida coast had not. At 11 a.m. EDT, Dennis was centered about 
345 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not letting anyone off the hook anywhere along the  
coast,'' said another meteorologist at the center, Todd Kimberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	Although forecasters had been talking about a glancing blow for  
the U.S. mainland, hurricane center director Jerry Jarrell said 
Dennis could make a direct hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``That ups the ante a little bit for central Florida,'' said  
Jarrell. ``It's too close for comfort right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was expected to strengthen over the next 24 hours and  
bring five to 10 inches of rain and tides 3 to 6 feet above normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``People still remember Hurricane Andrew here from 1992, so  
we're keeping an eye out for it,'' hotel owner Harcourt Cambridge 
said in the Bahamian capital of Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew blew off much of the topsoil on Eleuthera island, where  
some trees had only just begun bearing fruit again, said Gilbert 
Kemp, local government chairman at Hatchet Bay. Eleuthera is a 
110-mile-long strip of pink sand where 8,000 people live. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp said it had rained through the night and the wind was  
picking up, bending some smaller trees, as residents rushed to 
board up their homes. Boats in Nassau were hauled out of the 
harbor, and the governor general's official residence was boarded 
up before a light rain started falling Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis kicked up surf in the Carolinas, where people began  
stocking up on storm supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Gov. Jim Hodges ordered 1,000 National Guard  
troops and 500 state troopers to prepare for duty, but no decision 
has been made on any possible coastal evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, emergency planners urged 150,000 coastal  
residents to get ready for the storm. State troopers and emergency 
management personnel were on alert. 
</P>
<P>
	While surfers off the Outer Banks rode huge waves generated by  
the far-off storm, some residents of the Wilmington, N.C. area went 
to supply stores for plywood, batteries and lanterns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're starting to sell plywood and a lot of propane,  
batteries, lights,'' said Troy Green, a clerk at a Carolina Beach 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, the approaching storm prompted many surfers to play  
hooky from work and school today to catch some unseasonably good 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
	``On my way in this morning, I was following someone that had  
two or three boards on their car,'' said Heather Lewis, marking 
director for Ron Jon Surf Shop on Cocoa Beach, about 40 miles east 
of Orlando. The shop has been getting deluged with calls for surf 
reports, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis became a hurricane late Wednesday as its winds reached 75  
mph. Forecasters said it could strengthen. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other nearby storms posed little threat, forecasters said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cindy, upgraded to a hurricane again late Wednesday, was far out  
in the Atlantic. And Emily -- which sprang up at near-hurricane 
strength Tuesday -- began to lose strength and was downgraded to a 
tropical depression.

<HEADLINE> Krayzelburg, Heyns Break Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- American Lenny Krayzelburg set his  
second world record while South African Penny Heyns continued her 
amazing feats at the Pan Pacific swimming championships today. 
</P>
<P>
	Krayzelburg broke an 8-year-old record in the 200 backstroke to  
add to his 100 record from Wednesday, while Heyns broke her seventh 
world record in her last 10 races during the 200 breaststroke 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one record has fallen on all six days of the meet so  
far -- 10 overall -- in the pool which will be used at next year's 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The perfect record could be extended to seven days with a meet  
official saying the sport's governing body FINA has given Heyns 
permission to attempt to break her own 50 world record in a special 
time trial following Saturday's heats. 
</P>
<P>
	American Jenny Thompson, who broke a 100 butterfly record,  
claimed her fourth gold when she won the 100 freestyle final. 
Thompson finished in 54.89 to finish well ahead of Sarah Ryan of 
Australia at 55.58, adding her second individual gold to two relay 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Wilkens of the United States won the last final today,  
taking the 200 medley in 2:01.01. 
</P>
<P>
	Krayzelburg had a time of 1:55.87 in the final, beating the  
1:56.57 set by Martin Lopez Zubero of Spain in November 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I was close the last couple of months so I was very  
confident coming into this meet. But I felt a bit of pressure and 
I'm so relieved now. It's awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heyns revealed before the race that she was using the  
controversial food supplement Creatine, billed as a legal 
alternative to anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	While she believes her times might have plunged without the  
supplement, Heyns has been on a remarkable roll for the past five 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	She started the spurt at last month's Janet Evans Invitational  
in Los Angeles when she broke the 100 and 200 mark twice each. She 
broke the 100 in the heats of the this meet and missed it in the 
semis and final while easily winning gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyns took the 200 record down to 2:42.42 in Thursday's semis  
and lowered it significantly in today's final to 2:23.64. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am shocked by that,'' said Heyns. ``As much as I tried to  
convince myself that I was relaxed tonight, I felt a little 
distracted during the race. Coming home it wasn't as easy as it has 
been. Now I know why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heyns said she went out faster than she planned.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a weird race, I didn't feel as much in control as I  
have the other days,'' Heyns said. ``I'm blown away, I'm just 
having a lot of fun. The records are a bonus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heyns has returned from contemplating retirement after the  
Atlanta Olympics, where she won the breaststroke double. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she got to the stage of hating her sport, but after  
deciding to carry on to next year's Sydney Olympics she wanted to 
do everything possible to make sure she competed at her best, 
including taking the legal supplement Creatine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be swimming pretty well whether I was on it or not,''  
Heyns said. ``But I have the attitude that I don't want to get on 
the blocks during my career and know that I've trained and swum as 
hard as I could but that there was a nutritional side that I didn't 
do the best I could in. I want to cover all the bases.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. Funeral Head Admits To Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEBARY, Fla. (AP) -- A funeral home director fatally stabbed his  
wife after she threatened to leave him, then buried her with a 
woman whose family held a closed-casket service, police said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Villella confessed after detectives told him they were  
going to exhume the grave, said Gary Davidson, a spokesman for the 
Volusia County Sheriff's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were tipped to the crime when Exelee Louise  
Villella's sister called with worries, saying the last time she 
talked with her sister on Aug. 5, the couple was in the midst of an 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
	Her co-workers also raised suspicions, because the usually  
jealous Villella, who called every morning to check on his wife, 
did not call on Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies said Villella first told them his wife left in the  
middle of the night, but they doubted she would leave her toddler 
son and her car was in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Villella, 39, stabbed his 28-year-old wife  
while she slept on Aug. 5. The next day, he took the body to the 
Deltona Memorial Funeral Home &AMP; Cemetery in Orange City, about 40 
miles northeast of Orlando, and stored it in a cooler until the 
Aug. 9 burial of 89-year-old Majorie Hutchison. He was the only 
employee to handle Ms. Hutchison's casket. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators dug up the grave Friday and found the wife's body.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were stacked one on top of the other with the homicide  
victim underneath and Ms. Hutchison's body on top,'' Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Villella was arrested Thursday and charged with first-degree  
murder. He was jailed without bond.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall After Greenspan Remarks / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today after Federal Reserve Chairman  
Alan Greenspan, in remarks at a banking conference, did not discuss 
the central bank's interest rate policy. 
</P>
<P>
	At midday, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 47.18 to  
11,151.27. The Dow fell 127 points on Thursday amid profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also were lower today. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 7.86 at 1,354.15, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 13.84 at 2,760.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, speaking today at a Kansas City Federal Reserve bank  
meeting, talked about the stock market, saying the extraordinary 
rise in stock prices the last five years has been mostly 
inexplicable. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors seemed disappointed that Greenspan did not confirm  
many beliefs that Tuesday's 0.25 percent interest hike will be 
enough to quell inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The presumption is he thinks the stock market is too high and  
is contributing to overheating the economy which could cause 
inflation,'' said David Orr, chief economist at First Union Capital 
Markets Group in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed hinted Tuesday that no additional rate increases might  
be needed this year unless the economy showed signs of overheating 
or if inflation flared up. 
</P>
<P>
	A Commerce Department report today indicated the economy is  
growing moderately. Personal spending rose 0.4 percent in July, 
below what analysts had expected. Personal income rose a 
slower-than-expected 0.2 percent last month. The gain, the smallest 
this year, followed a strong 0.7 percent increase in June. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express, down 2 3/16 at 145, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson,  
down 1 5/8 at 102 13/16 were the the biggest losers in the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were mixed on the Nasdaq, as Intel rose 1 9/16  
at 82 5/8 and Microsoft dropped 1 7/8 to 92 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 258.3 million shares, 
down significantly from Thursday's session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index was down 2.54 at 433.48.

<HEADLINE> A Monet for $595, Anyone? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's a marriage of state-of-the-art laser optics  
and great old art: Claude Monet's water lilies, yours for only 
$595, its thick oil paint bobbing on the dark-blue pond. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in my car one day and I said to myself, 'I've got to  
figure out a way to recreate art that looks like the original,''' 
said Harvey Kalef, founder of Atelier America Inc., which has 
developed a computerized oil-on-canvas method to make masterpieces 
virtually indistinguishable from originals. 
</P>
<P>
	So for a fraction of the price, one can now virtually match any  
billionaire's art collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of Impressionist and modern canvases were on view this  
week at the toney Manhattan restaurant Le Cirque. No museum guard 
rushed over as art lovers touched the thick brushstrokes of images 
by Van Gogh and Renoir. 
</P>
<P>
	From the Vatican's Sistine Chapel ceiling, there's also a copy  
of Michelangelo's ``Creation of Adam,'' and from the Musee d'Orsay 
in Paris, ``Ballet Rehearsal'' by Edgar Degas. 
</P>
<P>
	They're all available through a mail-order catalog, at prices  
ranging from $475 to about $2,000, framed. Or one can lease a copy, 
at about $30 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody in the company will divulge exactly how the copying is  
done. ``After all, Colonel Sanders doesn't tell you how he makes 
his chicken, either!'' joked Marilyn Dickson, a vice president of 
Atelier America, based in Markham, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	But during a two-hour media presentation, some of the  
``secrets'' that cost millions of dollars to develop did trickle 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Here goes: After a transparency is made of the original comes  
the mystery technology -- a laser optical scanner that 
``interprets'' each brushstroke, its thickness and depth. 
Digitalized optics then capture the color nuances, which are later 
transferred to the canvas by a machine with a computer memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the scanned information, a mold is painstakingly made,  
inch by inch, and a massive steel ``forming'' machine using a 
thermal process churns out the texture onto the canvas. The mold is 
destroyed after limited editions of no more than about 900 copies 
are made; the back of each canvas is stamped to indicate it's a 
reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, each work is touched up by human beings with paint and  
brush. 
</P>
<P>
	One artist, John O'Brien, even coaches these Atelier artists to  
finish up his own copied paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're as close as possible to the original,'' he said,  
glancing at a replica of his ``Fleurs,'' a French-style street 
scene with a flower shop. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could fool even me,'' he said. After he sold the original  
``Fleurs,'' his wife's favorite among his works, the couple 
acquired a copy for their home in Marin County, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	He gets a commission from each reproduction after signing it.  
The company also pays royalties to other owners of artworks copied. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to dead masters, O'Brien notes, ``Van Gogh was  
known for his brushstrokes, not for flat copied sunflowers under 
glass. The joy of his art is in the thick paint -- and now you can 
have it for the price of a vacuum cleaner!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the first reproductions were created in 1995, Atelier  
America has sold tens of thousands of its replicas. 
</P>
<P>
	They're so real that customs officials at the Rome airport  
detained a copy of ``Creation of Adam'' being shipped to the 
Vatican ``because they thought it was the original,'' said Ms. 
Dickson. ``This is no cookie-cutter process.''

<HEADLINE> Military Defends Waco Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Attorney General Janet Reno opens a full  
investigation into the FBI's newly disclosed use of incendiary 
devices in the 1993 Waco siege, the military is insisting it played 
only an observer's role on the day the Branch Davidian cult 
compound burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Army special operations officers were present that final  
day, April 19, 1993, but they were not involved in the FBI 
operation in any way, not even in an advisory role, a senior 
Pentagon officer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer, who is familiar with the military's participation  
in the 51-day standoff but spoke only on the condition of 
anonymity, said the Pentagon had no say in the FBI's decision to 
use potentially flammable tear-gas grenades. 
</P>
<P>
	But former CIA officer Gene Cullen told The Dallas Morning News  
in a copyright story for today's editions that anti-terrorist Delta 
Force commandos told him detailed accounts of active military 
involvement as he worked with them on an overseas assignment in 
1993. Cullen would not identify the commandos. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits the military from direct involvement in  
domestic law enforcement unless a presidential waiver is granted. 
The Pentagon officer said no such waiver was requested in the Waco 
case because it was not deemed applicable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no operational involvement in this activity, or  
planning,'' the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the military did provide a wide variety of support  
services, including the loan of radios and other communications 
equipment, tanks, tents, helicopters and, at least in the early 
stages, some anti-terrorism advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Cullen told the News that members of the secret Army unit were  
``present, up front and close'' in helping the FBI in the final 
tear-gas assault on the Branch Davidian compound. 
</P>
<P>
	James B. Francis Jr., chairman of the Texas Public Safety  
Commission, said he has been told that evidence in the hands of 
state law enforcement personnel may support the account given to 
Cullen. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno pledged on Thursday that a new investigation of the siege  
will ``get to the bottom'' of why the FBI took six years to admit 
such grenades apparently were used on the day of the siege, 
although six hours before the compound burned. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI previously had denied using such devices at all.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the former senior FBI official who disclosed that  
incendiary tear-gas canisters were used expressed fear today that a 
new investigation could turn into a witch hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be very careful that agents who told the truth don't  
become the scapegoats for the Department of Justice, and I have a 
real fear that will occur,'' Danny Coulson said. ``The agents did 
the things there that they believed they had the authority to do, 
and they gave statements saying they had done so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coulson, a deputy assistant FBI director at the time of the 1993  
siege and the founding commander of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, 
said agents did disclose during their post-siege debriefings the 
use of the pyrotechnic tear gas grenades. 
</P>
<P>
	Why that information wasn't conveyed to high-ranking FBI and  
Justice Department officials in Washington -- who steadfastly 
claimed before congressional committees and in public statements 
that only non-incendiary tear gas was used -- is a mystery, Coulson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was certainly no cover-up,'' he said in an interview  
with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general described herself as ``very, very  
troubled,'' ``very, very frustrated,'' and ``very, very upset'' by 
the FBI's belated admission. She said she still does not believe 
the FBI is responsible for the 80 who died, including cult leader 
David Koresh. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends that Koresh set the fire himself that  
consumed the compound and that the conflagration was not caused by 
tear gas the FBI pumped into the building. 
</P>
<P>
	After Reno ordered the new investigation, FBI Director Louis  
Freeh assigned 40 FBI agents to re-interview everyone who was at 
the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress also moved toward new hearings.  
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton  
``stands with the attorney general in her determination to get all 
the facts in this case and to make them available to Congress and 
the public as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials would not comment on the Waco matter publicly  
or say whether Delta Force members played a role. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the senior officer said that the three military  
observers at the scene were special operations officers with 
expertise in hostage rescue and terrorism. They were under strict 
instructions not to participate or even give advice, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the officer also disclosed that two Army experts  
with similar background had been called in during the early stages 
of the standoff to review an FBI ``contingency plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They expressed opinions on the plan after studying it but were  
not among the officers at the compound on the final day, the 
officer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the General Accounting Office issued a report  
Thursday detailing military assistance provided during the 
standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The military provided ``a wide variety of assistance,'' both to  
the FBI and to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 
totaling about $1 million, the report said. The sum included 
support from state National Guard units that were later reimbursed 
by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	The report primarily focused on assistance to the ATF, noting  
that military personnel were called to the scene after it ``cited 
possible drug-related activity at the compound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, concluded that the  
military did not overstep its authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The report had been long in preparation and its release Thursday  
was coincidental.

<HEADLINE> Soybean Futures Push Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Forecasts for dry weather through most of the  
soybean belt next week helped push soybean futures higher Friday on 
the Chicago Board of Trade. Grain futures were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also were buoyed by continued market talk that China is  
in the market for U.S. soybean products and may have bought between 
250,000 tons and 350,000 tons of soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures edged down to a four-week low for December amid  
pressure from the impending harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures slipped, pressured by a lack of export sales that  
would help reduce relatively large inventories. With Canada's 
competing crop expected to be larger than originally forecast, 
investors are concerned 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 4 cents to $2.79 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1/2 cent to $2.15 1/4 a bushel; December oats were 
unchanged at $1.14 a bushel; November soybeans rose 4 1/4 cents to 
$4.71 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures prices were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose .20 cent to 66.55 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle fell .25 cent to 78.92 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs fell .18 cent to 44.97 cents a pound; February pork 
bellies rose 1.25 cents to 58.65 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Individual Schools Decide Badge Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The district that includes Columbine High  
School says its individual schools may decide for themselves 
whether to have students wear identification badges as a security 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jefferson County School Board this month informally approved  
a plan to require staff and students in all secondary schools to 
wear badges. But students complained and administrators questioned 
the idea's practicality. 
</P>
<P>
	The five board members said Thursday they had reconsidered. A  
formal vote on the proposal is expected next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are concerned about their children's privacy. They  
don't see what difference it will make,'' said board member Tori 
Merritts. ``They're concerned about punitive measures to enforce 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The badges were one of several recommendations made by a safety  
task force formed after the April 20 shooting rampage at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the plan said tags would have been ineffective in  
preventing that attack because the gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold, were students and would have had badges.

<HEADLINE> Sprinter Johnson Nearly Gave Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- A few weeks ago, Michael Johnson was ready  
to write off the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobbled by another injury and stung by accusations that he was  
ducking a showdown against Maurice Greene, the American sprint star 
was at one of the lowest points of his brilliant career. 
</P>
<P>
	But Johnson sat down with his coach, Clyde Hart, and agreed to  
continue chasing the goal he'd set at the start of the year: 
breaking the world 400-meter record in the final of the World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hart-to-heart talk paid off Thursday night when the double  
Olympic champion ran an electrifying 43.18 seconds to win his 
fourth consecutive world title and slash .11 off Butch Reynolds' 
11-year-old mark, the longest standing record in a men's track 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's indescribable,'' Johnson said Friday after celebrating  
late into the night with friends and family. ``When you've been 
chasing the record for so long, it's relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it couldn't have come at a better time in my career.  
After all the injuries I've had this year, having to pull out of a 
few meets, this was especially gratifying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was asked to compare the 400 record with the 200 mark of  
19.32 seconds he set at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're like children,'' the 31-year-old Texan said. ``They're  
both valuable, very dear to me, special for their own particular 
reason. The 200 was the first one. This one is more special, not 
just because of the world record, but because of the time, and that 
I broke it at this stage in my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's status for the championships had been in serious doubt  
after he pulled up with a strained hamstring in a 400 race in 
Stockholm, Sweden, on July 30. He went home to Waco, Texas, feeling 
physically and emotionally spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was about to throw it in for the season,'' Hart said  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had definitely lost the passion for the sport for a  
while,'' said his agent, Brad Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was upset that people had questioned his withdrawals  
from meets with injuries and accused him of avoiding a 200-meter 
race against Greene at the U.S. nationals in June in Eugene, Ore. 
Johnson pulled out of the meet citing a recurrence of the hip 
alignment problem that has plagued him throughout his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael was just disappointed,'' Hart said. ``You're injured  
and people say you are ducking somebody. He couldn't understand why 
people thought he wasn't telling the truth. That hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
	``But eventually everything turned around. We used it as a  
motivating factor -- to prove himself on the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart put Johnson through two weeks of grueling workouts  
involving 350-meter runs. Johnson skipped the prestigious 
Weltklasse meet in Zurich, Switzerland, to train at home. When he 
came to Seville, he was in perfect shape for the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew and he knew the record was within him,'' Hart said.  
``We didn't need the races to tell us. The workouts told us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the record fell Thursday night, the surprise was not that  
Johnson had broken it, but by how much. 
</P>
<P>
	What's so impressive about the record is that Johnson has had no  
real rivals in the 400 to push him. He won Thursday's race by a 
huge margin, with silver medalist Sanderlei Parrela of Brazil 
finishing more than a second behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realized way back that I would have to (go for the record)  
by myself,'' Johnson said. ``All the time I've been chasing this 
record, I knew I would have to do it alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said his next goal is to break the 43-second barrier --  
ideally at next year's Sydney Olympics, where he'll be attempting 
another 200-400 double and running in the 1,600-meter relay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always felt I can go under 43,'' he said. ``Running 43.18  
is just confirmation of that. In Sydney, I think there'll be the 
opportunity to run under 43.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, don't look for any sprint match race between  
Johnson and Greene, the 100-meter champion and world record-holder. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson still has bad memories of his 150-meter match race in  
1997 against Canada's Donovan Bailey, the 1996 Olympic 100-meter 
champion. Johnson pulled up with torn quadriceps, an injury from 
which Hart said he has still not fully recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to get involved in any special matchups any  
more,'' Johnson said. ``I don't think there would be anything for 
me to gain by doing that. I think those matchups should be left to 
the Olympic trials and Olympic Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Johnson, who is scheduled to run in the 200 at next week's  
Golden League meet in Brussels, Belgium, said he would be happy to 
face Green there. After Brussels, Johnson plans to run in only one 
more meet this year, in Rieti, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	First, though, Johnson will run anchor on the U.S. 1,600-meter  
relay team in Sunday's final event of the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory would give Johnson a career total of nine gold medals  
at the championships. He's currently tied with Carl Lewis for the 
all-time record with eight golds -- four in the 400, two in the 200 
and two in the relay.

<HEADLINE> Russian Banks Bleed the Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- In Russia's murky financial world, one thing is  
certain: billions of dollars pour out of the country every year 
illegally, much of it looted by the Russian mob and big businesses, 
and almost no one is ever caught. 
</P>
<P>
	The capital flight has greatly undermined Russia's muddled  
attempt to build a market economy, yet President Boris Yeltsin's 
government has been unable, or unwilling, to halt the illicit 
outflow of capital that shows no signs of slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest in a series of scandals is potentially one of the  
most explosive -- investigators believe that the Russian mob may 
have laundered billions of dollars in accounts at the Bank of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no one has been charged. But the Bank of New York on  
Friday fired Lucy Edwards, an executive it had suspended amid the 
allegations. The bank did not explain its decision, but Dow Jones 
Newswires reported that the bank suspected her of misconduct and 
falsifying records. 
</P>
<P>
	How bad is money laundering and capital flight in Russia?  
</P>
<P>
	No one knows for sure, but a reasonable estimate is that $10  
billion leaves the country illegally each year, said Alexei 
Ulukayev, an economist at the Institute for the Economy in 
Transition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, not only criminals but ordinary businessmen are  
also involved in capital flight from Russia,'' said Ulukayev. ``If 
it was only the mafia it would be a smaller problem. You can fight 
the mafia with police methods. But when it's an ordinary 
businessman then police methods are not sufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In post-Soviet Russia, crime and corruption are endemic,  
involving government, big businesses and organized crime groups 
with the lines between them often blurred. A series of corruption 
scandals and allegations in recent years have tainted Yeltsin's 
government and entourage. 
</P>
<P>
	Wealthy Russians, whether their money was earned legally or not,  
have established a pattern of moving their money outside Russia, a 
place where your bank can go belly-up at any time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian mob, which is believed responsible for much of the  
capital flight, sends money abroad to hide its illicit profits. 
Genuine businessmen face the uncomfortable choice of paying 
extremely high taxes or sending the money on a trip to Europe where 
the tax man won't find it. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Russia's Central Bank, which sets the rules for moving  
money in and out of the country, plays fast and loose. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank sent billions of dollars to a secret bank  
account on Britain's Channel Islands over a period of several 
years. Its explanation was hardly inspiring -- it wanted to hide the 
money from foreign creditors that might try to seize Russian 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank said the original capital was returned, but it  
hasn't said where the profits from the investments went. 
</P>
<P>
	When Russia's Central Bank defends the practice of clandestine  
bank accounts in foreign countries, wealthy Russians wonder why 
they should behave any differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know there is money missing from the government coffers,  
but no one seems to care,'' said Nikolai Gonchar, an independent 
member of parliament, who has been pushing for a more detailed 
investigation of the Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``For four-and-a-half months I've been urging the prosecutor  
general to investigate, but he has been doing his best not to open 
a criminal case,'' Gonchar said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian government has not been accused of any wrongdoing in  
the Bank of New York scandal. But Gonchar says his review of 
Central Bank documents has led him to believe that government has 
mishandled large sums of money on multiple occasions, including 
loans given to Russia by the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Private banks mushroomed in Russia after the collapse of the  
Soviet government in 1991, but they've done little to win the trust 
of ordinary citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people simply don't have banking accounts, personal checks  
are unheard of, and in rural areas, bank tellers sometimes tally up 
transactions on an abacus. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, the biggest banks can send money zipping around the  
globe, but they are largely unregulated and have been quite 
accommodating to people who don't want to answer questions about 
where their money came from. 
</P>
<P>
	This jerry-built system crumbled in August 1998, when Russia was  
hit by the world crisis in developing markets. Many banks 
eventually closed and depositors lost their money. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, well-heeled Russians are partial to bank  
accounts in Geneva, London and New York. In many cases, sending the 
funds abroad is illegal in some way, if only because the money is 
not being declared and no Russian taxes are being paid on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian law enforcement agencies, widely seen as corrupt and  
incompetent, have almost no experience in combating sophisticated 
money-laundering schemes that can send money whizzing across 
continents with a few keystrokes on a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Bank of New York case, investigators believe that more  
than $4 billion through a single account with some 10,000 
transactions during a six-month period, according to U.S. newspaper 
reports. The reports have said a total of $10 billion or more may 
be involved.

<HEADLINE> Bessettes' Mother Files Petition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The mother of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and  
Lauren Bessette left open the option Thursday to sue over the plane 
crash that killed her daughters and John F. Kennedy Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann M. Freeman of Old Greenwich, Conn., filed a petition in  
State Surrogate's Court in Manhattan to distribute existing assets 
totaling less than $1 million and any money that might be produced 
from lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The court papers said there may be ``personal injury and  
wrongful death claims against persons and parties as yet unknown'' 
arising from the July 16, 1999, crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Freeman's daughters -- 33-year-old Carolyn and 34-year-old  
Lauren -- were killed along with the 38-year-old Kennedy when his 
single-engine Piper Saratoga plunged into the Atlantic Ocean off 
Martha's Vineyard, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board has said the plane  
appears to have been functioning properly when it hit the water, 
but weather conditions may have been worse than a forecast Kennedy 
had received. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no will has been filed in Surrogate's Court for the  
estimated $100 million Kennedy estate. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition filed by Ms. Freeman showed that the daughters had  
filed no will for estates that were estimated to total no more than 
$500,000 each. Lauren Bessette was an investment banker at Morgan 
Stanley and Carolyn was a former publicist for designer Calvin 
Klein. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann B. Lesk, co-chairwoman of the section on Trust Estates and  
Surrogates Court of the New York County Lawyers Association, said 
state law calls for the parents to administrate the will of someone 
with no living spouse or offspring.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Mayor Defends Airport Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami's mayor defended the security at Miami  
International Airport, where a sting operation led to the arrests 
of dozens of American Airlines workers in a suspected cocaine 
smuggling ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miami International Airport is a safe and secure airport,''  
Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas said Thursday. ``This airport 
meets or exceeds all federal requirements and regulations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-nine people were indicted Wednesday in what was believed  
to be the biggest set of drug arrests involving a U.S. airline. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Thomas Scott, whose office led the investigation,  
criticized airport security and said airline workers had easily 
exploited their employee access. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged smugglers hid shipments in food carts and carry-on  
luggage, and dozens of workers gained access to secure areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Penelas said the airport had increased security in the past two  
years, including limiting employee access to planes. He said 
airport officials would study further limiting that access and the 
types of bags employees are allowed to bring into secure areas.

<HEADLINE> Union Pessimistic About Boeing Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. chairman Phil Condit said Friday  
the company faces ``reasonably good'' odds of avoiding a strike by 
its largest union despite pessimism from machinist union officials 
that a deal can be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's final contract proposal was expected to be delivered  
late Friday night to International Association of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers, which represents 44,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	A firm proposal was delivered earlier to the union earlier in  
the day, but union spokesman Tim Flynn said it was not the final 
offer. ``A cursory look at it suggests there's quite a distance to 
go, but we'll see what happens,'' Flynn said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Condit told reporters late Friday afternoon that cost was the  
bottom line for Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company. He 
emphasized the company's struggle to compete with European rival 
Airbus Industrie. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past it was the performance of your product that made  
the difference,'' Condit said at the hotel where negotiations are 
taking place. ``Airbus is a capable competitor. So the battles are 
about price ... that's the environment we're dealing in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Condit declined to discuss how the company is preparing for a  
strike, but said the Seattle-based company is in ``good financial 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've reached good, solid labor agreements with a lot of our  
bargaining units,'' Condit said. ``We've got big pieces of our 
company that will be running and stable'' even if the Machinists 
vote to strike on Sept. 1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said that a strike would shut down  
some factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides acknowledge a lack of consensus on major issues: job  
security, health care, pensions and keeping a traditional work 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each one of those is a walk issue. All bets are off if they're  
not addressed,'' said Mark Blondin, a full-time union 
representative at Boeing's Everett, Wash., plant. ``I really firmly 
believe they'll walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union is seeking to preserve jobs, improve medical benefits  
and increase pensions. The company wants to cut costs through 
subcontracting, paying less for health benefits and adopting a 
flexible work week. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks come as Boeing is undertaking a massive job cut  
program. From a high of 238,000 in June 1998, Boeing plans to 
reduce its work force to between 185,000 and 195,000 by the end of 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The average machinist at Boeing earns $40,000 a year, not  
counting benefits or overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The current 44-month contract covers 31,000 workers in  
Washington state, 1,400 in Portland, Ore., and 11,600 in Wichita, 
Kan. Boeing employs about 210,000 worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members are expected to vote Wednesday on whether to  
accept or reject the offer as well as whether to authorize a 
strike. The current contract expires at midnight Wednesday, and a 
strike could begin immediately if two-thirds of the Machinists vote 
to authorize it. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the Machinists in Seattle, Portland, Ore., and Wichita,  
Kan., voted informally to support a strike if negotiations failed. 
They have gone on strike in two of the past three contract talks, 
most recently for 69 days in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members said Friday they were ready for a strike, no  
matter how long it takes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Roberts, a material processor and shop steward at Boeing's  
Renton, Wash., plant, said he had enough money set aside so he 
wouldn't start to feel a pinch from the strike for at least four 
months. Most of his co-workers were similarly well situated, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts also said he expected well over the required two-thirds  
of union members to authorize a strike and cited last month's vote, 
in which 98 percent of the 19,000 Machinists from those three 
cities said they would support a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the numbers going to fall short of that,'' he  
said. ``After all, you have people here who have 10 or 15 years 
here and they've gone through and bled for the younger workers to 
have these benefits when they get hired in. When Boeing goes to 
take away those benefits, it's a slap in the face for those workers 
who've been here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts, who has worked at Boeing for nearly two years, and  
Cliff Standfill, a a tool maker at Renton who has worked for Boeing 
for 20 years, agreed that job security was the most important issue 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a money issue, it never has been,'' Standfill said.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Golfs With Prince Andrew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton golfed with Prince  
Andrew today and jokingly bet the island of Martha's Vineyard on 
the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the Duke of York teed off at Farm Neck Golf Club  
where the president, with the prince as a passenger, stopped his 
golf cart in front of a gaggle of reporters and photographers and 
introduced his royal guest. 
</P>
<P>
	The dukes of York, he asserted, were hereditary owners of  
Martha's Vineyard, located in the Atlantic off the Massachusetts 
coast, in the 17th century. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what the bet is? If he beats me we have to give him  
back the island,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you want the island back, sir,'' a reporter shouted.  
</P>
<P>
	Andrew smiled.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you when I've won,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The prince was heard to say that the play would be without a  
handicap, ``flat, no strokes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the foursome were Sir Evelyn Rothschild of London  
and a man preliminarily identified by the White House as Tony 
Fisher of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The golf outing came after Clinton ended two days of seclusion  
at his borrowed summer house with a burst of vacation activity on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He went horseback riding. Then he played golf, twice, 34 holes  
in all. Then he threw on a sweater and, accompanied by first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter Chelsea, joined friends 
at a clambake on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The clambake at the home of Mattel executive Bill Rollnick and  
his wife, Nancy Ellison, is an annual event. The Clintons were 
there two years ago when an aide told them Princess Diana had been 
killed in an automobile crash in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The clambake provided a quiet conclusion to what otherwise was a  
busy day for Clinton. In a stark turnaround from the seclusion he'd 
been in for the two previous days, the president arose early and 
headed to the Blue Heron Farm for a morning of horseback riding. 
</P>
<P>
	A squadron of wild geese flew over a nearby field as Clinton and  
Chelsea rode on sandy narrow paths through groves of oak trees at 
the 40-acre farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton left after an hour and spent the rest of the day at the  
Farm Neck Golf Club playing golf with two sets of college friends. 
During the first round with Warren Spector, Tom Flexner and Ken 
Iscol -- all of New York City -- Clinton sent his first shot into the 
woods, a well-traveled territory for Clinton golf balls. 
</P>
<P>
	During a later round with Clare O'Callahan, Maurie Flanagan and  
her son, Sean, Clinton paused after his first shot and asked: ``Is 
it OK?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Hit one more. Go ahead,'' replied Sean. So Clinton did.  
</P>
<P>
	``Much better,'' O'Callahan offered.  
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons are scheduled to leave Martha's Vineyard off the  
Massachusetts coast on Saturday for a round of fund-raisers in the 
posh Hamptons district of eastern Long Island. Beneficiaries will 
include the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton's 
expected campaign to win an open U.S. Senate seat in New York 
state.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Golfs With Prince Andrew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton golfed with royalty  
Friday and jokingly staked the island of Martha's Vineyard on the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The president joined Britain's Prince Andrew, the duke of York,  
on the links at the Farm Neck Golf Club. He noted that in the 17th 
century the ground on which they stood -- indeed all of this island 
off the Massachusetts coast -- was owned by the dukes of York. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Andrew has held the title since his mother, Queen  
Elizabeth, conferred it in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what the bet is? If he beats me, we have to give him  
back the island,'' Clinton said, stopping his golf cart near a 
gaggle of reporters and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you want the island back, sir,'' a reporter shouted.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you when I've won,'' said the grinning prince, a  
passenger in the president's electric cart. 
</P>
<P>
	If the question of the ownership of Martha's Vineyard hadn't  
been settled by the American Revolution, its 14,000 permanent 
residents and the scores of thousands of vacationers who visit each 
autumn might have had reason for worry: 
</P>
<P>
	The prince's first shot sailed down the middle of the fairway;  
the president's veered radically off course. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't go way over there,'' he implored.  
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, with the ball still in the air, there was a loud  
crash. A staff member in the nearby clubhouse had dropped a tub of 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton usually gives himself the luxury of a mulligan or two  
when he tees off, taking advantage of the extra shots that some 
golfers grant their partners. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the prince made do with his initial shot, Clinton  
followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was evidently played without handicap.  
</P>
<P>
	``No strokes. ... All flat,'' Prince Andrew decreed.  
</P>
<P>
	The royal golf match was the highlight of Clinton's last full  
vacation day on Martha's Vineyard, the seventh time he has spent 
summer weeks here during his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	The vacation's second half will be at the Finger Lakes region of  
upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton are set to  
leave Saturday for the posh Hamptons region of Long Island for a 
series of fund-raisers intended to raise money for Democratic 
campaigns in general and for Mrs. Clinton's likely New York Senate 
campaign in particular. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night at East Hampton the Clintons are hosts at the  
airport terminal to a buffet reception of the young Democrats' 
``Saxophone Club.'' At $250 per person, some 800 people are 
expected to turn out for the Clintons and comedian Jon Stewart to 
net about $200,000 for the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, it's on to a $1,000 per plate barbecue dinner at a  
private East Hampton residence. Singer Phoebe Snow will entertain 
the 300 people contributing jointly to the DNC, Mrs. Clinton's 
anticipated Senate race and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the Clintons star at a $5,000 per person lunch for 80  
at a South Hampton home. The first $1,000 of every ticket price, a 
party official said, will go to Mrs. Clinton's race with the 
remainder being shared by the DNC and DSCC. 
</P>
<P>
	In the priciest of the galas, rocker Jon Bon Jovi provides the  
music at a Bridgehampton dinner on Sunday night solely benefiting 
the DNC. At $25,000 per couple, the event is expected to bag 
$900,000.

<HEADLINE> Skippy Trademark in Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A woman who claims the trademark for a  
Depression-era cartoon character created by her late father was 
pirated by the makers of Skippy peanut butter agreed Friday to 
remove her accusations from a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Joan Crosby Tibbetts, 66, of Annandale, told a  
federal judge that she would temporarily remove passages from her 
Internet site that claim Bestfoods, a company that was spun off by 
CPC International, stole the trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies claim they are being harmed by her ``false and  
malicious'' statements. Ms. Tibbetts declined to discuss her case 
Friday on the advice of her lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The case, which has been in and out of courts for years, had its  
roots during the Depression, when Percy Crosby's cartoon strip 
Skippy was a favorite in newspapers. The character spawned a radio 
show and the Academy award-winning movie ``Skippy,'' which stared 
Jackie Cooper, then a child actor. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers paid Crosby for rights to license products with  
the Skippy name, and Crosby got rich. 
</P>
<P>
	Crosby, however, apparently never cut a deal with Rosefield  
Packing Co. when it began marketing a new type of peanut butter. In 
1933, Crosby fought the company's effort to register the Skippy 
name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, but, according to 
The Washington Post, there is no record he ever filed suit to 
defend the trademark, which expired in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, his life had begun to crumble. His marriage broke up,  
King Features dropped his cartoon and he was accused of evading 
taxes. He attempted suicide, was classified as paranoid 
schizophrenic and was committed to a mental ward where he spent his 
dying days. 
</P>
<P>
	Skippy, however, had again become a household name, this time  
because of peanut butter. In 1968, Ms. Tibbetts became 
administrator of her father's estate and sought compensation from 
CPC International, a successor to Rosefield that later spun off 
Bestfoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tibbetts accepted a $25,000 check, but later alleged she was  
duped, according to the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	She sued in 1980, but a judge ruled that her trademark rights  
had elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, CPC International sued Ms. Tibbetts, claiming she had  
infringed on the company's trademark by attempting to sell products 
through her company, Skippy Inc. U.S. District Judge Richard 
Williams ordered her to stop claiming the trademark rights had been 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the case was once again before Williams. He gave Ms.  
Tibbetts five days to remove certain statements from her Web site. 
Another hearing was set for Sept. 17.

<HEADLINE> Esquire Allowed in Fla. Prisons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Prisoners in Florida will be allowed to  
read about a California guard ``who did some very bad things'' to 
inmates despite concern that the Esquire magazine article is 
``dangerously inflammatory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A three-member Department of Corrections panel decided late  
Thursday that prisoners should have access to the magazine, which 
tells the story of Roscoe ``Bonecrusher'' Pondexter, a guard at 
Corcoran State Prison in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The September issue appears at the same time Florida prisons are  
dealing with the recent death of an inmate and an investigation 
into whether guards killed him. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine describes ``how a nice guy, Roscoe Pondexter,  
became a brutal guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the North Florida Reception Center prison in Lake  
Butler intercepted an inmate's copy of the magazine after reading 
``The Making of Bonecrusher'' by Richard Stratton. 
</P>
<P>
	They passed the story to the corrections department's literature  
review committee, which decided the magazine should be allowed, 
corrections spokesman C.J. Drake said today. 
</P>
<P>
	He said committee members felt the story had no direct bearing  
on Florida's prison system and wasn't particularly inflammatory 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The article appeared to be stating the facts as opposed to an  
article that would have advocated any course of action,'' Drake 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The story contains Pondexter's account of how he and other  
Corcoran guards abused inmates, including forcing them to fight 
``like gladiators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Bonecrusher was part of this gang of guards that was said to  
wager on these fights, part of this gang that shot and killed seven 
of the gladiators when the fights didn't go as planned, or shot and 
killed them just for sport,'' the story says. 
</P>
<P>
	David Granger, Esquire's editor in chief, said before the  
committee's decision he was ``struck that they would find our piece 
so powerful it could cause problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Corcoran, eight officers were indicted for allegedly staging  
gladiator-style fights between inmates. An independent panel found 
last fall that deadly force was not justified in 24 of 31 inmate 
shootings at Corcoran from 1989 to 1995; guards shot some inmates 
engaged in fistfights, killing seven of them. Five others were 
charged with sexually assaulting an inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	Pondexter was never charged and has been granted immunity in  
exchange for his testimony against other guards. He was fired for 
beating up a prisoner.

his wife, Nancy Ellison, is an annual event. The Clintons were 
there two years ago when an aide told them Princess Diana had been 
killed in an automobile crash in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The clambake provided a quiet conclusion to what otherwise was a  
busy day for Clinton. In a stark turnaround from the seclusion he'd 
been in for the two previous days, the president arose early and 
headed to the Blue Heron Farm for a morning of horseback riding. 
</P>
<P>
	A squadron of wild geese flew over a nearby field as Clinton and  
Chelsea rode on sandy narrow paths through groves of oak trees at 
the 40-acre farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton left after an hour and spent the rest of the day at the  
Farm Neck Golf Club playing golf with two sets of college friends. 
During the first round with Warren Spector, Tom Flexner and Ken 
Iscol -- all of New York City -- Clinton sent his first shot into the 
woods, a well-traveled territory for Clinton golf balls. 
</P>
<P>
	During a later round with Clare O'Callahan, Maurie Flanagan and  
her son, Sean, Clinton paused after his first shot and asked: ``Is 
it OK?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Hit one more. Go ahead,'' replied Sean. So Clinton did.  
</P>
<P>
	``Much better,'' O'Callahan offered.  
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons are scheduled to leave Martha's Vineyard off the  
Massachusetts coast on Saturday for a round of fund-raisers in the 
posh Hamptons district of eastern Long Island. Beneficiaries will 
include the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton's 
expected campaign to win an open U.S. Senate seat in New York 
state.

<HEADLINE> Two Concorde Jets Pass Too Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two British Airways Concorde jets traveling over  
200 mph came too close to one another as one was landing while the 
other was taking off from Kennedy International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration is calling the Thursday  
incident ``operational error'' possibly due to a mistake by air 
traffic controllers, spokeswoman Arlene Salac said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after 9 a.m. Thursday, British Airways Flight 1 from  
London was preparing to land while Flight 2 to London was taking 
off from a nearby runway. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest the planes had been was about 800 feet vertically  
and about three-quaters of a mile horizontally, Ms. Salac said. The 
plans were about eight miles from the airport at the time, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the needle-nose supersonic planes were close, Salac  
said the incident did not qualify as a near collision. She said her 
agency was investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways and Air France are the only scheduled airlines  
flying the Concorde in the United States. British Airways flies two 
daily round trips between London and New York, while Air France 
operates a daily round trip between Paris and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane is popular with celebrities, world-class athletes and  
other rich people. It flies above turbulence at nearly 60,000 feet, 
crossing the Atlantic in about 3 1/2 hours, less than half that of 
regular jetliners.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays Place Eiland on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays placed  
pitcher Dave Eiland on the disabled list with left hip bursitis 
Friday and recalled reliever Alan Newman from Triple-A Durham. 
</P>
<P>
	Eiland, 4-7 with a 5.48 ERA, left Thursday's game against the  
Chicago White Sox in the third inning with hip soreness. The stint 
on the DL is the second of the season for the right-hander, who 
missed part of June because of lower back stiffness. 
</P>
<P>
	Eiland had won three of his past five starts, getting his first  
victories in consecutive decisions for the first time since 
September 1990 with the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman, a left-handed reliever, has been with the Devil Rays on  
four different occasions this season, going 1-2 with a 10.13 ERA in 
six games.

<P>
	SOUTH PARIS, Maine (AP) -- A grand jury will consider the case of  
a driver whose van struck and injured Stephen King. 
</P>
<P>
	The June 19 accident was investigated by the sheriff's  
department, which turned over its report to the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Norman Croteau said Friday the Oxford County

further. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 51, was walking along the shoulder of a road near his  
vacation home when he was hit by the van. He has undergone several 
surgeries to set broken bones in his leg and hip and faces a long 
rehabilitation.

<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- In the latest wave of layoffs to hit  
Singapore's electronics industry, U.S. computer maker Compaq will 
lay off 1,600 people, or nearly two-thirds of the workers at its 
Singapore factory, the company said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest personal computer maker announced in July  
that it would close a number of plants and slash up to 8,000 jobs

<HEADLINE> Downey Jr. Back in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORCORAN, Calif. (AP) -- Robert Downey Jr. is back behind bars.  
</P>
<P>
	Downey, 34, arrived Thursday at Corcoran State Prison, where he  
will be housed with other inmates in a dormitory setting, said 
prison spokeswoman Belle Call. He'll be treated at the prison 
substance abuse unit, along with about 7,000 other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the actor will receive special treatment, Call  
responded: ``Negative. He's an inmate. That's what he is to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Municipal Judge Lawrence Mira sentenced  
Downey to three years for a probation violation stemming from a 
1996 drug conviction. The judge refused the actor's request to 
remain on parole, saying Downey had manipulated doctors and 
psychiatrists during seven court-ordered drug rehabilitation 
programs.

</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York, whose accounts are suspected of being used  
for money laundering by Russian mobsters, has fired a London-based 
executive in charge of its Eastern European operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank would not elaborate on its decision to fire the  
executive, Lucy Edwards, but Dow Jones Newswires reported that the 
bank suspected her of misconduct and falsifying records. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards is married to a Russian businessman who serves as a  
director on a company that investigators believe may be associated 
with the scheme. Ms. Edwards was suspended Aug. 18, and her home 
and office were searched by authorities three days later. 
</P>
<P>
	A second executive suspended by the bank, Natasha Kagalovsky,  
has denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards could not be reached for comment, and has not been  
charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In an ironic twist to the case, Ms. Edwards made a presentation  
on the latest money laundering techniques at a conference for 
financial executives in Riga, Latvia, in June. Her speech was 
entitled ``Money Laundering: Latest Developments and Regulations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Gelin, who helped organize the conference for the  
London-based company Shorex Ltd., invited Edwards to address the 
two-day meeting. ``One of her roles at the bank, in terms of taking 
on new clients, was diligence and the money laundering aspects. She 
was trained by the bank in that,'' Gelin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it would be good to take on someone from a Western  
bank because they were likely to have stricter procedures, more 
than in Eastern Europe,'' Gelin said. ``The Americans are always 
lecturing the world on how fantastic they are, so we trusted 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering is the process of moving ill-gotten gains  
through a series of bank accounts until they appear like legitimate 
profits from legal businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators suspect that billions of dollars were moved  
through accounts at the Bank of New York, partly through a company 
called Benex Worldwide Ltd. Ms. Edwards' husband, Russian 
businessman Peter Berlin, is listed as a director of Benex. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe the total amount funneled through the bank  
may exceed $10 billion, reports have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among evidence found by British police during a search of Ms.  
Edwards' London apartment last week was Bank of New York stationery 
with Ms. Edwards' home address on it, according to Dow Jones 
Newswires. Investigators suspect she may have been conducting 
business from her house using the bank's name, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigations declined to  
comment. A call to the U.S. Attorney's office in New York, which is 
believed to be investigating the matter, was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Bank of New York official suspended pending the  
investigation, Ms. Kagalovsky, is a senior vice president in New 
York who also supervised the bank's business in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement authorities reportedly are investigating the  
activities of Ms. Kagalovsky's husband Konstantin, who was Russia's 
representative to the International Monetary Fund from 1992 to 1995 
and later worked as a senior executive at Russia's Menetap bank. He 
now is vice president of Russian oil giant Yukos. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple released a statement Thursday denying any wrongdoing  
and dismissing reports of Russian mob involvement as an 
``anti-Russian campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil: Economic Protest Made Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's leaders acknowledged Friday  
that this week's opposition rally -- the biggest in seven years -- 
had made an impact and that the government had to find ways to 
redirect Brazil's economic goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The peaceful rally Wednesday drew thousands of people from  
around the country to Brasilia, the capital. The protesters came in 
some 2,000 buses to express their discontent with President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso's belt-tightening free-market reforms, 
which have produced stagnation and high unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates of the crowd varied from 40,000 to 130,000.  
</P>
<P>
	``This march serves as a reflection, so that these criticisms  
can lead us to a correction of policy,'' said Rep. Inocencio 
Oliveira, a leader of the government-allied Liberal Front Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso also responded, saying ``the message is noted. ... We  
have to look at what lies ahead and what is left to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement with the International Monetary Fund for a  
$41.5 billion loan, Brazil must reduce its budget deficit. But some 
analysts think that in the wake of the protest, the government will 
take a harder line with the IMF, loosening spending restrictions to 
ease the nation's 7.5 percent unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso, who was elected in 1994 and re-elected last year, has  
tried to modernize Brazil's archaic state-run economy. But the 
global crisis that blew up in Asia in 1997 forced the government to 
raise interest rates and devalue its currency, plunging the economy 
into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent poll showed 59 percent of Brazilians think Cardoso is  
doing a bad or terrible job. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition leaders promised to turn up the heat. Next up is the  
``Cry of the Excluded,'' a nationwide protest backed by Brazil's 
Roman Catholic Church and scheduled for Sept. 7, the Brazilian 
Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just the beginning,'' said Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva,  
a two-time presidential candidate for the leftist Workers Party. 
``We hope that Cardoso listens and feels the clamor of the 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the protest wasn't all bad news for the government. It was  
smaller than some had feared it would be, and most demonstrators 
were linked to political parties -- very different from the popular 
groundswell that preceded former President Fernando Collor de 
Mello's 1992 impeachment on corruption charges.

<HEADLINE> Former Mexican Prosecutor Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Mexico's former top drug prosecutor, under house  
arrest in New Jersey for more than four years, was charged Friday 
with laundering $9.9 million in suspected drug payoffs through a 
Houston bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 25-count money laundering and conspiracy indictment  
unsealed Friday, Mario Ruiz Massieu was charged with using an 
unidentified intermediary to move the cash from Mexico to a Houston 
bank between 1993 and 1995, after he opened the account himself 
with a $40,000 deposit. 
</P>
<P>
	On 26 other occasions, the intermediary deposited $9.9 million  
into the account at a branch of the Chase Bank of Texas, known 
formerly as the Texas Commerce Bank, the indictment alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. authorities took Ruiz Massieu into custody Thursday night  
at his Palisades Park, N.J., home. He's been under house arrest 
since 1995, after authorities nabbed him at Newark International 
Airport while he was fleeing to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Magistrate Judge Joel Pisano in Newark, N.J., set bond for  
Ruiz Massieu at $500,000 and ordered that he be flown to Houston 
within the next 10 days. His wife and 10-year-old daughter 
accompanied him to court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed in the government, that they continue to  
hound this man who has prevailed in so many proceedings,'' defense 
attorney Cathy Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fleming said the criminal case is identical to the civil  
forfeiture case against Ruiz Massieu that was tried in Houston more 
than three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, a federal jury concluded that more than $9 million  
seized in the account had been illegally obtained and therefore 
rightfully seized by U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Customs Service officials in Houston said Friday they are  
still looking for Jorge Stergios Gomez, who authorities believe was 
instructed by Ruiz Massieu to ferry the money to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz Massieu has successfully defended himself against four U.S.  
attempts to extradite him and one attempt to deport him. He has 
continued to write books about Mexican political history while 
under house arrest in New Jersey, Ms. Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican government has accused Ruiz Massieu of obstructing  
the investigation into the 1994 assassination of his own brother, 
Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the No. 2 official of the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican prosecutors contend Mario Ruiz Massieu was trying to  
protect the man convicted of masterminding that murder, Raul 
Salinas, the brother of the then-president. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Salinas is currently serving a 25-year homicide sentence at  
a medium-security prison west of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Mexican president, Carlos Salinas, now lives in  
self-imposed exile in Dublin, Ireland.

<HEADLINE> FCC OKs MCI Purchase of SkyTel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission has  
approved the acquisition of paging company SkyTel Communications 
Inc. by telecommunications power MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC said it had received no comments or documentation from  
competitors or outside agencies seeking to block the merger. The 
regulatory agency concluded that the merger would ``serve the 
public interest, convenience and necessity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramkrishna Kasargod, an analyst with Morgan Keegan and Co. in  
Memphis, Tenn., said Thursday that with the level of competition in 
the telecommunications market, ``there was no reason for anyone to 
oppose this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasargod and Henry Barbour, manager of investor relations for  
SkyTel, both noted that while SkyTel does make up a great deal of 
the high-end messaging business, it has only a small percentage of 
the total paging industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``WorldCom has no paging licenses whatsoever ... . With the  
merger, we just aren't threatening anybody,'' Barbour said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Department of Justice gave its blessing in July, all  
that now stands in the way of the merger is a vote from SkyTel 
shareholders, expected to take place Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, the nation's No. 2 long-distance phone company,  
and SkyTel, one of the few profitable companies in the paging 
industry, are both based in the Jackson metro area. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger proposal calls for SkyTel shareholders to receive one  
share of WorldCom Stock for every four shares of SkyTel. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of MCI WorldCom closed Friday at $78.50, while SkyTel  
shares were unchanged at $20 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, valuing 
the deal at about $1.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> College Binge Drinking Worries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The president of Pennsylvania State University  
says binge drinking is an even bigger problem on college campuses 
than illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to say that drug use is no longer a problem, but  
the truth is we don't see nearly as much of it as excess 
consumption of alcohol,'' Graham Spanier told the National Press 
Club. ``Alcohol has been the drug of choice on campuses today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While universities have always had a drinking student  
population, Spanier said Thursday, the ones who do drink are doing 
so more heavily and more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke two days after a Penn State student celebrating her  
21st birthday was hospitalized with a blood-alcohol content of 
0.682 percent -- a level twice what normally sends a person into 
coma. The student participated in a tradition of drinking at least 
21 alcoholic drinks during a 21st-birthday ``bar tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, drinking by Penn State students led to rioting.  
Some 1,500 students gathered in downtown State College as rioters 
set bonfires in the middle of the street, tore down light posts, 
battered storefronts and injured more than a dozen police. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are unmistakable consequences of such behavioral  
patterns,'' Spanier said. ``Frequent binge drinkers are far more 
likely than non-binge drinkers to have multiple problems'' that 
include engaging in unplanned sexual activity, getting hurt and 
damaging property. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanier said a recent survey found that more than 40 percent of  
college students today engage in binge drinking, defined as the 
consumption of at least five drinks at one sitting by a male or 
four drinks for a female. 
</P>
<P>
	He said alcohol is a factor in 40 percent of all academic  
problems and 28 percent of all dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanier outlined plans to launch a national awareness campaign  
on Sept. 10, with full-page ads in more than a dozen major 
newspapers. He also said colleges and universities will intensify 
educational and prevention efforts and establish a Web site to call 
greater attention to the issue.

<HEADLINE> IMF Loans to Russia in Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- International Monetary Fund loans to Russia  
should be halted until controls are put in place for preventing 
illegal diversions of the sort that may have occurred through the 
Bank of New York, the House Banking Committee chairman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, made the statement amid concern that  
some of the $10 billion or so allegedly funneled through the bank 
by Russian gangsters in a money-laundering scheme may have involved 
IMF loans to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless and until firm methodologies for safeguarding funds are  
established, a moratorium ought to be put into place on IMF lending 
to Russia,'' Leach said in a statement from Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities are investigating whether there was a  
diversion of IMF loans or of U.S. credits extended to the Russian 
government for buying grain, corn and other farm products. The IMF 
has said it is taking the allegations seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF spokesmen had no immediate comment Friday on Leach's  
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are trying to determine whether money is missing  
from a bank account set up by Russia's Agriculture Ministry to 
deposit revenues from the sale of U.S. grain in Russia at market 
prices, a U.S. intelligence source told The Associated Press. The 
Russian government is supposed to use the account to pay off its 
official debts, said the source, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Banking Committee plans to hold hearings next month on  
the alleged money-laundering scheme at Bank of New York, the 
nation's 15th-largest bank. It has been described as potentially 
one of the biggest money-laundering operations ever uncovered in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A Russian couple linked to the alleged scheme denied any  
wrongdoing Friday and also dismissed reports that the Russian mob 
illegally moved billions through the bank as an ``anti-Russian 
campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, Natasha and Konstantin Kagalovsky, have not been  
charged with any crime, but are considered key figures in the 
ongoing investigation by U.S., British and Russian law enforcement 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Konstantin and Natasha wish to state unequivocally that they  
have never been involved in money laundering in any way, shape or 
form,'' said a statement issued by their lawyer, Stanley Arkin, in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kagalovsky, a senior vice president at Bank of New York who  
supervised its East European division out of its New York City 
headquarters, was suspended last week after the scandal erupted. 
Her husband was Russia's representative to the IMF from 1992 to 
1995 and he is now vice president of Russian oil giant Yukos. 
</P>
<P>
	Another bank official, Lucy Edwards, was fired on Friday after  
being suspended earlier. She was a senior official at the bank's 
London office who also oversaw its East European operations. Ms. 
Edwards is married to Russian businessman Peter Berlin, who had 
access to at least one of the bank accounts under investigation, 
according to newspaper reports.

<HEADLINE> Military Provided Advice at Waco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- During the Waco standoff, the military  
provided assistance ranging from helicopters and tanks to experts 
on hostage rescue, Pentagon officials and congressional 
investigators said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials insisted the military did not play an  
``operational'' role in any of the activities leading up to the 
fiery destruction of the Branch Davidian compound in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Army special operations officers were present on the day  
the compound burned, but they did not give advice to the FBI on how 
to proceed, nor was advice requested from them, said a senior 
military official. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither did the three observers have anything to do with the  
FBI's newly disclosed use of incendiary devices on that day, said 
the official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of the military's role was given fresh attention with  
disclosure of the use of the military-style incendiary devices and 
a statement by the chairman of the Texas Department of Public 
Safety, James B. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis told The Dallas Morning News that federal officials need  
to explain why members of the Army's Delta Force anti-terrorism 
squad were at the scene on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits the military from becoming actively  
involved in domestic law enforcement matters unless directed to do 
so by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials would not comment on the record on the matter  
or divulge specific information regarding the Delta Force. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the senior official said that Defense Department early  
on in the 51-day standoff was asked to provide two special 
operations officers with expertise in hostage rescue to review an 
FBI contingency plan. 
</P>
<P>
	They did review the plan, the official said.  
</P>
<P>
	The military also loaned radios and other communications  
equipment -- and technicians to maintain them -- and made various 
other equipment available, including tanks, tents and helicopters, 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the General Accounting Office, an investigatory arm  
of Congress, issued a report on Thursday on military assistance 
provided during the standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that the military provided ``a wide variety of  
assistance,'' both to the FBI and to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms. It put the total cost of the assistance at $1 
million, including support from state National Guard units. 
</P>
<P>
	Primarily, the report focused on assistance to the Bureau of  
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, noting that military personnel were 
called to the scene after the agency ``cited possible drug-related 
activity at the compound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its report to the House Government Oversight Committee, the  
GAO concluded that the agency's ``requests for assistance from 
military counterdrug programs met the requirements of the relevant 
statutes for authorizing such support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senior Pentagon official said no consideration was given to  
requesting a presidential waiver of the law that prohibits military 
involvement in domestic law enforcement because it wasn't deemed 
necessary or applicable. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said he did not know whether the military supplied  
the FBI with the incendiary devices that were used, but he said he 
doubted it.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Funeral Head Admits To Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEBARY, Fla. (AP) -- A funeral home director fatally stabbed his  
wife after she threatened to leave him, then buried her with a 
woman whose family held a closed-casket service, police said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Villella confessed after detectives told him they were  
going to exhume the grave, said Gary Davidson, a spokesman for the 
Volusia County Sheriff's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were tipped to the crime when Exelee Louise  
Villella's sister called with worries, saying the last time she 
talked with her sister on Aug. 5, the couple was in the midst of an 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
	Her co-workers also raised suspicions, because the usually  
jealous Villella, who called every morning to check on his wife, 
did not call on Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies said Villella first told them his wife left in the  
middle of the night, but they doubted she would leave her toddler 
son and her car was in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Villella, 39, stabbed his 28-year-old wife  
while she slept on Aug. 5. The next day, he took the body to the 
Deltona Memorial Funeral Home &AMP; Cemetery in Orange City, about 40 
miles northeast of Orlando, and stored it in a cooler until the 
Aug. 9 burial of 89-year-old Marjorie Hutchison. He was the only 
employee to handle Ms. Hutchison's casket. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators dug up the grave Friday and found the wife's body.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were stacked one on top of the other with the homicide  
victim underneath and Ms. Hutchison's body on top,'' Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Villella was arrested Thursday and charged with first-degree  
murder. He was jailed without bond.

<HEADLINE>  Hurricane Looms East of Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis buffeted fragile  
Bahamian islands with gusty winds on Friday and kicked up high surf 
hundreds of miles away off North Carolina's Outer Banks. 
Forecasters warned it could strike the east coast of Florida as 
soon as Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor of North Carolina put state troopers on alert and  
National Guard troops prepared for storm duty in South Carolina as 
a hurricane watch was posted for Florida's eastern coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Gale-force winds whipped around Harbour Island in the Bahamas  
and waves from a choppy Atlantic crashed over roadways on the 
island of Eleuthera, residents said. Locals and tourists alike 
huddled behind boarded-up windows, said Sharon Rolle, owner of the 
Coral Sands Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds from the storm's weaker side bent trees and tossed around  
outdoor furniture in the northwest Bahamas, but the hurricane's 
powerful 80-mph winds threatened to directly strike the Abaco 
islands Friday night, according to meteorologist Todd Kimberlain of 
the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``That portion of the northern Bahamas is going to be under the  
gun,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 p.m. EDT, Dennis was 20 miles east of Great Abaco, a sliver  
of an island no more than 10 miles at its widest, and 315 miles 
southeast of Cape Canaveral in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	On its current track, moving west-northwest at nearly 7 mph, it  
is projected to sidle along the Florida coast by Saturday and then 
head further north, near the Carolinas, within three days, 
Kimberlain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was projected, however, to turn north sometime later  
Saturday, taking it further from the U.S. coast, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	People began preparing for the storm from the Bahamas to the  
Carolinas, banging wood over windows, battening down roofs and 
stocking up on supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Gov. Jim Hodges ordered 1,000 National Guard  
troops and 500 state troopers to prepare for duty, but no decision 
was made yet on any possible coastal evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, emergency planners urged 150,000 coastal  
residents to get ready for the storm. State troopers and emergency 
management personnel were placed on alert. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was expected to strengthen over the next 24 hours,  
bringing up to 10 inches of rain and tides up to 8 feet above 
normal. That would threaten fragile coral reefs and trees on 
islands such as Eleuthera, which already suffered widespread damage 
from Hurricane Andrew in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Abacos -- a 130-mile chain of sparsely populated islands  
that were settled by loyalists from New York in 1783 -- winds bent 
small trees to the ground early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's picking up already. We've got squalls going by and winds  
are about 25 mph to 40 mph ... we're expected to get the brunt of 
it,'' Club Soleil Resort owner Rudy Malone said on Great Abaco 
island. 
</P>
<P>
	All the tourists at his hotel had flown out Thursday, but others  
might be stranded since the island's airport closed Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone said he saw a group of American tourists among shoppers  
stocking up on supplies Friday. ``Some people think it's exciting, 
but that's probably because they've never been through (a 
hurricane),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane center director Jerry Jarrell said Dennis still  
``could become a major hurricane, a borderline Category 3, assuming 
landfall in South Carolina.'' Category 3 hurricanes have winds of 
111 mph to 130 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberlain said the ``saving grace'' was that Dennis was  
projected to approach Florida with an unusually weak western side, 
which Jarrell projected might carry winds of 96 mph to 110 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``We're not letting anyone off the hook anywhere along  
the coast,'' Kimberlain said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, the approaching storm prompted many surfers to skip  
school and work to catch unseasonably good waves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the surfers that are here from all over Florida --  
Tampa, Fort Lauderdale,'' said Bill Kokotis, owner of the beachside 
Blueberry Muffin restaurant in Indialantic, 50 miles southeast of 
Orlando. ``The hurricane passing by out there creates a nice surf 
and they're all loving it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane watch stretched along 200 miles of Florida's east  
coast, from Sebastian Inlet north to Fernandina Beach, and was 
accompanied by a riptide warning. 
</P>
<P>
	At Marineland of Florida, 30 miles north of Daytona Beach,  
employees prepared to protect the park's 19 dolphins, two sea 
lions, three penguins and hundreds of tropical fish and sea turtles 
from the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our staff will make sure there's no debris that could go into  
the tanks,'' said general manager David Internoscia. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lily, 44, and Nellie, 46, were unfazed by all the commotion.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've been through many hurricanes,'' Internoscia said of  
two of his oldest dolphins. ``They'll stay in their own 
environment.''

<HEADLINE> Olden Polynice Signs With Jazz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Veteran center Olden Polynice agreed to a  
deal with the Utah Jazz on Friday, the team's first sought-after 
free agent signing since Chris Morris in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is contingent on Polynice, 34, passing a physical  
within the next five days. Jazz officials would not disclose the 
terms, but his agent, Dwight Manley, said Polynice signed a 
two-year contract with an option for a third year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz have $1 million and $2 million salary-cap exemptions to  
use on free agents this summer. It is unclear which the 12-year 
veteran would get, or whether an extended contract would affect the 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot, 250-pound Polynice averaged 8.0 points and 9.0  
rebounds for Seattle last season, close to his career averages of 
8.3 points and 7.0 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz signed an aging Thurl Bailey as a free agent before  
last season and Howard Eisley in 1995, his second year in the 
league. Since Morris' signing, other high-profile players courted 
by the Jazz have opted to go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz, seeking a power player to plug into the rotation with  
Karl Malone and Greg Ostertag, pursued Polynice for the last two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that Olden is one of the quality big players in the  
league and are looking forward to having his physical presence in 
the paint with our other big men,'' Jazz general manager Tim 
Howells said. 
</P>
<P>
	It had been rumored that the Jazz -- after being eliminated from  
the playoffs in the second round by the younger Portland Trail 
Blazers -- were looking for fresher players. But Howells said 
Polynice's age wasn't a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're finding that players are playing effectively well beyond  
what they were five years ago,'' Howells said. He also said Karl 
Malone, who shares Manley as an agent with Polynice, is ``very 
enthused'' about the signing. 
</P>
<P>
	Polynice was picked eighth in the 1987 draft by the Chicago  
Bulls, but was dealt the same day to Seattle. He has also played 
with the Los Angeles Clippers, Detroit and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the team concluded a two-week search by hiring  
Kevin O'Connor as vice president of basketball operations.

	In the Abacos -- a 130-mile chain of sparsely populated islands  
that were settled by loyalists from New York in 1783 -- winds bent 
small trees to the ground early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's picking up already. We've got squalls going by and winds  
are about 25 mph to 40 mph ... we're expected to get the brunt of 
it,'' Club Soleil Resort owner Rudy Malone said on Great Abaco 
island. 
</P>
<P>
	All the tourists at his hotel had flown out Thursday, but others  
might be stranded since the island's airport closed Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone said he saw a group of American tourists among shoppers  
stocking up on supplies Friday. ``Some people think it's exciting, 
but that's probably because they've never been through (a 
hurricane),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane center director Jerry Jarrell said Dennis still  
``could become a major hurricane, a borderline Category 3, assuming 
landfall in South Carolina.'' Category 3 hurricanes have winds of 
111 mph to 130 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberlain said the ``saving grace'' was that Dennis was  
projected to approach Florida with an unusually weak western side, 
which Jarrell projected might carry winds of 96 mph to 110 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``We're not letting anyone off the hook anywhere along  
the coast,'' Kimberlain said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, the approaching storm prompted many surfers to skip  
school and work to catch unseasonably good waves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the surfers that are here from all over Florida --  
Tampa, Fort Lauderdale,'' said Bill Kokotis, owner of the beachside 
Blueberry Muffin restaurant in Indialantic, 50 miles southeast of 
Orlando. ``The hurricane passing by out there creates a nice surf 
and they're all loving it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane watch stretched along 200 miles of Florida's east  
coast, from Sebastian Inlet north to Fernandina Beach, and was 
accompanied by a riptide warning. 
</P>
<P>
	At Marineland of Florida, 30 miles north of Daytona Beach,  
employees prepared to protect the park's 19 dolphins, two sea 
lions, three penguins and hundreds of tropical fish and sea turtles 
from the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our staff will make sure there's no debris that could go into  
the tanks,'' said general manager David Internoscia. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lily, 44, and Nellie, 46, were unfazed by all the commotion.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've been through many hurricanes,'' Internoscia said of  
two of his oldest dolphins. ``They'll stay in their own 
environment.''

<HEADLINE> Patriots Sign Terry Allen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- The New England Patriots signed Terry  
Allen on Friday and got themselves a veteran running back to try 
and replace the injured Robert Edwards and a mentor for rookie 
Kevin Faulk. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, 31, gained 700 yards in 10 games for the Washington  
Redskins last year, averaging 4.7 yards per carry. He has rushed 
for 6,881 yards in his career, sixth among active players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to come here and do whatever they ask me to do,'' Allen  
said. ``To go out, and basically show Kevin what it takes to get 
through the season ... how to prepare for a game. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have anything to prove to myself,'' he said. ``I've  
been to the Pro Bowl. The only thing I haven't done is win the 
championship and that's what I want to do. ... I think this team 
has what it takes to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, whose best season was 1996 when he rushed for 1,353 yards  
and was voted to the Pro Bowl, has a history of knee problems of 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Drafted by Minnesota in the ninth round out of Clemson in 1990,  
Allen missed his entire rookie season after knee surgery. He also 
missed the 1993 season with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, 24, ran for 1,115 yards last season as a rookie, but he  
severely injured his knee during a flag football game at the Pro 
Bowl in February. He will miss the entire 1999 season because of 
the injury, which doctors have said could end his career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots placed running back Derrick Cullors on injured  
reserve after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery on Wednesday. He 
is expected to miss the entire 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriots spokesman Stacey James declined to disclose the terms  
of Allen's contract, but WBZ radio reported that Allen agreed to a 
two-year contract with a $100,000 signing bonus and a $400,000 
annual base salary.

<HEADLINE> Method of School Violence Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on school violence is based on  
telephone interviews with 1,016 randomly selected adults from all 
states except Alaska and Hawaii. The interviews were conducted Aug. 
20-25 by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were weighted to represent the population by  
demographic factors such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the  
sample cause the results to vary by more than 3 percentage points 
from the answers that would be obtained if all Americans were 
polled. 
</P>

subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions.

<HEADLINE> Greg Manning Hired as Georgia St AD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Greg Manning, a former Maryland basketball star,  
was hired as athletic director at Georgia State on Thursday, 
reuniting him with his former coach, Lefty Driesell. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning, 39, spent the past five years as director of major  
gifts at his alma mater. His hiring by Georgia State ended a 
three-month search for a successor to Orby Moss, who resigned after 
nine years to take a similar position at Norfolk State. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning was an academic All-American and four-year starter at  
Maryland from 1978-81, playing for Driesell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Greg, but I wasn't involved in the selection process,''  
said Driesell, preparing for his third season at Georgia State. 
``Of course, they asked me about him. He's a great young man who is 
well respected at Maryland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia State wanted someone with a strong fund-raising  
background to be the school's fifth AD. During Maryland's 1998-99 
budget year, Manning was responsible for raising $1.2 million in 
cash and $300,000 in scholarship endowments for the athletic 
program.

<HEADLINE> Utah Jazz Names Personnel Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Utah Jazz will sign veteran free-agent  
center Olden Polynice to a two-year deal, Polynice's agent said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Polynice, 34, was in Salt Lake City taking a physical this  
morning, according to agent Dwight Manley, who said a news 
conference to announce the deal will likely be held later in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going up there in an hour. We plan on signing,'' Manley  
said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley, who is also the agent for Jazz forward Karl Malone,  
would not disclose the terms of the deal, but said it was a 
two-year contract with an option for a third year. 
</P>
<P>
	Polynice, 34, averaged eight points and nine rebounds per game  
for Seattle last year. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the second major move for the Jazz in 24 hours.  
Yesterday, the team concluded a two-week search by hiring Kevin 
O'Connor as the new vice president of basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, director of player personnel for the Philadelphia  
76ers last year, succeeds Scott Layden, who left Aug. 10 to become 
general manager of the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, 51, said he planned to start with the Jazz ``as soon  
as I can clean out my desk in Philadelphia,'' although he expected 
to work for both organizations during the transition.

<HEADLINE> Separatist's Conviction Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- An appeals court overturned the state  
conviction of Republic of Texas leader Richard McLaren, saying it 
found insufficient evidence against him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas 8th Court of Appeals, rendered a judgment of acquittal  
for McLaren, who is serving a 99-year prison sentence in a 
kidnapping that sparked an armed standoff with state police in 
April 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The El Paso-based court, in its ruling issued Thursday, said  
``there was no showing that McLaren abuducted Joe and Margaret Ann 
Rowe.'' Prosecutors had argued that while McLaren was not present 
at the Rowes' home, he had plotted and directed the kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision does not mean McLaren is a free man. The separatist  
-- who claims Texas is an independent nation -- was sentenced last 
year to 12 1/2 years in federal prison for participating in a 
fraudulent scheme to distribute $1.8 billion in worthless Republic 
warrants, which resembled cashier's checks. 
</P>
<P>
	McLaren's attorney, Frank Brown of Alpine, did not immediately  
return a telephone call from The Associated Press on Friday. 
District Attorney Albert Valadez, who prosecuted McLaren, also 
could not be reached for comment. No one answered the telephone at 
his office early this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony in McLaren's trial in October 1997 in Alpine showed  
that three of his followers in the Republic had stormed the Rowes' 
home in the Davis Mountains Resort and taken them hostage on April 
27, 1997. The couple, who lived near Republic members and had 
quarreled with McLaren, were taken hostage, allegedly in 
retaliation for the arrest of another Republic member, Robert 
Scheidt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rowes were held hostage in their own home for more than 12  
hours before they were exchanged for Scheidt. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't end the problem. The hostage-taking touched off  
a standoff between McLaren and other Republic members and scores of 
state troopers, who laid siege to the remote resort 175 miles 
southeast of El Paso until the group surrendered a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Months later, McLaren and an aide, Robert ``White Eagle'' Otto,  
were convicted of engaging in organized criminal activity, 
essentially participating in a conspiracy, to commit aggravated 
kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Republic members contend the U.S. annexation of Texas in 1845  
was illegal and refuse to recognize Texas' statehood and 
institutions, including the court system. 
</P>
<P>
	At their trial, McLaren and Otto represented themselves and  
treated the proceedings as a sham. After the prosecution rested, 
they asked their standby court-appointed counsel to file motions 
for a mistrial and for directed verdicts of acquittal. The judge 
denied both and a jury eventually took less than two hours to 
convict.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Give Back Some Gains / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell for a second straight session  
on Friday, as traders continued to reassess the strong run-up 
earlier in the week and investors steered money into corporate bond 
offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 3/32  
point, or $10.93 3/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 5.97 percent from 5.90 percent 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices had soared in the past week on expectations that the  
Federal Reserve would let interest rates stabilize for the rest of 
this year. But on Thursday, bond traders began to re-evaluate 
whether yields had fallen too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed on Tuesday raised short-term rates for a second time  
this summer in a pre-emptive strike against inflation. Higher 
interest rates push down prices for bonds, which pay a fixed rate 
of return, but investors had already anticipated the Fed's move. 
Instead, traders focused on hopes that the rate hikes since June 
may be all that is needed to slow down the economy and keep 
inflation at bay for now. But those hopes are now in question. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's largest corporate offering, Fannie Mae, the biggest  
buyer of U.S. mortgages, sold $4 billion of 10- and 30-year 
securities. Additionally, the Federal Home Loan Bank sold $3 
billion of two-year notes. Corporate bond offering hurt Treasurys 
because they usually pay higher interest than government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell 1/8 point to 7/32 point, and intermediate maturities fell 12/32 
point to 23/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.97 percent as the  
discount rose 0.06 percentage point to 4.84 percent. Six-month 
yields were 5.10 percent, as the discount rose 0.05 percentage 
point to 4.90 percent. One-year yields were 5.24 percent as the 
discount rose 0.07 percentage point from late Thursday to 4.97 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 5.25 percent from 5.31 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1/4 point to 114 13/16. The average yield 
to maturity fell to 5.75 percent from 5.76 percent late Thursday.

<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A television columnist for The Indianapolis  
Star and The Indianapolis News was suspended and reassigned Friday 
for plagiarizing a story written by a writer at another newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Hall, who has been a television writer at the newspaper  
for 13 years, apologized in a statement posted on the papers' Web 
site Friday night by Executive Editor Frank Caperton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of time pressures, I made a stupid mistake and  
violated a sacred law of our profession,'' he said. ``I apologize 
to our readers and my family, co-workers and friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall was suspended without pay for three weeks. When he returns,  
he will be assigned to reporting duties that do not involve writing 
columns, according to Caperton's statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He also has been warned that if any further lapses in honesty  
come to light he will be dismissed,'' Caperton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone calls by The Associated Press to Caperton and Hall  
were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall was suspended after submitting a story to an editor, who  
noticed that it was strikingly similar to a story done by a 
television writer at another newspaper, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall's story was not published in The Star and The News.  
</P>
<P>
	No details were given about Hall's story, and the other  
newspaper and writer were not identified.

	The newsroom staffs of the Star and News merged in 1995 and the  
News is due to close Oct. 1.

<HEADLINE> Military Computers Vulnerable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Auditors who investigated the Defense  
Department's information networks found security vulnerabilities in 
computer systems controlling critical operations that range from 
weapons design to soldiers' payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, following up on cyber security  
recommendations it has made since 1996, warned Friday that 
``weaknesses in DOD information security continue to provide both 
hackers and hundreds of thousands of authorized users the 
opportunity to modify, steal, inappropriately disclose and destroy 
sensitive DOD data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation from the GAO -- Congress' investigative arm --  
that DOD put together a comprehensive, departmentwide information 
security program is not new; the report noted that the Pentagon has 
already made limited progress on some computer security fronts. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Hansen said the GAO's report was  
welcomed as a way of helping to raise awareness of the problem and 
that it was ``right in line with the types of things that we are 
ready to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department, perhaps the largest user of such  
information systems in the world, spends roughly $1 billion a year 
on computer system security, and has requested more money from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put the kinds of corrections in will require consistent  
efforts, and those cost,'' Hansen said. The office of Defense 
Secretary William Cohen and other DOD operations within the 
Pentagon itself recently set up additional firewalls and password 
protection for information systems, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said that while some corrective efforts have been  
undertaken in response to its earlier recommendations, progress has 
been ``inconsistent across the various DOD components,'' including 
controls over who can physically or electronically gain access to 
sensitive computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Users were granted access to computer resources that exceeded  
what they required to carry out their job responsibilities,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen said the Defense-wide Information Assurance Program, a  
security effort aimed at consolidating such control protection 
efforts across the DOD, is on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO report said it was too early to assess the success of  
this program, and recommended that the program define how it will 
work with other security initiatives already in place.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- An 18-year-old Panamanian admitted he sent  
e-mail bomb threats to IBM, claiming he would demolish the company 
headquarters unless he was paid $5 million, authorities said today. 
Jahair Joel Navarro was charged with threatening to use a weapon of 
mass destruction. The crime, which falls under federal 
anti-terrorism statutes, carries a maximum sentence of life in 
prison without parole. Navarro, a legal resident of the United 
States, was ordered held without bail after prosecutors told a 
judge he had sent a similar threat to Microsoft Corp.

	Greenspan: Market Has Larger Role  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve needs to pay closer  
attention to what happens on Wall Street, Chairman Alan Greenspan 
said today, since Americans reaping the rewards of the high-flying 
stock market are using those paper profits to justify spending and 
other financial decisions. Some economists interpreted Greenspan's 
comments as a signal that the Fed may further raise interest rates 
this year. Two previous increases -- this week and on June 30 -- have 
not dampened the Wall Street stock-buying ``exuberance'' that 
Greenspan has expressed concern about.

overnight rain delay and rallied today to defeat defending champion 
Toms River, N.J., 3-2 in the U.S. championship game at the Little

<HEADLINE> Szabo Wins 5,000m Gold Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Gabriela Szabo of Romania extended her  
reign over the 5,000 meters at the World Championships today, 
beating Zahra Ouaziz of Morocco with a championship record. 
Averlech Worku of Ethiopia finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo swept past Ouaziz with a finishing kick some 250 meters  
from the finish line and crossed in 14 minutes 41.82 seconds, 
improving on the mark of 14:46.47 Sonia O'Sullivan of Britain had 
set to win the 1995 title in Goteborg. 
</P>
<P>
	Ouaziz took the silver with 14:43.15 and Worku finished in  
14:44.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo is the 3,000 specialist and only ran her first 5,000 of  
the season in a qualifying heat for the World Championships. She 
has yet to be beaten this year and defeated Ouaziz for the 12th 
time in a row since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 3,000, the Romanian is still going for a share of the $1  
million Golden League jackpot after notching her fifth win in a row 
in Zurich two weeks ago, where she beat Ouaziz. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Szabo took the early lead, setting a pace only three  
rivals could match, Ouaziz took over around the half-way mark, 
desperately trying to shake off her main opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moroccan increased her pace again with three laps to go and  
only Szabo and Worku could stay in her wake. 
</P>
<P>
	When Szabo put in her finishing rush no one could match her.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Barr Ordered To Pay $28,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Bob Barr has agreed to pay more than  
$28,000 in fines to settle charges arising from a Federal Election 
Commission audit of his 1994 and 1996 campaigns, the FEC said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr, R-Ga., a frequent critic of Democratic fund-raising  
practices during the 1996 presidential campaign, also agreed to 
implement new campaign accounting procedures, to send campaign 
financial workers to FEC training programs and to prepare an 
internal training manual to help campaign workers comply with the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC said Barr accepted nearly $100,000 in contributions to  
the two campaigns that exceeded federal election law limits of 
$1,000 per contributor per election, and failed to itemize an 
additional $25,045 in contributions from individuals who gave $200 
or more to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also said Barr's campaigns failed to properly  
refund excessive cash contributions of $1,705, understated the 
receipts and expenditures in 1993, failed to disclose required 
identifying information about contributors who gave a total of 
$45,683 and failed to file required reports of large, pre-election 
contributions totaling $49,804. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Ginsberg, an election lawyer who represented Barr in  
negotiations with the FEC, described the agreement as ``one of 
those business-as-usual deals that cleaned up some things from Mr. 
Barr's initial races for Congress that had to do with highly 
technical aspects of federal election law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsberg said the excessive contributions, for example, resulted  
from multiple donations from the same individuals that added up to 
more than the legal limit, but were not detected because the 
campaign lacked an adequate system to track contributions from the 
same source. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not illegally taking checks,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached in May but not disclosed by the FEC  
until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr, a former federal prosecutor who was first elected to  
Congress in 1994, was one of the House managers during the Senate 
impeachment trial of President Clinton earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Cutting Ties With Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALCON HEIGHTS, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura launched an  
attack on the Saint Paul Pioneer Press today on his radio show, 
saying he would cancel subscriptions to the newspaper and not honor 
interview requests. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, who repeatedly has singled out the paper for criticism,  
said on the show ``Lunch with the Governor'' that he was upset by 
recent criticism his return to the pro wrestling ring as a referee. 
</P>
<P>
	Editor Walker Lundy wouldn't comment until he has reviewed a  
tape of the show, an assistant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura criticized the paper for its coverage of his guest  
referee appearance at a World Wrestling Federation event Sunday, a 
pay-per-view television show that featured wrestling by scantily 
clad women, vulgar language and simulated violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said the Pioneer Press is hypocritical because it runs  
advertisements for X-rated movies and strip clubs in its sports 
section. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I have to do it by executive order or if I  
simply can state it because I am the governor, but I'm going to 
cancel all subscriptions at the Capitol because I don't want people 
thinking that we at the Capitol in some way support a newspaper 
that supports pornography,'' he said, clarifying that he was 
referring to his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not participate with the Saint Paul Pioneer Porn paper  
anymore, because of the fact that we're going to take a stand on 
this triple-X, this pornography that they're peddling over there,'' 
he said. He said he expected the paper to ``really come after me 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His chief spokesman, John Wodele, said cutting ties with the  
state's second-largest newspaper would not have broader 
ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a communications person in the office of the governor, I am  
not concerned with our ability to get our message to the people no 
matter what the circumstances,'' Wodele said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Ventura nor Wodele said how long either moratorium would  
last. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party governor had retired from the ring in 1986  
because of injury. He took part as a WWF referee after a judge 
turned aside legal challenges to his participation. An editorial 
published in the newspaper Tuesday said the governor promoted sex 
and violence during his appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you wonder also what our governor was doing there,  
bringing increased hype and -- no doubt -- more youthful viewers to 
this unredeeming display of behavior?'' the editorial asked.

<HEADLINE> Columbia/HCA Removing 900 Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Columbia/HCA Healthcare Inc., the  
nation's largest hospital chain, has removed about 900 doctors from 
its payroll as part of a restructuring brought on by a federal 
fraud investigation into the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia, the nation's largest hospital company, once owned  
physician practices that employed 1,500 doctors, but is now 
unraveling many of those contracts. Columbia, like most hospitals, 
lost money owning physician practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying physician practices became a popular strategy for  
hospitals in the early 1990s as they sought a way for them tried to 
drive patient admissions. But hospitals largely found when they put 
doctors on salary, the physicians tended to work less and did 
little to boost their practices' revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to stay focused on what you do best. Clearly that  
doesn't mean owning and controlling physicians,'' Columbia senior 
vice president Victor Campbell told The Tennessean on Thursday. 
``We realize that, for us, that's a horrible strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Columbia still is losing about $100 million a year  
on its doctors and will continue to lose money because it cannot 
simply cancel all the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell declined to quantify the losses, but said they are  
``substantially less'' than they were two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens  
in New York, said getting rid of the doctors is a good move. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a Wall Street perspective, it's to be applauded,'' she  
said. ``They might end up with a sleek, profitable company yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said Columbia ``was never an aggressive buyer'' of  
doctors but acquired physician practices in different markets 
depending on its competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy was changed after Dr. Thomas Frist took over Columbia  
in 1997. He began a restructuring that has seen the company shrink 
from 344 hospitals to a little more than 200 and get out of the 
home health care business. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Louis Brunsting, a cardiac surgeon at Columbia's Centennial  
Medical Center in Nashville, said he's glad Columbia is focusing on 
running hospitals instead of doctors' practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that hospitals owning practices has been a failed  
experiment,'' he said. ``I think a hospital's core business is 
providing hospital services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Columbia officials continue negotiations with the  
federal government in an attempt to end the fraud investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, two Columbia middle managers in Florida were  
convicted of defrauding the government by overcharging federal 
health programs. It was the first criminal convictions to stem from 
the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Early Bowl Games To End in 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- There is a certain sense of  
frustration when people like Michael Cleary and Robert Mulcahy talk 
about the future of the Kickoff Classic at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no future.  
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State will play Miami this year. There will be three more  
games after that and then the traditional opener to the college 
football season and every other preseason game is going to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its inception in 1983, the Kickoff Classic has raised  
between $6 million and $8 million for scholarships, contributed 
more than $35 million to the colleges playing and been the showcase 
of football in the New York City metropolitan area television 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the positives, the NCAA voted at its convention in  
January to end all preseason games. The others are the Pigskin 
Classic, the Eddie Robinson game and the Black Coaches Association 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleary, the executive director of the National Association of  
College Directors of Athletics, lobbied for two years trying to 
save the games, particularly the Kickoff Classic, the original one 
and the only one played at a neutral site. 
</P>
<P>
	His organization benefited from the game, but so did a lot of  
groups connected with it: the National Football Foundation and 
College Hall of Fame, the national coaches association, the 
schools, the players, the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to get rid of the new games, so they lumped us all  
together,'' Cleary said. ``They had to protect themselves from 
anyone else who wanted to come in and start a game. They didn't 
want any more lawsuits and didn't want to lose any more money than 
they were losing, so they lumped us all together. They threw the 
baby out with the bath water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is a sensitive time for the NCAA when it comes to  
litigation. The governing body of college sports earlier this year 
agreed to pay almost $55 million to settle a case involving 
so-called restricted earnings coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The last thing the NCAA needed was the organizers of a couple of  
preseason football games suing it because it let the Kickoff 
Classic continue and dropped the others. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other reasons the Kickoff Classic and the other games  
are going away. The biggest is it creates an opening for a 
postseason playoff to decide a national champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The feeling in college football is to go to a playoff system  
at the end of the year and extend the season,'' said Bob Casciola, 
the president of the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame. 
``Well, you can't just add games in football. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the possibility of that arising, where do you shorten the  
season? If you are going to add at the back end, you have to take 
off the front end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mulcahy understands the reasoning as well, although seeing the  
Kickoff Classic end is difficult for him. 
</P>
<P>
	The current Rutgers athletic director and the former chief  
executive of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, the 
Kickoff Classic was one of his babies. The sports authority at the 
Meadowlands runs the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the early 1980s, Mulcahy went to Ohio to play in a golf  
tournament to benefit the financially strapped College Hall of 
Fame. One of his playing partners was former Princeton great Dick 
Kazmaier, and the two started talking about ways to help the Hall 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	On the golf course, the Kickoff Classic was conceived. It was  
eventually approved by the NCAA, but the sports authority still had 
to compete for the right to oversee it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was bidding on a percent of the gate plus whatever  
the TV rights fees were,'' said. ``If we bid that way, we knew we 
weren't going to win. So we guaranteed the price, including payoff 
to teams, banking on what they could sell the TV rights for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rest is history.  
</P>
<P>
	Schools competing in the game get a minimum of $625,000 plus a  
percentage of the ticket sales over a set level. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really had become a unique game to kick off the college  
season and I am sad to see it go,'' Mulcahy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulcahy's biggest hope is that a way can be found to continue  
supplying the National Football Foundation with money for 
scholarships. It awards between 15 and 18 scholarships annually 
with recipients getting around $18,000, with most of the money be 
raised by the Kickoff Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Graime, the director of college athletics for the  
Continental Airlines Arena and Giants Stadium, still has a slim 
hope the Kickoff Classic can continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some say we are dead, but I'm an optimist,'' he said. ``I  
think it is an uphill battle, but philosophies change, committee 
structures change, personalities change. I have some hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graime also has a Plan B. If Giants Stadium can't be the site of  
a Kickoff Classic, he wants to explore the possibility of bringing 
some major games to the area, such as Army-Navy again and some 
intersectional rivalries that might continue at a neutral site. 
</P>
<P>
	The drawbacks would be raising the money to lure teams here and  
convincing teams to give up home games, which is very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not just going to shrivel up and die,'' Graime said.  
``We've got other ideas we are formulating, and the first on the 
list is to see if we can't extend the Kickoff Classic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleary holds out no hope for that.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is going to happen. We are dead,'' he said. ``They  
just want us to die a nice natural death.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gun Controls Signed Into Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis tightened California's gun  
controls on Friday, signing into law a ban on the cheapest 
handguns, increased regulations at gun shows and a requirement that 
trigger locks be sold with all guns. 
</P>
<P>
	With other new laws that expand the state's assault weapons ban  
and limit residents to one gun purchase a month, California now has 
the toughest package of gun control laws in the nation, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in the Second Amendment. But we have been able to  
balance the rights of the Second Amendment in a responsible way to 
protect public safety,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	California Democrats have pushed for stricter controls for four  
years, but their efforts gained momentum after the deadly Columbine 
High School shooting last year in Colorado, the 1997 North 
Hollywood shootout between bank robbers and police and this month's 
shooting at a Los Angeles Jewish community center. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including the National Rifle Association, said the laws  
will increase illegal gun sales. ``They're high on symbolism and 
low on substance,'' said Steve Helsley, state liaison for the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	The new laws ban the manufacture and sale of poorly made  
handguns and impose stricter manufacturing standards on cheap guns 
commonly referred to as Saturday night specials. 
</P>
<P>
	They also require exhibitors at gun shows to provide more  
information about who will handle the sale of guns, and requires 
minors to be accompanied by a parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Trigger locks must be purchased with each gun, though the lock  
does not have to be put on the weapon. Davis said the locks will 
reduce the number of accidental gun deaths, particularly among 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	All three laws go into effect on Jan. 1.
