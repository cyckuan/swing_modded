<HEADLINE> Jury Deliberates Louima Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A jury deliberated for six hours without  
reaching a verdict in the case of four officers accused of helping 
a fellow officer sodomize a handcuffed Haitian immigrant with a 
broom stick. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury was due back Monday in a case that shocked the city for  
its alleged brutality and raised tensions between police and 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The case had five defendants, but one, Officer Justin Volpe,  
pleaded guilty midway through the trial of committing the actual 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the four remaining defendants, one officer is accused of  
holding Abner Louima down in a stationhouse bathroom; two are 
accused of beating him in a police car on the way to the 
stationhouse and the fifth is charged with helping cover up the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	While Louima identified Volpe in court, he could only identify  
the second officer as the driver of the patrol car that brought him 
to the stationhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe assaulted Louima because mistakenly thought Louima had  
punched him in a melee outside a nightclub.

<HEADLINE> Army Pilot Pleads Guilty in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT STEWART, Ga. (AP) -- One of two pilots blamed for a  
helicopter crash last summer in the Bahamas that killed their wives 
has admitted he did not have the authority to allow the women on 
the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Warrant Officer Daniel Riddell, who was in control of the  
UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter when it crashed, told a military judge 
Friday that he was guilty of wrongful violation of a military order 
for permitting the women on the maintenance test flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddell told the judge that he and Chief Warrant Officer David  
Guido were only authorized by their commander to take the 
helicopter on the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all we were briefed for and we did allow the wives on  
board the aircraft,'' Riddell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The July 6 crash near Grand Exuma Island airport killed Rebecca  
Riddell and Pam Guido. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddell also pleaded guilty Friday to willful dereliction of  
duty. The combined charges carry a maximum of two years in prison, 
dismissal from the Army and forfeiture of military pay and 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to simply accept responsibility for what he did,  
which was allow the wives to have the helicopter ride they 
wanted,'' said Riddell's attorney, Doug Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddell still faces charges of conspiracy, misappropriation of a  
military aircraft, making a false official statement and conduct 
unbecoming an officer. His court-martial is scheduled for June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Guido's court-martial is to begin next week. He faces similar  
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing held in March to determine whether the men  
would go to trial, one investigator testified the accident was 
caused by a ``pitch-back attack,'' a maneuver that causes the 
helicopter to abruptly change directions by spinning the tail. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers have said a mechanical failure was to blame and  
that the pilots did nothing dangerous.

<HEADLINE>  Sabres Know About Stanley Cup Flops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Six Buffalo Sabres know the satisfaction of  
making it to the Stanley Cup finals, and all six know the 
disappointment of losing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Woolley, Joe Juneau, Stu Barnes, Rhett Warrener, Alexei  
Zhitnik and Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	Five had the embarrassment of a sweep heaped atop the  
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley, Barnes and Warrener played for the Florida Panthers  
when they were swept by Colorado three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts a lot, and I don't want to have that feeling again,''  
said Woolley, Buffalo's leading scorer in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The six Sabres understand the pressures, the distractions, the  
endless questions. Win or lose, experience counts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for us to have people who have been there before,''  
Sabres general manager Darcy Regier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres beat Toronto in five games to win the Eastern  
Conference finals and will face the Dallas Stars in the Stanley Cup 
finals beginning Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Regier acquired Barnes, Warrener and Juneau in trades this  
season. Their playoff experience was a plus. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the Toronto series, we asked Joe Juneau and Stu Barnes  
to talk to the players about what it's like and the kind of 
commitment that's needed and just kind of keep everybody's feet on 
the ground,'' Regier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau was with the Washington Capitals when they were swept by  
Detroit last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek rode the bench behind Ed Belfour when Chicago was swept by  
Pittsburgh in 1992. Zhitnik played for the Los Angeles Kings when 
they were beaten in five games by the Montreal Canadiens in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the final, I think it was eight years ago or seven, I  
don't even know,'' Hasek said. ``I don't remember too much. I was 
the backup. This year is a totally different experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes.  
</P>
<P>
	Zhitnik says all six players will build on their experience for  
the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody's angry,'' Zhitnik said.  
</P>
<P>
	Zhitnik vows not to be embarrassed.  
</P>
<P>
	``This could be my last chance,'' said Zhitnik, a native of  
Ukraine. ``I know this game is going to be shown all around the 
world. My friends are going to watch at home. I'm going to be 
hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau scored Washington's winning goal to oust the Sabres in  
Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals last season. He was happy 
when Washington traded him to Buffalo on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to have a chance at it again,'' Juneau said. ``With  
all the injuries with Washington we didn't have a chance to repeat. 
That's why I feel very lucky that Washington let me go with a team 
that had a chance to go far in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff and assistant Mike Ramsey also were  
part of a Stanley Cup sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a little easier the second time around,''  
said Ruff, an assistant with Florida in 1996. ``You know you've got 
to keep your players focused and that there's a lot of media 
attention and a lot of things going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey played for the Red Wings when they were swept by the New  
Jersey Devils in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Having failed to grab it once, Zhitnik knows what it takes to  
capture the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kill to win,'' he said. ``Do anything possible -- score, block  
the shots, play physical, even if you're not a physical player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley says there's a lot to handle both on and off the ice.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know exactly what I'm getting into, from the media exposure  
to focusing properly and handling the tickets and handling the 
family,'' he said. ``It's something that our young guys are going 
to have to pick up and learn real fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, maybe the biggest lesson to be learned from a crash  
in the Cup final is to forget it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be thinking about the past,'' Woolley said.  
``I'm not going to be thinking about the last time I was there. I'm 
just going to be going forward and trying to win this thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have to cherish this. It's a very special moment.  
And to win, how cool that would be.''

	N. Albania Shelled by Serbs  
</P>
<P>
	TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Yugoslav forces shelled a northern  
Albanian border town crowded with refugees late Saturday, 
international officials said. One person died and several were 
injured in the shelling, which targeted an Albanian army barracks 
about five miles west of the border, according to Andrea Angeli, a 
spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe. Angeli also said three shells hit the nearby village of 
Nikoliq, injuring three women. In the border areas, rebels from the 
Kosovo Liberation Army are still trying to move fighters and 
supplies into the province to further their fight for independence.

	Yugoslavia: Peace Signing Near

	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- A Kosovo peace agreement might be signed  
Sunday, Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency reported, quoting 
unnamed sources. NATO sources said the agreement would contain 
specific conditions for withdrawal, but refused to detail them. 
When the alliance verifies that the conditions have been met, NATO 
air attacks on Yugoslavia will be suspended and allied peacekeeping 
troops will begin entering Kosovo, the sources said on condition of 
anonymity. No timetable was given, however. NATO also will keep 
open the option of resuming bombing until the withdrawal is 
complete, the sources said.

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The space shuttle Discovery was  
scheduled to touch down on Kennedy Space Center's floodlighted 
runway early Sunday in a rare night landing. But Mission Control 
informed the seven astronauts there was a chance that rain and wind 
could keep them up an extra day. The astronauts accomplished their 
last orbital job -- releasing Starshine, a glittery, educational 
satellite. Commander Kent Rominger and his crew spent six of their 
10 days in orbit at the new unmanned international space station, 
dropping off supplies and making repairs.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jazz and pop singer Mel Torme, known as ``the  
Velvet Fog,'' died early Saturday. He was 73. Torme, died of 
complications from a 1996 stroke after being rushed from his 
Beverly Hills home to a hospital, his publicist said. ``He was one 
of the supreme jazz singers of all time,'' said singer Jack Jones 
of Torme.

<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- American Airlines crews began  
dismantling the shell of a jetliner Saturday while mourners 
attended the first of several memorial services for the nine people 
killed in the crash of Flight 1420. Federal investigators hope to 
learn more about the mechanics of the plane's spoilers -- wing 
panels used to slow an airplane after landing. Although the 
co-pilot has said he believes the captain set the spoilers, a 
flight data recorder indicates they never popped up when the plane 
landed in a severe thunderstorm Tuesday and skidded off the end of 
the runway.

anniversary of D-Day, June 6, 1944, U.S. troops re-enacted the 
World War II landing Saturday in France. The memorial was staged by 
active duty soldiers on Omaha Beach. Also Saturday, paratroopers of 
the 82nd Airborne Division jumped over the La Fiere Bridge, and 
officials later laid wreaths and held a service at the American 
Cemetery. Thousands of veterans from several nations were on hand 
for this weekend's commemorations.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lemon Drop Kid won the Belmont Stakes Saturday  
and denied the Triple Crown to Charismatic, who finished third and 
pulled up hurt. Another longshot, Vison and Verse, was second. 
Charismatic, the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner, fractured two

boxing title Saturday night by winning every round in a brutal 
beating of Reggie Johnson. Jones, who said Johnson was partially 
responsible for his split with his father, punished the Houston 
fighter from the third round on, punching him at will in the late 
rounds. Jones, 40-1 with 33 knockouts, became the first undisputed 
light heavyweight champion since Michael Spinks relinquished the 
title in 1985 to campaign as a heavyweight. Jones won 120-106 on 
the three judges' cards.

four-point play to give the New York Knicks a 92-91 win Saturday 
night over the Indiana Pacers in Game 3 of the NBA Eastern 
Conference finals. New York trailed 91-88 when Johnson took an 
inbounds pass and he was fouled while making a 3-point shot. 
Johnson made the decisive free-throw.

<HEADLINE> UPI Suspends Spanish Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- United Press International is suspending its  
Spanish language service at the end of June as part of a 
restructuring plan, the company's chief executive said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnaud de Borchgrave said the move was part of a restructuring  
plan he announced in January when he took the news service's top 
job after decades of magazine and newspaper work. He said Thursday 
that the goal of those changes is to move UPI away from ``hourly 
news leads'' and toward developing an investigative wire, programs 
based on the Web and links to research centers and think tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suspension of the Spanish service ... enables us to get  
away from the humdrum routine news coverage,'' de Borchgrave said. 
</P>
<P>
	UPI plans to re-enter the Spanish-language market with new  
products next year, he said.

<HEADLINE> South Dakota Tornado Kills One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PIERRE, S.D. (AP) -- The tiny town of Oglala on the Pine Ridge  
Indian Reservation was hit by a tornado Friday night, and one 
person is dead and several are reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
	National Weather Service spotters reported at least three  
tornadoes near Pine Ridge, and severe storms were reported in other 
parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	A 46-year-old man was killed. Six people were missing, including  
a baby living in with the man. 
</P>
<P>
	John Mousseau of the Pine Ridge Police Department said early  
Saturday that many homes were hit by a tornado at Oglala. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe 20 mobile homes were destroyed and 50 other residences  
were damaged,'' he told The Associated Press. ``The tornado hit 
right into a housing cluster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers from several counties were called to Oglala,  
Mousseau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the homeless spent the night in dormitories at the Pine  
Ridge High School, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Highway Patrol has set up an emergency command center at  
Oglala, and Sgt. Larry Weelborg said the National Guard also is 
helping out. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Janklow was on his way to Oglala, according to Pine  
Ridge Police. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three people were taken to a Rapid City hospital with  
head injuries, and there's an unconfirmed report of at least one 
death, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been pretty hectic,'' Weelborg said. ``Some trailer  
houses were totally wiped out, and other houses had their roofs 
torn off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanie Jealous, a dispatcher for the Pine Ridge Police  
Department, said her office had received reports of people getting 
trapped under trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The electricity went out when the storm hit, so tracking the  
storm was difficult, Jealous said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Eight Nabbed in Fake Microsoft Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eight people have been arrested in a  
counterfeiting scheme that authorities said churned out 15,000 
phony copies of Microsoft computer programs every month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern California residents were arrested Thursday, a day  
after being indicted on 45 counts of counterfeiting, conspiracy and 
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	All are expected to enter pleas Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Five other people also were named in the federal grand jury  
indictment, including three who were arrested in February and freed 
on bond, the U.S. attorney's office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ring pressed counterfeit CD-ROM disks of Windows 98 and  
other popular programs, printed bogus ``certificates of 
authenticity'' and then packaged and sold the disks overseas, 
authorities contend. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in February raided several warehouses and seized a  
room-sized CD-ROM replicator. Also seized were color printing 
presses, packaging machines and other counterfeit items that 
Microsoft officials estimated were worth about $56 million on the 
retail market.

<HEADLINE>  Spurs Nearing Another Sweep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- For two rounds, the Portland Trail Blazers  
were the bullies of the West, shoving out Phoenix, then Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	In Round 3, big met bigger, tough met tougher.  
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio Spurs aren't pushed around by anybody. They are  
too big, too smart and way too together for that to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they have been beating all comers. After their 85-63  
thrashing of the Blazers on Portland's homecourt Friday night, a 
win Sunday would give the Spurs a sweep in the Western Conference 
finals and their first trip to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't wait to hit the floor tomorrow,'' Mario Elie said  
before the Spurs' practiced on Saturday. ``When you have a team 
down like that, you want to finish them off. You can't give them no 
hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	History says this series might as well be over. No team has come  
back from 0-3. And after they shot 25 percent on Friday night, with 
an NBA playoff-record-low 19 field goals, the Blazers didn't look 
like a team ready to make that kind of postseason history. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Portland coach Mike Dunleavy was trying to stay positive.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of young guys who aren't that far from the NCAA  
tournament,'' he said. ``That's the mentality we have to take, that 
it's a one-game elimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Dunleavy said, ``Just because it's never been done  
doesn't mean somebody can't do it for the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have dominated the postseason. They've won nine  
playoff games in a row and are 10-1 overall. They swept the Los 
Angeles Lakers and are on the brink of doing the same to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought we'd be 10-1 and on the verge of sweeping  
another team,'' Elie said. ``I mean, we're just on a major roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers were so sure they could beat San Antonio, especially  
after they played the Spurs so close in the first two games. Now 
they're singing the praises of the Spurs' unity and sense of 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem to have the will to win,'' Isaiah Rider said.  
</P>
<P>
	David Robinson just smiles that big smile when told of the  
Blazers' newfound admiration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the same way against the Lakers,'' he said, ``that  
slow, grudging realization. That's OK. In this league, you've just 
got to earn your respect. You've just got to go get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson reminded everyone on Friday just how important he is to  
his team. With Tim Duncan in foul trouble, Robinson took charge, 
especially on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. 50 is having a blast,'' Elie said. ``He's jumping around  
like a little kid. He's showing a lot of emotion. You can see the 
passion in his game, especially with that terrific defensive 
display he put on yesterday -- seven blocks and that didn't even 
count the shots he changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He saw when Tim went out it was his responsibility to lift the  
team and he did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers were left to ponder what would have been if Damon  
Stoudamire hadn't picked this week to spout off about his lack of 
playing time, if someone besides Rasheed Wallace could get some 
offense going, if Sean Elliott's 3-point prayer hadn't been 
answered at the end of Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Sean doesn't make that shot, it's a different series,''  
Rider said. ``Yeah, I'm shocked that we're down 3-0. I'm stunned. 
It's all about pride now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the way Elliott, Jaren Jackson and Avery Johnson are  
playing, there isn't much the Blazers can do defensively, Elie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a tough job. They double-team our big guys, and  
our other guys know down the outside shots,'' Elie said. ``Who 
knows what they're going to do tomorrow? If they play our outside 
guys, it gives Tim and Dave room to operate down low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one expects Duncan to have two bad games in a row.  
</P>
<P>
	``What's scary is Tim Duncan played 20 minutes and had five  
points,'' Elie said. ``He's disappointed. He's mad. I expect a big 
performance out of him. He feels he let the team down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach Gregg Popovich is especially pleased with Jackson,  
an NBA castoff who tied a team record with six 3-pointers on Friday 
night. Jackson has become a major weapon on the road. He also had 
big games in San Antonio's two road victories against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's played for about 19 teams but he's found a home here.  
He's comfortable here,'' Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire's outburst had an obvious effect on his game. After  
complaining about his lack of fourth-quarter playing time, 
Stoudamire was 1-for-12 Friday night and was roundly booed by the 
hometown fans. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all part of the learning experience good teams must go  
through to become title contenders, Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way you build a team is through trials and tribulations,  
going through some heartache and growing together,'' he said. ``It 
takes time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And time is running out for Portland. The Spurs are 5-0 away  
from home in the playoffs and have beaten the Blazers six times in 
a row.

<HEADLINE> Report: De La Hoya Wants More Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Oscar de la Hoya wants double the  
proposed $15 million purse to get into the ring with Felix 
Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Sunday's El Mundo newspaper, de la Hoya won't agree  
to fight Trinidad in a welterweight reunification fight for the $15 
million that he has been offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oscar not only has not signed the contract but also will not  
accept the offered purse of $15 million to fight Trinidad,'' the 
newspaper quoted Roberto Alcazar, de la Hoya's trainer, in a 
telephone interview from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcazar said de la Hoya, the WBC champion, was discussing  
getting double that amount with his promoter, Bob Arum. 
</P>
<P>
	The $15 million figure came from Arum, who is arranging the  
Sept. 18 bout in Las Vegas. De la Hoya was paid $5 million for his 
last bout, when he defended his title against Oba Carr in Las Vegas 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It was thought that everything was arranged when, after an  
internal dispute about how to share the purse, Trinidad's camp 
agreed this week to $10.5 million for the IBF champion. Trinidad 
was said to get $8.5 million and promoter Don King $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's lawyer Nicolas Medina said the Puerto Rican fighter  
had accepted the deal only after Arum had informed him that de la 
Hoya had agreed to the terms, El Mundo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad is undefeated in 35 fights with 30 knockouts and for  
years has sought an opportunity to challenge de la Hoya, who is 
considered the top welterweight in the world. De la Hoya has won 
all 31 of his fights, with 22 knockouts.

<HEADLINE> Lemon Drop Kid Wins Belmont Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lemon Drop Kid, a long shot racing for just the  
fifth time this year, came on in the stretch and won the Belmont 
Stakes on Saturday as Charismatic finished third in a bid for the 
Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the finish, Charismatic, the Kentucky Derby and  
Preakness winner, was pulled up by jockey Chris Antley, who 
immediately dismounted. It appeared the strapping chestnut colt was 
favoring his left foreleg. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid, ridden by Jose Santos, took the lead from  
Charismatic with about an eighth of mile left and got to the end of 
the 1 1/2 miles ahead of another longshot, Vison and Verse. 
</P>
<P>
	The filly Silverbulletday was in the hunt until the quarter pole  
and then faded in her bid to become the first of her sex to win the 
Belmont since Tonya in 1905. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third straight year that a bid for the elusive Triple  
Crown was foiled, and this one ended on a very sad note. 
</P>
<P>
	About five minutes after the end of the race, Charismatic was  
taken from the track in a horse ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterinarian Dr. Larry Bramlage said he was told that  
Charismatic suffered a cracked ankle bone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Naturally our feelings are pretty low, but naturally our main  
concern is for the horse,'' Charismatic's owner Bob Lewis said. 
``We're devastated with the thought that anything could be wrong 
with Charismatic.''

	TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Peace may be on the horizon, but that  
didn't stop Yugoslavian forces from shelling this northern Albanian 
border town crowded with refugees late Saturday, according to 
international observers. One person died and several were injured 
in the shelling, which targeted an Albanian army barracks about 
five miles west of the border, according to Andrea Angeli, a

news agency says. When NATO verifies that the withdrawal conditions 
have been met, alliance air attacks on Yugoslavia will be suspended

told the news agency on condition of anonymity. No timetable was 
given, however. NATO also will keep open the option of resuming 
bombing until the withdrawal is complete, the sources said.

informed the seven astronauts there was a chance that rain and wind 
could keep them up an extra day. The astronauts accomplished their

attended the first of several memorial services for the nine people 
killed in the crash of Flight 1420. Federal investigators hope to 
learn more about the mechanics of the plane's spoilers -- wing 
panels used to slow an airplane after landing. Although the

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Aims for Late-Night Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery's astronauts  
accomplished their last orbital job Saturday -- releasing Starshine, 
a glittery, educational satellite -- then aimed for a rare 
middle-of-the-night landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery was scheduled to touch down on Kennedy Space Center's  
floodlighted runway early Sunday. Mission Control informed the 
seven astronauts there was a chance that rain and wind could keep 
them up an extra day. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's space shuttles have landed in darkness only 10 times  
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Commander Kent Rominger and his crew spent six of their 10 days  
in orbit at the new international space station. They left 2 tons 
of tools, water, clothes and other supplies for the first permanent 
crew, due to arrive next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Before departing Thursday, the astronauts also fixed a broken  
radio, replaced flawed battery packs, and made it quieter by 
installing mufflers over noisy fans. 
</P>
<P>
	This was only the second crew to visit the orbiting outpost. The  
first crew connected the station's two components in December. And 
it will be this December before shuttle astronauts arrive with more 
supplies. First, the Russians must launch their long-delayed 
service module; that's scheduled for November. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's astronauts briefly set aside their packing for  
Saturday morning's release of Starshine, a 19-inch sphere covered 
with 878 small, circular mirrors that were polished by 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	It's purely an educational project; more than 25,000 students  
around the world will track the sparkling satellite over the next 
seven to eight months and, in doing so, determine the density of 
the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Reminiscent of a 1970s disco ball, the $1 million Starshine  
twinkled as it popped out of a canister in the shuttle cargo bay 
and floated away. It quickly was spotted by observers on the ground 
with the naked eye.

	``It was a fantastic sight,'' said Canadian astronaut Julie  
Payette, who pushed the ejection button. ``The first thing we all 
saw was the flickering of the mirrors ... We could track it with 
our cameras for the longest time because it's now and then getting 
a flash. It's beautiful.''

	The project's director, Gil Moore of Utah State University, said  
the satellite should remain in orbit until January before it 
plunges through the atmosphere and burns up.

<P>
	``We invite everybody in the world to track this thing,'' Moore  
said. ``This is not just for kids. It's for students of all ages.''

<HEADLINE> Co-Pilot Says Approach Was Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Despite gusting winds, the descent of  
American Airlines Flight 1420 seemed fine until it touched down on 
a wet runway and couldn't stop, the co-pilot told federal 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The MD-82 jet skidded off the runway at about 90 mph, hitting a  
bank of lights and steel walkway before breaking apart and bursting 
into flames Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight passengers and the pilot died.  
</P>
<P>
	At a hospital room Friday where he is recovering from injuries,  
First Officer Michael Origel told investigators that he believed 
the pilot took the necessary steps to safely land the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Origel described the flight and descent into Little Rock  
National Airport as being ``normal,'' said George Black Jr., a 
member of the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	But after touchdown, ``the first officer felt that they  
hydroplaned down the runway, and the reason for that is he did not 
feel the normal decelerating forces that would be expected,'' Black 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have been especially curious about the plane's  
wing panels -- or spoilers -- which are supposed to pop up at 
touchdown to help slow the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	A flight data recorder, which monitored at least two of the  
panels, showed they never opened. 
</P>
<P>
	But Origel said he noted on an American Airlines-mandated  
checklist that Capt. Richard Buschmann had set the spoilers to 
deploy, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He believed that the captain did arm the spoilers,'' Black  
said while summarizing the two-hour interview. ``Our people did not 
feel that he was being deceptive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flight data recorders also indicated the jet's thrust reversers  
-- used to slow the plane -- were turned on and off. The thrust 
reversers usually remain engaged until the plane slows to a speed 
at which the pilot can safely steer it on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Origel said he saw the captain activate the thrusters, shut them  
off, then activate them again. Because the engines on an MD-82 are 
close to the fuselage, engaging the thrusters affects how well the 
pilot can control the rudder, and turning them off gives the pilot 
better control, he told investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said the plane was traveling at 165 mph when it landed  
2,000 feet down the 7,200-foot runway -- about the proper location. 
It slowed only to 90 mph over the next mile of runway, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black also said that while Origel and some passengers believed  
the jet hydroplaned, a NASA expert on hydroplaning said the jet had 
a good grip on the runway. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm produced wind gusts of 60-75 mph before reaching the  
airport. Investigators are trying to determine how strong the 
crosswinds were as the plane approached. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, several survivors made a tearful return to the scene,  
looking from a rock levee about 100 yards away from the crumpled 
plane as it lay on the banks of a rain-swollen and fast-moving 
Arkansas River. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors and relatives were given red and pink roses as they  
got off the buses. Some laid the flowers on a makeshift memorial 
made of hay bales. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were tears. People as a group kind of consoled each  
other,'' said Jimmy Manus of Benton, whose wife and their two 
daughters were on the plane. ``They were glad they made the trip 
today.''

<HEADLINE> Boston's Portugal Won't Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston's Mark Portugal is back with the Red Sox  
after flirting with retirement. But he's no longer in the starting 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal, who strongly considered ending his career to spend  
more time with his three children, decided Friday to remain with 
the Red Sox. But he has struggled lately and is just 3-3 with a 
5.33 ERA and will be used in relief, manager Jimy Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	That, Portugal said, is fine with him.  
</P>
<P>
	The bigger issue in his life is finding a way to spend more time  
with his children, who live in nearby Barrington, R.I., after his 
marriage of 11 years ended in divorce during last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal, who pitched with Philadelphia the past two seasons,  
signed as a free agent with Boston to be closer to his children -- 
Derek, 10, Jacob, 6, and Alexandra, 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``But with the night games and the road schedule, at times it  
feels like I've been a Saturday afternoon father on homestands,'' 
Portugal said. 
</P>
<P>
	He expects to be able to spend more time with his children once  
the school year ends this month. One reason he decided against 
retirement was their desire to see him play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came back because I love to play baseball and my kids love  
to see me play baseball,'' Portugal said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he didn't make his decision until he arrived in Boston's  
clubhouse before Friday night's 5-1 win over Atlanta and after 
meeting with Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the questions I asked Jimy is if he wants me on his  
team. He said, `most definitely.' That was reassuring,'' Portugal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darn right we want him back on this team. He can help us,''  
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, though, his scheduled start Sunday will be taken by Pat  
Rapp. There's no indication when Portugal, 36, will return to the 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he wants to continue playing.  
</P>
<P>
	``This has been my life for the last 18 1/2 years. It's given me  
everything I have,'' he said. ``You don't know how long you'll play 
this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his last outing, Portugal allowed six runs and lasted three  
innings in Monday's 8-7 win over the Detroit Tigers. He left the 
ballpark in a hurry without talking to reporters. He said his mind 
wasn't in the game and he apologized to teammates and Williams 
about his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ``angry, upset and confused'' at the time and, after  
talking with his agent, team officials and others since then, 
decided to remain active, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to go home and think about this from a father's  
perspective and from a baseball player's perspective,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal first came to the majors in 1985 with Minnesota and  
played with Houston, San Francisco and Cincinnati before joining 
Philadelphia in 1997. His career record entering this season was 
102-83 with a 3.89 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a $2.7 million, one-year contract with the Red Sox, a  
deal that gives Boston a $3.3 million option with a $300,000 buyout 
for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have problems and bad days at our job where we just  
want to toss it out the window,'' Portugal said. ``And sometimes we 
don't get a second chance to do what we love to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been rough seas, but we've weathered the storm now.''

<HEADLINE> Blues Make Bid To Keep Turgeon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The uncertainty over St. Louis Blues center  
Pierre Turgeon's future appears to be over. 
</P>
<P>
	The team has informed Turgeon that the Blues would give the  
restricted free agent a qualifying offer to retain his rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Turgeon, 29, would have been an unrestricted free agent July 1  
if the Blues had not tendered the qualifying offer. That gives them 
the right to match any offer in the unlikely event he got one as a 
restricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Turgeon led the Blues in playoff scoring with four goals and 13  
points and has scored at least 20 goals in 11 consecutive seasons.

<HEADLINE> Sabres' Rasmussen Proves Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Erik Rasmussen knew he could make it in the  
NHL, and he was getting tired of trying to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres kept the bruising young forward shuttling between  
Buffalo and its AHL affiliate in Rochester for most of this past 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Check the oil. Fill the tank.  
</P>
<P>
	Rasmussen rubbed his eyes while speeding along one cold night  
outside of Batavia and asked himself: 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this the way I really want to spend my life?''  
</P>
<P>
	The answer came last Monday when Rasmussen beat Toronto's Curtis  
Joseph to send Buffalo to its first Stanley Cup final since before 
he was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the 22-year-old Sabres forward is packing summer clothes for  
a trip to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Stanley Cup final,'' he said. ``I don't even know what to  
say. I don't even know how I feel about it. Right now I'm trying to 
concentrate on the next game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the puck drops in Dallas on Tuesday, Rasmussen will try to  
knock the luster off a Dallas Star. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hitting gets me into the game,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter  
whether I'm doing the hitting or being hit. Sometimes when I get 
hit, it wakes me up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 205-pound Minnesotan is one player an opponent  
really ought to let sleep. His hits stirred things up in Buffalo's 
Marine Midland Arena this season. 
</P>
<P>
	First would come the tremendous bang rising above the crowd  
noise. The glass would bend. The crowd would roar. The visiting 
team would sag. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hitting is a big part of his game,'' said Joe Juneau,  
Rasmussen's linemate. ``It gives us a big boost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rasmussen can also score and make plays. H had only three goals  
and seven assists in 42 regular-season games while bouncing back 
and forth between Buffalo and Rochester, but two goals and two 
assists in the playoffs have allowed Rasmussen to finally let the 
lease expire on his Rochester apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	His two playoff assists were on game-winning goals.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's here for good,'' said wing Miroslav Satan, Buffalo's  
leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Rasmussen lives with Sabres defenseman Jay McKee, another  
young player who has proved himself this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what it is exactly that's made me stick this  
time,'' Rasmussen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting used to the grind of the pro game has helped. Drafted in  
the first round by Buffalo in 1996, Rasmussen spent most of the 
1997-98 season in Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
	This season he's found consistency as he's gotten used to the  
grind. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem was more mental than physical,'' he said. ``One  
night I would play well and the next night I would disappear. In 
the NHL you can't take a night off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Resentment was Rasmussen's companion on many of those trips to  
Rochester. But he realized that his time in the minors was not a 
demotion after all. It was part of his preparation for a Stanley 
Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
	``You learn a lot in the minors,'' said Rasmussen, who struggled  
during his sophomore season at Minnesota. ``I learned how to score 
again and make plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His goals aren't pretty. The game-winner in Toronto came off a  
brilliant play by linemate Brian Holzinger, whose shot caromed off 
Joseph's stick and straight to Rasmussen, who snapped the tie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the type of player who's going to skate the length of  
the ice and beat five guys and score a goal,'' Rasmussen said. ``I 
have to settle for the ugly ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To a team that has never won a Stanley Cup since it joined the  
league in 1970 and hasn't played in a Cup final since it lost to 
Philadelphia in 1975, Rasmussen's most recent goal was a thing of 
beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so proud of him scoring that goal,'' Sabres wing Dixon  
Ward said. ``He's made great strides.''

<HEADLINE> National League Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Brian Bohanon can't pinpoint why he has stopped  
winning. 
</P>
<P>
	The free-agent acquisition, who heard talk of an All-Star berth  
after beating the Arizona Diamondbacks with a complete-game victory 
on May 14, hasn't won since. 
</P>
<P>
	Bohanon couldn't provide any answers Friday night after going 6  
1-3 innings for the Colorado Rockies and failing for the fourth 
straight time to get his seventh victory, although they rallied to 
win 9-8 in 10 innings over the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are they looking off-speed late? Are they giving up on my cut  
fastball all together?'' Bohanon asked. ``There are a few different 
scenarios.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Bo didn't have his best stuff, but he hung in there and  
pitched like a champ,'' Colorado manager Jim Leyland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bohanon was long gone before Dante Bichette's RBI single with  
two outs in the 10th inning, his fourth hit of the game, gave 
Colorado the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am getting sick and tired of just going out there and just  
keeping the team in the game,'' Bohanon said. ``These are games 
that should be won, and I'm just not doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Veres (2-2), who blew the save in the ninth, was the winner  
for Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Darryl Hamilton, who reached on a fielder's choice, was at  
second base with two outs when Larry Walker was intentionally 
walked by Bob Wickman (2-3). Bichette, who broke a 2-for-34 slump 
with an RBI double in the fifth, then hit the first pitch to 
left-center field for the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Bichette finished 4-for-6 with three RBIs and two doubles.  
</P>
<P>
	``Coming home helped a lot as well as the fans and being in  
situations that were really motivating helped a lot,'' said 
Bichette, who is hitting .241 with two home runs and 16 RBIs on the 
road, but .313 with six homers and 23 RBIs at home. ``I am more 
relaxed at home, and when you are relaxed, you can be a little 
quicker, think a little better and see the ball a little better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers, who have lost eight of 11, rallied in the ninth to  
tie the game 8-8. Marquis Grissom's two-out single off Veres with 
the bases loaded scored Mark Loretta, but Ron Belliard was thrown 
out at the plate for the third out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not swinging the bats well,'' Milwaukee manager Phil  
Garner said despite the Brewers' 17-hit attack. ``You are swinging 
the bats when you are driving in runs when you need them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care if we had only gotten three hits. They ought to  
come when we need them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado took an 8-7 lead in the eighth on a two-out RBI single  
by Bichette off David Weathers. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's 11th homer of the season, a two-run shot in the seventh  
off reliever Al Reyes, gave the Rockies a 6-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's Henry Blanco drove in a run with a career-high three  
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom had four hits and two RBIs for Milwaukee, and Loretta  
and Alex Ochoa each had two hits and an RBI. David Nilsson had a 
solo homer for the Brewers. Starter Jim Abbott went six innings in 
his first career appearance against the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Milwaukee has been in sole possession of last place in the  
NL Central since May 15. ... Catcher Kirt Manwaring rejoined the 
Rockies from Triple-A Colorado Springs, where he played seven games 
on an injury rehabilitation assignment. ... Nilsson has three 
homers in his last two games. ... Milwaukee has scored 73 runs on 
136 hits in its last 12 games. ... Colorado is 3-2 in extra innings 
this year. ... A Milwaukee starter has pitched at least six innings 
in five of the past six games.

<HEADLINE> Duquesne Players Charged in Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Nine Duquesne University students, including  
three basketball payers, have been charged in a federal indictment 
with taking part in an elaborate scheme to defraud PNC Bank of 
nearly $36,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Another suspect who did not attend the school, Robert Unoarumhi  
of Philadelphia, was also named in the federal indictment, and 
helped orchestrate the scheme along with basketball players Simon 
Ogunlesi and Jamal Hunter, U.S. Attorney Harry Litman's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The scheme involved buying bank credit cards and unused personal  
checks from students, then using them to make $35,961 in fraudulent 
withdrawals and money orders between Feb. 22 and April 12, 
prosecutors said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogunlesi and Hunter, transfer students who had yet to play for  
Duquesne, are suspended from the university and the basketball team 
pending the outcome of the case, said the Rev. Sean Hogan, 
executive vice president for student life. 
</P>
<P>
	Disciplinary action against the other students, including  
reserve basketball player Devone Stephenson, could come after their 
arraignment scheduled June 15, Hogan said. Charges include 
conspiracy, trafficking in and using unauthorized access devices 
and bank fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Also charged are Duquesne students Maritza Harvin, 19; Casey  
Cook, 19; Derek Garrambone, 20; Onyekachi Emeagi, 23; Kenneth 
Rivera, 18; and Brooke Jordan, 19, all listed as residing in 
university dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed,'' Hogan said. If the allegations are  
proven, ``this is totally contrary to what we expect from the 
students and it's totally unacceptable, and we'll take all 
necessary action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Wisniewski, supervisor of the multi-agency Federal Crimes  
Task Force, said Ogunlesi and Hunter solicited other Duquesne 
students to sell their PNC Bank Visa Check Cards and personal 
checks, which the students would later report as stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The personal checks were allegedly used to make phony deposits  
into the students' accounts. Unoarumhi then withdrew money from the 
inflated accounts by using the check cards at automated teller 
machines, while he and Ogunlesi also purchased money orders using 
the check cards, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	PNC officials soon noticed suspicious activity in the accounts  
and contacted authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't take a genius to determine that the compromise point  
was at Duquesne University,'' Wisniewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogunlesi was arrested Thursday in Wayne, near Philadelphia.  
Litman said Hunter planned to surrender to authorities in Hartford, 
Conn., on Monday. Police were still searching for Unoarumhi. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogunlesi, 22, and Hunter, 20, transferred to Duquesne this year  
and were expected to play key roles in a basketball program 
rebuilding from a disastrous 5-23 season. Ogunlesi, a 6-foot-10 
center who transferred from Villanova, and Hunter, a 6-foot-5 guard 
from Loyola of Maryland, would have been eligible after midterm 
exams. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephenson, 20, a 6-foot 7 reserve forward, was disciplined by  
Porter for breaking an unspecified team rule last season. He 
averaged 4.3 points and 3.4 rebounds in 28 games last season.

<HEADLINE> Farm Unionization Vote Unresolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Which union will represent pickers  
and packers at the country's largest strawberry grower remains an 
open question as state labor officials review contested ballots 
that have held up final results of a runoff election. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 1,400 workers at Coastal Berry Co. turned out Thursday  
and Friday to choose between the United Farm Workers and a rival 
union, Coastal Berry of California Farm Worker Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Committee received 688 votes, while the United Farm Workers  
had 598, state labor officials said. No winner could be announced 
because another 92 ballots were contested, preventing either union 
from gaining the required majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Agriculture Labor Relations Board will begin  
investigating the contested ballots on Monday, said Freddie 
Capuyan, an agent for the board who is overseeing the election. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Farm Workers union has been trying to unionize  
Coastal Berry for several years in hopes of building momentum for 
union contracts throughout California's $600 million, 20,000-worker 
strawberry industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the union made famous by Cesar Chavez figured Coastal  
Berry was the best place to start, since owners vowed to be neutral 
towards the unions, a rare move in the anti-union strawberry 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But the United Farm Workers has struggled to win the confidence  
of workers, and has consistently trailed the upstart Coastal Berry 
of California Farm Worker Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Committee, which has no president and no negotiating  
experience, also got the most votes at the initial election last 
week, but failed to get the required majority, forcing the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	United Farm Workers spokesman Marc Grossman said the union was  
disappointed in the latest results. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't just up against this Committee, we were really  
against an entire strawberry industry that is rich and powerful and 
greedy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At its most powerful in 1970, United Farm Workers had 80,000  
members. But the figure dwindled to 20,000 by the time Chavez, the 
union's legendary founder, died in 1993. Since then, it has grown 
to 27,000 members.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Quotes from the losing connections after  
Saturday's $1 million Belmont Stakes, in order of finish beginning 
with runner-up Vision and Verse: 
</P>
<P>
	Vision and Verse: ``I'm real pleased with his effort. He was  
doing super coming into the race. He was dead game in the stretch 
and I thought we were going to get there.'' -- trainer Bill Mott. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic: ``Heading for the finish, he suddenly dipped  
underneath me and I could tell he was in pain. He gave everything 
he had and ran as hard as he could but he couldn't give the people

<HEADLINE> FBI Raids Office of Don King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The federal probe into whether the  
IBF sold rankings and arranged fights for kickbacks has spread to 
Don King's corporate office. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all nonsense. They can look at all the documents they  
want,'' Don King said Saturday in a statement released by spokesman 
Greg Fritz. ``Had they asked for (the documents), I would have 
given them to them. I have nothing to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents with empty boxes raided the offices of the boxing  
promoter Friday looking for records involving the International 
Boxing Federation, Don King Productions and Monarch Productions, a 
company run by King's son, Carl, a boxing industry source told The 
Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury in Newark, N.J., has been investigating the  
IBF for several months -- even before the disputed draw in March 
between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, which prompted New York 
law enforcement agencies to start their own investigations of the 
IBF. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI would not confirm the raid at King's office in Deerfield  
Beach, about 40 miles south of West Palm Beach, was linked to the 
IBF investigation or if the search would be completed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can tell you is we are serving search  
warrants on his offices as part of an ongoing investigation,'' FBI 
spokesman Mike Faregas said. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for IBF president Bob Lee Sr., said Friday he knew  
nothing about the FBI raid and refused to say what he knew about 
King's possible involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 18, the Los Angeles Times quoted boxing promoters and  
managers as saying the sport's sanctioning bodies sometimes sell 
the rankings that lead to more lucrative bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported that witnesses have testified before the  
federal grand jury in New Jersey that some payments to the 
sanctioning bodies were made in cash, but that others were less 
obvious, such as those contained in overpayments of standard fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, HBO president Lou DiBella denied King's  
assertion that a rematch was set between Evander Holyfield and 
Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	And sources close to the negotiations, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said one of the stumbling blocks was the possibility 
King could be indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	DiBella said there were ``some problematic issues that need to  
be worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HBO has insisted King step aside as the fight promoter if he is  
indicted on charges stemming from a number of investigations, 
sources close to the negotiations told the AP. So far, King has 
refused such a clause in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in Newark, federal grand jurors have subpoenaed all  
IBF records since 1982 on rankings and contracts for fights, as 
well as checks, invoices, expense forms and telephone records, its 
attorney has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors, citing grand jury secrecy, will not  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Krovatin, the lawyer for Lee, said he does not want to  
give ``any sort of credibility'' to rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boxing itself seems to be a sport that is awash in rumors and  
innuendo and false allegations and rivalries and jealousies and 
paybacks and those sorts of things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF and two other sanctioning groups -- the World Boxing  
Association and World Boxing Council -- set rules and rankings that 
play a large role in determining bouts. Boxers who defy the groups 
risk losing the chance at title bouts and large purses.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Reform Just Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Delay, President Clinton told Congress, would  
mean the death of campaign finance reform. So he urged a deadline 
for action: the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	The issue is still there, and so are the delays. Overhauling the  
campaign finance system has become a perennial topic of talk 
without action. 
</P>
<P>
	House reformers are trying to push it past GOP leaders to force  
a vote next month, not on the September timetable they've been 
offered. So campaign finance has become part of the broader 
struggle over managing the House with a fragile 11-seat GOP 
advantage over Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, joined by a half-dozen moderate Republicans, are  
within 16 signatures of forcing the issue by petition. A House 
majority, 218 members, can get a measure to the floor, overruling 
the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Since that would be a blow to the already troubled leadership of  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, the petition becomes a matter of party 
loyalty. With solid control, a majority could discipline its 
defectors in bestowing House assignments or curtailing their 
campaign support. Not with an 11-vote edge, and the prospect of a 
hard campaign to protect control in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In similar circumstances last year, Newt Gingrich, then speaker,  
agreed to a vote on the campaign finance bill, and it passed, 252 
to 179. But it was obvious that the Senate wasn't going to pass the 
measure, for lack of the 60 votes to end a filibuster there, where 
a majority isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would ban so-called soft money, funds raised by  
the political parties, supposedly for purposes independent of 
specific campaigns or candidates, although the distinction has 
become fiction. The illegal foreign donations to the Democrats 
during Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign were soft-money 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would restrict the growing use of what are called  
issue ads, paid for by corporations, unions or other interest 
groups, and spared the contribution limits that apply to campaigns 
because they do not directly advocate the defeat or election of a 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguments about campaign rules have been going on since the  
first limits were enacted over Richard M. Nixon's veto in 1971. 
Three years later, impelled by Watergate, a Democratic Congress 
broadened them. But the Supreme Court overturned a major feature of 
that law, ruling that campaign spending limits can't be compelled 
because it would it would violate freedom of speech guarantees. 
That 1976 court decision upheld limits on individual contributions 
to candidates for Congress and the White House, set at $1,000, 
unchanged for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Political money has been flowing around them ever since, in a  
flood since limit-free soft money was sanctioned. For the last 
campaign, the Federal Election Committee reported Republicans 
raised $111.3 million of it, Democrats $89.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides are hard at the money side of the 2000 campaign for  
Congress. House Republican campaigners are planning a special $25 
million drive to turn out the GOP vote in defense of their 
majority, independent of the candidates it would benefit, so that 
donations won't be restricted. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever, if anything, is done on a campaign finance overhaul  
this year would almost certainly be prospective, not effective for 
the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The advocates say the voters want change, and point to polls  
showing that when asked, more than two-thirds of Americans say 
there's too much money in politics and something should be done. 
</P>
<P>
	But when they list their own priorities, campaign finance reform  
barely makes the list. Reformers thought it would after the 
excesses of the 1996 presidential campaign, when the Democrats had 
to refund tainted, foreign donations. Clinton's own fund-raising 
tactics -- the Lincoln Bedroom invitations to donors, for example -- 
stirred controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Having beaten the game to win his second term, Clinton then  
joined it. ``You know and I know that delay will mean the death of 
reform,'' he said in his 1997 State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	It did that year, and the next. It could again.

<HEADLINE> Gun Show Held in Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Less than two months after the deadly shootings at  
Columbine High School, a gun show that was the source of all four 
firearms used in the rampage was held again on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. Tanner, organizer of the Tanner Gun Show, said the weapons  
sold at his show are not the cause of the violence like the April 
20 attack by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. The two students killed 
13 and then took their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guns are not to blame and the ready availability of them is  
not to blame,'' said Tanner, 72. He said he couldn't explain the 
violence at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the minds of the children,'' he said. ``I'm not a  
psychologist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He canceled one show that was to be held the weekend after the  
shooting, but said he'll continue his monthly shows. ``We'll do gun 
shows as long as we can do gun shows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were no protests at the Merchandise Mart exhibition hall  
just north of Denver. But the buyers and sellers acted as if they 
were under siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Many cursed politicians who are pursuing gun-control  
legislation. The House has yet to pass a measure passed by the 
Senate last month that would expand background checks to all sales 
at gun shows and bar those without federal firearms dealer licenses 
from selling weapons at shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have over 4,000 gun laws now. Those kids at Columbine broke  
16 laws. If we had more laws, they would have broken 17 or 19 or 
however many they needed,'' said Terry Kern, a Denver gun dealer. 
The existing laws need to be enforced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kern, 42, wore a T-shirt with a picture of Adolf Hitler giving a  
Nazi salute and the words, ``All in favor of gun control, raise 
your right hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His table was piled with rifles, pistols and semiautomatic  
handguns. Behind him, his 2-year-old girl and 3-year-old boy played 
in a plastic wagon. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Angela Kern, 26, said she grew up going to gun shows  
with her father. She said her children are learning a healthy 
respect for firearms that will help safeguard them from accidents 
or violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think exposing your kids and teaching them about guns is  
better, instead of hiding them in your closet,'' she said. The more 
mysterious guns are to children, the more desirable they become, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun dealer Bob Andersen said people who sell guns legally cannot  
be blamed if they fall into the wrong hands. ``I have no control 
over what they do with the gun after they walk out that door,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say two shotguns and a rifle were bought at the show  
last December by Klebold's prom date, Robyn Anderson, when both 
teens were 17. She was 18, old enough to buy long guns legally and 
furnish them to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Friday on ``Good Morning America,'' Ms. Anderson  
said Harris and Klebold gave her money to buy the guns, but that 
she did not know they were planning the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth gun, a semiautomatic pistol, was bought at a show and  
sold to Harris and Klebold by Mark Manes, 22, who faces a maximum 
six-year prison term if convicted of providing the weapon to a 
minor. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, a man used an assault rifle he bought at a  
Tanner show to kill his wife, a sheriff's deputy and a supermarket 
manager.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Tough on 'Social Promotion' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- At Morse Elementary in a northwest side  
neighborhood where 97 percent of the children are poor, principal 
Leon Hudnall Jr. is trying to keep failure at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more you work with your kids, the fewer kids you're going  
to have retained,'' Hudnall said recently as more than 200 children 
crowded into the basement for the supper offered with after-school 
lessons. For failing students, the Lighthouse program offers a way 
to pass to the next grade. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago is heading into the fourth year of a nationally watched  
program to end social promotion, the practice of advancing 
unprepared students to the next grade so they can stay with their 
age group. Almost 25,000 children are heading for the mandatory 
summer program when school lets out this week. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton wants other schools to follow suit, ending  
social promotion if they receive federal money. But districts face 
the problem of what to do if large numbers of students fail -- some 
for a second or third time. 
</P>
<P>
	With more retentions, the choice gets complicated. School  
systems must keep buildings open during afternoons and summers, 
find extra space for kids who otherwise would be promoted or 
graduated, and keep frustrated repeaters from dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big question is whether this constitutes educational  
triage,'' said Linda Lenz, editor of Catalyst, a newsletter that 
chronicles school reform in Chicago. ``Are these kids being helped 
or sacrificed to help other kids?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already some districts are backing off. A Los Angeles plan would  
have required at least 150,000 students -- 40 percent of the 
elementary school population -- to attend summer school to help them 
avoid flunking. Now, the program will be voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York City, officials upset parents when they estimated a  
third of students -- 300,000 -- could fail under a plan to use test 
scores, attendance rates and report cards to curb social 
promotions. This July, 52,000 children will attend a program that 
will cost $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 20 percent of U.S. students are held back a grade each  
year. In large cities, as many as 50 percent will flunk at least 
once before they graduate or drop out. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas, Colorado, Florida and Louisiana have cracked down on  
the practice in recent years. In Texas, Gov. George W. Bush just 
won a plan to ban social promotions statewide. 
</P>
<P>
	But more educators argue that instead of simple retention, most  
underachieving students need systemic remedies. One-on-one 
tutoring, parent counseling and extended school days must be part 
of any plan. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the Lighthouse program made a difference for Kimberly  
Harrison, a 10-year-old at Morse, her principal said. Kimberly, who 
made it to fourth grade after a second try, recently passed a test 
that decided whether she could go on to fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're learning a lot in here. We do division,'' said the shy  
girl with tiny braids. ``I think I'm going to score high on the 
test, because the division got easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact at Morse this year, reading scores went up 13.4  
percentage points, meaning fewer students in the 
kindergarten-through-sixth grade school are at risk of being held 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are looking for that magic bullet. It's just  
old-fashioned hard work,'' said Hellen DeBerry of the Chicago 
schools' office of accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who want to curb social promotion say that without  
retention, children are fooled into thinking they have learned 
necessary skills or get the message that achievement doesn't count. 
At worst, they say, colleges and businesses will spend millions on 
remedial education for students who never ``got it'' in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``This hasn't been something that we developed in a vacuum,''  
Chicago schools chief Paul Vallas said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tougher districts get, the more backup they need:  
</P>
<P>
	--Boston, faced with thousands of retained students, spent $21  
million creating new ``transition'' grades to give a second chance 
to students who stand to flunk. 
</P>
<P>
	--In North Carolina, a policy approved by the state school board  
in April to end social promotion has critics worried about a lack 
of programs to help students struggling with the new standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Some educators believe the damage of simply holding students  
back outweighs benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negative effects of holding students back are often  
invisible ... because they occur many years later,'' said Robert M. 
Hauser, a sociology professor at The University of 
Wisconsin-Madison. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudnall says one key is understanding the non-academic reasons  
why children fail: poor nutrition, family problems, frequent 
absences or a lack of role models. 
</P>
<P>
	But that is no excuse for failure, Hudnall said, as he patrols  
the halls for stragglers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell them I know you can't help the conditions you're coming  
from at home, but you've got to listen while you're here,'' he 
said. ``We keep the building warm, give them three good meals a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you keep doing the same old thing, the same old way, you'll  
get the same old results.''

<HEADLINE> Son of Maryland Governor Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- The teen-age son of Gov. Parris N.  
Glendening was arrested early Saturday on charges of drunken 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond H. Glendening pulled into a parking lot at about 2:30  
a.m., shortly after officers responded to a burglar alarm at a 
store. Glendening, 19, told police he stopped because his Chevy 
Blazer had been damaged after he hit a utility pole, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	He failed three sobriety tests and refused to take a  
Breathalyzer test, said police Lt. Andrew Ellis. He was charged 
with driving while intoxicated and driving under the influence of 
alcohol and released on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor and his wife, Frances, released a statement five  
hours after the arrest of their only child, who recently finished 
his sophomore year of college. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early this morning, we received a call that every parent  
dreads,'' the Glendenings said. ``Today our first duty must be as 
parents. We will offer Raymond our unconditional and abiding love, 
support and guidance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Glendenings said they would have no further comment until  
the legal proceedings against their son were resolved.

<HEADLINE> Regular-Season Champs Want the Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- For two years, the Dallas Stars have been the  
NHL's best team in the regular season. Beginning Tuesday, they'll 
try to be the best when it matters most. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since moving to Dallas six seasons ago, the  
Stars have reached the Stanley Cup finals, finishing off the 
Colorado Avalanche 4-1 in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up for Dallas are the Buffalo Sabres, the Eastern  
Conference winners. The series begins with games in Reunion Arena 
on Tuesday and Thursday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Ken Hitchcock set the finals as the team's goal when the  
Stars gathered for training camp last September. He's confident his 
veteran-filled team wants to take that accomplishment a step 
farther. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their focus,'' he said, ``is on four more games.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock gave the players Saturday off to savor their  
accomplishment. They'll be back at work on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't get too excited, but it's hard not to,'' team captain  
Derian Hatcher said. ``We've got to try to keep this in 
perspective. We've played well all season, but now we have to do it 
to Buffalo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars played so well this season that they won a second  
straight Presidents' Trophy for the top regular-season record. The 
reward was home-ice advantage in the playoffs, which Dallas cashed 
in Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	With 17,001 towel-waving fans cheering them on, the Stars  
controlled the game from the start by swarming the puck on defense. 
The frustrated Avalanche never got going on offense, managing just 
three shots in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas went up 1-0 midway through the first period, then  
ex-Avalanche Mike Keane scored twice late in the second to put away 
the game and the series. Colorado's lone goal came after it trailed 
4-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a matter of one or two guys,'' Colorado coach Bob  
Hartley said. ``They play very well as a team. That's the best 
hockey club in the NHL on top of being probably the toughest team 
to play when they take the lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars lost the Western Conference finals to Detroit in six  
games last year. This year, Dallas won Game 6 in Colorado to set up 
the deciding game at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said all year there is a big difference between this year's  
team and last year's,'' forward Guy Carbonneau said. ``We have more 
poise and we trust each other. It seems like when we need it, we 
always play our best. It just goes to show we have a great team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last three teams to win the West -- Detroit the past two  
years and Colorado in '96 -- each swept the East champion in the 
Stanley Cup finals. New Jersey also swept the Cup in four straight 
game in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Dallas is on a roll, the Stars aren't expecting  
anything easy against Buffalo, who survived the East as the seventh 
seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buffalo is a hard-working team,'' said Dallas goaltender Ed  
Belfour, who outplayed Colorado's Patrick Roy in the semifinals and 
now will be measured against Dominik Hasek. ``Dominik's a great 
goaltender and they've got speed. We're going to have to play our 
best to beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One advantage the Sabres might have is fresher legs. Buffalo has  
been off since eliminating Toronto last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can even use having played a seven-game  
series to say that they are going to be tired,'' Sabres coach Lindy 
Ruff said. ``They are going to have three days to recover. The 
excitement is going to be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas franchise has never won the Cup. The Minnesota North  
Stars reached the finals in 1991 and 1981, but lost both times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our organization has been on a roller coaster ride,'' said  
center Mike Modano, one of three remaining Minnesota North Stars. 
``When you get to this point, you just ride it as long as you 
can.''

<HEADLINE> Cathay Cancels More Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- A weeklong sickout by pilots forced Cathay  
Pacific Airways to ground half its scheduled flights Friday, but 
airline officials said the situation appears to be improving and 
resumed taking flight bookings for selected routes. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines and the main pilots' union plan to meet Saturday to  
discuss their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay cancelled 59 of the 117 flights scheduled Friday -- the  
highest number yet -- but began accepting bookings for Bangkok, 
Manila, Taipei, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore ahead of its meeting 
with the pilots' union on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay had to charter 26 flights from other airlines to carry  
the passengers, but Tony Tyler, Cathay's director of corporate 
development, said in a statement that the situation ``was showing 
signs of stabilizing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airline angered the pilots by demanding pay cuts averaging 8  
percent in exchange for stock options, and the situation 
deteriorated last week when the company gave the pilots until June 
11 to either take a revised offer -- including a smaller pay cut and 
better stock options -- or lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay was forced to cancel many flights since last Friday, when  
pilots began phoning in sick, saying the layoff threats had left 
them too stressed-out to fly. They have threatened a strike vote if 
Cathay starts firing pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	John Findlay, the union's secretary general, would not say  
whether the union would make any concessions at Saturday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is we're walking in tomorrow with an open mind  
and see where we go from there. Tomorrow is the start of a possible 
resolution of this issue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Thursday, Hong Kong's labor officials successfully  
persuaded Cathay management to reopen talks with the leaders of the 
Hong Kong Association of Aircrew Officers, the main pilots's union. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay had said earlier it would not back down unless the pilots  
withdraw demands for annual pay increases if they take two years of 
cuts and a yearlong pay freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	Katherine Wang, a Cathay spokeswoman, insisted Friday that  
management has ``no intention to change any elements of our pay 
proposals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay lost $69 million last year, running up its first loss  
since 1963 as passenger traffic plunged amid Asia's economic 
crisis.

<HEADLINE>  Angels' Park Ejected After Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Chan Ho Park was  
ejected from Saturday's game against the Anaheim Angels after 
throwing a forearm and a kick at Anaheim pitcher Tim Belcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The altercation unfolded after Park's sacrifice bunt with one  
out in the fifth in a game the Angels led 4-0 thanks to Matt 
Walbeck's grand slam an inning earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Belcher fielded Park's bunt and tagged him out. After a brief  
exchange of words, Park forearmed Belcher in the face and followed 
that up with a kick-boxing move that connected before Belcher 
wrestled him to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Both benches and bullpens emptied, but there were no further  
incidents and the game was held up for only about five minutes. 
Park was ejected after the umpires conferred briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	Belcher, apparently uninjured, retired Eric Young on a fly to  
center to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the game, Park had knocked down Randy Velarde twice  
with pitches near his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Park was involved in an altercation with Tony  
Phillips during an Angels-Dodgers game in Anaheim after hitting 
Phillips with a pitch.

<HEADLINE> Summer Camps Increase Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After a school year of shootings and copycat threats, summer  
camps are bracing for the arrival of millions of children -- and 
tightening security to make sure tragedy doesn't follow them. 
</P>
<P>
	Some overnight camps are asking parents to pack their children's  
bags to keep out weapons, and camp directors say they will be more 
vigilant in searching campers and sending kids home if they don't 
behave. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel the greatest tragedy of Columbine would be thinking it  
can't happen to us,'' said Bob Schultz, American Camping 
Association director of resource development, referring to the 
April 20 shooting rampage in Littleton, Colo., that left 15 people 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Martinsville, Ind.-based ACA sent a letter to member camps  
urging them to review safety procedures and detailing when it is 
legal and appropriate to search campers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is stepped-up concern,'' said Don Cheley, who operates  
camps in Estes Park, Colo., 75 miles from Littleton. ``In terms of, 
are kids bringing in bombs or weapons, we are clearly going to be 
mindful of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodger Popkin, owner of North Carolina's Blue Star Camps and  
president of the ACA, sent a letter to parents asking them to pack 
for their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, ``we've added an addendum to our contract with campers  
saying they can't have weapons or ammunition,'' Popkin said. 
``Previously, we would have never dreamed we needed that type of 
contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Popkin and other directors said overnight camps have a  
number of safety advantages over schools. Counselors living round 
the clock with campers are more likely to spot any problems, and 
children's access to weapons is limited since they are not allowed 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Solomon, executive director of the New York-based National  
Camp Association, said member camps have received more calls since 
the school shootings from parents hoping to send their kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, it has heightened the attractiveness of summer  
camp, because it is a secure environment which is not in an urban 
area,'' he said. ``For many families, camp this summer more than 
ever before really represents a safe haven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many parents agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, I'm more concerned about when he's at school,'' said  
Bob Asher of Montclair, N.J., whose 11-year-old son will go to Camp 
Interlocken in Hillsboro, N.H. ``Of all the things to worry about, 
that doesn't enter my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Gallea of New York City, who is sending his son and  
daughter to Incarnation Camp in Ivoryton, Conn., said: ``The fact 
that I get my kids out of the city for six weeks, I feel they are 
so safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camp directors say they have received more calls from parents  
who want their children excluded from riflery and other target 
sports on moral grounds than from those concerned about a shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Security concerns are also being discussed at the nation's day  
camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the wake of these kinds of incidents, if somebody brings a  
duffel bag they didn't bring before, you have to go up to Johnny 
and ask, `What is that?''' said Dave Hilliard, president of the 
Wyman Center, which runs 16 day camps for disadvantaged children in 
and around St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilliard said the organization contacted law enforcement  
officials to help review existing safety precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said the precautions shouldn't have a dramatic effect on  
the good experiences children have at camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better to overreact than underreact,'' he said. ``We  
would have our heads in the sand to think that violence cannot 
permeate the camp environment.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, his wife Tipper,  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and two dozen members of 
Congress put on their running shoes Saturday to raise money for 
breast cancer research and treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Washington Monument, they joined 65,000 other  
participants, many of whom were cancer survivors or relatives of 
cancer victims. After a brief pep rally and warm-up set to dance 
music, they blended into a sea of white T-shirts for a 5-kilometer 
run around downtown Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Race for the Cure was expected to raise $2.5 million for  
research programs, local education about breast cancer and medical 
care for poor women in the Washington area.

<HEADLINE> SLOC Targets T-Shirt Vendor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A federal judge has ordered a Park City  
retailer to stop selling bootleg Olympic T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Charging trademark infringement, the Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee and the U.S. Olympic Committee sued the Park City Shirt 
Company and got a restraining order Friday from U.S. District Court 
Judge Tena Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to beat up anybody and we didn't ask for any  
money,'' said Mark Lewis, SLOC's vice president of marketing and 
licensing. ``We just asked that they turn the product over and take 
it off the shelves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Company owner Paula Henry said he complied with the court order  
after making about 100 of the T-shirts, which carried the words 
``2002 Winter Games'' and ``Winter Olympics, Park City USA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic officials vigorously protect the ``Olympic'' trademark  
and have taken action before against unlicensed merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wasatch Brew Pub, also in Park City, ran into trouble when  
it dubbed one of its ales the ``unofficial beer of the 2002 Winter 
Games.'' Threatened with a lawsuit, the brewery-restaurant settled 
for a simple ``2002'' and the 'no' symbol -- a red circle and slash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic movement relies heavily on licensing income from  
Olympic products and legitimate vendors won't pay as much if ``they 
know they're going to be competing with counterfeit products,'' 
Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Winter Games draw nearer, Lewis said, he expected other  
entrepreneurs and ``knock-off artists'' to attempt making money on 
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we want to do is try to stop it early,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Falls Short in Push for Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- They lost when they were expected to win and won  
when no one gave them much of a chance. The Colorado Avalanche were 
unpredictable to the very end. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's up-and-down season ended Friday night with a 4-1 loss  
to the Dallas Stars in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching the Avalanche struggle to even control the puck made it  
hard to believe they had taken control of the series with a 7-5 
road win over the top-seeded Stars five days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	They also bore no resemblance to the team that erased a 2-0  
series deficit to the defending champion Detroit Red Wings in the 
conference semifinals. Those Avs had been written off before 
implausibly rallying to win four straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was the season a success? No. We didn't win the Stanley Cup,''  
captain Joe Sakic said. ``That was our goal. We just came up a 
little bit short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was hard to gauge the Avalanche from the very beginning.  
</P>
<P>
	Playing under rookie coach Bob Hartley, Colorado went winless  
for the season's first two weeks but won nine of its last 12 games 
to finish with the second-best record in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Their success earned the Avs home-ice advantage through the  
first two rounds of the playoffs, but that proved useless for a 
team that finished the season with a 10-game home unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado lost six of nine postseason home games -- the biggest  
loss coming in Game 6 of the conference finals. The Avalanche had a 
chance to eliminate Dallas but lost 4-1 to send the series back to 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference was we couldn't win our games at home,'' Sakic  
said. ``It finally bit us. To win just three home games all 
playoffs, that's embarrassing. That just shouldn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Game 6 loss will stand as the last NHL game at 24-year-old  
McNichols Arena. It also will haunt goaltender Patrick Roy as he 
tries to forget how Colorado stumbled in its bid for a second 
championship in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, Game 7 doesn't hurt as much as Game 6,'' Roy said. ``We  
were in our building. If there's something I will remember all my 
life when I get older, it's probably going to be Game 6.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barring any surprise offseason moves, the Avalanche will have  
virtually the same cast of skaters when they open the $160 million 
Pepsi Center in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest question is whether Colorado can re-sign Theo Fleury  
after acquiring him in a February trade with Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Fleury can become an unrestricted free agent on July 1,  
Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix has been noncommittal 
throughout the playoffs. Fleury scored 10 goals and had 14 assists 
in 15 games with Colorado in the regular season, but was held to 
three assists in the Dallas series. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, who made $2.4 million this season, is expected to  
receive about $6 million per year on the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even want to think about it right now,'' he said.  
``I've made it clear that Colorado is the place I would definitely 
like to play at the start of next season. It's fun to play with 
guys who want to win and who care about winning and an organization 
that cares about winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury and forward Valeri Kamensky are the only Avalanche  
players who will become unrestricted free agents. In the past year, 
Colorado has signed all-stars Peter Forsberg, Sandis Ozolinsh and 
Roy to contract extensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Several others, including defenseman Adam Foote and forward  
Shjon Podein, were signed to multi-year contracts before and during 
the season, and Sakic has one year remaining on his three-year, $21 
million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	With the NHL struggling to find ways to reward fast-skating  
teams such as Colorado, critics say the Avalanche should pattern 
themselves after Dallas, which plays a more conservative, 
defense-first style. 
</P>
<P>
	It probably won't happen. In addition to their talented veterans  
Sakic, Forsberg and Adam Deadmarsh, the Avs found additional 
scoring power from rookies Chris Drury and Milan Hejduk. 
</P>
<P>
	If Fleury returns, the offense figures to be potent again. Just  
don't try to make any predictions.

to Steffi Graf in the French Open women's final, doubles partner 
Anna Kournikova was there to console her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anna came to the locker room and hugged me and said, `You were  
better out there,''' Hingis said. 
</P>
<P>
	France's Nathalie Tauziat also helped Hingis cope a little bit  
with her loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis said she didn't really want to come back out to the court  
to accept the runner-up trophy because the crowd was booing her. 
Her mother, Melanie Molitor, convinced her to go back out. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my mother wouldn't have been there, I wouldn't have come

	 *ANKE, ANDREI AND ANDRE:* Love-struck Andrei Medvedev has made  
it no secret that happiness in his personal life has attributed to 
his success in tennis. But the player he'll meet in Sunday's men's 
final said that being in or out of love doesn't affect his play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like him that being in love makes any difference  
to me,'' said Andre Agassi, who was recently divorced from actress 
Brooke Shields. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good guy and I'm happy to hear that,'' Agassi said of  
Medvedev's romance. ``I prefer if he let his girlfriend play for 
him instead, with all due respect for her game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medvedev's girlfriend is Anke Huber, ranked 30th in the world.  
In an interview with French daily Le Parisien on Saturday, Huber 
said she wouldn't want to play for him but she does imagine herself 
in Medvedev's place when she watches him play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at his stroke, I try to see what I could do if I was on  
the court, the way I would play,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants To Help Mentally Ill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton kicked off a White House  
campaign Saturday designed to erase the stigma of mental illness. 
``In too many of our hearts,'' he said, ``mental illness is 
misunderstood and feared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president teamed with Tipper Gore in his weekly radio  
address as a prelude to Monday's first White House conference on 
mental illness. He said the session will seek ways to dispel myths 
about the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too many people with mental illness are denied the opportunity  
to fully participate in American life,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, disclosed recently  
that she underwent treatment for depression. A longtime advocate 
for the mentally ill, she played a leading role in organizing 
Monday's conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most widely believed and most damaging myths is  
that mental illness is a personal failure, not a physical 
disease,'' she said. ``Nothing could be further from the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president and Mrs. Gore also announced a new public service  
campaign designed to change attitudes about schizophrenia, 
depression and other such maladies. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore is working with Surgeon General David Satcher and the  
Ad Council to produce the campaign on mental illness, which she 
said affects one in five Americans every year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virtually every American has a friend, a neighbor or a  
colleague with a mental illness,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why, then, is mental illness met with so much misunderstanding  
and fear?'' Mrs. Gore asked. ``We have come so far in the diagnosis 
and treatment of mental illness, but our attitudes have lagged far 
behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued an executive order Friday to eliminate the  
government's stricter hiring and promotion standards for mentally 
disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our administration has worked hard to widen the circle of  
opportunity for every American,'' he said. ``That means making sure 
people living with mental illness have the same chance to live up 
to their God-given potential as all other Americans.''

<HEADLINE> BYU's Myles-Mills Wins 100M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Leonard Myles-Mills didn't pay any attention  
to the more heralded runners in the men's 100 meters at the NCAA 
Outdoor Track and Field Championships -- and made his own kind of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The BYU senior raced to victory Saturday in 9.98 seconds, making  
him the first repeat champion in the event since Auburn's Harvey 
Glance in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Glance, now the coach at Alabama, was on hand to present the  
first-place medal to Myles-Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning time was a record at Boise State's Bronco Stadium  
and tied Mills for eighth place on the all-time collegiate list. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into the race, all of the attention was focused on  
Southeastern Conference champion Coby Miller of Auburn and SEC 
runner-up John Capel of Florida. Neither came close to Myles-Mills 
as Capel was second in 10.03 and Miller sixth in 10.21. 
</P>
<P>
	After 14 of the 21 men's events, Stanford led with 50 points,  
followed by SMU with 29, Southern California with 24 and seven-time 
defending champion Arkansas with 23. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's standings, defending champion Texas led with 46  
points after 15 events. Southern California was second with 39 and 
UCLA third with 36. 
</P>
<P>
	Suziann Reid helped the Longhorns take the lead by winning the  
400 for the third time in four years in 51.09, a stadium record. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were depending on me to get 10 points,'' Reid said.  
</P>
<P>
	There was a surprise in the women's 100, as Southern California  
freshman Angela Williams, the 1998 High School Athlete of the Year, 
beat two-time defending champion Debbie Ferguson of Georgia. 
Williams bolted into the lead at the start and finished in 11.04. 
Ferguson was second in 11.10. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the greatest day of my life,'' Williams said. ``It's  
like the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the easiest victory in one of the short races was turned  
in by South Carolina's Terrence Trammell. He won the men's 110 
hurdles in 13.45, a stadium record, and two meters ahead of 
runner-up Dawane Wallace of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	In a blanket finish, Miami's Yolanda McCray won the women's 100  
hurdles in 12.85 with Georgia Tech's Andria King second in 12.87 
and UCLA's Joanna Hayes third in 12.89. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast Louisiana's Andras Haklits has to go outside the  
Southland Conference to find hammer-throw competition because the 
event is not part of the league's program. 
</P>
<P>
	Haklits found the opposition to his liking, winning with a heave  
of 243 feet, 1 inch on his final attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first three throws were bad,'' the freshman from Hungary  
said. ``Also, my fourth was very bad. My fifth was better, and on 
my last throw, I just let it go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haklits' big effort enabled him to surpass Norbert Horvath,  
another Hungarian who competes for Southern California, and 
defending champion and two-time NCAA indoor weight-throw champion 
Libor Charfreitag of Slovakia and SMU. Horvath wound up second at 
241-11 and Charfreitag was third at 239-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Connolly of Stanford, the son of 1956 Olympic hammer throw  
champion Harold Connolly, finished fourth at 236-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Hungary is known for its hammer throwers, and has three of the  
world's best. Tibor Gecsek, who coached Haklits before he came to 
the United States, is ranked No. 1. Balazs Kiss, the 1996 Olympic 
gold medalist and four-time NCAA champion for Southern California 
from 1993-96, is No. 2, and Adrian Annus is No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Haklits plans to compete for Croatia -- rather than  
Hungary -- in this year's World Championships and next year's 
Olympics. He spends a lot of time in Croatia and has dual 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Croatia hasn't got any good throwers,'' Haklits, 21, said. ``I  
am the best. In Hungary, I could never make the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haklits came to the United States last August on a scholarship.  
He chose Northeast Louisiana because he knows a member of the 
women's basketball team and her father was his physical education 
teacher in high school in Szombathely, Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here, I get everything free -- a scholarship, meals, a dorm,''  
he said. ``At home, I didn't get anything free. My parents paid for 
everything.''

<HEADLINE> Agassi To Go for Grand Slam Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Injury nearly forced Andre Agassi out of the French  
Open. Now he is just one match away from making history. 
</P>
<P>
	If he beats Andrei Medvedev in Sunday's final, Agassi will be  
only the fifth man to triumph at all four Grand Slams -- and the 
first to win them on three different surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three weeks ago, his participation at Roland Garros was in  
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi said that if the shoulder injury that kept him out of the  
World Team championship had persisted for two more days, he would 
have pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he goes into his third French Open final as favorite.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of pressure. I'd be lying if I said there  
wasn't,'' Agassi said Saturday after beating Dominik Hrbaty of 
Slovakia 6-4, 7-6 (8-6), 3-6, 6-4, in a rain-delayed semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi has won three Grand Slam events: Wimbledon in 1992; the  
U.S. Open in 1994; and the Australian Open in 1995. Fred Perry, Roy 
Emerson, Don Budge and Rod Laver, who did it twice, are the only 
men to have won all four. 
</P>
<P>
	The red clay of Roland Garros has normally been the obstacle.  
</P>
<P>
	Such greats as Boris Becker, Jimmy Connors, Stefan Edberg and  
Pete Sampras have won the other three Slams, but slipped up at the 
French. 
</P>
<P>
	No man has won Grand Slams on more than two surfaces: the U.S.  
Open was played on grass until 1974, the Australian Open until 
1988. Agassi said winning Slams on three different surfaces would 
be ``an incredible achievement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he has bad memories of Roland Garros finals, having lost  
to Andres Gomez and then Jim Courier in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1990 and 1991, I struggled with the Xs and Os. I didn't  
have the same direction in my career as I do now or the experience 
personally,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi believes that the grind required to come back from a rank  
of 140 prevented him preparing properly for the big events in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, I had different goals for myself,'' he said. ``I  
was interested in coming into the Slams feeling strong and fresh 
and ready. 
</P>
<P>
	At No. 100, Medvedev is the lowest-ranked player to reach the  
Roland Garros final in the open era. But having beaten Pete Sampras 
and tournament favorite Gustavo Kuerten, he demands respect. 
</P>
<P>
	At his best on clay, Medvedev has a powerful forehand that could  
trouble Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very respectful of the shots that he can hit,'' Agassi  
said of his opponent. ``I've watched him for a long time. He can 
play some great tennis, especially on clay. So I know my work is 
cut out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Agassi still has one of the best returns in the  
game, and has showed great character to fight back from behind 
against Arnaud Clement and defending champion Carlos Moya. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andre is inspired now, he is motivated,'' Medvedev said. ``He  
is playing well and he is fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medvedev said he is just happy to be in the final.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've surpassed my expectations by a mile. Even if I lose I  
will be the happiest man on earth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you win, that's a bonus. The pressure is finished, now it  
is time to enjoy the moment.''

<HEADLINE>  Knicks-Pacers To Settle It on Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- It's time for the Indiana Pacers and the New  
York Knicks to settle their differences on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The two clubs have exchanged angry words in the days leading up  
to tonight's Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	New York coach Jeff Van Gundy complained Thursday about the  
Pacers' play and the officiating. The Pacers responded Friday by 
saying the talk won't change anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just them being what they said we were, a bunch of  
babies, a nursery and whining,'' Mark Jackson said. ``I've been 
beat up for two games. When I missed shots, I simply said I missed 
shots. It didn't make a difference how they were playing me. I 
didn't complain. I'm not going to complain, so don't look for a 
cop-out or bail-out now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy claimed officials are keeping his point guards from  
defending Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers fired off a few shots of their own as they practiced  
Friday at Market Square Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no whining on our part. Everything is coming from  
their camp,'' said Reggie Miller, accused by Van Gundy of taking 
cheap shots at the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy also accused Rik Smits of a cheap shot and said he  
called NBA vice president Rod Thorn about the play in the opening 
two games in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller wasn't concerned.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they're going to call Rod Thorn and beg for calls, they  
need to look at themselves in the mirror. They're the ones that are 
doing all the hitting and the holding,'' Miller said. ``We're just 
trying to play basketball. ... It's too late in the season to be 
crying now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series is tied 1-1 going into tonight's game at Madison  
Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will be without center Patrick Ewing, gone for the  
rest of the season with a partially torn Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana coach Larry Bird said Van Gundy's comments were directed  
at officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's trying to work the officials, which is good. It's all  
part of the game,'' Bird said. ``We say things how we feel. 
Obviously, he's not too happy right now. ... It's up to us to just 
go there and play basketball.''

<HEADLINE>  Sabres Know About Stanley Cup Flops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Six Buffalo Sabres know the satisfaction of  
making it to the Stanley Cup finals, and all six know the 
disappointment of losing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Woolley, Joe Juneau, Stu Barnes, Rhett Warrener, Alexei  
Zhitnik and Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	Five had the embarrassment of a sweep heaped atop the  
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley, Barnes and Warrener played for the Florida Panthers  
when they were swept by Colorado three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts a lot, and I don't want to have that feeling again,''  
said Woolley, Buffalo's leading scorer in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The six Sabres understand the pressures, the distractions, the  
endless questions. Win or lose, experience counts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for us to have people who have been there before,''  
Sabres general manager Darcy Regier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres beat Toronto in five games to win the Eastern  
Conference finals and will face the Dallas Stars in the Stanley Cup 
finals beginning Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Regier acquired Barnes, Warrener and Juneau in trades this  
season. Their playoff experience was a plus. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the Toronto series, we asked Joe Juneau and Stu Barnes  
to talk to the players about what it's like and the kind of 
commitment that's needed and just kind of keep everybody's feet on 
the ground,'' Regier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau was with the Washington Capitals when they were swept by  
Detroit last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek rode the bench behind Ed Belfour when Chicago was swept by  
Pittsburgh in 1992. Zhitnik played for the Los Angeles Kings when 
they were beaten in five games by the Montreal Canadiens in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the final, I think it was eight years ago or seven, I  
don't even know,'' Hasek said. ``I don't remember too much. I was 
the backup. This year is a totally different experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes.  
</P>
<P>
	Zhitnik says all six players will build on their experience for  
the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody's angry,'' Zhitnik said.  
</P>
<P>
	Zhitnik vows not to be embarrassed.  
</P>
<P>
	``This could be my last chance,'' said Zhitnik, a native of  
Ukraine. ``I know this game is going to be shown all around the 
world. My friends are going to watch at home. I'm going to be 
hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau scored Washington's winning goal to oust the Sabres in  
Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals last season. He was happy 
when Washington traded him to Buffalo on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to have a chance at it again,'' Juneau said. ``With  
all the injuries with Washington we didn't have a chance to repeat. 
That's why I feel very lucky that Washington let me go with a team 
that had a chance to go far in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff and assistant Mike Ramsey also were  
part of a Stanley Cup sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a little easier the second time around,''  
said Ruff, an assistant with Florida in 1996. ``You know you've got 
to keep your players focused and that there's a lot of media 
attention and a lot of things going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey played for the Red Wings when they were swept by the New  
Jersey Devils in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Having failed to grab it once, Zhitnik knows what it takes to  
capture the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kill to win,'' he said. ``Do anything possible -- score, block  
the shots, play physical, even if you're not a physical player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley says there's a lot to handle both on and off the ice.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know exactly what I'm getting into, from the media exposure  
to focusing properly and handling the tickets and handling the 
family,'' he said. ``It's something that our young guys are going 
to have to pick up and learn real fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, maybe the biggest lesson to be learned from a crash  
in the Cup final is to forget it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be thinking about the past,'' Woolley said.  
``I'm not going to be thinking about the last time I was there. I'm 
just going to be going forward and trying to win this thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have to cherish this. It's a very special moment.  
And to win, how cool that would be.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Illinois Runnerup Claims Foul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The runnerup for Mrs. Illinois says the 1999  
pageant was no beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Appleby claims the wrong woman was awarded the crown, and  
with it the free trip to Hawaii, a piano, vacuum cleaner, 14-carat 
diamond necklace and luggage. 
</P>
<P>
	In her lawsuit, Appleby says pageant officials broke their own  
rules by awarding the crown to a contestant who had won the title 
seven years ago under another name. The pageant says the exception 
was valid because the winner surrendered her crown because she got 
a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Skylling-Burke, 33, a flight attendant from Palatine, was  
named Mrs. Illinois in Elgin on April 10. In 1992, she took the 
crown as Monica Skylling-Kraus. 
</P>
<P>
	Appleby, 31, a manager from Chicago, is claiming consumer fraud  
against the pageant sponsors, Marcie and Joseph Aceto of Oak Brook. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was done on the up and up,'' Joseph Aceto said.  
</P>
<P>
	As first runnerup, Appleby won a spot in a nine-week acting  
class, a vacuum cleaner, cosmetic organizer, trophy and flowers.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Makes it Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Asssociated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton made it official  
Friday: She will begin raising money to travel to New York, conduct 
polls and hire staff -- all forming the nucleus of a Senate 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to open an exploratory committee in July. And then  
I'll spend some time -- a lot of time -- in New York listening to 
people and I'm looking forward to that,'' Mrs. Clinton announced 
almost offhandedly at the end of an ABC ``Good Morning America'' 
broadcast on youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In political circles, formation of such a committee is  
tantamount to a declaration of candidacy, making Mrs. Clinton the 
nation's first first lady to seek public office for herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's running for office. She's running,'' said James  
Carville, the political mastermind of Bill Clinton's 1992 
presidential victory and an informal adviser to Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	At the helm of Mrs. Clinton's political operation, Harold Ickes  
said her decision -- not yet cemented in stone but in a state of 
``high mull'' -- is driven by a commitment to public service and a 
realization that ``in order to be effective in public service, you 
need a platform, a structure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be sort of a wandering minstrel. She herself likes  
structure,'' Ickes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of her announcement, a group called Conservatives  
for Effective Leadership alerted reporters that it was creating a 
new political action committee -- complete with direct-mail campaign 
and mass-media advertising -- to oppose any ``Hillary for Senate'' 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Has she ever introduced a piece of legislation, run a business  
or even served on her local school board? The answer is no,'' said 
radio talk show host and CEL president Gary Nolan. ``She is only a 
leader to those liberals that confuse words with action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers to the first lady, a Yale-trained lawyer who led her  
husband's efforts in Arkansas to reform the state's schools and in 
the White House to overhaul health policy, said she is prepared for 
a political brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a race that could pit her against the no-holds-barred  
Republican mayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has sugar coated how tough this will be for her,'' said  
media adviser Mandy Grunwald, a veteran of Bill Clinton's 
presidential campaign who is likely to enlist in Mrs. Clinton's 
Senate bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``She knows, she's been told and she's proceeding,'' Grunwald  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exploratory committee, which can raise money within federal  
contribution limits of $1,000 per individual and $5,000 for a 
political action committee, is meant to quiet a bubbling 
controversy over Mrs. Clinton's testing-the-waters trips through 
New York under the guise of official business on the taxpayers' 
dime. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't need to wander into that thicket,'' said Democratic  
political consultant Jim Duffy, who estimated that Mrs. Clinton 
will need to raise between $20 million and $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's got to be very careful. They need to raise money and put  
it in the bank so this conflict-of-interest thing doesn't become a 
problem,'' Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's political team plans to be prepared to begin  
collecting money almost as soon as she forms the committee. Ickes 
said her first trip on the committee's tab will come in early July. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fair to say when she establishes the exploratory  
committee she will be in position to ask people almost immediately 
for contributions,'' Ickes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Mrs. Clinton be making fund-raising calls herself?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know yet. That is still very much in flux,'' Ickes  
said. ``Typically what happens in these things is she will contact 
people and ask them for support and have somebody else come in 
behind her and actually ask for the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, the Schenectady County Democratic Committee  
became the first county organization in New York to endorse -- by 
unanimous approval of about 100 local party leaders -- the first 
lady as a Senate candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Carville, who met with Mrs. Clinton at the White House earlier  
Thursday, said he will help with her campaign, but said he would 
not have an official staff role. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exploratory committee underway, Mrs. Clinton must next  
``start thinking about a timetable, thinking about people, putting 
a staff together. There's a gazillion things you have to do,'' 
Carville said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pointing up the juggling act Mrs. Clinton will have to master,  
those gazillion things will wait until she completes a 
long-planned, two-week trip later this month through Europe and the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will slow her down a little bit,'' said Grunwald, who  
nonetheless contended it is a political plus for Mrs. Clinton to 
remind New Yorkers now of her international reputation as an 
advocate for women and children.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Jack Valenti, the Washington  
lobbyist for the top Hollywood studios, says filmmakers should do 
more to eliminate gratuitous violence from their pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should look at their creative work and say, `Is this the  
best that I can do? Is there something here that is gratuitous as I 
define it?''' Valenti said Friday during a gathering of 
screenwriters called to debate entertainment violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenti -- who has taken much heat from Congress on the issue --  
said he'll fight for the writers' First Amendment rights. But he 
said people in the movie business need to take personal 
responsibility and cut needless violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The event comes as lawmakers go on the attack against movies,  
television, music and video games following the school massacre in 
Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and Congress have taken Hollywood to task,  
suggesting the industry has contributed to a culture of violence 
through the bloody images in the product. 
</P>
<P>
	At a seminar titled ``Guns Don't Kill People ... Writers Do,''  
Brian Helgeland, writer and director of the ultraviolent Mel Gibson 
film ``Payback,'' said writers should answer only to themselves and 
not adhere to a code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't know how to respond to a code or a consensus as to  
what's responsible and what isn't acceptable. That is only for me 
to answer in my own work,'' said Helgeland, who also co-wrote 
``L.A. Confidential'' and ``Nightmare on Elm Street 4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But William Mastrosimone, who wrote the HBO movie ``The Burning  
Season'' and the CBS miniseries ``Sinatra,'' said Helgeland's 
perspective was ``very dangerous'' and ``extremist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to look to ourselves and acknowledge the effect we  
have in the world,'' said Mastrosimone, contending that studies 
clearly show a cause-and-effect relationship between entertainment 
violence and people's real-life behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	At the seminar, Callie Khouri, the Academy Award-winning writer  
of ``Thelma &AMP; Louise,'' which starred Susan Sarandon and Geena 
Davis, said the issues are more complicated than simply blaming one 
segment of society or another for youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that she was surprised when audiences applauded a  
scene in her movie in which one character shoots a man. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hoped for a stunned reaction from audiences and realization  
that the character just sealed her fate,'' Khouri said. ``I was 
terrified and I realized that I can't control how my work is 
perceived.''

<HEADLINE> Navajos Fear Drought's Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Every day, Marilyn Watchman leads her family's  
sheep herd through a canyon on the remote Navajo reservation in 
northeastern Arizona, just as generations before her did. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a tradition she fears another summer of drought could steal  
from her family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might have to sell them all,'' Watchman said of her flock.  
``But then there wouldn't be anything to live for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal officials worry the summer may bring a return to harsh  
conditions to the already unforgiving land. In 1996, when the 17 
million-acre reservation saw only an inch of rain, crops dried up 
in summertime and sick, skinny cows died on the desert floor. 
</P>
<P>
	This winter was even drier, and mountain snowpacks are at record  
lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Many who live here are ranchers like Watchman, making their  
living selling the sheep and cattle they tend. Others hold jobs in 
the reservation's small towns but maintain smaller ``hobby herds'' 
at their rural homes, providing a connection to Navajo traditions 
and beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing a disastrous summer, the Navajo government is urging  
older cattle be sold and hobby herds be removed from the land. Next 
week, Navajo Nation president Kelsey Begay plans to use radio 
addresses to ask tribal members to take voluntary safeguards to 
prevent overgazing. 
</P>
<P>
	But choosing between the land and tradition won't be easy, said  
Harry Walters, a professor of Navajo culture at Dine College in 
Tsaile, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Maintaining a hobby herd is ``not a hobby,'' Walters said.  
``It's a way of life. (Animals) don't really belong to us; they 
belong to the holy people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herds of any size provide Navajos with a vital relationship with  
the land that could vanish along with the animals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a connection Watchman feels deeply.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I ride along with my cattle, I just feel in harmony with  
the world,'' said Watchman, whose herd already has dwindled to 45 
cattle and sheep, roughly one-third of its former size. ``It's like 
a release.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More worrisome, Watchman said, are thoughts of what her family  
will do if the animals disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of us didn't go after a good education because we were  
planning on taking care of our livestock,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Sabres Know About Stanley Cup Flops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Six Buffalo Sabres know the satisfaction of  
making it to the Stanley Cup finals, and all six know the 
disappointment of losing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Woolley, Joe Juneau, Stu Barnes, Rhett Warrener, Alexei  
Zhitnik and Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	Five had the embarrassment of a sweep heaped atop the  
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley, Barnes and Warrener played for the Florida Panthers  
when they were swept by Colorado three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts a lot, and I don't want to have that feeling again,''  
said Woolley, Buffalo's leading scorer in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The six Sabres understand the pressures, the distractions, the  
endless questions. Win or lose, experience counts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for us to have people who have been there before,''  
Sabres general manager Darcy Regier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres beat Toronto in five games to win the Eastern  
Conference finals and will face the Dallas Stars in the Stanley Cup 
finals beginning Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Regier acquired Barnes, Warrener and Juneau in trades this  
season. Their playoff experience was a plus. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the Toronto series, we asked Joe Juneau and Stu Barnes  
to talk to the players about what it's like and the kind of 
commitment that's needed and just kind of keep everybody's feet on 
the ground,'' Regier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau was with the Washington Capitals when they were swept by  
Detroit last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek rode the bench behind Ed Belfour when Chicago was swept by  
Pittsburgh in 1992. Zhitnik played for the Los Angeles Kings when 
they were beaten in five games by the Montreal Canadiens in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the final, I think it was eight years ago or seven, I  
don't even know,'' Hasek said. ``I don't remember too much. I was 
the backup. This year is a totally different experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes.  
</P>
<P>
	Zhitnik says all six players will build on their experience for  
the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody's angry,'' Zhitnik said.  
</P>
<P>
	Zhitnik vows not to be embarrassed.  
</P>
<P>
	``This could be my last chance,'' said Zhitnik, a native of  
Ukraine. ``I know this game is going to be shown all around the 
world. My friends are going to watch at home. I'm going to be 
hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau scored Washington's winning goal to oust the Sabres in  
Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals last season. He was happy 
when Washington traded him to Buffalo on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to have a chance at it again,'' Juneau said. ``With  
all the injuries with Washington we didn't have a chance to repeat. 
That's why I feel very lucky that Washington let me go with a team 
that had a chance to go far in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff and assistant Mike Ramsey also were  
part of a Stanley Cup sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a little easier the second time around,''  
said Ruff, an assistant with Florida in 1996. ``You know you've got 
to keep your players focused and that there's a lot of media 
attention and a lot of things going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey played for the Red Wings when they were swept by the New  
Jersey Devils in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Having failed to grab it once, Zhitnik knows what it takes to  
capture the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kill to win,'' he said. ``Do anything possible -- score, block  
the shots, play physical, even if you're not a physical player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley says there's a lot to handle both on and off the ice.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know exactly what I'm getting into, from the media exposure  
to focusing properly and handling the tickets and handling the 
family,'' he said. ``It's something that our young guys are going 
to have to pick up and learn real fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, maybe the biggest lesson to be learned from a crash  
in the Cup final is to forget it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be thinking about the past,'' Woolley said.  
``I'm not going to be thinking about the last time I was there. I'm 
just going to be going forward and trying to win this thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have to cherish this. It's a very special moment.  
And to win, how cool that would be.''

<HEADLINE> Losing Wasn't Worst of It for Lukas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Losing was cruel enough. But fate wasn't  
finished with D. Wayne Lukas. Not yet. 
</P>
<P>
	In the span of a few hundred yards on a postcard Saturday  
afternoon, he lost both the crowning achievement of a career and 
most likely, the horse that was going to give it to him. 
</P>
<P>
	One moment, the trainer's game colt, Charismatic, was leading  
the Belmont. The next moment, he was a beaten favorite, finishing 
third. And in the moment after that, as Lukas and owner Bob Lewis 
consoled one another over coming close enough to a Triple Crown to 
wrap their arms around it, he looked back up the track to see his 
horse in distress, struggling just to stay on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at his barn minutes later, Lukas was still shaken,  
searching for the words to describe the way his emotions had been 
whipsawed. Behind him and to the right, Charismatic was resting in 
a stall, with a left leg broken in two spots. The veterinarians had 
come and gone, the colt's connections wandered around the shedrow 
in stunned silence, and Lukas and his wife fought back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we had the right horse in the right place on the right  
day,'' he said. ``We just didn't get the right situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas does not deny he had led a charmed life for nearly two  
months now, ever since the first Saturday in May, when Charismatic 
rocketed from a claiming horse to the champion of both the Kentucky 
Derby and the Preakness. And up until the chestnut reached the 
eighth pole Saturday, leading the field in a final drive for home, 
it seemed like the right situation was about to become the perfect 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for the Triple Crown, Lukas owns every honor that can be  
accorded a trainer. He has won $200 million in purses, nearly 
double what his closest pursuer has. The week before the Derby, he 
was elected to thoroughbred racing's Hall of Fame. He owns 18 
Eclipse awards. He has 13 Breeders Cup victories and wins in 12 
Triple Crown races, though not a sweep of all three in the same 
year with the same horse. 
</P>
<P>
	And so that's what this Belmont title, the Triple Crown and the  
$5 million bonus that's thrown in was going to be -- his exclamation 
point. And it was, at least until that fateful stride at the eighth 
pole, when jockey Chris Antley felt Charismatic do something he 
would later describe as ``a bobble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was almost,'' Antley said, still fighting back tears,  
``like letting out air. ... I steadied him just a bit and that 
horse'' -- that would be Lemon Drop Kid, the eventual winner -- 
``came on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Antley finished, Lewis, the colt's owner, put an arm around  
the jockey's shoulder. He told him to buck up, told him that 
getting down off the horse the second after they hit the wire 
certainly avoided compounding the seriousness of the injury and 
maybe even saved the colt's life. And they weren't the only two 
people in the barn fighting back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	A few steps away, Lukas himself was struggling to stay on an  
even keel. He had shed his suit jacket when they brought 
Charismatic over from the track in an ambulance and now it was 
impossible to read his eyes behind large-frame aviators tinted 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Only six years ago, Lukas lost a horse named Union City in the  
Preakness, setting off whispers that the horse was not sound going 
in. The beating he took in the newspapers grew louder in successive 
years as a string of his top horses ran into problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabasco Cat, Lukas' 1994 Preakness winner, was retired with a  
leg injury. Then Flanders, his champion juvenile filly, broke a 
bone and had to be retired as well. Three more of his best colts, 
1995 Preakness winner Timber Country, 1995 Derby winner Thunder 
Gulch and 1996 Derby champion Grindstone, ran into trouble and had 
to quit prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	The more people whispered that Lukas was hard on his horses the  
more it stung. And on this Saturday, when it looked like nothing 
bad could happen to him, fate had something even more cruel than 
losing in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	He stood off to one side as one of his veterinarians tried to  
answer questions about Charismatic's future. There was precious 
little comfort to be had. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do horses come back from this?'' a reporter asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh yeah,'' Dr. Stephen Selway answered, ``but not a lot of  
them.''

	Serbs Shell Northern Albanian Town  
</P>
<P>
	TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Serb forces shelled a northern Albanian  
border town crowded with refugees late Saturday, sending relief 
workers and townspeople fleeing into cellars, international 
monitors said. Eight shells exploded in Kruma, nine miles north of 
Kukes and about five miles west of the Yugoslav border, according 
to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. It 
happened hours after Yugoslav and NATO generals met on the 
Macedonian border to discuss the withdrawal of Serb soldiers and 
police from Kosovo. The state-run Tanjug news agency reported 
Saturday that Yugoslav officials might sign a withdrawal agreement 
Sunday.

	NATO-Serb Talks To Resume  
</P>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- At a Macedonian coffeehouse on the  
Kosovo border Saturday, NATO spelled out to Yugoslav generals the 
exact terms for the withdrawal of Serb troops from the province -- a 
key condition for the allied bombings to halt. The talks adjourned 
after five hours, and a NATO spokesman, Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, 
said the Yugoslav delegation asked for more time to consult 
``higher authorities'' about terms of the withdrawal. Clifford said 
the meeting would resume tomorrow morning at Kumanovo base, 20 
miles east of Blace and one of two major NATO bases in Macedonia.

	GDANSK, Poland (AP) -- Welcomed as Poland's favorite son, Pope  
John Paul II returned to his homeland today and paid tribute to the 
Baltic port city of Gdansk where the ``cry of conscience'' against 
communist rule rang out. Tens of thousands of Poles lined streets 
and highways to get a glimpse of the frail, 79-year-old pope at the 
start of his 13-day tour of the country. Amid the Polish and 
Vatican flags and paper hearts tacked on trees were the red and 
white banners of Solidarity, the trade union that rose from the 
Gdansk shipyards to challenge the communist regime.

	Crashed American Jet Dismantled  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- American Airlines crews began  
dismantling the broken and charred shell of an airliner today while 
mourners attended the first of several memorial services for the 
nine people killed in the crash of Flight 1420. Federal 
investigators hope that while moving the wreckage they will learn 
more about the mechanics of the plane's spoilers -- wing panels used 
to slow an airplane after landing. Although the co-pilot has said 
he believes the captain set the spoilers, a flight data recorder 
indicates they never popped up when the plane landed in a severe 
thunderstorm Tuesday and skidded off the end of the runway.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mel Torme, the jazz and pop singer whose warm  
vocals earned him the title ``the Velvet Fog,'' and the co-writer 
of the Christmas classic that celebrates ``chestnuts roasting on an 
open fire,'' died early today. He was 73. Torme, who had suffered 
what was described as a mild stroke in August 1996, died of 
complications from that stroke after being rushed from his Beverly 
Hills home to University of California, Los Angeles, said his 
publicist, Rob Wilcox. ``He was one of the supreme jazz singers of 
all time, with the vocal dexterity matched only by Ella 
Fitzgerald,'' said singer Jack Jones of Torme.

		   Lemon Drop Kid Wins Belmont Stakes  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lemon Drop Kid, a longshot racing for just the  
fifth time this year, came on in the stretch and won the Belmont 
Stakes on today as Charismatic finished third in a bid for the 
Triple Crown. Lemon Drop Kid, ridden by Jose Santos, took the lead 
from Charismatic with about an eighth of mile left and got to the 
end of the 1 1/2 miles ahead of another longshot, Vison and Verse. 
Shortly after the finish, Charismatic, the Kentucky Derby and 
Preakness winner, was pulled up by jockey Chris Antley. It appeared 
the strapping chestnut colt was favoring his left foreleg. Dr. 
Larry Bramlage said Charismatic suffered a fracture ``similar to 
twisting your ankle.'' Dr. Stephen Car said, ``The bone did not 
break the skin and does not appear to be life-threatening.''

Serb troops from Kosovo. The talks adjourned after five hours, and

<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- As NATO and Yugoslav generals discussed  
the terms of a withdrawal from Kosovo, more refugees straggled 
across the border into Albania today telling of brutal beatings by 
Serb police. The refugees, 86 men from two villages, crossed into 
Albania after being released from a prison where they had been held 
for four days for alleged links to Kosovo guerrillas. Bedri Selmani 
said he and many of the others were beaten with wooden staves and 
kicked by Serb police as they walked toward Albania. Some of the 
refugees were treated by medical workers for severe bruises.

	Clinton: End Mental Illness Stigma

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton kicked off a White House

too many of our hearts,'' he said, ``mental illness is 
misunderstood and feared.'' The president teamed with Tipper Gore 
in his weekly radio address as a prelude to Monday's first White 
House conference on mental illness. ``Too many people with mental 
illness are denied the opportunity to fully participate in American 
life,'' Clinton said. Mrs. Gore disclosed recently that she

	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India and Pakistan failed to agree on a  
date for peace talks today for the disputed Kashmir region, where 
ground forces were locked in combat and Indian artillery targeted 
separatist rebels. Pakistan's offer to send Foreign Minister Sartaj 
Aziz to New Delhi on Monday ``is not convenient,'' said Raminder 
Singh Jassal, an Indian foreign ministry spokesman. India would 
soon suggest alternative dates, he said. India and Pakistan have 
fought two wars over the Himalayan province. India controls 
two-thirds of Kashmir, Pakistan the rest, and both claim all of it.

say if this was her last year on the tour. Hingis served for the

rears up, shows her fangs and shoots barbed hairs from her rump. 
It's a good thing she's been a perfect patient so far. 
</P>
<P>
	The Goliath tarantula, the largest spider species in the world,  
underwent a second CAT scan Friday in hopes of saving her from a 
nasty infection oozing from her side. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving a CAT scan to a spider is not a regular event, but this  
spider is worthy of saving, say those who know her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has a robust, loose personality,'' said Sandy Barnett,  
senior herpetologist at The National Aquarium in Baltimore. ``I 
really hope we can help her out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prognosis wasn't good. Doctors are planning to perform a  
lifesaving operation next week to try to save the eight-legged 
creature. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 79011, weighing in at a hefty 2 1/2 ounces, is the size of a  
salad plate, has dark brown hair, and a turret of eyes atop a flat 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	She also has an abscess the size of a quarter that is causing  
her to lose fluid. Instead of walking on the tips of her toes like 
a ballerina, she's down at the heel -- a sure sign of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	An antibiotic ointment had no effect and another technique,  
punching a hole in her side to drain the infection, could kill her, 
said Dr. Brent Whitaker, the aquarium's director of animal health 
who is to perform the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	During surgery, the same artificial skin used in human surgery  
will be used to create a covering over the abscess. The abscess can 
then be drained and more artificial skin can be used to seal the 
drain hole, Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ian Walker, a veterinary intern at the aquarium who hopes to  
assist Whitaker, said his biggest fear is that he could break into 
the body cavity by mistake, causing her powder blue blood to leak 
out uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will probably lose the animal anyway if we don't try,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tarantula, which comes from South American rain forest, is  
worth all the effort, Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't discriminate,'' he said. ``All of our animals get  
top-notch care.''

<HEADLINE> Pa. Senator: Save Security Pension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Protecting Social Security surpluses from  
other government functions is key to the retirement program's 
future, a Republican senator said today in his party's weekly radio 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, co-chairman of the Senate  
Republican task force on Social Security, urged Democrats to 
support a GOP effort to legally separate the program's funds from 
the rest of the budget, preventing raids for other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans believe voting to preserve the Social Security  
surplus for Social Security alone is a critical first step to 
preserving Social Security's long-term future,'' Santorum said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can take this step together and begin the important work of  
putting the system on a fiscally sustainable course for the 21st 
century,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 416-12 vote last month, the House passed legislation that  
would make it harder for lawmakers to spend surpluses coming from 
Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senate version of the bill faces resistance from  
Democratic leaders. A procedural vote in April fell six votes short 
of the 60 needed to consider the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration opposes the legislation, saying it  
would hinder the government's day-to-day cash flow without actually 
doing anything to help Social Security out of a financial crisis 
looming after baby boomers retire in droves in the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum has proposed letting workers take part of the money  
they now pay in Social Security taxes and invest it in the stock 
market through a personal retirement account, although he did not 
mention this in his address. 
</P>
<P>
	Skepticism has been growing that Congress can pass a full-scale  
overhaul before the 2000 presidential election. The GOP drive to 
formally separate the Social Security surpluses is partly a 
fallback plan to counter Democrats' accusations that Republicans 
want to spend the money on tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Social Security is now collecting more money than it  
pays out, a financing shortfall is expected after baby boomers 
retire and begin to collect benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's federal budget surplus, expected to be $80 billion  
to $110 billion, will come entirely from Social Security taxes. The 
pending legislation would forbid Congress or the president from 
including that and future Social Security-generated surpluses in 
budgeting for other programs or for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum accused Clinton of raiding Social Security for $53  
billion next year and $158 billion over the next five years for 
other government programs in his fiscal 2000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``When one considers that the system is already in fiscal  
jeopardy, spending this money only aggravates the problem,'' 
Santorum said in his speech, recorded Friday in Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE>  Pantani Barred From Tour of Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADONNA DI CAMPIGLIO, Italy (AP) -- Marco Pantani was barred from  
the Tour of Italy Saturday, two stages from his second consecutive 
triumph, after tests showed unusually high levels of red blood 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The high counts can signal the use of the banned growth hormone  
EPO, but also can occur naturally. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian television quoted the team as saying dehydration and the  
high altitude of Friday's leg of the race might be responsible for 
Pantani's reading. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantani, leaving his hotel two hours after the 21st stage of the  
Giro had started without him, said he could not understand what had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry for cycling ... but there is something strange in  
this affair,'' the 29-year-old Italian said, saying a blood test 
Friday night showed no irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This morning, I had a bitter surprise,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Tg2 quoted him, off-camera, as saying he might retire.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have restarted after serious accidents ... but this time my  
morale has really hit the bottom,'' Pantani said when asked about 
the question of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	International Cycling Union doctors performed the tests on  
Pantani and other cyclists hours before the start of the 21st stage 
of the cycling marathon. The top 15 competitors in overall 
standings were reportedly tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantani's count was red blood cell count 52, Italian media said.  
The UIC maximum is 50. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Pantani was prevented from starting in the leg and  
barred from competing for 15 days, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the law. We had to stop him,'' Hein Verbruggen, head of  
the UIC, told Italy's ANSA news agency. ``It's a hard blow for 
cycling because the No. 1 has been hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All competitors had been tested before the start of the race in  
Agrigento, Sicily, last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Two unheralded cyclists, Nicola Loda and Javier Ochoa Palacios,  
were stopped by UIC doctors then because of high red blood cells 
count. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantani, one of the best world climbers, had virtually clinched  
the Tour of Italy on Friday by winning his fourth stage at this 
resort in the Dolomite mountains, extending his lead by more than 5 
1-2 minutes over the closest rival, Paolo Savoldelli. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's stage started without the pink jersey since  
Salvodelli, the new leader, refused to wear it. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the events of Saturday ``the worst thing that could  
have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Savoldelli now holds a 34-second lead over compatriot Ivan  
Gotti, the 1997 Giro winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantani had won both the Giro and the Tour of France last year --  
the latter rocked by a doping scandal that took the prestigious 
French race to the brink of suspension.

<HEADLINE> Severed Thumb Used To Find Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A murder victim helped detectives  
investigating his death by biting off a suspect's thumb during the 
confrontation that led to his killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators matched Douglas O'Neil Hannam's prints to the  
thumb found at Bowen's Auto Body after a botched armed robbery that 
resulted in the slaying last month, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police think Hannam, 26, fled to New York City and have issued a  
warrant for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 12, Hannam and two suspects who already have been  
arrested allegedly tried to rob shop owner Spurgeon Bowen, but 
Bowen fought back and bit off Hannam's thumb. One of the men in 
custody is accused of firing the fatal shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannam received medical treatment for the severed thumb at a  
Palm Beach County hospital where he told doctors he cut it off with 
a saw.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts Get Ready for Trip Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- Discovery's astronauts today packed  
up the space shuttle for their return trip home and completed one 
last task: the release of a mirrored satellite to be tracked by 
students around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle is due back at Florida's Kennedy Space Center around  
2 a.m. EDT Sunday. It would be only the 11th time in 94 flights 
that a space shuttle has returned in darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning the seven astronauts stowed gear and inspected  
Discovery's systems to ensure everything was in working order for 
landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian astronaut Julie Payette then ejected the Starshine  
satellite from the shuttle cargo bay. The 19-inch sphere, covered 
with 878 circular mirrors that were polished by schoolchildren, 
sparkled like a disco ball as it shot out of Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing we all saw was the flickering of the  
mirrors,'' Payette said. ``It was glittering, and then the ball 
just went off. It's beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of students from 18 countries will track Starshine  
over a six-month period, measuring the time it takes to orbit the 
Earth. By year's end it will plunge through the atmosphere and burn 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite deployment capped a busy 10-day mission.  
</P>
<P>
	Discovery became the first shuttle to dock with the  
international space station when the two spacecraft linked up early 
Saturday. That night, astronauts Tamara Jernigan and Daniel Barry 
conducted an eight-hour spacewalk to attach tool bags and cranes to 
the outside of the outpost. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew ventured inside the station Sunday evening to begin  
unloading 2 tons of supplies for future residents, ranging from 
water and clothes to laptop computers. The astronauts also made 
electronic repairs and installed mufflers to reduce noise from 
clattering fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery unlatched itself from the space station Thursday  
evening. NASA's next trip to the outpost is scheduled for December.

<HEADLINE> Lemon Drop Kid Wins Belmont Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charismatic left the Belmont starting gate a  
mile and a half from racing legend. He left the track in a horse 
ambulance, his racing career over. 
</P>
<P>
	Just moments after the Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner finished  
third Saturday behind Lemon Drop Kid and Vision and Verse in the 
Belmont Stakes, a pall dropped like a curtain over the huge crowd 
as Chris Antley pulled up the big chestnut colt and dismounted. 
</P>
<P>
	About an hour later, the word came that Charismatic fractured  
two bones in his left front leg -- the cannon bone and the sesamoid. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means he's through as a racehorse,'' said veterinarian  
Dr. Larry Bramlage. ``We expect him to be fine as a stallion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another veterinarian, Dr. Jim Hunt, a veterinarian for  
Charismatic trainer D. Wayne Lukas, said the horse will have 
surgery probably Sunday or Monday, but that it was not 
life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Naturally, you hate to see a horse get hurt,'' said winning  
trainer Scotty Shulhofer. ``I would have felt better if it hadn't 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the injury hadn't occurred, it appears Charismatic  
wouldn't have been able to hold off Lemon Drop Kid and Vision and 
Verse, who were a head apart at the wire, with Charismatic another 
1 1/2 lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
	Bramlage said the injury apparently occurred just past the wire.  
</P>
<P>
	It was an unfortunate ending for the former claimer who had  
caught the public's imagination in his bid to give a Triple Crown 
to Lukas and owners Bob and Beverly Lewis. The Lewises had failed 
to win the Triple Crown two years ago when the Bob Baffert-trained 
Silver Charm finished second in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're devastated at the thought that anything could be wrong  
with Charismatic,'' Bob Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	A tearful Antley, who probably saved Charismatic from more  
serious injury by his quick action, said his mount ``gave us a lot. 
He gave America a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disappointed Lukas, who has won 12 Triple Crown races and  
all three of them in one year but with different horses, said: ``I 
think we had the right horse at the right place on the right day, 
but we didn't get the right situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's racing and these things happen. We'll deal with them,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid certainly deserved his victory but it was a  
disappointing ending, since many had hoped to see Charismatic 
become the first horse to win the Triple Crown since Affirmed in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
	The race also was billed as a showdown between Charismatic and  
the Baffert-trained filly Silverbulletday. Baffert had Triple Crown 
challenges foiled when Silver Charm, also owned by the Lewises, 
finished second in 1997 and Real Quiet, owned by Mike Pegram, 
Silverbulletday's owner, was second in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Naturally, you hate to see a horse get hurt,'' said winning  
trainer Scotty Shulhofer. ``I would have felt better if it hadn't 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, making her debut against males after winning 11  
of 12 against fillies, didn't foil Charismatic's bid for glory. But 
her presence in the race likely played a big part in his defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, Charismatic chased the pace much earlier than is  
his custom, laying second behind Silverbulletday from the clubhouse 
turn until less than a half-mile remained. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid, ridden by Jose Santos, was fourth with a  
quarter-mile to go, then was taken outside for his winning charge 
down the middle of the track. He took the lead from Charismatic 
with an eighth of a mile remaining and won in 2:27.88. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt, owned by Laddie and Jeanne Vance, paid a winning  
mutuel of $61.50, third-largest in the 131-year history of the 
race. His place and show prices were $26 and $10.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid finished a head in front of Vision and Verse,  
trying to become the first non-Derby and Preakness starter to win 
the Belmont since Shulhofer did it with Colonial Affair in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Vision and Verse paid $44.40 and $17 and Charismatic was $3.60.  
Silverbulletday, ridden by Jerry Bailey, faded in the stretch and 
finished seventh in the field of 12 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the order of finish after fourth-place Best of Luck  
were Stephen Got Even, Patience Game, Silverbulletday, Menifee, 
Pineaff, Prime Directive, Teletable and Adonis. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic's pace surprised Bailey.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to go head and head that far, but I could see  
Antley's horse was kind of rank. I looked over and he was trying to 
get him back, but he couldn't get him back,'' Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second victory in five starts for Lemon Drop Kid, the  
grandson of Seattle Slew, the 1977 Triple Crown winner. Lemon Drop 
Kid had finished ninth in the May 1 Kentucky Derby, then skipped 
the Preakness two weeks later and prepped for the Belmont with a 
third in the Peter Pan on May 23 at Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic was the 8-5 favorite ahead of Menifee (5-2) and  
Silverbulletday (5-1). 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd roared in anticipation of a stretch battle between the  
filly and Charismatic, but Silverbulletday faded and Lemon Drop Kid 
and Vison and Verse stole Charismatic's thunder. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic had gone from racing for a $62,500 claiming tag on  
Feb. 11 to the brink of racing history, but Lemon Drop Kid stole 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning mutuel payoff was the highest since 1980, when  
Temperance Hill beat the filly Genuine Risk and paid $108.80. In 
fact, the payoff was the third-highest in Belmont history. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Directive broke on top but when the field entered the  
clubhouse turn, it was Charismatic surprisingly in the lead, 
followed by Patience Game and Menifee. They held that order 
entering the backstretch with a mile to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Then halfway down the backstretch, Jerry Bailey sent the filly  
ahead of Charismatic as the crowd roared. At this point, Stephen 
Got Even was third and Prime Directive fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday led Charismatic past the half-mile pole and into  
the turn, with Vision and Verse third and Stephen Got Even fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic was back in front of the filly by the quarter pole  
and then the charge for victory started. Lemon Drop Kid came out on 
top, as the Triple Crown drought now goes into a 22nd year.

	NATO, Yugoslav Commanders Meet  
</P>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- NATO and Yugoslav generals met for five  
hours in a coffeehouse on the Macedonia-Yugoslavia border today to 
work out exact terms of a Serb troop withdrawal from Kosovo -- a key 
condition for the allied bombings of Yugoslavia to halt. Alliance 
jets, meanwhile, struck in Belgrade, Kosovo's capital of Pristina 
and at military targets just 12 miles from the talks even as 
British commander Michael Jackson was joined at the Europe cafe by 
a delegation of Yugoslav generals. After the Serbs headed back by 
car to Yugoslav territory, a NATO spokesman said they needed to 
confer with Yugoslav authorities on ``a few points of detail'' in 
the withdrawal plan.

	Clinton: End Mental Illness Stigma  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton kicked off a White House  
campaign today designed to erase the stigma of mental illness. ``In 
too many of our hearts,'' he said, ``mental illness is 
misunderstood and feared.'' The president teamed with Tipper Gore 
in his weekly radio address as a prelude to Monday's first White 
House conference on mental illness. He said the session will seek 
ways to dispel myths about the mentally ill. ``Too many people with 
mental illness are denied the opportunity to fully participate in 
American life,'' Clinton said. Mrs. Gore disclosed recently that 
she underwent treatment for depression.

	New S. Africa Leader Mulls Cabinet  
</P>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- As President-elect Thabo Mbeki  
pondered his Cabinet choices today, reports emerged that more than 
a quarter-million people not on voter lists cast ballots in last 
week's elections. With Mbeki's African National Congress on the 
verge of winning a two-thirds majority -- which would allow it to

	Pope Returns to Poland  
</P>
<P>
	GDANSK, Poland (AP) -- Welcomed as Poland's favorite son, Pope  
John Paul II returned to his homeland today and paid tribute to the 
Baltic port city of Gdansk where the ``cry of conscience'' against 
communist rule rang out. Tens of thousands of Poles lined streets 
and highways to get a glimpse of the frail, 79-year-old pope at the 
start of his 13-day tour. John Paul's first visit to Poland as pope 
20 years ago helped spark the creation of Solidarity, the first 
free labor union in the Soviet bloc. Formed a year after the visit, 
Solidarity spread into a nationwide movement that toppled communism 
in 1989.

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Steffi Graf won her sixth French Open title and her  
first Grand Slam championship in almost three years today with a 
come-from-behind victory over top-ranked Martina Hingis. Graf, 
cheered on by the fans at Roland Garros, fought back to beat Hingis 
4-6, 7-5, 6-2 in a turbulent match on a cloudy day in Paris. Hingis 
served for the match at 5-4 in the second set but could not hang 
on. Hingis, who lost her second French Open final in three year, 
received a warning and was penalized a point for several outbursts, 
and was frequently booed by the center court fans.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Detroit Pistons star and Toronto

candidate for the Washington Wizards head coaching position. 
Thomas, now a commentator on NBC's NBA broadcasts, has been 
involved in talks with Wizards owner Abe Pollin about the opening, 
according to today's edition of the Washington Post. The 
38-year-old led the Pistons to NBA championships in 1989 and 1990. 
He was GM of the Raptors from 1994-97.

<HEADLINE> Rivers Is Frontrunner for Magic Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The Orlando Magic officially remained  
without a coach Saturday, although the search to fill the vacancy 
appeared to be over. 
</P>
<P>
	Doc Rivers, who played 13 NBA seasons before retiring three  
years ago, has been the leading candidate to succeed Chuck Daly for 
two weeks and reportedly is ready to sign a four-year guaranteed 
contract worth about $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages left by The Associated Press at Rivers' home  
in San Antonio were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Magic officials also did not return calls, although club  
spokesman Joel Glass said Friday night that an announcement was not 
expected over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando Sentinel reported that Rivers, 37, would become the  
league's second-youngest coach behind New York's Jeff Van Gundy on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic brought Rivers to town for an interview last Wednesday  
and he remained for a second day of talks that clearly established 
him as the frontrunner for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Orlando player and current Phoenix Suns assistant Scott  
Skiles interviewed the day before Rivers. The team has not 
scheduled talks with any other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers, who has been working as a television analyst for Turner  
Sports, has said he was impressed with the Magic front office as 
well as the commitment to win in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly retired May 24 with one year left on a contract worth $5  
million per season, leaving behind a team that overachieved during 
the regular season only to lose to Philadelphia in the first round 
of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Rivers has no prior coaching experience, he played much  
of his career for Mike Fratello in Atlanta and Pat Riley in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sentinel said three former NBA coaches -- Dave Wohl, Jim  
Cleamons and Johnny Davis -- are under consideration to be Rivers' 
top assistant. As many as two of Daly's assistants, including 
Brendan Suhr, could be retained as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic reportedly have been interested in Rivers ever since  
he retired as a player in 1996 and targeted him as Daly's successor 
several days before the Hall of Fame coach announced his 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, 68, left broadcasting to re-enter coaching in 1997 but had  
an option after the second season of his three-year deal to 
continue coaching for $5 million, accept a consultant's position at 
$200,000 or leave for another team. 
</P>
<P>
	The new coach is expected to join general manager John Gabriel  
and the rest of the Orlando staff in Chicago for the start of the 
NBA pre-draft camp on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Breaks Two Bones in Leg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The career-ending injury sustained by  
Charismatic in the Belmont Stakes involves fractures to two bones 
in his lower left foreleg, similar to an ankle injury a human 
athlete might suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic sustained a condylar fracture in the cannon (shin)  
bone, which is a fracture of the knobby end of the bone. He also 
suffered a vertical fracture in his lateral sesamoid, one of two 
small bones located above and at the back of the fetlock (ankle), 
according to Dr. Jim Hunt, veterinarian for trainer D. Wayne Lukas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a complete fracture, the bone is broken to the outside,''  
said Hunt. ``There's actually a piece of bone that is loose. He's 
also sustained a vertical fracture in his lateral sesamoid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can fix the condylar fracture with no problem. The lateral  
sesamoid is a little bit trickier, it simply has to heal with 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Stephen Selway, another Lukas veterinarian, said the surgery  
will take place Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt's lower leg was placed in a cast and he was returned to  
his stall in the barn at Belmont Park, where Lukas said he was 
resting comfortably. Surgery at the equine hospital next to Belmont 
Park will insert screws to hold the fragments of bone together. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cast he's wearing now is more of a traditional cast, it's  
very tight and snug now. They think the sesamoid will heal on 
itself. All of the tendons look real good,'' Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
	He speculated the injuries might have occurred at different  
points of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may have happened in different strides because there are  
two fractures,'' Lukas said. ``Usually when there's multiple 
fractures they don't happen at the same time, they happen 
sequentially. He does seem pretty comfortable now.''

<HEADLINE> Mead Johnson Recalls Infant Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- Mead Johnson Nutritionals is recalling  
7,000 cases of infant formula after a labeling error resulted in at 
least one can of an adult nutritional supplement being mislabeled 
as the formula. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said the 8-ounce can labeled as ProSobee  
infant formula actually contained the nutritional supplement 
Vanilla Sustacal. 
</P>
<P>
	Infants fed Sustacal who are ill, at risk of dehydration or  
highly sensitive to milk protein could face severe medical 
problems, Mead Johnson said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	No cases of illness have been reported to Mead Johnson due to  
the labeling error. The company ordered the recall due to the 
possibility that other cans in the 7,000-case batch may have been 
mislabeled. 
</P>
<P>
	The containers of ProSobee are sold in 4-pack fiberboard  
cartons. The batch being recalled is coded 1NOV99/PROSOB/AKN13 and 
was shipped to stores late last year. The batch in question 
contained about 120,000 cans. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers with questions about the recall can call the Mead  
Johnson Customer Resource Center at 1-888-587-7275.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Plans Visit to Arkansas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani plans an unlikely pit  
stop next month to raise funds for his U.S. Senate campaign: 
Arkansas, the home turf of his possible opponent, First Lady 
Hillary Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's foray into Little Rock, Ark., will turn the tables  
on Mrs. Clinton, who has made 10 visits to New York this year amid 
endless rumors of her candidacy for the seat being vacated next 
year by U.S. Sen. Daniel Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas Republicans predict the visit could be lucrative for  
Giuliani, who has set up an exploratory committee as he considers a 
Senate race. ``There are some people here who would give money to 
anyone who ran against Hillary Clinton,'' said Chris Carnahan, 
director of the Arkansas GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	An exact date for Giuliani's visit was not set. Giuliani, a  
native New Yorker, has raised Mrs. Clinton's status as an 
out-of-towner on his campaign's Web site, ``HillaryNo.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton announced this week that she was opening an  
exploratory committee in July. While Mrs. Clinton has not said 
whether she will seek election, an assortment of Democratic 
officials have said she will run next year.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Williams Might See Time  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Herb Williams, the oldest player in the NBA,  
might see something other than garbage time in Game 3 of the 
Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Williams could be called into service if the  
Knicks' big men get into foul trouble tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be able to play a normal rotation,' coach Jeff Van  
Gundy said Friday. ``Whether that happens or not, you've got to be 
prepared for everything. I don't want Herb to have to play 25 
minutes because of foul trouble early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who spent the first 7 1/2 years of his career with  
Indiana and is the franchise's 10th-leading career scorer, is the 
Knicks' only true backup center now that Patrick Ewing is hurt and 
Chris Dudley is moving into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Still a popular player in Indianapolis, Williams nonetheless  
says he has no lingering affection for the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Me and some of their players get along real well, but we're  
trying to get a championship here,'' Williams said. ``It's not 
about being fond of the team. I'm fond of the Knicks, that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 3 of the series, tied 1-1, tips off about 6:40 p.m. EDT.  
Game 4 is Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know they've been a much better road team in the playoffs  
than they have at home. They were up 30-27 (after one quarter) at 
Milwaukee, 28-22 at Philly and 31-17 at Philly, and we have to be 
ready. No one plays better on the road,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	After wavering Thursday, Van Gundy on Friday announced his  
decision to go with Dudley. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, this is the simplest,'' Van Gundy said. ``You can get  
guys in as early as you want, you can change early if that's what 
you need to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley started 16 games during the regular season, four  
alongside Ewing and 12 when Ewing was out with Achilles' 
tendinitis. In the 12 games without Ewing, the Knicks went 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Patrick's been out in the past, that's how we've been,''  
Van Gundy said. ``We've had some good wins, some tough losses. 
We'll start the same, and everyone will stay in their same 
pattern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means Latrell Sprewell, the team's leading scorer, will  
continue to play as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks used their third straight day of rest to go over what  
they need to do now that they don't have Ewing. Doctors discovered 
a slight tear in Ewing's Achilles' tendon on Wednesday and declared 
him out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston, Sprewell, Larry Johnson and the two point guards,  
Charlie Ward and Chris Childs, will need to contribute more 
offensively. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like Patrick was averaging 20 shots a game,'' Houston  
said. ``We had a lot of balance before Patrick went out, so it's 
going to change, but it's not going to change to the point where 
certain people are going to take 10 or 20 more shots per game and 
overextend themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight's game will only be the third for Indiana in two weeks  
since it completed a sweep of Philadelphia in the semifinals May 
23. For the Knicks, it will be their third in 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's been great for us,'' coach Larry Bird said of the  
extensive practice time his team has had. ``We got a lot of things 
accomplished. We put in some new stuff on the offensive end. We've 
had time to prepare, and that should help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks are expecting to see improved offensive production  
from Rik Smits now that his chances of getting into foul trouble 
while guarding Ewing have been reduced. Van Gundy would not say 
whether Dudley would start with the defensive assignment on Smits, 
or whether he will continue handing that task to Kurt Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy also warned that the Knicks cannot overlook Dale and  
Antonio Davis, both of whom have hurt the Knicks offensively. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you go into the game trying to avoid foul trouble, you  
can't be effective. We've got to be aggressive, tenacious and 
passionate, but we also have to be smart,'' Van Gundy said.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules Against AT&AMP;T </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A federal judge dealt a blow to AT&AMP;T Corp.  
on Friday, ruling that the telecommunications company must allow 
rival Internet companies in the Portland area access to its 
high-speed cable lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The case could set a nationwide precedent, allowing other local  
authorities to require similar conditions. AT&AMP;T plans to appeal the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T brought the lawsuit in January after months of haggling  
about open Internet access with the city of Portland, Multnomah 
County and eight local cable regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very straightforward matter,'' said City Commissioner  
Erik Sten. ``We want people to have choice. We're the only city 
that held firm and kept the requirement in place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case stems from AT&AMP;T's recent $48 billion acquisition of  
Tele-Communications Inc. Before AT&AMP;T could take over TCI's network 
of high-speed, broadband cables, the company needed to obtain 
approval from thousands of local regulators across the country who 
determine cable franchise rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of communities have approved those transfers, but  
Portland area cable officials said they would only approve the 
transfer if AT&AMP;T guaranteed that competing Internet-service 
providers had access to the lines as well. Anything less would 
stifle competition, local officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T balked and took them to court.  
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Owen Panner ruled that the  
``open access'' condition was within the rights of the local 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Local franchising authorities have the power to determine  
whether a change of ownership or control would 'eliminate or reduce 
competition,' '' Panner wrote. ``It is not my role to second-guess 
the findings supporting the decision to impose open access.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Rosenblum, vice president for legal affairs and federal  
regulation for AT&AMP;T, said AT&AMP;T's merger does not restrict access to 
the Internet because most people log on through regular phone 
lines, not the broadband cable under consideration. Among the 
high-speed phone lines, wireless connections and satellite links, 
there is more than enough competition for Internet access, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenblum noted that only about 100,000 people nationwide  
currently gain access to the Internet through broadband cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cities, such as Los Angeles, Denver and Dallas, are still  
grappling with the issue of whether to renew AT&AMP;T's franchise 
rights in their areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington, D.C.-based OpenNet Coalition, a group of more  
than 70 Internet service providers, hailed the ruling, calling a 
victory for the right of local communities to require competition 
in the Internet marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Thurburn, chairman of FlashNet Communications, a member of  
OpenNet, hoped Friday's decision will inspire them to regulate 
high-speed cable hookups as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city of Portland has been very brave in taking on AT&AMP;T in  
the battle,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of America Online, also one of the coalition's members,  
rose $12 to $117.75 on the New York Stock Exchange on news of the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, AT&AMP;T slipped 87 1/2 cents to $53.37 1/2, while At Home  
Corp., which has access to AT&AMP;T's cable properties, dropped $10.75 
to $94.50, also on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Loses and Breaks Ankle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charismatic tried so hard to become the first  
Triple Crown winner in 21 years that he broke an ankle doing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave us a lot, he gave America a lot,'' jockey Chris Antley  
said after the colt pulled up just past the finish line, third to 
longshot Lemon Drop Kid in a race where winning was the only thing. 
</P>
<P>
	He was taken off the track in a van and returned to trainer D.  
Wayne Lukas' barn. Dr. Neal Cleary, the New York Racing 
Association's chief examining veterinarian, said the injury was a 
lateral fracture of the left front leg. He said Charismatic was 
comfortable ``and he appears to be a surgery candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NYRA said the injury was not life-threatening but ended his  
racing career. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means he's through as a race horse,'' Dr. Larry Bramlage  
said. ``We expect him to be fine as a stallion. That means it's the 
end of his career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bramlage said the injury probably occurred ``soon after the  
wire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic's loss and injury may have been the result of just  
what Lukas feared -- the entry of Silverbulletday, the super filly. 
She couldn't stay the 1 1/2 miles, but she exhausted Charismatic 
trying to catch her. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, where Charismatic was  
able to stay out of traffic and make late runs to victory, he went 
right after Silverbulletday. She is trained by Bob Baffert, who won 
the first two Triple Crown races the past two years only to lose 
the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	The filly took the lead at the top of the backstretch, still a  
mile from the finish, with Charismatic right behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Through a 47.3 second half-mile and a mile in 1:36 2/5, he  
stalked her, using the effort he had saved in the first two Triple 
Crown races. He took the lead briefly at the turn, but the effort 
was too much -- Charismatic held gamely, but Lemon Drop Kid and 
Vision and Verse flew by him on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe Charismatic ran away with her,'' said Jerry  
Bailey, who was riding the filly. ``It wasn't a killer pace but you 
just hate to go eyeball to eyeball early in the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	'' When they hooked up, they were moving right along,'' said  
Scotty Schulhofer, the trainer of Lemon Drop Kid, ridden by Jose 
Santos. ``Jose had him perfectly positioned and was able to take 
advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the winner became a second thought with Charismatic standing  
on the track, surrounded by veterinarians and track employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our feelings are pretty low,'' said Bob Lewis, who with his  
wife, Beverly, owns the colt. ``Our only concern right now is 
Charismatic. We hope to God he is going to be fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We accepted the accolades in Louisville and Baltimore and  
today was just one of those things that happens. What happened 
today is history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winners' jubilation was dampened by news of the injury.  
</P>
<P>
	``My heart really goes out to him,'' said Jeanne Vance, the  
colt's owner. ``I didn't realize he was injured. It's one of the 
sad things about our business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Schulhofer: ``I would feel much better if it hadn't  
happened.''

<HEADLINE> 'Binks' Actor Thrilled by Part </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ahmed Best, the man behind the mask of the new  
``Star Wars'' character Jar Jar Binks, feels like he came to the 
scene-stealing role from a galaxy far, far away. 
</P>
<P>
	Before ``Star Wars, Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' Best's  
only film experience was working as an extra in ``Lean On Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept waiting every day for somebody to say, `Excuse me,  
you're not supposed to be here,''' Best says in the June 24 issue 
of Rolling Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	Director George Lucas discovered Best while the  
singer-dancer-drummer was working in the San Francisco production 
of the dance musical ``Stomp.'' Lucas couldn't have been happier 
with his choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the first time I could get an alien to turn in a really  
great performance,'' Lucas said of Best, who acted out the scenes 
during filming in costume, but whose image was digitally created 
and inserted during special effects work later.

<HEADLINE> Mich. St. Stars Plead Not Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan State University basketball stars  
Mateen Cleaves and Antonio Smith pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor 
charges of larceny. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair were formally charged Friday in connection with  
stealing a 40-ounce bottle of beer from an East Lansing 7-Eleven. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've waived arraignment and the next step is the pre-trial,''  
their attorney, Brian Jeffries, told the Lansing State Journal 
after submitting their waiver forms Friday morning in East Lansing 
District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The players did not appear in court.  
</P>
<P>
	The arrest warrants were issued Wednesday -- seven weeks after  
police pulled over the two players who led the Spartans to the 
Final Four in the NCAA Tournament this year, Michigan State 
University's first trip since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Their vehicle matched the description of one reportedly involved  
in a store theft about 2 a.m. on April 14. Smith was arrested on 
two traffic warrants that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingham County Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III said it took seven  
weeks to issue the other warrants because police needed time to 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves, a 21-year-old two-time All-American, and Smith, 23,  
face misdemeanor charges of larceny of property worth less than 
$200. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, accused of breaking open the 7-Eleven's cooler door lock,  
also faces a charge of malicious destruction of property. If 
convicted, the pair face up to 93 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Wednesday, Michigan State basketball  
coach Tom Izzo said he hadn't seen the complaint or the police 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my understanding that the matter will be dealt with in  
the courts and after the judicial process runs its course, I'll 
take appropriate action,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants in certain misdemeanor cases are allowed to file  
arraignment waivers and not appear in person, as long as their 
rights are communicated to them through their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	A date has not been set for the pre-trial conference.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves chose to stay at Michigan State University for his  
senior year next fall, passing up an opportunity last month to 
declare for the NBA Draft. Smith, the Spartans No. 3 career 
rebounder, completed his eligibility in March and some draft 
analysts project him as a possible second-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players are from Flint, Mich. and were captains during the  
1998-99 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Michigan State player, Jason Klein, was in the car with  
Smith and Cleaves when police pulled it over. No warrant has been 
issued for his arrest. Also in the vehicle was a female who was 
ticketed for underage drinking.

<HEADLINE> Eight Nabbed in Fake Microsoft Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eight people have been arrested in a  
counterfeiting scheme that authorities said churned out 15,000 
phony copies of Microsoft computer programs every month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern California residents were arrested Thursday, a day  
after being indicted on 45 counts of counterfeiting, conspiracy and 
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	All are expected to enter pleas Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Five other people also were named in the federal grand jury  
indictment, including three who were arrested in February and freed 
on bond, the U.S. attorney's office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ring pressed counterfeit CD-ROM disks of Windows 98 and  
other popular programs, printed bogus ``certificates of 
authenticity'' and then packaged and sold the disks overseas, 
authorities contend. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in February raided several warehouses and seized a  
room-sized CD-ROM replicator. Also seized were color printing 
presses, packaging machines and other counterfeit items that 
Microsoft officials estimated were worth about $56 million on the 
retail market.

<HEADLINE> One American in Impressionists Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mary Cassatt was the lone American among the  
French Impressionists -- a largely male, Parisian bunch -- and the 
most important work she did in the United States disappeared nearly 
a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But her art has grown in popularity in recent years, with one  
painting selling for more than $4 million in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Sunday, a major show at the National Gallery of Art  
will feature 55 of her paintings and drawings. All that remains of 
her major U.S. project, though, are small black and white photos of 
the 14-by-58-foot mural painted for Chicago's Columbian Exposition 
of 1893. 
</P>
<P>
	Known chiefly as a painter of mothers and children, Cassatt was  
not sentimental about them. She campaigned for women's suffrage and 
said the idea for a national Mother's Day holiday was absurd. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassatt had been born to a wealthy Pittsburgh family but  
determined to earn her own way as an artist in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	She liked the proposal for the Chicago mural on ``Modern  
Woman,'' writing that the order for it came from a ``determination 
that women should be someone and not something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The prospect of contributing a major mural on the subject of  
women, to a building designed and decorated by women, and devoted 
to work by women at a venue sure to be seen by hundreds of 
thousands proved irresistible,'' wrote Judith A. Barter, curator of 
American Arts at the Art Institute of Chicago, in the catalog for 
the current show. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Impressionists discouraged her from taking on the job. She  
wrote that the idea enraged the painter Edgar Degas -- a longtime 
friend with whom some writers have seen a romantic attachment. 
Degas considered murals a kind of decoration and thought paintings 
should not be used for that. 
</P>
<P>
	American critics ridiculed the finished work. Cassatt believed  
that was because a woman had painted it. No one seems to know what 
happened to it after the exhibition closed. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she preferred to stay in France because women did not  
have to fight for recognition there if they did serious work. But a 
few years later she had a successful commercial show of her 
pictures in New York. Her work has grown in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996 her painting ``In the Box'' set a record of $4,072,500  
for one of her works in an auction at Christie's in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassatt covered a range of subjects -- theater scenes; women  
taking tea, reading newspapers, at washstands; even a couple of 
flirtatious Spanish bullfighters and a few prints of nudes. 
</P>
<P>
	She rarely painted men, but the show includes two portraits of  
her brother Alexander, who became president of the Pennsylvania 
Railroad. She also advised him on collecting the work of her 
friends the Impressionists. She died in France in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander Cassatt was instrumental in shutting down Washington's  
Pennsylvania Station, which occupied the space on the Mall where 
the National Gallery now stands. The present Union Station replaced 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Mary Cassatt'' will close Sept. 6. Admission is free.

<HEADLINE> Roberts Not Recognized at Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Recreating a scene from ``Notting Hill,'' Julia  
Roberts sat down to dinner with a group of friends who had no idea 
a famous Hollywood star was joining them. Things got weird though 
when one guest didn't recognize her. 
</P>
<P>
	Set up by Marie Clare magazine for an article in its July issue,  
the dinner party mirrored one in the movie that features Roberts as 
a movie star dating a London bookstore owner, except for the woman 
who had no idea who the guest of honor was. 
</P>
<P>
	``And what do you do for a living,'' she asked Roberts.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an actress,'' Roberts replied.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anything I might have seen?'' the woman went on.  
</P>
<P>
	``How about `Pretty Woman?''' Roberts answered.  
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly it dawned on the questioner who she was talking to.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's not very good with faces,'' the woman's fiance said to  
Roberts. ``Please don't take it personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts didn't.  
</P>
<P>
	``Why is it so weird that somebody didn't recognize me?''  
Roberts said later. ``The fact is that whenever I meet somebody, I 
say, `Nice to meet you. I'm Julia.''

<HEADLINE>  Astros Owner Accused Derogatory Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros owner Drayton McLane went to a  
banquet to accept an award and ended up in the middle of a 
controversy with the Hispanic community. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Camacho, vice president and general manager of KTMD-TV,  
and Rod Rodriguez, the station's sales manager, accused McLane on 
Friday of saying Hispanics couldn't understand the game of 
baseball, bought only cheap seats and didn't eat the Astrodome 
food. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked him why he doesn't market toward Hispanics,'' Camacho  
said. ``He said it was hard to reach Hispanics because the game of 
baseball is strategy and skill and it's complicated, and that's why 
more Hispanics don't go to Astros games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said if you gave them a basketball and told them to put the  
ball through the hoop, they can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho said McLane made the comments to a small group at a  
cocktail party Thursday night prior to a banquet hosted by the 
Houston Advertising Foundation, which presented McLane with the 
Trailblazer Award for community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The station later reported McLane's comments.  
</P>
<P>
	McLane angrily denied all the charges in a statement. Then he  
cut short a South Texas vacation and returned to Houston to meet 
with reporters and further deny that he ever made any insensitive 
comments about Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	McLane told a different story about the conversation.  
</P>
<P>
	``They asked if there was one thing you could do for Hispanics,  
what would it be?'' McLane said. ``What I said was that the Astros 
feel we want to get them more enthused and more involved with the 
Houston Astros. Our research shows that only 8 percent of the fans 
that come to the games are Hispanics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho said McLane said baseball is a game of statistics and  
numbers ``and people like to follow baseball in the newspapers and 
Hispanics don't read newspapers, and when Hispanics do go, they buy 
the cheap $2 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``My statement was, in general terms, that of all major league  
sports, the most complicated is baseball,'' McLane said. ``I say 
that to all types of groups ... You can take a basketball and get 
anyone to understand that game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho attended the hastily called news conference Friday and  
defended his station's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have witnesses who heard what he said,'' Camacho said. ``We  
are telling the truth. It's not a he said-she said. It's he 
said-they said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig defended McLane, calling him  
``honorable'' and ``sensitive.'' Selig dismissed the remarks by the 
TV executives as ``slander'' and said McLane has the ``full support 
of everyone in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLane said he talked to six to eight people at a reception  
before the dinner, but denied saying anything insensitive toward 
Hispanics, who represent 22 percent of the eight-county Houston 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never a disparaging remark pertaining to the cheap  
seats,'' McLane said. ``That was never said. The food was never 
discussed. That just wasn't a part of the conversation that we 
had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez said he heard the same comments as Camacho.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said Hispanics don't read the newspapers,'' Rodriguez said.  
``I looked at my general manager (Camacho) to see if he's really 
saying that. I told him I read newspapers. We grew up on baseball. 
It was our livelihood. Hispanics love the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLane said he'd been in business 42 years and had never had  
such an accusation, noting his companies have 11,000 employees of 
all races.

	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- NATO and Yugoslav generals met for five  
hours in a coffeehouse on the Macedonia-Yugoslavia border today to 
work out terms of a Serb troop withdrawal from Kosovo, the key to 
ending NATO's fierce bombing campaign. The two sides began meeting 
after a three-hour delay. About five hours later, the Serb 
delegation headed by car back to Yugoslav territory. A NATO 
spokesman, Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, said the Serbs needed to confer 
with Belgrade on ``a few points of detail'' in the text of the 
withdrawal plan and are expected to return later in the day.

	PARIS (AP) -- Steffi Graf won her sixth French Open title and the  
adoration of Roland Garros fans when she fought back to beat 
top-ranked Martina Hingis 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 in a turbulent final today. 
Hingis, who lost her second French Open final in the last three 
tournaments, received a warning and was penalized a point for 
several outbursts and was frequently booed by the center court 
fans. Graf captured the 22nd Grand Slam title of her career less 
than two weeks before her 30th birthday against the 18-year-old 
Swiss who dislodged Graf from the No. 1 ranking in March 1997.

his vice president, to announce a new public service campaign 
designed to change attitudes about schizophrenia, depression and 
other such maladies. ``The hard truth is, in too many of our 
communities, and in too many of our hearts, mental illness is 
misunderstood and feared,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio

Senate Republican task force on Social Security, urged Democrats to 
support a GOP effort to legally separate the program's funds from 
the rest of the budget, preventing raids for other programs. The 
Clinton administration opposes the legislation, saying it would

because it tolerates homosexuals, the bank said today. As many as 
500 accounts have been closed at the bank since March, apparently

hours of talks today without any sign of progress to end a sickout 
that has forced the carrier to cancel half its flights. After the 
discussions, Hong Kong's assistant commissioner of labor, Tsang 
Kin-woo, said there was an agreement to continue the meetings. The 
airline canceled 63 of its 119 scheduled flights today. Cathay is 
demanding that the pilots take pay cuts averaging 7 percent over

Naoyuki Tsuda, survived the attack in his office in Osaka, and is 
not in critical condition, police said. Although the white flag 
with a red circle and the song for the emperor are widely used in 
school ceremonies, they are not officially recognized and remain 
controversial because they evoke bitter memories of Japan's

<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Cathay Pacific Airways and its pilots held five  
hours of talks Saturday without any sign of progress to end a 
sickout that has forced the carrier to cancel half its flights. 
</P>
<P>
	After the discussions, Hong Kong's assistant commissioner of  
labor, Tsang Kin-woo, said there was an agreement to continue the 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay and the pilots had no immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The airline canceled 63 of its 119 scheduled flights Saturday --  
the largest number yet since pilots began calling in sick en masse 
on May 28. 
</P>
<P>
	But the carrier began accepting new bookings for flights from  
Hong Kong to Bangkok, Manila, Taipei, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. 
Cathay halted bookings earlier in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay is demanding that the pilots take pay cuts averaging 7  
percent over two years in exchange for stock options and has given 
them until June 11 to either take the deal, quit or be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting Thursday with Hong Kong labor leaders, Cathay  
bosses agreed to the Saturday meeting with the pilots union for the 
first time since the sickout began. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is that I am pleased that we'll be talking. No  
progress will be made unless we're talking and now we're talking,'' 
said John Findlay, general secretary of the Hong Kong Aircrew 
Officers Association, before the talks started. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay posted a net loss of $69 million last year, running up  
its first red ink since 1963 as passenger traffic plunged amid 
Asia's economic crisis and Hong Kong's deep recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots say that if any union member is fired in the dispute,  
they will take a strike vote.

	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Oscar de la Hoya wants double the  
proposed $15 million purse to get into the ring with Felix 
Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Sunday's El Mundo newspaper, de la Hoya won't agree  
to fight Trinidad in a welterweight reunification fight for the $15 
million that he has been offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oscar not only has not signed the contract but also will not  
accept the offered purse of $15 million to fight Trinidad,'' the 
newspaper quoted Roberto Alcazar, de la Hoya's trainer, in a 
telephone interview from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcazar said de la Hoya, the WBC champion, was discussing  
getting double that amount with his promoter, Bob Arum. 
</P>
<P>
	The $15 million figure came from Arum, who is arranging the  
Sept. 18 bout in Las Vegas. De la Hoya was paid $5 million for his 
last bout, when he defended his title against Oba Carr in Las Vegas 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It was thought that everything was arranged when, after an  
internal dispute about how to share the purse, Trinidad's camp 
agreed this week to $10.5 million for the IBF champion. Trinidad 
was said to get $8.5 million and promoter Don King $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's lawyer Nicolas Medina said the Puerto Rican fighter  
had accepted the deal only after Arum had informed him that de la 
Hoya had agreed to the terms, El Mundo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad is undefeated in 35 fights with 30 knockouts and for  
years has sought an opportunity to challenge de la Hoya, who is 
considered the top welterweight in the world. De la Hoya has won 
all 31 of his fights, with 22 knockouts.

<HEADLINE> Investors Gear Up for Longer Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They hunch over stock tables in the dead of  
night and troll the Internet at the crack of dawn for the hottest 
tips and rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	These investors aren't content to buy and hold for the long  
term, and instead clamor to trade all day, every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans who have embraced do-it-yourself investing are  
providing a powerful push as the nation's stock exchanges debate a 
history-making decision to extend their trading hours. 
</P>
<P>
	But some investors remain skeptical more hours are necessary and  
the idea terrifies small-brokerage owners who face stretching their 
slim staffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the stock exchanges themselves fear volatile price  
swings in the hours when most investors are eating breakfast or 
kicking back in front of the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging the uncertainties of such a big change, the New  
York Stock Exchange said Thursday it won't extend its schedule 
until some time next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, investors large and small are gearing up for the change.  
</P>
<P>
	The loudest calls for extended hours come from investors on the  
West Coast, who feel locked out by U.S. markets' current hours of 
9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time, and day traders, who buy and sell 
stocks quickly, hoping to profit from price swings. 
</P>
<P>
	Reinhart Rentsch, an avid trader in New York, expects the extra  
hours will allow him to pounce on corporate news that is often 
reported in early morning or late evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many advantages,'' he said. ``And for people who  
speculate in stocks, I think the advantages are even greater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly what concerns more conservative investors.  
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Miller of Teaneck, N.J., considers himself a day trader,  
buying or selling two or three times a day. Nonetheless, he, too, 
is concerned about the push for longer hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller says he will trade more often, but he fears that the  
market will be flooded with orders from investors who haven't 
thoroughly researched their trades. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who used to work 9 to 5 and then come home and do  
in-depth research will no longer be able to do so,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many professional traders now welcome the lull imposed by the 4  
p.m. market close. The early evening hours provide them time to 
finalize paperwork, meet with clients for drinks or golf, and 
debate their course for the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Small brokerages are particularly worried about stretching their  
resources to meet the demands of a longer session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We already work 12-hour days, so we'll probably go to 15-hour  
days,'' said Alan Davidson, president of Zeus Securities Inc. in 
Jericho, N.Y., and head of the Independent Broker-Dealer 
Association. ``There's really not much give here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If small brokerages are forced to hire more staff, Davidson  
said, many could go under, particularly since night trading is not 
expected to bring in much additional money. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because, at least initially, trading would be restricted  
to a small percentage of all listed companies. The NYSE expects to 
allow trading in 500 of its 3,088 stocks during the extra hours. 
The Nasdaq Stock Market, which includes most of the nation's 
biggest technology companies, plans to trade 100 of its largest 
stocks when it adopts longer hours as early as September. 
</P>
<P>
	By limiting trading to big, widely held stocks, the exchanges  
hope to protect investors from the volatile price swings that can 
occur when only a small number of people are participating in a 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Spero, a certified financial planner in Cleveland,  
acknowledges individual investors forced Wall Street to consider 
longer hours, but she believes only a small percentage will take 
advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people love the idea of making a change (in their  
portfolios) every day, but hardly anyone does it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who do are already finding more options outside  
traditional stock exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	Instinet, an electronic trading system owned by Reuters Inc.,  
now caters to big-money clients, but is exploring ways to open its 
service to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Another is CyberCorp., which plans to offer extended hours to  
clients of its online brokerage unit CyberBroker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the most important company news announcements take  
place before or after hours,'' said founder Philip Berber. ``Until 
now, that's been the exclusive domain of institutional traders, and 
we don't think it should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's trading, the Dow Jones industrial average rose  
136.15 to 10,799.84, finishing up 240.10 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite rose 28.21 to 1,327.75, and  
finished up 25.91 for the week. The Nasdaq composite gained 75.02 
to 2,478.34 Friday, gaining 7.82 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 10.32 to 634.52 Friday, gaining  
12.26 for the week. The American Stock Exchange index rose 5.04 to 
780.98 Friday, and was up 2.24 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.35 to 442.33  
Friday, gaining 3.69 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, which represents the  
combined market value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues, 
ended the week at $12.152 trillion, up $175.594 billion from last 
week. A year ago the index was $10.472 trillion.

<HEADLINE> Murder Probe Reveals Teens' Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOLF CREEK, Ore. (AP) -- They grew up without telephone,  
television or Internet, in a home they helped their parents carve 
from 52 acres behind locked gates deep in the southern Oregon 
mountains 
</P>
<P>
	Always together, usually on their dirt bikes, Josh Cain and  
half-brother Trevor Walraven were known around town as good kids 
who helped in the family business and did odd jobs for neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	They were so well-regarded that when authorities charged the  
teens with murdering a popular lodge owner and riding around in his 
sport-utility vehicle last summer, many thought it was a cruel 
joke. 
</P>
<P>
	But the evidence that's come out as the case moves toward its  
first trial Tuesday pulls back a curtain from a seemingly sheltered 
existence and reveals elements of teen-age life in 1999 that are 
frighteningly familiar: drugs, guns and the violent lyrics of 
Marilyn Manson. 
</P>
<P>
	In the cabin the boys shared outside their parents' house,  
detectives found marijuana bongs and letters from Josh, 19, asking 
15-year-old Trevor to send him some pot, LSD and methamphetamine 
when Josh was away from home. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also a copy of lyrics, apparently in Josh's  
handwriting, from Manson's song ``Portrait of an American Family'': 
</P>
<P>
	``Dealing with insanity, smoking pot, hating this (expletive)  
world, murder is the answer, I only kill to know I'm alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives focused on the brothers after they were seen driving  
the vehicle owned by Black Bar Lodge owner Bill Hull, who 
disappeared July 26 after attending Sunday church services. 
</P>
<P>
	His decomposing body was found almost a week later covered with  
brush in a remote forest clearcut less than 8 miles from his home. 
An autopsy revealed he'd been shot once in the top of the head with 
a copper-jacketed, hollow-point .38-special bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Zink, who knew the boys as director of the Wolf Creek  
Teen Center and is the mother of Trevor's girlfriend, firmly 
believes their explanation why they were driving Hull's 1997 
Chevrolet Suburban: They'd found it parked on an isolated logging 
road not far from their home, a key in the ignition and a wallet in 
the glove compartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if God stepped down here today and said, `Eileen, those  
boys did that,' I would question God himself because he was trying 
to trick me,'' Zink said. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh goes on trial for murder Tuesday. No trial date has been  
set for the younger Trevor, accused of pulling the trigger and 
charged as an adult with aggravated murder. 
</P>
<P>
	They lived 10 miles down Grave Creek, a tributary of the Rogue  
River dotted with mining claims dating back to the Gold Rush. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys' parents, Karen Cain and Doug Walraven, began building  
their home in 1983, going no further than cash on hand, living 
first in a trailer then a small cabin. It was 1997 before the main 
house was well enough along for the parents to move in, and the 
boys took over the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were home-schooled most of their lives. Josh attended 10th  
grade at Glendale High School, where he signed up for football. 
Rather than finish high school, he got his equivalency diploma and 
enrolled in 1997 at the University of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	When Josh went to school, so did Trevor. His junior high  
teachers described him as bright, a bit of a class clown, but a boy 
the other kids looked up to. 
</P>
<P>
	If he wore a particular bracelet, they all wanted one just like  
it. He liked skateboarding and shaved the sides of his head, 
leaving the top long enough for a pony tail. His only brush with 
the law was for riding his motorcycle on the freeway without a 
driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
	Their parents made their living traveling to swap meets to sell  
antique gas station paraphernalia and Raggedy Ann collectibles. 
When the boys were young, they went along. As they got older, they 
earned money helping other people set up booths. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, when their parents hit the road, the boys stayed  
home. 
</P>
<P>
	When the parents returned after swap meets in Idaho and Portland  
last July, the boys told them home intruders had stolen Josh's .357 
Magnum, an earlier Christmas gift from his mother, along with 
Trevor's .22-caliber revolver. Some rifles and a shotgun in the gun 
safe in the main house were untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hull was reported missing, investigators heard reports his  
Suburban had been seen around Grants Pass and Wolf Creek. 
Investigators tracked it to Josh and Trevor and were waiting to 
talk to them when they returned from a three-day joy ride to Eugene 
and Reedsport. 
</P>
<P>
	They claimed a friend from California had let them use it. When  
that story unraveled, they said they'd found it a couple miles from 
their house. On a hunch, sheriff's Detective Fred Barbero had a 
search team go over the area. They found Hull's body a mile and a 
half up the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbero testified at a pretrial hearing that the fatal bullet  
was the same brand and type found at the boys' house. He added that 
.38-special bullets can be fired from a .357 Magnum. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Cain testified that she didn't mind her boys smoking pot,  
but didn't believe her sons were using other drugs or were 
interested in violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Haynes, a friend along on the joy ride, told investigators  
that while sitting on a front porch in Eugene, Trevor suggested 
they mug a pizza delivery man for gas money to get home. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbero testified that Trevor also told Haynes how the  
Suburban's owner had picked him up and Trevor had forced him at 
gunpoint into the hills, where he shot him in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Zink said the brothers' arrests were a terrible blow to other  
kids in town. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here these boys are known as good kids,'' she said. ``They had  
motorbikes and spending money, a two-parent family, a nice place in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had so many kids say to me, `If this can happen to them,  
there's no hope for me.'''

<HEADLINE> Ewing Sits, Watches and Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Ewing couldn't play Saturday night. He  
couldn't run, and he certainly couldn't jump. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Larry Johnson's unlikely four-point play lifted the New  
York Knicks to a stunning 92-91 victory over the Indiana Pacers, 
Ewing left the celebrating to his teammates -- much the same way he 
has left his hopes for an NBA championship in their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been hurt all throughout the playoffs, but he's given 110  
percent,'' said Johnson, whose 3-pointer and ensuing free throw 
with 5.7 seconds left lifted the Knicks to a 2-1 lead in the 
Eastern Conference finals. ``It's time to give it back to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, whose black suit made him look like the world's tallest  
undertaker, wasn't dressed for the wild Madison Square Garden party 
that followed the victory. As his teammates bounced around him in 
elation on the Knicks' bench, Ewing only raised his arms toward the 
ceiling and pumped his fists. 
</P>
<P>
	With a cast on his partially torn left Achilles' tendon, that  
was the best the big man could muster. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who wound up with a game-high 26 points, made up for  
it. He ended up hugging director Spike Lee on the court after 
Indiana's Mark Jackson missed a 10-foot jumper at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks responded to Ewing's pre-game call to ``get me a  
ring,'' with bench players Marcus Camby and Chris Childs 
particularly cranking up their games in Ewing's absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys had to step up with Patrick out,'' Johnson said.  
``That was our main focus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They did. In addition to Johnson's second straight 20-plus game,  
Camby -- in 33 minutes -- grabbed 11 rebounds and scored 21 points, 
including two clutch free throws to bring the Knicks within one 
with 13 seconds left. Childs had 10 assists and just a single 
turnover. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby more than made up for Ewing's missing 13.1 points and 8.7  
rebounds -- the wounded center's playoff averages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew coming in that we were without our leader,'' Camby  
said after the game. ``We knew we had to pick up our play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And they did. Coach Jeff Van Gundy, who spent the game down the  
bench from Ewing, credited his captain with giving his teammates a 
boost despite his dark attire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick was so supportive of the team -- Chris and Marcus in  
particular,'' Van Gundy said. ``I feel so happy we were able to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory allowed the Knicks to keep the homecourt advantage  
going into Monday night's Game 4 at the Garden. It also continued 
their unlikely quest to get Ewing his first NBA title since 
entering the league as the overall No. 1 draft pick in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Kurt Thomas, one of several Knicks who battled Indiana  
center Rik Smits during the game, said Ewing's absence would 
continue to spur his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just keep fighting, no matter what the situation is,''  
Thomas said. ``We'll keep fighting until the end.''

<HEADLINE> Six Retirees Killed in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- Three retired couples were killed when  
their car was struck by another as they drove out of an adult 
condominium community. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the six retirees, all from the New York area, set  
out for the airport to drop off one couple before dinner Friday. 
They were struck as they turned left at a traffic light at the 
community's entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact sent both cars airborne, nearly splitting the  
retirees' car in half and throwing three passengers from the car. A 
third car was struck by the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden the cars went airborne and bodies were flying  
all over,'' said Paula Schinasi, who called police. 
</P>
<P>
	Driver Neil Marvin, 66, Paulette Marvin, 68, Samuel Beja, 68,  
Elaine Beja, 66, Seymour Insler, 73, and Sue Insler, 67, were 
killed at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the other vehicle, Robert Carratelli, 42, was  
treated for minor injuries and released from Delray Medical Center. 
No one in the third car was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges were filed. Police said the investigation was  
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents had complained for years about speeding traffic at the  
intersection. A traffic light was installed, but a new petition 
sought a turn signal, too.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants To Help Mentally Ill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton kicked off a White House  
campaign Saturday designed to erase the stigma of mental illness. 
``In too many of our hearts,'' he said, ``mental illness is 
misunderstood and feared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president teamed with Tipper Gore in his weekly radio  
address as a prelude to Monday's first White House conference on 
mental illness. He said the session will seek ways to dispel myths 
about the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too many people with mental illness are denied the opportunity  
to fully participate in American life,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, disclosed recently  
that she underwent treatment for depression. A longtime advocate 
for the mentally ill, she played a leading role in organizing 
Monday's conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most widely believed and most damaging myths is  
that mental illness is a personal failure, not a physical 
disease,'' she said. ``Nothing could be further from the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president and Mrs. Gore also announced a new public service  
campaign designed to change attitudes about schizophrenia, 
depression and other such maladies. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore is working with Surgeon General David Satcher and the  
Ad Council to produce the campaign on mental illness, which she 
said affects one in five Americans every year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virtually every American has a friend, a neighbor or a  
colleague with a mental illness,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why, then, is mental illness met with so much misunderstanding  
and fear?'' Mrs. Gore asked. ``We have come so far in the diagnosis 
and treatment of mental illness, but our attitudes have lagged far 
behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued an executive order Friday to eliminate the  
government's stricter hiring and promotion standards for mentally 
disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our administration has worked hard to widen the circle of  
opportunity for every American,'' he said. ``That means making sure 
people living with mental illness have the same chance to live up 
to their God-given potential as all other Americans.''

<HEADLINE> Plane Crash Victims Had Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Gordon McLerran's family had traced its  
Scottish roots back to the 9th century, but he wasn't satisfied to 
stop there. He and his wife, Joyce, had just spent two weeks 
tramping around their ancestral homeland, and they were already 
plotting a return. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, Gordon had thought about leasing his house and moving  
over there for a year,'' his 87-year-old mother, Mildred, said from 
her home in Russellville. ``He had looked at real estate over there 
and the cost of living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But those plans died last week in the flames of American  
Airlines Flight 1420. 
</P>
<P>
	The McLerrans were among nine people, including the pilot, who  
perished Tuesday when the MD-82 slid off a runway at Little Rock's 
National Airport and broke apart in a violent thunderstorm. 
Investigators have yet to determine precisely what was to blame -- 
pilot error, the storm, a mechanical failing or possibly some 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
	What is certain is that nine lives -- some just beginning, others  
in their golden years -- were cut short. 
</P>
<P>
	James Harrison of Paragould, Ark., was just 21, but he knew  
exactly what he wanted in life. He often quoted a favorite biblical 
verse, James 1:1, ``a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus 
Christ,'' said the Rev. George Lynch, pastor of the First Baptist 
Church of Royal. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was his name, and that's what he wanted his life to  
represent,'' said Lynch, who hired the Ouachita Baptist University 
senior three years ago to run the church's music ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch, 30, said Harrison was already showing the traits of a  
good minister. ``We were learning together how to lead a church and 
choir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service was held Saturday for Harrison in the small  
town of Royal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sue Gray's plans revolved around the next person she could help.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gray, 78, a retired Russellville schoolteacher, was always  
doing something at All Saints Episcopal Church -- working the flower 
garden, teaching Sunday school, embroidering altar linens. She 
helped a friend who had a triple bypass surgery to get out and 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
	She made sure that the basketball uniforms and dresses were  
properly mended for Luanne Hamilton's children. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a ray of sunshine in our lives and in our children's  
lives,'' said Mrs. Hamilton. ``She was our Granny Gray, and I was 
just so blessed to be a part of her life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Thacker, 53, a vice president at the River Valley Bank in  
Russellville, led the tour group to Europe that included the 
McLerrans and Ms. Gray. She had been thinking about next year's big 
trip. Alaska was a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty Ingram was probably itching to get back to her flowers.  
Ms. Ingram, 69, a retired secretary, had a vibrant garden and 
worked with other gardeners to put some color around buildings in 
Russellville. 
</P>
<P>
	``She took great pride in her flowers and made it a joy to those  
of us who lived here,'' neighbor Charity Goates told the Arkansas 
Democrat-Gazette. Some of the plants in front of Ms. Ingram's 
apartment building have yet to bloom. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite a successful Air Force career and two decades on  
commercial airliners, pilot Richard Buschmann, 48, seemed to prefer 
the simple, everyday pleasures. ``It's still the swim meets, the 
soccer games -- typical family life that just keeps going on, only 
now it isn't,'' said Eileen Vogler, a longtime family friend in 
Naperville, Ill., 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 American Airlines pilots and flight attendants in  
uniform were among the mourners who attended Buschmann's funeral in 
his hometown Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon and Joyce McLerran, at 64 and 65, had a busy retirement.  
Mrs. McLerran took up pottery in 1991, not long after the high 
school sweethearts moved to Russellville from Corpus Christi, 
Texas, where he was a state chemist and she worked in insurance; he 
was president of the local arts council and was active in Kiwanis. 
A memorial service was held Saturday for the McLerrans in 
Dardanelle. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a most devoted couple -- in fact, unusually so,''  
said Gordon's mother. ``Whatever one wanted to do, the other one 
fell right in with it. They would walk down the mall holding 
hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And they gave her life more meaning. ``I should have been the  
first one to go,'' she said. ``I'm 87 years old now. What good am I 
now?'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Customers Mourn Supermarket Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Supermarket customers returned to the aisles  
where a man embarked on a deadly shooting rampage the day before, 
buying bouquets along with their groceries before laying the 
flowers outside in tribute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate you coming back,'' Albertsons manager Greg McNiff  
told a customer leaving the store on Friday evening. ``Our 
employees need to see you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have charged 23-year-old Zane Floyd, a former Marine  
from Camp Pendleton, Calif., with killing four Albertsons workers 
and critically injuring a fifth with a pump-action shotgun 
Thursday. Investigators have not determined a motive, and believe 
the victims were shot at random. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five people, including 14 employees, were in the store  
about two miles west of the Las Vegas Strip when the shooting 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's remarkable that we didn't end up with more victims,''  
said Las Vegas police Sgt. Kevin Manning. ``He quit because there 
was no one else to victimize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who escaped were two vendors who were rushed into a  
walk-in cooler by a produce manager as shooting began. Police found 
the women hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Albertsons offered counseling for its employees before reopening  
late Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole time I was in there I was shivering,'' said Drew  
Henry, 28, a checker who returned to the store for help. He was not 
working during the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellow police tape had been taken down outside the market on  
Friday, and only the makeshift memorial and TV news satellite 
trucks remained. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no words to describe what happened here,'' said  
Christine Gustavson, 21, a former store employee. She placed 
flowers next to a sign that read: ``You're in our prayers. 
Albertsons Store 611.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Marquez, 24, who said he knew Floyd from their work  
together as bouncers, was also perplexed as he visited the store. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has their breaking point,'' Marquez said of Floyd.  
``That was not him. It was like a total 360, a Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. 
Hyde thing. It doesn't make any sense.''

<HEADLINE> Yale Crew Defeats Harvard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- Yale's senior-dominated crew rowed to a  
comeback victory Saturday in the four-mile Yale-Harvard Regatta, 
finishing six seconds ahead of favored Harvard in the nation's 
oldest intercollegiate athletic event. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard led the first three miles on the wind-ruffled Thames  
River before the Eli varsity oarsmen pulled ahead and maintained a 
slim lead the rest of the way. Yale finished in 20:45, two scull 
lengths ahead of the Crimson in the 134th running of the event, 
which dates to 1852. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the only the second time Yale has defeated Harvard in the  
past 15 years and leaves the Eli trailing the series 81-53. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was delayed for several hours because of rough water on  
the Thames. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yale crew -- composed of senior coxswain Steve Pritzker,  
senior strokeman Alex Reid, senior Mark McCusker (7th man), senior 
Jim Needham (6th man), sophomore Scott Proper (5th man), junior Jim 
Donahue (4h man), senior Rob Welhoelter (3rd man), senior Hans 
VanTrotha (2nd man) and senior bowman Lucas McLoughlin -- celebrated 
long and loudly after reaching the dock. 
</P>
<P>
	Pritzker said his crew stuck to its pre-race strategy.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had a lot of guys who had been through it. Our plan was to  
keep it close the first three miles because we knew with a mile to 
go we could do it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Makes Nighttime Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery and its crew  
returned from the first docking mission with the international 
space station on Sunday, making a rare middle-of-the-night landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery swooped through a mostly clear sky and touched down on  
Kennedy Space Center's floodlighted runway just after 2 a.m. It was 
only the 11th time that a space shuttle landed in darkness; 
infrared cameras tracked its approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of rain offshore, Mission Control waited until almost  
the last minute before giving the seven astronauts the go-ahead to 
fire the braking engines and come home. They cheered the news. 
</P>
<P>
	The freshly stocked space station was soaring over the North  
Atlantic when Discovery rolled to a safe stop, ending a journey of 
nearly 4 million miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welcome home, Discovery, from the first docking mission to the  
international space station,'' Mission Control radioed to the 
astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to be home,'' replied Commander Kent Rominger.  
</P>
<P>
	Rominger and his crew spent six of their 10 days in orbit at the  
new international space station. They left 2 tons of tools, water, 
clothes and other supplies for the first permanent crew, due to 
arrive next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Before departing Thursday, the astronauts also fixed a broken  
radio, replaced flawed battery packs, and made it quieter by 
installing mufflers over noisy fans. 
</P>
<P>
	This was only the second crew to visit the orbiting outpost. The  
first crew connected the station's two components in December. And 
it will be this December before shuttle astronauts arrive with more 
supplies. First, the Russians must launch their long-delayed 
service module; that's scheduled for November. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's astronauts briefly set aside their packing for  
Saturday morning's release of Starshine, a 19-inch sphere covered 
with 878 small, circular mirrors that were polished by 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	It's purely an educational project; more than 25,000 students  
around the world will track the sparkling satellite over the next 
seven to eight months and, in doing so, determine the density of 
the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Reminiscent of a 1970s disco ball, the $1 million Starshine  
twinkled as it popped out of a canister in the shuttle cargo bay 
and floated away. It quickly was spotted by observers on the ground 
with the naked eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a fantastic sight,'' said Canadian astronaut Julie  
Payette, who pushed the ejection button. ``The first thing we all 
saw was the flickering of the mirrors ... We could track it with 
our cameras for the longest time because it's now and then getting 
a flash. It's beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The project's director, Gil Moore of Utah State University, said  
the satellite should remain in orbit until January before it 
plunges through the atmosphere and burns up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We invite everybody in the world to track this thing,'' Moore  
said. ``This is not just for kids. It's for students of all ages.''

<HEADLINE> Lemon Drop Kid Wins Belmont Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charismatic left the Belmont starting gate a  
mile and a half from becoming a racing legend. He left the track in 
an ambulance, his career over. 
</P>
<P>
	Just moments after the Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner finished  
third Saturday behind Lemon Drop Kid and Vision and Verse in the 
Belmont Stakes, a pall dropped like a curtain over the crowd of 
85,818, biggest in New York racing history, as Chris Antley pulled 
up the big chestnut colt and dismounted. 
</P>
<P>
	About an hour later, the word came that Charismatic fractured  
two bones in his left front leg -- the cannon bone and the sesamoid. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means he's through as a racehorse,'' said veterinarian  
Dr. Larry Bramlage. ``We expect him to be fine as a stallion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Stephen Selway, a veterinarian for Charismatic trainer D.  
Wayne Lukas, said the horse will have surgery Sunday. The operation 
is not life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt's lower leg was placed in a cast and he was returned to  
his stall in the barn at Belmont Park, where Lukas said he was 
resting comfortably. Surgery at the equine hospital next to Belmont 
Park will insert screws to hold the fragments of bone together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Naturally, you hate to see a horse get hurt,'' said winning  
trainer Scotty Schulhofer. ``I would have felt better if it hadn't 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the injury hadn't occurred, it appears Charismatic  
wouldn't have been able to hold off Lemon Drop Kid and Vision and 
Verse, who were a head apart at the wire, with Charismatic another 
1 1/2 lengths back. The filly Silverbulletday finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Bramlage said the injury apparently occurred just past the wire.  
</P>
<P>
	It was an unfortunate ending for the former claimer who had  
caught the public's imagination in his bid to give a Triple Crown 
to Lukas and owners Bob and Beverly Lewis. The Lewises had failed 
to win the Triple Crown two years ago when the Bob Baffert-trained 
Silver Charm finished second in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're devastated at the thought that anything could be wrong  
with Charismatic,'' Bob Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Charismatic crossed the finish line, he clearly was  
limping with Antley still aboard. The jockey rolled off and 
immediately ran his hands down both front legs and picked the left 
leg up to keep Charismatic from putting weight on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had horses break down in the past. I've seen what it's  
like before,'' Antley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran my hands down both his legs. Horses go into shock. They  
can't feel that,'' he said, referring to a broken bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Antley's quick action drew praise from Lukas, veterinarians and  
Bob Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was simply marvelous,'' Lewis said. ``He might have saved  
the horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disappointed Lukas, who has won 12 Triple Crown races and  
all three of them in one year but with different horses, said: ``I 
think we had the right horse at the right place on the right day, 
but we didn't get the right situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's racing and these things happen. We'll deal with them.''  
</P>
<P>
	Antley said he didn't know when the injury occurred but said he  
felt Charismatic ease a bit about the eighth pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was almost like letting out air. He eased off the run he  
started on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid certainly deserved his victory but it was a  
disappointing ending. Many had hoped to see Charismatic -- a great 
grandson of Secretariat -- become the first horse to win the Triple 
Crown since Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	The race also was billed as a showdown between the Triple Crown  
challenger and the sensational filly Silverbulletday, making her 
debut against males after winning 11 of 12 against fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened for a mile, and then Silverbulletday faded. But her  
presence in the race likely played a big part in Charismatic's 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, Charismatic chased the pace much earlier than is  
his custom, laying second behind Silverbulletday from the clubhouse 
turn until less than a half-mile remained. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe he (Charismatic) ran away (on the pace) with  
her,'' Jerry Bailey, Silverbulletday's rider, said. ``It's tough to 
go head and head that far, but I could see Antley's horse was kind 
of rank. I looked over and he was trying to get him back, but he 
couldn't get him back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid, ridden by Jose Santos, was fourth with a  
quarter-mile to go, then was taken outside for his winning charge 
down the middle of the track. He took the lead from Charismatic 
with an eighth of a mile remaining and won in 2:27.88. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt, owned by Laddie and Jeanne Vance, paid a winning  
mutuel of $61.50, fourth-largest in the 131-year history of the 
race. His place and show prices were $26 and $10.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid finished a head in front of Vision and Verse,  
trying to become the first non-Derby and Preakness starter to win 
the Belmont since Schulhofer did it with Colonial Affair in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Vision and Verse paid $44.40 and $17 and Charismatic was $3.60.  
</P>
<P>
	Completing the order of finish after fourth-place Best of Luck  
were Stephen Got Even, Patience Game, Silverbulletday, Menifee, 
Pineaff, Prime Directive, Teletable and Adonis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid earned $600,000 for his second victory in five  
starts this year and fourth triumph in 11 career outings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came over to the track great and I've said ever since we  
put him in training he's been a nice horse,'' Schulhofer said. ``He 
needed a little time to get going and he peaked on the right day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Lemon Drop Kid ended up in the winner's circle, it was  
Charismatic who was on the minds of many as they left Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again the fragility of racehorses and the uncertainty of  
racing was brought home. 
</P>
<P>
	``All week, we talked about how maintenance-free this horse was  
and how durable he is,'' Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tearful Antley, who rode back into the limelight with  
Charismatic after being sidelined for 18 months with weight 
problems, said: ``He gave us a lot. He gave America a lot. The game 
goes one.''

<HEADLINE> Garcia Pulls Out of Gainer Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- IBF junior lightweight champion Roberto  
Garcia pulled out of his title defense against Derrick Gainer 
Saturday night because of a dispute over the judges, the boxer's 
manager said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Woodworth, co-manager for Garcia, said that the IBF  
refused to provide impartial judges for the fight, which was on the 
undercard of the Roy Jones Jr.-Reggie Johnson light heavyweight 
championship bout. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariam Muhammad, executive secretary of the International Boxing  
Federation, said Garcia's managers told her Friday that they had a 
problem with one official and a change was made of the entire 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't tell me who to have officiate, but if they have a  
problem with someone we try to accommodate them,'' she said. ``Mr. 
Woodworth came to me and I switched the officials and was told 
everything was a go. I went to bed Friday night thinking the fight 
was on and woke up Saturday morning to find out it was off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, 32-0 with 24 knockouts, won the title in a unanimous  
decision against Frank Warren on March 13, 1998. He was replaced in 
the bout by Donovan Carey of Baton Rouge, La., 15-1-1 with three 
KOs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Gainer of Pensacola, Fla., was 27-4 as a  
professional, with 19 knockouts, and ranked No. 2 by the IBF. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodworth said all the announced judges were from the South and  
Garcia could not risk losing the title due to an unfair decision. 
Garcia is from Oxnard, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we asked who our judges are, we were told we would have  
two Mississippi, one Louisiana and one Florida,'' Woodworth said. 
``Now, we are not trying to question the integrity of any 
commissioner or any judge, but on the surface you can't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad said she knew nothing of such concerns.  
</P>
<P>
	``What constitutes an impartial official?'' she said. ``I don't  
know what they mean by that, since we made a switch to accommodate 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodworth said the managers were also concerned about  
allegations the IBF sold rankings and arranged fights for 
kickbacks. Federal agents raided the offices of boxing promoter Don 
King on Friday as part of an investigation the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robert is an undefeated champion,'' Woodworth said. ``This is  
what is wrong with boxing. All we wanted is for Gainer to pick two 
judges and us to pick two judges. All we ask for is fairness and an 
even shake, and they denied it to us.''

<HEADLINE> Push for Women's History in Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Each fall, as Doris Meadows begins  
another year of teaching 11th-grade history, she gives her new 
students a task: Compose three lists of famous Americans in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has trouble filling up the first category -- famous white  
men. But when it comes to naming women and blacks for the other 
open-ended lists, nearly all her students come up short. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't make it to 10,'' said Meadows, a teacher at Joseph  
Wilson Magnet High School in Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
	How to work women's history into high school teaching is one of  
the main topics of debate at the Berkshire Conference on the 
History of Women. The annual three-day forum, which opened Friday 
at the University of Rochester, drew 1,300 scholars, including 170 
from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	At Stanford University in 1972, Meadows taught one of the first  
college classes in women's history. When she was hired 12 years ago 
by Wilson Magnet, a public school, ``it was kind of a natural 
progression for me to try to bring that knowledge into my 
classroom,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	History courses that put the spotlight on women and re-examine  
the past through the prism of gender are now commonplace on 
American college campuses. Over the past two decades, historians 
have been integrating that discipline's insights into their 
teaching and writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many high school textbooks mention ``the big events, like  
women's suffrage, and then it tends to be episodic,'' Meadows said. 
``To learn from history, people need to know the full story, not 
just the list of presidents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the panelists for this weekend's event is Sally Schwager,  
director of the Women's History Institute at Harvard. Since 1985, 
she has conducted a teacher's program to help high schools find 
ways to make history ``much more inclusive, not just for women but 
different races, social classes and religions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Women's history ``began as a project of putting women back into  
history'' but has flowered into an academic specialty that's had 
``an incredible impact on history, in rethinking questions and 
offering new interpretations,'' said Eileen Boris, a women and 
gender studies professor at the University of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Changing the way history is taught in high schools ``is the last  
thing to happen, the most difficult to effect,'' said Leila Rupp, a 
history professor at Ohio State University who edits the Journal of 
Women's History. 
</P>
<P>
	Often, the impetus for altering the perspective in high school  
history projects comes from students themselves, Rupp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than encourage ``a supermarket attitude'' -- where  
students hop from one group in society to the next -- Meadows says 
she emphasizes that ``what we have is one large history, and it's 
important to see the connections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	High schools present special difficulties -- time constraints, an  
apparent drift toward ever-smaller course books and ``politically 
driven'' battles over what textbook writers choose to include or 
exclude, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But giving students broader glimpses at the past becomes  
critical, she said, because ``history provides us models for how 
people have lived before us and what the human possibilities are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Meadow's class, by the end of the year, her students have a  
much greater appreciation for the contributions that both women and 
minorities have made to U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last week of school, I do the exercise over again and they  
all just start laughing because now they can do tons,'' she said. 
``If the kids leave my class without being able to do that list, I 
am not doing my job.''

<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- During Jeff Gordon's transition from top  
prospect to Winston Cup champion, a Sunday at Dover Downs 
International Speedway often ended in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	But things haven't gone so well recently on The Monster Mile for  
the 27-year-old driver from Pittsboro, Ind., who considers Dover 
his home track because sponsor DuPont is headquartered 45 minutes 
up the road in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon won at Dover for the first time in 1995 -- coincidentally  
the year of his first title. He returned in 1996 to win both the 
spring and fall offerings on the high-banked concrete oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dover is a great race track for us,'' said Gordon, who proved  
that even in defeat a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He led 375 of 400 laps, but wound up third because he had to  
stop for fuel with eight laps left. 
</P>
<P>
	Victimized by accidents and mechanical failures this year that  
have dropped him all the way to eighth in the standings as he 
pursues a record-tying third straight title, Gordon is hoping to 
begin a turnaround Sunday in the MBNA Platinum 400. But he won't be 
greedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think anything in the top five would make it a successful  
weekend,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HEADING HOME:* Three-time Winston Cup champion Darrell Waltrip,  
whose 84 career victories are the most among active drivers, failed 
to make the field for the MBNA 400. It was only the second time in 
his 28-year career that Waltrip has been sent home. 
</P>
<P>
	The last of his 84 career victories came in the 1992 Southern  
500, 207 races ago. Waltrip, who also failed to make the field in 
Concord, N.C., in October 1997, has been qualifying often as a 
result of provisionals. 
</P>
<P>
	But he is out of them for now, and will have to drive fast  
enough to get in for the next three races. He had two shots this 
weekend, but failed to go fast enough either Friday or Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip was joined on the sidelines by Hut Stricklin and rookie  
Buckshot Jones, who also failed to qualify Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CRASH IRVAN:* Ernie Irvan, whose once-promising career has  
degenerated into an almost-weekly crashfest, was busy Saturday. He 
was involved in two accidents while driving in the MBNA Platinum 
200 Busch Grand National event, then did some meaningful damage. 
</P>
<P>
	At the beginning of ``Happy Hour,'' the final practice for  
Winston Cup drivers competing in Sunday's MBNA Platinum 400, Irvan 
wrecked again. He totaled his Pontiac when it spun into the 
frontstretch wall at Dover Downs International Speedway. An oil 
line came loose, quickly engulfing the engine compartment in 
flames, but Irvan escaped without injury. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in his backup car a few minutes after the practice crash,  
and finished the session without another mishap. Because his 
primary car was withdrawn, Irvan will fall to the rear of the 
43-car field Sunday. He had earned the 29th starting position. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan was a factor in the championship race in 1994 until he  
crashed during practice at Michigan Speedway. He had a major head 
injury, and was out of action for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old driver from Salinas, Calif., has 15 career  
victories, three since his return late in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SOME BAD NAMES:* Dover Downs International Speedway has been  
called many things -- often unprintable ones -- in its 31 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Park is aware of most of them, and says they are  
justified. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place has more nicknames than any track we go to,'' he  
said. ``There's The Monster Mile and White Lighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you notice, none of them are nice, soothing names, either.  
There is good reason for that. I think all the names are designed 
to intimidate the drivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PIT STOPS:* A victory by Jeff Gordon, Terry Labonte or Wally  
Dallenbach would give Hendrick Motorsports seven at Dover, tying 
the Wood Brothers for the most in track history. The Woods haven't 
been to the winner's circle at Dover since the late Neil Bonnett 
won the 1981 fall race. ... Ken Schrader, a winner of the spring 
race in 1991, hasn't prevailed anywhere since -- a drought of 247 
starts. ... Bill Elliott's losing streak now stands at 139 races 
... Kenny Wallace didn't have any fun last year on The Monster 
Mile. He had an accident and finished 40th in the spring race, then 
blew an engine, finished just two laps and was last in the fall 
event. ... Fords took five of the top seven spots in both Dover 
races last year. ... Sweeps are no rarity at Dover. Six times in 
track history -- most recently by Jeff Gordon in 1996 -- a driver has 
won both the spring and fall events. ... Rookie points leader Tony 
Stewart is a shocking fifth overall in the Winston Cup standings. 
No rookie has finished the season in the top 10 since Jody Ridley 
wound up seventh in 1980. ... Terry Labonte will extend the career 
record for most consecutive Winston Cup starts when he takes the 
green flag Sunday for the 615th straight time. The rear fenders on 
Rick Mast's Ford bear this inscription: ``Guess Who, Ha! Ha! Ha! 
Ha!'' That's a teaser for a sponsorship deal expected to be 
announced next weekend at Michigan Speedway. ... James Ince, crew 
chief for Rich Bickle, and Jeff Buice, who calls the shots for 
Jerry Nadeau, have been fined $2,500 by NASCAR for drilling holes 
in the frames of their cars to lighten them prior to the Coca-Cola 
600 last Sunday in Concord, N.C.

<HEADLINE> New Statue Honors Poet Pushkin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A site on the campus of George Washington  
University was dedicated Friday at a groundbreaking ceremony for a 
statue to celebrate the 200th birthday of Alexander Pushkin, the 
poet, storyteller and democratic propagandist sometimes called 
``the Russian Shakespeare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. James W. Symington, D-Mo., chairman of the  
American-Russian Cultural Foundation, read a letter of support from 
President Clinton, and Washington Mayor Anthony Williams proclaimed 
Friday as ``Pushkin Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The statue, I am told, will be the only one of Pushkin, in  
fact the only statue of a Russian literary figure, in this 
country,'' said Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, president of the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	Symington sang a Pushkin poem set to music by Russian composer  
Mikhail Glinka. He also led an audience of 200 gathered at the 
street corner site in a chorus of ``Happy Birthday, Alexander.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Having the statue may be more important for Russia than the  
next loan from the World Bank,'' sculptor Alexander Burganov 
recently told a small group representing the university and the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Burganov has also done a figure of the poet and his wife,  
Natalya, for the front of the Pushkin House on the Arbat, Moscow's 
broad pedestrian avenue. Pushkin died in 1837 from a wound suffered 
in a duel brought on by rumors that his wife was unfaithful.

<HEADLINE> FBI: Suspect Trusted bin Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Army sergeant accused of conspiring  
with terrorists to murder Americans helped move Osama bin Laden 
from Pakistan to Sudan and trained members of his terrorist 
organization, according to newly unsealed court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan  
suggested there was a close relationship between Ali Mohamed, 46, a 
native of Egypt, and bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the 
Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also showed frequent contact between the FBI and Mohamed  
over the last six years and indicated that Mohamed had even sought 
unsuccessfully at one point to work as a translator for the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint alleged that Mohamed was telling the FBI as early  
as 1993 about bin Laden, who is also charged in the broad 
conspiracy case stemming from the bombings which killed 213 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The document was one of many unsealed after The New York Times  
filed legal papers challenging whether the bulk of the documents in 
the case against Mohamed could remain sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohamed trained members of bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist  
organization and helped move bin Laden from Pakistan to Sudan in 
1991, according to the FBI complaint signed by Special Agent Daniel 
Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mohamed stated that he did this because he loved bin Laden and  
believed in him,'' the complaint alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said Mohamed admitted he had trained people in war zones  
and added that war zones can be anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left Friday with Mohamed's lawyer, James Roth, was not  
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohamed left the U.S. Army in 1989 after three years of service.  
In the military, he earned a Parachute Badge and an M-16 Expert 
Badge, teaching soldiers in the special forces about Muslim 
culture.

<HEADLINE> Severed Thumb Used To Find Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A murder victim helped detectives  
investigating his death by biting off a suspect's thumb during the 
confrontation that led to his killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators matched Douglas O'Neil Hannam's prints to the  
thumb found at Bowen's Auto Body after a botched armed robbery that 
resulted in the slaying last month, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police think Hannam, 26, fled to New York City and have issued a  
warrant for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 12, Hannam and two suspects who already have been  
arrested allegedly tried to rob shop owner Spurgeon Bowen, but 
Bowen fought back and bit off Hannam's thumb. One of the men in 
custody is accused of firing the fatal shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannam received medical treatment for the severed thumb at a  
Palm Beach County hospital where he told doctors he cut it off with 
a saw.

<HEADLINE>  Hernandez Makes Great Glove Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Orlando Hernandez had his own version of a  
hidden-ball trick at Yankee Stadium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	With a runner at third in the second inning of the New York  
Yankees' 6-3 Subway Series win over the Mets, fellow Cuba defector 
Rey Ordonez hit a comebacker just to the third-base side of the 
pitcher's mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``El Duque'' gloved the one-hopper, but the ball got struck  
between the index and middle fingers of his glove. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing in my mind was throw the glove and the ball,''  
Hernandez said through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, known for his many different release points, looked  
Robin Ventura back to third base, then took a step toward first and 
threw his glove -- with the ball in it -- to Tino Martinez, a toss of 
about 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez easily gloved it -- the glove and the ball -- for the  
second out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it all stayed together. I had to catch it with both  
hands,'' Martinez said. ``It was pretty weird. He didn't try to run 
it halfway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was similar to a play the Mets were involved in on Sept. 3  
1986. Keith Hernandez hit a comebacker to San Francisco Giants 
rookie pitcher Terry Mulholland. When the ball got stuck in 
Mulholland's glove, the pitcher ran toward first and made an 
underhand toss of the glove and ball to first baseman Bob Brenly, 
getting the out. 
</P>
<P>
	``El Duque'' remembered that play.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in Cuba, I saw something similar on videotape,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre was concerned about Ventura racing  
home. Hernandez tried to call time out by first-base umpire John 
Shulock didn't grant it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tino would have had to throw the ball and the glove, too,''  
Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez wasn't so sure.

<HEADLINE>  Hernandez Makes Great Glove Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Orlando Hernandez had his own version of a  
hidden-ball trick at Yankee Stadium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	With a runner at third in the second inning of the New York  
Yankees' 6-3 Subway Series win over the Mets, fellow Cuba defector 
Rey Ordonez hit a comebacker just to the third-base side of the 
pitcher's mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``El Duque'' gloved the one-hopper, but the ball got struck  
between the index and middle fingers of his glove. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing in my mind was throw the glove and the ball,''  
Hernandez said through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, known for his many different release points, looked  
Robin Ventura back to third base, then took a step toward first and 
threw his glove -- with the ball in it -- to Tino Martinez, a toss of 
about 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez easily gloved it -- the glove and the ball -- for the  
second out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it all stayed together. I had to catch it with both  
hands,'' Martinez said. ``It was pretty weird. He didn't try to run 
it halfway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was similar to a play the Mets were involved in on Sept. 3  
1986. Keith Hernandez hit a comebacker to San Francisco Giants 
rookie pitcher Terry Mulholland. When the ball got stuck in 
Mulholland's glove, the pitcher ran toward first and made an 
underhand toss of the glove and ball to first baseman Bob Brenly, 
getting the out. 
</P>
<P>
	``El Duque'' remembered that play.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in Cuba, I saw something similar on videotape,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre was concerned about Ventura racing  
home. Hernandez tried to call time out by first-base umpire John 
Shulock didn't grant it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tino would have had to throw the ball and the glove, too,''  
Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez wasn't so sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a long throw,'' he said. ``I would have had  
to take the ball out first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Yankees couldn't believe what they were seeing.  
</P>
<P>
	``When he threw it, there were about 18 different things that  
could have happened,'' third baseman Scott Brosius said. ``You 
think the ball is going to fly out of the glove; Tino's going to be 
looking for two different things. But it all worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura held, but the Mets got the run in for a 2-0 lead when  
Roger Cedeno reached on a bunt single in front of the plate and 
Ventura slid home ahead of Martinez's return throw. It was the Mets 
only hit in nine at-bats with runners in scoring position.

<HEADLINE> Golf, Family Keep Jordan Happy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Michael Jordan avoids attending and  
watching basketball games so he can separate himself from the sport 
and help his fans do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as I can stay away from it, the easier the ties are  
broken,'' he said Friday. ``I don't want to be in a situation that 
I can't deal with being away from it, so I stay away from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Jordan didn't follow through on a promise to visit  
the United Center this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans need to understand that this is my final decision,''  
he said. ``Basketball is over for me in terms of playing in front 
of crowds and representing the city of Chicago and playing on 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must get away from it so that people can leave that part of  
my life in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan quit the Chicago Bulls in January, saying he was 99.9  
percent sure he would never again play in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm approaching 100 percent,'' he said. ``The longer I stay  
away from the game and get more involved in my kids' activity, that 
99.9 starts to formulate more in the direction of 100.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he has any thoughts about playing next season, Jordan  
replied, ``None at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I deep down realize it was the best move that I made,'' he  
said. ``I'm very happy with my decision. I'm very happy with the 
way my life is headed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's life in retirement includes spending time with his  
wife, Juanita, and their three children, traveling, playing golf 
and developing business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he helps his kids with their homework, puts them to bed,  
and eats breakfast and dinner with his family, activities he never 
had time for during his playing days. 
</P>
<P>
	And, yes, he really does drive the carpool.  
</P>
<P>
	``The fun thing about it -- this is kind of scary to even mention  
-- but my little girl loves for me to take her to school on my 
motorcycle. It was something I could never do before,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His daily workouts are history, and the only time he picks up a  
basketball is to play with his kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only exercise I've had over the last month or two months  
is walking in Ireland and Scotland on the golf course,'' he said. 
``That was a lot of work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said his attempt two months ago to buy a half-interest in  
the Charlotte Hornets is dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will that ever change? Maybe, but I'm not going to search it  
out,'' he said. ``I'm happy with the things I'm involved in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That includes the November launch of his new fragrance, Jordan  
by Michael. He has teamed again with designer Bijan for a new scent 
three years after his namesake cologne became a hit. Jordan was in 
Beverly Hills to shoot the advertising campaign, which will feature 
his wife for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan wants to reduce his endorsements, including those in  
which he is merely a spokesman, in favor of ventures that allow him 
to be creative and take a hands-on approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to cut back because the most valuable thing to me  
now is time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months into retirement, Jordan said he's a happier person.  
</P>
<P>
	``I smile a lot more than I used to,'' he said. ``Now all I have  
to pay attention to is my family and my kids.''

<HEADLINE> Saudis, Mexicans Discuss Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Mexico's energy minister met with  
his Saudi Arabian counterpart Saturday and discussed the world oil 
market and greater cooperation between the two producers, the 
Mexican energy minister, Luis Tellez, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tellez said that he and the Saudi oil minister, Ali Naimi, did  
not discuss the possibility of further production cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico joined the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  
and other non-OPEC producers in a March agreement to cut more than 
2.1 million barrels a day from world oil supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, scheduled to run from April 1, 1999 until the end  
of March, bolstered depressed oil prices that fell to a record low 
of $10 per barrel. London's benchmark Brent blend futures were at 
$15.20 a barrel late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tellez and Naimi ``reiterated the firm commitment of their  
governments with the supply reduction agreements and expressed 
their will to continue with the agreements in terms of timeframe 
and quantities,'' said a statement issued after their meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	It said both ministers believed that current prices, which have  
shored up after rising sharply, would improve even more. 
</P>
<P>
	Tellez said after the meeting that he and Naimi, whose country  
is the biggest OPEC producer, estimated near-full compliance in May 
production by all members. 
</P>
<P>
	Tellez, who arrived Friday, is also expected to visit Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Gay Philanthropist Named Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The controversy over the new U.S.  
ambassador to Luxembourg looms larger than the tiny country. 
</P>
<P>
	James C. Hormel, appointed to the post Friday by President  
Clinton, has been dean of the University of Chicago law school and 
has built a reputation as one of San Francisco's most generous 
philanthropists. But Hormel, who has diplomatic experience, is 
likely to be remembered less for his diplomatic skills than as the 
nation's first openly gay ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's appointment, made while the Senate was in recess,  
angered Catholics and religious conservatives by bypassing senators 
who had held up Hormel's nomination since October 1997. They fear 
that Hormel, who used part of his family's Hormel food fortune to 
help create the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and 
lesbian political group, will promote a radical agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights opposes  
Hormel because he has refused to condemn the Sisters of Perpetual 
Indulgence, an irreverent group of habit-wearing drag queens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the man's sexual orientation, but his record of  
anti-Catholic bigotry,'' said William Donohue, president of the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Others, however, acknowledge that sexual orientation is the  
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that by forcing Americans to be represented by a  
radical homosexual activist like Hormel, Clinton is showing his 
contempt for traditional morality, marriage, sexual fidelity and 
any concept of honor,'' said Robert Knight with the Washington, 
D.C.-based Family Research Council, a religious lobby. ``Who's he 
going to appoint next? Larry Flynt as ambassador to the Vatican?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel, 66, who twice was named to U.S. delegations to the  
United Nations, made few public comments during the long nomination 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hardly view myself as a 'radical,''' he wrote to Sen. Gordon  
Smith, R-Ore., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1996 he described himself as a mentor to homosexuals,  
``part elder statesman for a constituency that is still in its 
adolescence in terms of experiencing its wisdom and empowerment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel's friends call him charming and funny, a good listener  
and a consummate host. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a real sense of foreign relations, always has,'' says  
Alice Turner, who was married to Hormel from 1955 to '65. ``He is 
extraordinarily well-qualified -- overqualified -- for this 
appointment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel's nomination cleared the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee in 1997 and secured bipartisan Senate support. Officials 
in Luxembourg, where 97 percent of the population of 425,000 is 
Catholic, said it would welcome Hormel as ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who has compared  
homosexuality to vices such as kleptomania and sex addiction, 
refused to schedule a floor vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``On one hand, you have these anti-gay senators saying we don't  
need legislation to protect gays and lesbians but you have the 
United States Senate discriminating against someone because he's 
gay,'' says David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign. ``It was very 
un-American and unfair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends say that, far from being a radical activist, Hormel is a  
devoted family man, to his partner, Timothy Wu, and to his children 
-- four daughters and a son, and 13 grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father has better family values than most parents I know.  
He is very dedicated to his family,'' says James Hormel Jr., who 
moved to San Francisco to live near his father. ``Our family is 
different, yes, but it is extremely strong. We love each other very 
much.''

	NATO, Yugoslav Commanders Meet  
</P>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- NATO and Yugoslav commanders met at a  
cafe today along the Kosovo-Macedonia border for crucial talks 
establishing the precise terms for the withdrawal of Serb troops 
from Kosovo -- a key condition before NATO halts the bombardment of 
Yugoslavia. Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson of Britain, representing NATO, 
was joined at the Europe coffeehouse by a delegation of Yugoslav 
generals who arrived three hours late. Alliance officials said 
there would be no negotiations -- just details spelling out the 
conditions and logistics of the pullout. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea 
stressed that withdrawing Yugoslav troops would be open to 
airstrikes if they commit any violence during their retreat.

	Clinton: End Mental Disability Myths  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to dispel myths about the mentally  
ill, President Clinton teamed up today with Tipper Gore, wife of 
his vice president, to announce a new public service campaign 
designed to change attitudes about schizophrenia, depression and 
other such maladies. ``The hard truth is, in too many of our 
communities, and in too many of our hearts, mental illness is 
misunderstood and feared,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio 
address. Clinton asked Mrs. Gore to join him as a prelude to the 
first White House conference on mental illness Monday. Mrs. Gore, 
wife of vice President Al Gore, disclosed recently that she had 
battled depression.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the Federal Aviation  
Administration has told the American Airlines pilots union that the 
agency will begin strictly enforcing crew rest regulations by the 
end of the year, the union says. That word yesterday came three 
days after an American jet crashed on landing in Little Rock, Ark., 
at the end of a long day for the two-member cockpit crew, although 
the FAA said the stepped-up enforcement is not related to the 
accident. Under federal law, airline pilots cannot fly more than 
eight hours in a 24-hour period.

Pat Robertson after he referred to Scotland as a ``dark land'' 
because it tolerates homosexuals, the bank said today. As many as 
500 accounts have been closed at the bank since March, apparently 
because of the publicity over its dealings with Robertson. In a

injured after the tiny town of Oglala on the Pine Ridge Indian 
Reservation was hit by a tornado last night. National Weather 
Service spotters reported at least three tornadoes near Pine Ridge, 
and severe storms were reported in other parts of the state. A 
46-year-old man was killed and six people are missing, including a 
baby living in with the man. ``Maybe 20 mobile homes were destroyed

Naoyuki Tsuda, survived the attack in his office in Osaka, and is 
not in critical condition, police said. Although the white flag 
with a red circle and the song for the emperor are widely used in 
sports events and school ceremonies, they are not officially 
recognized and remain controversial because they evoke bitter 
memories of Japan's aggression during World War II.

<HEADLINE> Report: Agent Bought Car for Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Sports agent Tank Black purchased a  
$133,500 Mercedes-Benz for former Florida linebacker Jevon Kearse 
on Dec. 31, 1998, two days before the Orange Bowl, it was reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Petersburg Times obtained documents from Florida's  
Division of Motor Vehicles that indicate the car was purchased in 
Kearse's name. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported that Kearse's signature appears on an  
odometer disclosure statement dated Dec. 31. DMV papers identify 
Kearse as the owner of the car and indicate a lien dated Dec. 31. 
The vehicle's registration application lists Kearse as the car's 
owner and the date of acquisition as Dec. 31. The notarized title 
lists Dec. 31 as the date the title was transferred from an Atlanta 
dealership to Kearse. 
</P>
<P>
	Kearse drove the car to a Jan. 5 news conference in Gainesville  
to announce he would forgo his senior season to enter the NFL 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The linebacker, a first-round draft pick by the Tennessee  
Titans, did not immediately return telephone messages left by The 
Associated Press on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Leonard Mungo said Black bought the car, but it was not  
given to Kearse until Jan. 5, three days after his eligibility had 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tank, as you know, purchases cars for all his clients,'' Mungo  
said. ``That kind of vehicle was a rare vehicle and he knows his 
clients are always looking for those kinds of vehicles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mungo claims Kearse didn't know the car existed until his  
eligibility was complete and there was no agreement to provide the 
car to Kearse in exchange for him signing with Black. He said 
Kearse's signatures on the documents dated Dec. 31, 1998 may have 
been forged. 
</P>
<P>
	A salesman at RBM of Atlanta, the dealership that sold Black the  
Mercedes, said he has been issued a subpoena in the investigation 
and declined comment. Asked if he remembered anything about the New 
Year's Eve transaction, salesman John Johnson told the newspaper, 
``I do, but I'm under subpoena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA's Bill Saum, who investigates problems involving agents  
and gambling, confirmed that Kearse would have been ineligible for 
the Orange Bowl if an agent had helped him buy a car. But he said 
Florida would not be in violation unless school officials were 
aware and let Kearse play anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Saum said that even if Kearse had the car in Miami before the  
bowl game, it may not have been obvious to UF officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on where the car was,'' Saum said. ``Just because  
it might have been in the same city as the bowl game, you can't 
jump to the conclusion that someone should have seen it and made 
some decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL Players Association has filed a disciplinary complaint  
against Black accusing him of improper dealings with former Florida 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	University police are investigating the Columbia, S.C.-based  
agent, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, former linebacker Johnny Rutledge admitted taking  
$500-per-month payments from Black over the span of a year. 
Rutledge said Reggie McGrew and Kearse have admitted the same under 
sworn depositions. 
</P>
<P>
	Mungo said Kearse and Rutledge first testified they had not  
taken payments, but were coerced by investigators into changing 
their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Violating Florida's agent law is a crime punishable by up to  
five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- Even after a 2-over 74 on Saturday that  
dropped her 11 strokes behind the leader, Si Re Pak isn't ready to 
give up her reign as U.S. Women's Open champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, not yet. Open not over. I have 18 holes left, who knows.  
Somebody could shoot low score. It could be me,'' Pak, the 
21-year-old South Korean, said after her worst round at Old Waverly 
Golf Club. ``One more day ... I still have chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from bogeys at Nos. 2 and 5, Pak had pars the rest of the  
way Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak, who beat Jenny Chuasiriporn in a 20-hole playoff for last  
year's Open title, opened this year's tournament with rounds of 67 
and 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Since following her U.S. Women's Open championship with two  
victories last July, Pak hasn't had won or even had a top 10 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LUCKY BOUNCE:* Karrie Webb got a lucky bounce at No. 18 on  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting a 5-iron out of the rough about 169 yards from the pin,  
Webb thought she had left the ball short. Instead, it barely caught 
the edge of a brick wall bulkhead separating the green from Lake 
Waverly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a lucky break. You know, sometimes you get those,  
sometimes you don't,'' Webb said. ``I was really just trying to fly 
through the front of the green to try and carry that trap. Just 
really didn't come at it cleanly at all and thought it was in the 
water pretty much the whole way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ball bounced high off the brick, over the bunker fronting  
the green and rolled into the fringe on the opposite side. She 
chipped within 4 feet and saved par to finish with a 4-under 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb is at 8 under for the championship, seven strokes off the  
lead. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SIGHT UNSEEN:* Before the U.S. Women's Open started, Lori Kane  
had never played the last five holes at Old Waverly Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	It obviously hasn't affected her through three rounds.  
</P>
<P>
	At 11-under 205, Kane is tied with Kelli Kuehne for second  
place, four strokes behind Juli Inkster. 
</P>
<P>
	Kane has played holes No. 14 through 18 in 5 under this week.  
She was bogey free through that stretch until getting to No. 17, a 
183-yard par-3, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kane had planned to play just nine holes each of the first two  
days after getting to West Point and then play 18 holes on 
Wednesday, the day before the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``My clubs didn't arrive until Monday late, so the nine holes  
was out. I stuck with my game plan because I wanted to get more 
rest,'' Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing nine holes Tuesday, rain and lightning delays  
Wednesday limited Kane to just 13 holes. She then walked the last 
five holes, and played them for the first time in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BIG SUPPORT:* Kelli Kuehne had some big support during the  
third round. 
</P>
<P>
	Her fiancee, Jay Humphrey, was in the gallery. And he wasn't  
hard to pick out of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Humphrey is a 6-foot-7, 300-pound offensive tackle from Texas  
who was drafted in April by the Minnesota Vikings.

<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AMATEUR ACES:* Amateur champion Grace Park enters the final  
round of the Women's Open tied for 10th, even after a 1-over 73 on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old Park, who is playing her final tournament as an  
amateur, earned a full exemption into the Open as only the second 
player ever to win golf's three major women's amateur titles in the 
same year. 
</P>
<P>
	Park is at 6 under, five strokes off the lead. The only other  
amateur to make the cut, Kellee Booth, shot a 2-under 70 Saturday 
and is even through 36 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak and Booth were the only of 12 amateurs in the Open to make  
the cut. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FELLOW AUSSIES:* Five Australians made the cut at the U.S.  
Women's Open. Only one, Wendy Doolan, wasn't paired with a fellow 
Aussie during the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	Mardi Lunn and Alison Munt, who both started at 1 under, were  
grouped together. Webb and Rachel Hetherington, both at 4 under, 
played in another group. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb had the best day by an Aussie with a 4-under 68, while  
Hetherington had a 76. Munt shot a 71, three strokes better than 
Lunn. Doolan shot a 73. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *UP AND DOWN:* Maria Hjorth has U.S. Women's Open best 17  
birdies, one more than leader Juli Inkster, but Hjorth is 11 
strokes off the lead at 4-under 212 after three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to her birdies, Hjorth has 11 bogeys and a double  
bogey. Inkster, on the other hand, has had just one bogey, that at 
No. 3 during the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Hjorth countered seven birdies with three bogeys  
and a double bogey to finish with a 2-under 70. That followed 
rounds of 73 and 69.

<HEADLINE> Burn 5, MetroStars 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Jason Kreis had two goals and two  
assists Saturday night to lead the Dallas Burn to a 5-2 victory 
over the New York-New Jersey MetroStars. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the third in four games for Dallas, while the  
MetroStars, playing without a foreign player in their lineup, lost 
their third straight. It was the worst loss of the season for New 
York-New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	John Jairo Trellez flicked a glancing header into the upper  
right corner after a cross from Mark Santel in the 31st minute to 
give the Burn a 1-0 lead. Santel played the ball in from just 
outside the box after taking a short corner from Kreis. 
</P>
<P>
	Santel made it 2-0 eight minutes later when he ran onto a pretty  
lead pass from Kreis, turned rookie defender Kevin Knight around 
and carried the ball into the box. From there he rolled a low shot 
into the right corner of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars got one back in the 52nd minute when Mike  
Sorber's shot from the top of the box took a crazy bounce off the 
right post and skidded across the goal to the foot of Brian Kelly 
who knocked it home. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal ended a 335-minute scoring drought for the MetroStars  
against the Burn. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven minutes later the Burn made it 3-1 after Kreis fought off  
Sorber and Mike Duhaney in the New York-New Jersey box following a 
long punt by Dallas goalkeeper Matt Jordan. Once he controlled the 
ball, Kreis turned quickly and slipped it into the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Kreis added his second goal of the match and 10th of the season  
in the 66th minute when he took a pass from Dante Washington, 
pulled MetroStars' keeper Mike Ammann off his line and drilled in a 
low left-footed shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' Brian Haynes scored in the 77th minute and the  
MetroStars closed the scoring in the 84th minute when Billy Walsh 
headed in Peter Villegas' corner kick.

<HEADLINE> Merrill To Begin Settlement Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. is acknowledging that some  
of the 900 sexual discrimination claims filed against the firm 
appear to have merit. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo distributed Friday to its national sales staff,  
Merrill said it was ``prepared either to begin settlement 
discussions or to seek additional information on about one-third'' 
of the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some instances, where it is clear that co-workers or  
managers did not treat women properly, Merrill Lynch will take 
appropriate action against those responsible for the improper 
conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight women sued the nation's largest brokerage in Februrary  
1997 on behalf of the company's female financial consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	A settlement was reached in September 1998 allowing 2,900 women  
who worked at Merrill Lynch between January 1994 through June 1998 
to file discrimination claims to be heard by mediators. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those eligible to join the case, 31 percent came forward and  
claimed the firm gave men more walk-in clients, referrals, leads, 
departing brokers' accounts and initial public offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a long hard fight, and we are pleased to see,  
for the first time, Merrill is acknowledging that in fact there 
were legitimate claims and there was mistreatment of women at the 
firm,'' said Linda Friedman, a plaintiff lawyer for with Stowell &AMP; 
Friedman in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch, however, found the remaining two-thirds of the  
complaints did not have the information to ``support the 
allegations made in the claims,'' according to the memo, which was 
signed by Launny Steffens, vice chairman of the New York-based 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Those 600 women have 90 days in which to request mediation,  
after which, if they are still not satisfied with the outcome, can 
request a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The closely watched case is helping change the way  
discrimination cases are handled on Wall Street. Until recently, 
nearly all cases were handled through industry arbitration -- a 
system criticized as biased in favor of companies because most of 
the arbitrators were men. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, Merrill Lynch became the first Wall Street  
firm to end mandatory arbitration for civil rights claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch is making other changes too. ``We have recently  
put into place a variety of initiatives intended to foster success 
and fairness, including new policies for account distribution and 
leaves of absence,'' Steffens wrote in the memo. ``We will be 
announcing more initiatives shortly.''

<HEADLINE> Pantani Barred From Tour of Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADONNA DI CAMPIGLIO, Italy (AP) -- Marco Pantani was barred from  
the Tour of Italy Saturday, two stages from his second consecutive 
triumph, after tests showed unusually high levels of red blood 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The high counts can signal the use of the banned growth hormone  
EPO, but also can occur naturally. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian television quoted the team as saying dehydration and the  
high altitude of Friday's leg of the race might be responsible for 
Pantani's reading. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantani, leaving his hotel two hours after the 21st stage of the  
Giro had started without him, said he could not understand what had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry for cycling ... but there is something strange in  
this affair,'' the 29-year-old Italian said, saying a blood test 
Friday night showed no irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This morning, I had a bitter surprise,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Tg2 quoted him, off-camera, as saying he might retire.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have restarted after serious accidents ... but this time my  
morale has really hit the bottom,'' Pantani said when asked about 
the question of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	International Cycling Union doctors performed the tests on  
Pantani and other cyclists hours before the start of the 21st stage 
of the cycling marathon. The top 15 competitors in overall 
standings were reportedly tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantani's count was red blood cell count 52, Italian media said.  
The UIC maximum is 50. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Pantani was prevented from starting in the leg and  
barred from competing for 15 days, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the law. We had to stop him,'' Hein Verbruggen, head of  
the UIC, told Italy's ANSA news agency. ``It's a hard blow for 
cycling because the No. 1 has been hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All competitors had been tested before the start of the race in  
Agrigento, Sicily, last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Two unheralded cyclists, Nicola Loda and Javier Ochoa Palacios,  
were stopped by UIC doctors then because of high red blood cells 
count. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantani, one of the best world climbers, had virtually clinched  
the Tour of Italy on Friday by winning his fourth stage at this 
resort in the Dolomite mountains, extending his lead by more than 5 
1-2 minutes over the closest rival, Paolo Savoldelli. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's stage started without the pink jersey since  
Salvodelli, the new leader, refused to wear it. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the events of Saturday ``the worst thing that could  
have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Savoldelli now holds a 34-second lead over compatriot Ivan  
Gotti, the 1997 Giro winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantani had won both the Giro and the Tour of France last year --  
the latter rocked by a doping scandal that took the prestigious 
French race to the brink of suspension.

<HEADLINE> Mich. St. Stars Plead Not Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan State University basketball stars  
Mateen Cleaves and Antonio Smith pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor 
charges of larceny. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair were formally charged Friday in connection with  
stealing a 40-ounce bottle of beer from an East Lansing 7-Eleven. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've waived arraignment and the next step is the pre-trial,''  
their attorney, Brian Jeffries, told the Lansing State Journal 
after submitting their waiver forms Friday morning in East Lansing 
District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The players did not appear in court.  
</P>
<P>
	The arrest warrants were issued Wednesday -- seven weeks after  
police pulled over the two players who led the Spartans to the 
Final Four in the NCAA Tournament this year, Michigan State 
University's first trip since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Their vehicle matched the description of one reportedly involved  
in a store theft about 2 a.m. on April 14. Smith was arrested on 
two traffic warrants that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingham County Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III said it took seven  
weeks to issue the other warrants because police needed time to 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves, a 21-year-old two-time All-American, and Smith, 23,  
face misdemeanor charges of larceny of property worth less than 
$200. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, accused of breaking open the 7-Eleven's cooler door lock,  
also faces a charge of malicious destruction of property. If 
convicted, the pair face up to 93 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Wednesday, Michigan State basketball  
coach Tom Izzo said he hadn't seen the complaint or the police 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my understanding that the matter will be dealt with in  
the courts and after the judicial process runs its course, I'll 
take appropriate action,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants in certain misdemeanor cases are allowed to file  
arraignment waivers and not appear in person, as long as their 
rights are communicated to them through their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	A date has not been set for the pre-trial conference.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves chose to stay at Michigan State University for his  
senior year next fall, passing up an opportunity last month to 
declare for the NBA Draft. Smith, the Spartans No. 3 career 
rebounder, completed his eligibility in March and some draft 
analysts project him as a possible second-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players are from Flint, Mich. and were captains during the  
1998-99 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Michigan State player, Jason Klein, was in the car with  
Smith and Cleaves when police pulled it over. No warrant has been 
issued for his arrest. Also in the vehicle was a female who was 
ticketed for underage drinking.

<HEADLINE> FAA To Enforce Crew Rest Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the Federal Aviation  
Administration told the American Airlines pilots union that the 
agency will begin strictly enforcing crew rest regulations by the 
end of the year, the union says. 
</P>
<P>
	That word Friday came three days after an American jet crashed  
on landing in Little Rock, Ark., at the end of a long day for the 
two-member cockpit crew, although the FAA said the stepped-up 
enforcement was not related to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, airline pilots cannot fly more than eight  
hours in a 24-hour period. They also must be able to rest for eight 
hours in that same span. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of the American crew, the pilots had been on duty  
13 1/2 hours, close to the airline's 14-hour duty limit and within 
three hours of when they would have had to start their FAA-mandated 
rest period. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots claim airlines routinely violate the tenor of the rest  
rules, especially with backup crews. They can be on standby status 
for days without being told when they should rest. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a reserve pilot might awaken at 7 a.m. and not be  
told until 8 p.m. of a flight assignment beginning at 10 p.m. The 
pilot might then be expected to complete his or her allotted eight 
hours of flying time over a 12-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
	In such a case, the pilot would be awake for 27 consecutive  
hours but should have had eight hours of rest within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of compliance has become an industrywide problem and  
a major cause of pilot fatigue that is seriously compromising 
aviation safety,'' said Capt. Richard Rubin, a spokesman for the 
Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's 9,600 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA announced in 1995 that it intended to resolve disputes  
over crew rest. It proposed a rule allowing up to 10 hours of 
flight time, but within a 14-hour duty day. 
</P>
<P>
	During ``duty'' time, crews may not be flying, but they may be  
at the airport, checking in for a flight or on a layover. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA proposal would have done three things: given airlines  
two more hours of flight time, given pilots unions a defined duty 
period and given passengers the benefit of having crews who receive 
a 10-hour off-duty period -- two hours more than the current rest 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Various factions balked at the proposal, and in February a  
rule-making body told the FAA there was no consensus within the 
aviation community on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey met with representatives of the  
Allied Pilots Association on Friday, and union officials said she 
told them the agency would announce its intention to enforce the 
existing rules next week and begin doing so at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials would say only that Garvey had met with the union.  
They referred reporters to a statement on the agency's Web site 
that said the FAA ``will soon place a notice in the Federal 
Register stating its intent to enforce the current regulations 
until a new proposed rule is developed and made part of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the statement was affected by the crash, FAA  
spokesman Eliot Brenner said: ``The meeting had been scheduled for 
at least two weeks.''

<HEADLINE> Missing Students' Bodies Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAVINGTON, Pa. (AP) -- Prosecutors say they plan to seek murder  
charges against two of three suspects already jailed for the 
disappearance of two college students, now that the victims' bodies 
have been found. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Aaron Land, 20, and Brian Muha, 18, were  
discovered in the woods Friday after a three-day search through 
swamps and waist-high grass along a highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were students at Franciscan University in  
Steubenville, Ohio, 15 miles west of here and a short distance from 
the Pennsylvania-West Virginia line. Police believe they were 
kidnapped Monday from their apartment during a burglary, robbed and 
shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the discovery of the bodies, Ohio authorities charged  
Terrell Rhaim Yarbrough, 18, of Pittsburgh and Nathan D. Herring, 
18, of Steubenville, Ohio, with kidnapping, burglary and robbery. 
Both were being held on more than $2 million bond. 
</P>
<P>
	A third suspect, 16-year-old Brandon Young of Steubenville,  
Ohio, was charged in juvenile court with receiving stolen property. 
He was held without bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said two of the three are suspected in the students'  
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury will now be asked to consider murder charges, said  
Stephen Stern, an Ohio prosecutor.

<HEADLINE> Citizenship Revoked Without Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Federal officials don't have to go to court  
before revoking an immigrant's citizenship for failure to disclose 
past crimes or arrests, says a federal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
overturns a judge's nationwide injunction last year that protected 
more than 4,500 naturalized citizens from administrative revocation 
of their citizenship by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein of Seattle said in her  
July 1998 ruling that the INS's authority to revoke citizenship 
without going to court was in serious question. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appeals court, in a 2-1 ruling, said a 1990 law that  
authorized the INS to grant naturalized citizenship contained the 
implicit power to revoke it. Before 1990, only the courts could 
grant or revoke citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan S. Franklin, a lawyer for the immigrants, said he would  
ask the full appellate court for a rehearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Citizenship is among a person's most cherished rights,'' he  
said. ``This is the first time any court has ever held that the INS 
may take that right away on its own, without going before a 
judge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	INS spokeswoman Elaine Komis said the agency had not seen the  
ruling and would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the immigrants face loss of citizenship for allegedly  
failing to disclose past arrests in their citizenship applications. 
Franklin said the INS has contended that virtually any arrest must 
be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, he said, one of the nine lead plaintiffs was  
arrested for investigation of possessing a marijuana plant that was 
actually a fern. Another was arrested on a minor charge, got the 
case dismissed and was told by the judge to treat it as if it had 
never happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional critics have accused the INS of lax citizenship  
testing that has allowed numerous criminals to slip through. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 1997 audit found errors in numerous cases, the INS  
identified more than 6,300 cases of possible fraud and had reviewed 
4,450 by the time of the injunction last July. Of those, revocation 
notices were issued in 2,722, and the other 1,908 were cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	The notices had led to final action in 61 cases, of which 16  
resulted in denaturalization and the rest were cleared or 
withdrawn, the INS said. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 1,900 cases still to be reviewed, a total of more  
than 4,500 are covered by Rothstein's injunction.

<HEADLINE> Implicated IOC Member Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye, an  
International Olympic Committee member implicated in the recent 
Salt Lake City bidding scandal, has died at 76. 
</P>
<P>
	The death was announced Friday by the IOC in a brief statement,  
which gave no details surrounding cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
	Guirandou-N'Diaye of the Ivory Coast was one of 10 IOC members  
issued warnings in the recent scandal. Six members were expelled 
and four more resigned in the scandal. Another died before the 
corruption allegations surfaced last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Guirandou-N'Diaye was given a ``serious warning'' by the IOC in  
March for accepting an airline ticket and gifts worth more than 
$4,200 from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Guirandou-N'Diaye, appointed to the IOC in 1969, was a former  
member of the powerful IOC Executive Board and a former IOC first 
vice-president. He was also president of the Ivory Coast Judo 
Federation and a vice-president of the International Judo 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Olympic Movement lost a good friend in Louis  
Guirandou-N'Diaye,'' IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch said in a 
brief statement. ``He was a force in the world of judo and a 
champion of sport in Cote d'Ivoire. We shall miss him.''

<HEADLINE> Crop Subsidy Changes Awaited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Producers and lawmakers are awaiting word from  
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman on sweeping changes he is 
considering in a crop subsidy program that has ballooned in size. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loan deficiency'' payouts occur when commodity prices drop  
below a so-called ``loan rate'' -- a predetermined price set by the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	These payments vary widely from county to county due to a number  
of factors, and Glickman wants the payments equalized, which could 
cost nearly $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got places in this country where you get an LDP of 30  
cents and you go 15 miles and get 70 cents,'' Glickman said in an 
interview. ``That's not fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pledged Thursday that a decision on whether to overhaul the  
payment system would come within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Created to ensure minimum crop income for farmers, the subsidy  
program kicked in last year when the Asian economic crisis and a 
worldwide grain glut caused U.S. prices to plummet. Farmers 
collected $2.89 billion for last year's crops under the program, 
and the 1999 cost will soar to nearly $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the 1996 farm bill was written, nobody really thought  
that LDP would turn out to do very much because people believed the 
market would go up forever and worldwide demand would go up 
forever,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today almost every farmer in America is getting an LDP  
payment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It rivals the Agriculture Department's largest program, the  
``market transition'' payments established in the 1996 farm law to 
wean producers off government support programs. That program cost 
the government $5.6 billion last year alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Commodity groups and members of Congress have criticized the  
Agriculture Department for what they call a rush to transform a 
complicated system. Many have accused USDA of being too secretive 
about the proposed changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not secrecy,'' Glickman said, arguing that lawmakers  
have been briefed all along and that some farm news services are 
``kind of whipping the issue up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact, however, is that we do have to ensure that we get  
the word out clearly,'' he said. ``I think if we do nothing, these 
same congressmen and senators who are asking us to slow down are 
going to get barraged this year from people who are treated in what 
they say is a discriminatory fashion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both USDA and the White House's Office of Management and Budget  
are reviewing the plan for a uniform, national rate structure. 
</P>
<P>
	The reasons for county-to-county variances are complicated: Each  
weekday, the department calculates both loan rates and prices for 
major commodities in every county in the nation. The amount of a 
loan deficiency payment is the difference between the loan rate and 
posted price on a given day. 
</P>
<P>
	Another major factor is the extra transportation cost the  
farther a county is from a terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department recently distributed examples using  
data from 10 dates over the past year comparing current rates with 
a proposed national rate. While the outlook for corn growers was 
rosy, according to that scenario, the picture for wheat producers 
wasn't so good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to work pretty good for us on spring wheat,  
but it looks like durum's going to get clobbered,'' said Lance 
Gabe, executive director of the North Dakota Grain Growers 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Average payments could go up for some but down for others, and  
``people don't want to be on the wrong side of the average,'' said 
Gabe, whose state rivals Kansas as the nation's leading wheat 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman said he is under enormous pressure from Corn Belt  
producers to equalize the loan rates, and it is farmers in those 
states -- Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Nebraska and parts of Kansas -- 
who likely would benefit the most. 
</P>
<P>
	But tentative analysis suggests no commodity would be worse off  
under a new system, the secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers I have seen show that by and large, no state  
suffers any material harm,'' said Glickman.

<HEADLINE> Crashed American Jet Dismantled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- American Airlines crews began  
dismantling the broken and charred shell of an airliner Saturday 
while mourners attended the first of several memorial services for 
the nine people killed in the crash of Flight 1420. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators hope that while moving the wreckage they  
will learn more about the mechanics of the plane's spoilers -- wing 
panels used to slow an airplane after landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the co-pilot has said he believes the captain set the  
spoilers, a flight data recorder indicates they never popped up 
when the plane landed in a severe thunderstorm Tuesday and skidded 
off the end of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane struck a steel walkway leading to landing approach  
lights, split apart and caught fire, killing Capt. Richard 
Buschmann and eight passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service was held Saturday in the small town of Royal,  
near Hot Springs, for James Harrison, 21, a Ouachita Baptist 
University student who was returning from a choir trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a service where we healed some of our hurt,'' said  
crash survivor and fellow student Misha Perkins, adding there were 
both tears and laughter during the private service attended by 
about 200. ``I know James is not worse off, we may be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said the 6-foot-5, 270-pound Harrison got into a line  
of people moving toward the exits, but stayed on the smoked-filled 
plane and helped at least two badly injured victims escape. 
</P>
<P>
	``He died the way he lived, helping others,'' said Bill Ellis,  
dean of arts and sciences at Ouachita Baptist. ``James could be 
alive today. He chose to help others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines is offering $25,000 checks to survivors of the  
deceased. The money comes with no conditions, meaning people can 
accept them without giving up their legal options. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators kept close watch as salvage crews used a crane to  
load the MD-82's two jet engines onto a flatbed trailer, and then 
prepared the plane's wings and fuselage for removal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are parts of the plane now that are obviously being  
covered by wreckage that we'd like to be able to get to when we 
lift the wreckage -- things we haven't yet seen,'' said Matthew 
Furman, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board. 
``We'll be looking at the cable and wires that are attached to the 
spoiler, trying to determine, if we can, what position they were in 
at the time of impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have said that the cockpit lever that sets the  
spoilers for landing was found in an unusual position. Also the 
mechanical checklist operated by First Officer Michael Origel 
displayed data for takeoff, instead of landing. 
</P>
<P>
	But NTSB lead investigator Greg Feith said both irregularities  
could have been caused when the plane crashed, potentially yanking 
cables that connect the cockpit lever to the spoilers and jumbling 
cabin controls including the checklist. The levers and other 
controls also could have been bumped during rescue efforts, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the spoiler issue, we want to be very cautious  
about the way we take those pieces over to where they are, so that 
we don't destroy any witness marks or any physical evidence,'' said 
NTSB member George W. Black Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators plan to run the jet engines and then disassemble  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators especially want to test the engines' thrust  
reversers, the engine-mounted devices which also help slow the 
plane. Flight data indicate that the reversers were turned on and 
off twice after touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The reversers usually remain engaged until a plane slows to a  
speed at which the pilot can safely steer it on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Origel said he saw the captain activate the reversers, shut them  
off, then activate them again. Origel, who was interviewed Friday 
by investigators, was released from the hospital on Saturday. He 
broke his leg in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the engines on an MD-82 are close to the fuselage,  
engaging the thrusters affects how well the pilot can control the 
rudder, and turning them off gives the pilot better control. But 
investigators said using the thrusters intermittently could affect 
a plane's deceleration.

	``I have always felt that the `reading' of a lyric by a singer  
is concomitant with the reading of good poetry. One doesn't rattle 
off the lines, singsong style, merely to serve the rhyming. The 
`reason,' the natural sense of the lyric lines, (is) of paramount 
importance, as far as I'm concerned.''

came. She turned toward me and said, `I mean it. I love you.' Then 
she was gone. I knew she did not mean `I love you' in any literal 
sense. She was in love with DiMaggio. She `loved' me for treating 
her like something more than a glossily packaged piece of meat. For 
taking the time to help make her look good in front of a large

<HEADLINE> Schulhofer Wins Another Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scotty Schulhofer trained his second Belmont  
Stakes winner in the 1990s on Saturday, although both victories 
will forever be overshadowed by injuries to the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Schulhofer's Colonial Affair won the Belmont, but the  
race was marred when Kentucky Derby winner Prairie Bayou broke down 
on the backstretch and was humanely destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	On another bittersweet Saturday at Belmont Park, Schulhofer's  
Lemon Drop Kid won the 131st Belmont as Charismatic, poised to 
become the 12th Triple Crown champion, sustained a career-ending 
injury -- a fractured left leg -- near the wire in finishing third. 
</P>
<P>
	``Naturally, I hate to see a horse get hurt,'' Schulhofer said,  
``You know I would feel much better if it hadn't happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even though it did, Schulhofer was proud of Lemon Drop Kid,  
who went off at odds of 29-1, and paid $61.60 on a $2 bet. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came over to the track great and I've said ever since we  
put him in training, he's been a nice horse,'' Schulhofer, who 
celebrated his 73rd birthday on May 30. ``We've never had a problem 
with him. He just needed a little time to get going and he peaked 
on the right day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid, who was ridden by Jose Santos, finished ninth in  
the Kentucky Derby, skipped the Preakness and finished third to 
Best of Luck in the Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont on May 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Schulhofer, inducted into racing's Hall of Fame in 1992, is one  
of New York's most respected trainers. He was credited with giving 
Julie Krone a chance to become a top rider, and she rewarded him by 
winning the '93 Belmont aboard Colonial Affair and becoming the 
first woman to win a Triple Crown race. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the '93 Belmont, Schulhofer was a not as confident  
sending Lemon Drop Kid against Charismatic, and other potential 
spoilers Silverbulletday, who finished seventh, and Menifee, who 
was eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Colonial Affair won, I was very confident,'' Schulhofer  
said. ``I told Julie to just wait and make your move. Yesterday, I 
was not as confident as I was today. I had a great feeling in the 
paddock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All week, Schulhofer has low-keyed his 3-year-old son of  
Kingmambo. But Lemon Drop Kid won for the fourth time in 11 career 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We finally got our race track, and got a good clean trip, and  
everything worked,'' Schulhofer said. ``In the Blue Grass, we 
didn't get much of a trip and in the Derby we got stuck outside. 
The Peter Pan was over a sloppy track and today it all came 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schulhofer, who grew up in Aiken, S.C., where his father owned a  
riding academy, has trained four Eclipse Award winners, including 
2-year-old colt champion Fly So Free in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Slams S. Dakota Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OGLALA, S.D. (AP) -- A tornado ripped through a small town on the  
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, smashing homes and killing at least 
one person. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister struck Oglala on Friday evening as violent  
thunderstorms rolled across the region of mostly open prairie in 
southwestern South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole house was vibrating,'' said Milo Sits Poor, who rode  
out the storm in a basement. ``A car that was parked out front 
started spinning in circles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Myrna Eagle Hawk said she hid under a mattress with her niece  
and nephew when the storm struck. ``The living room, one bedroom is 
demolished. The roof -- there is no roof,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 homes, a church and a church hall were destroyed and 50  
houses were damaged, said Gene Abdallah, superintendent of the 
state Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight people were taken to a Rapid City hospital, and about 20  
were treated in Pine Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Violent thunderstorms, baseball-size hail, high winds and at  
least four tornados rolled across the southern part of the state 
Saturday. No major injuries or damage was reported. 
</P>
<P>
	National Guard members were sent to Oglala and the town was  
evacuated for an hour Saturday night because of the bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Janklow flew to Oglala earlier in the day and said the  
most immediate need was finding temporary housing for people who 
need a place to sleep, eat and bathe. ``You'll have a lot of people 
that want to help,'' he told tribal officials. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 people had spent the Friday night in dormitories at  
the Pine Ridge High School. They were expected to spend Saturday 
night there as well. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night, the wind gusted to 70 mph west of Oglala near  
Oelrichs, and 2 to 3 inches of rain fell in an hour elsewhere in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago, on May 30, a tornado in eastern South Dakota wiped  
out the town of Spencer and killed six people.

<HEADLINE> NFL Suspends Leon Lett Indefinitely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Already uncertain about the health of star  
cornerback Deion Sanders, the Dallas Cowboys were dealt another 
blow from a familiar and troubling area. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon Lett, the Cowboys' Pro Bowl defensive tackle, was suspended  
indefinitely for violating the NFL's substance-abuse policy, his 
third suspension since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his first suspension lasted four games and the second  
lasted a year, team officials have remained hopeful the third 
suspension might not be as long. 
</P>
<P>
	The league would not say officially would not say how long Lett  
would be out. 
</P>
<P>
	But one NFL official said commissioner Paul Tagliabue would  
determine the length of Lett's suspension on several factors, 
including how often he has tested clean for drugs since his last 
suspension ended in November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll depend on the data he receives from the people  
monitoring (Lett's) progress,'' said the official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Aiello, the NFL's vice president of public relations, said  
recently that the drug policy is a balance between punishment and 
treatment and that, ``Penalties at this stage are tied to some 
extent to the cooperation of the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lett has been tested up to 10 times a month for the last two  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Dallas and Miami player, cornerback Clayton Holmes, was  
also found to have violated the NFL's drug and alcohol policy after 
serving a one-year suspension. He received a four-game suspension 
for the later offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett was unavailable for comment, and his agent, Jim Steiner of  
St. Louis, did not return several phone messages from The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys issued only a terse written statement declining  
comment because of confidentiality rules in the NFL's drug-testing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've said all we're going to say,'' club spokesman Rich  
Dalrymple said when reached at home Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett's suspension had been rumored for several weeks. It was  
announced quietly late Friday when the NFL placed him on the 
reserved suspended list sent to each club. 
</P>
<P>
	It is just the latest event to rock a team that won three Super  
Bowls in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, former Cowboy offensive lineman Mark Tuinei died of  
a heroin overdose while partying with backup fullback Nicky Sualua. 
</P>
<P>
	The agent for former Michael Irvin said last week that the  
former All Pro wide receiver would welcome a trade. Irvin is 
reportedly unhappy about his declining role in coach Chan Gailey's 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is the ongoing saga of the big toe on Sanders' left  
foot. Diagnosed as turf toe last season, Sanders waited until late 
April before having surgery, and no one knows whether he'll be 
ready for the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is believed to be trying to reduce Sanders' $8.2  
million salary cap cost, and the cornerback has acknowledged the 
club might release him if it can't restructure his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Cowboys open training camp next month, they will be  
thin at defensive tackle without Lett, a 6-foot-6, 300-pounder in 
his eighth year from Emporia State. Last season, he made 51 
tackles, four sacks, 20 quarterback pressures and a team-high seven 
tackles for losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett was suspended in 1995 after testing positive for marijuana  
and again in 1996 after testing positive for cocaine.

<HEADLINE> Rams Give Top Pick Holt $10M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Torry Holt gave himself a memorable 23rd  
birthday present Saturday, signing a five-year, $10 million 
contract with the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the money, which includes a $5.4 million signing  
bonus, the Rams threw in a chocolate cake at a news conference for 
their first-round pick. Holt, who caught 88 passes for 1,604 yards 
and 11 touchdowns his senior season at North Carolina State, blew 
out candles that had been lit by coach Dick Vermeil. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great birthday present for anybody that's 23 years old  
and come into the amount of finances I came into,'' Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's safe to say Holt's 22nd birthday was a lot less memorable.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I got a cake and a hug and a kiss from my girlfriend,  
and my family,'' he said. ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holt wasn't exactly acting like an instant millionaire, given  
his extremely modest plans for the big day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to relax,'' he said. ``I may go out and buy  
some jeans or something. Stay fresh, stay looking nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holt, the sixth overall pick, is the third first-rounder to  
sign. The others are running back Ricky Williams with New Orleans, 
and quarterback Tim Couch, the first overall pick, with the 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing reverses a trend for the Rams. The No. 1 pick last  
year, defensive end Grant Wistrom, signed on the eve of training 
camp. Two years ago, Orlando Pace, the first overall pick, missed 
all of training camp and in 1996 Lawrence Phillips sat until late 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I wanted to be a little special,'' Holt said. ``I  
wanted to go ahead and get things done, get that behind me. The 
team doesn't have to wonder, is he going to be here, or what he is 
doing, or is he selfish?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams never really had a worry there. Holt has been showing  
his dedication the last month, working out two hours a day at Rams 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil said it shouldn't be long before Holt is the equal of  
the Rams' other wideout, Isaac Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what Isaac can do when he's healthy, and I think this  
man has the ability to be his equivalent,'' Vermeil said. ``I don't 
know if it'll be his rookie year, but it'll be soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil said the signing was just another indication that the  
Rams, who are trying to end a string of nine straight losing 
seasons and were 4-12 last year, are a team on the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really feel we had an outstanding winter and spring,''  
Vermeil said. ``Moving into the summer and our final minicamp, all 
it does is keep the positive vibes moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The signing clears the decks for the Rams in their negotiations  
with newly-acquired running back Marshall Faulk. Faulk participated 
in the first minicamp last month after saying he wouldn't report 
until his contract was reworked, and may show up for the next 
minicamp next week if progress continues in talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Communications look good,'' Vermeil said. ``I can't tell how  
close they are, but I think we're in the same stadium.''

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Aims for Nighttime Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery and its crew  
streaked toward a rare middle-of-the-night landing Sunday following 
the first docking mission with the international space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery was scheduled to touch down on Kennedy Space Center's  
floodlighted runway just after 2 a.m., ending a journey of nearly 4 
million miles. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's space shuttles have landed in darkness only 10 times  
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of rain offshore, Mission Control waited until almost  
the last minute before giving the seven astronauts the go-ahead to 
fire the braking engines and come home. They cheered the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Commander Kent Rominger and his crew spent six of their 10 days  
in orbit at the new international space station. They left 2 tons 
of tools, water, clothes and other supplies for the first permanent 
crew, due to arrive next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Before departing Thursday, the astronauts also fixed a broken  
radio, replaced flawed battery packs, and made it quieter by 
installing mufflers over noisy fans. 
</P>
<P>
	This was only the second crew to visit the orbiting outpost. The  
first crew connected the station's two components in December. And 
it will be this December before shuttle astronauts arrive with more 
supplies. First, the Russians must launch their long-delayed 
service module; that's scheduled for November. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's astronauts briefly set aside their packing for  
Saturday morning's release of Starshine, a 19-inch sphere covered 
with 878 small, circular mirrors that were polished by 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	It's purely an educational project; more than 25,000 students  
around the world will track the sparkling satellite over the next 
seven to eight months and, in doing so, determine the density of 
the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Reminiscent of a 1970s disco ball, the $1 million Starshine  
twinkled as it popped out of a canister in the shuttle cargo bay 
and floated away. It quickly was spotted by observers on the ground 
with the naked eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a fantastic sight,'' said Canadian astronaut Julie  
Payette, who pushed the ejection button. ``The first thing we all 
saw was the flickering of the mirrors ... We could track it with 
our cameras for the longest time because it's now and then getting 
a flash. It's beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The project's director, Gil Moore of Utah State University, said  
the satellite should remain in orbit until January before it 
plunges through the atmosphere and burns up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We invite everybody in the world to track this thing,'' Moore  
said. ``This is not just for kids. It's for students of all ages.''

<HEADLINE> Yagli Wins Belmont Stakes Undercard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yagli made a triumphant return to the race track  
on Saturday, sweeping past Middlesex Drive in the deep stretch to 
win the $300,000 Manhattan Handicap on Belmont Stakes day. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third of four stakes races leading up to Charismatic's  
bid for the Triple Crown in the Belmont, Yagli made a strong move 
at the top of the stretch and won by 2 1/2 lengths over Federal Trial, 
with Middlesex Drive another neck back. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Yagli's first start since Feb. 6, when the 6-year-old  
trained by Hall of Famer Bill Mott won the Gulfstream Park 
Breeders' Cup Handicap. Mott elected to give Yagli a rest as he 
prepares his horse for the Breeders' Cup Turf in November at 
Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagli covered 1 1/4 miles on the inner turf course in 1:58 2-5,  
giving jockey Jerry Bailey his fourth victory on the undercard 
leading to the Belmont. He was aboard Silverbulletday in the 
Belmont Stakes. The winner, who went off at 2-5, returned $4.30, 
$2.90 and $2.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagli won for the ninth time in 19 career starts and earned  
$180,000 for owner Allen Paulson. Bailey also won aboard Dance 
Master in the first race, Durmiente in the third and Yes It's True 
in the $150,000 Riva Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	In the $150,000 True North Handicap, 26-1 longshot Kashatreya  
overtook favored Artax in the stretch. The winner returned $55, 
$13.80 and $7.10. Artax was second, and The Trader's Echo third. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes It's True held the lead through the stretch and beat Lion  
Hearted by a length in the Riva Ridge, giving trainer D. Wayne 
Lukas his second win of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Owned by Padua Stable, Yes It's True made his first start since  
a victory three weeks ago in the Maryland Breeders' Cup Handicap on 
Preakness day, a race in which a crazed fan walked onto the track, 
tried to punch at a few horses, including Artax, and nearly was 
trampled as the horses narrowly avoided him in the stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes It's True, the 3-5 favorite in the 10-horse field, covered  
seven furlongs in 1:22 1-5 and returned $3.50, $2.90 and $2.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Cozy Blues, a 10-1 shot, won the $150,000 Just A Game Breeders'  
Cup by a neck over UR Unforgetable. The winner, trained by James 
Bond, paid $21.40, $8.90 and $6.20, and covered a mile in 1:33 1-5.

<HEADLINE> Springer Appears at Chicago Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- To hear Jerry Springer tell it, he's been doing  
the country a favor by televising violence in all its unattractive 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody watches our show and thinks, 'Wow, that's behavior that  
I think everyone's going to love,''' Springer said Friday at a City 
Council committee hearing. ``You do away with that and we'll go 
back to violence on television being totally sanitized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer came to City Hall to answer aldermen's questions about  
``The Jerry Springer Show,'' and the rowdy guests the 
Chicago-produced program tends to attract. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer admitted there have been some staged incidents during  
the show's eight-year run. But ``overwhelmingly, the show is 
real,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderman Ed Burke, a former policeman, has said that if the  
violence is real, off-duty Chicago police officers who work for 
Springer should cuff guests who get out of hand and haul them off 
to jail. If it's fake, he says Springer should get an entertainment 
license. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes vague, sometimes defiant, Springer held court amid  
cheering fans, hissing opponents and a block of as many as 20 TV 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew applause when he objected to some of Burke's questions,  
including one about how much money he makes. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's none of your business,'' Springer replied.  
</P>
<P>
	When questioned about his producers allegedly bringing a banned  
felon into the country to appear on the show, Springer chose not to 
answer, saying, ``I've never been a member of the Communist 
party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's beautiful,'' yelled Jim Birmingham, a retired city  
worker and Springer fan who came to watch the hearing. ``Do it some 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though threatened with a subpoena, Springer came to the hearing  
voluntarily. But he said he thought the panel should be 
concentrating on more serious matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of difference in the violence that happens on  
the streets of Chicago and the roughhousing that takes place in our 
studio,'' Springer said, likening the fights on his show to brawls 
at a hockey game. 
</P>
<P>
	He said guests were free to file complaints against one another.  
The off-duty officers also have the discretion to make arrests -- 
and have done so on rare occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the syndicated show's distributor issued an order  
forbidding fights and replaced some scheduled episodes with tamer 
shows -- an agreement that Springer has already reneged on once. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Michael Pfleger, a Catholic priest who prompted the  
committee to take up the matter, said he plans to hold distributor 
Studios USA Network to that promise. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the aldermen tabled a resolution that would force  
officers to make arrests if real violence erupts. Alderman Dorothy 
Tillman called the hearing a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really sat here and tried to turn it into `The Jerry  
Springer Show,''' Tillman told her colleagues. Then she turned her 
comments to Springer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry, through it all, you won.''

<HEADLINE> Singer Mel Torme Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mel Torme, the jazz and pop singer whose warm  
vocals earned him the unwanted title ``the Velvet Fog,'' and the 
co-writer of the Christmas classic that celebrates ``chestnuts 
roasting on an open fire,'' died Saturday. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Torme, who had suffered what was described as a mild stroke in  
August 1996, died of complications from that stroke after being 
rushed from his Beverly Hills home to University of California, Los 
Angeles, said his publicist, Rob Wilcox. 
</P>
<P>
	Torme's wife, Ali, and five children were at his side when he  
died, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Torme received a lifetime achievement award from the National  
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences at February's Grammy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his singing and prolific song-writing, Torme's career  
included acting in movies and on television, where he drew fresh 
attention in the late 1980s on ``Night Court'' as the musical hero 
of main character Judge Harold T. Stone, played by Harry Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a very special talent, one of the most talented  
individuals in our business,'' said singer Vic Damone. ``A 
composer, musician, arranger. He was so very bright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the supreme jazz singers of all time, with the  
vocal dexterity matched only by Ella Fitzgerald. He had the best 
sense of timing and a lot of heart in his work. And he was a good 
guy,'' said singer Jack Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lost a wonderful friend,'' said comedian Jerry Lewis.  
``There could never be anyone to replace Mel, not only as a singer 
but as a dear friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even people who had heard little of his singing could not miss  
his other claim to musical immortality: He was co-author of the 
lyrics and music to ``The Christmas Song'' -- ``Chestnuts roasting 
on an open fire, Jack Frost nipping at your nose.'' The song was a 
huge hit for Nat ``King'' Cole in 1946 and has been recorded by 
countless other singers, including Torme himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Torme, who began his singing career on radio at age 4, preferred  
jazz singing to the crooning that brought him his nickname. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really wasn't until the end of my high school days, in  
1943, that I determined to be a jazz singer,'' he says. ``Then I 
got sidetracked. (His manager) felt the way to the gold was for me 
to become a crooner. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long period I was singing mushy, sentimental songs. I  
began to be called the Velvet Fog. I never liked it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was rescued by a recording executive who heard a bit  
of jazz in his style and urged him in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
	He saw his vocal career as a work in progress, ``a long learning  
curve.'' Listening to recordings in a box CD set on his career, he 
said: ``The early songs are kind of callow. I cringe a little bit 
at them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was his own arranger for much of his career, played piano and  
other instruments, acted in a few Hollywood films, had a TV talk 
show for a while in the '50s, and had his occasional appearances on 
``Night Court,'' where Judge Stone kept a photo of Torme in his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	He was nominated for a best supporting actor Emmy in 1956 for a  
role in ``The Comedian,'' a Playhouse 90 production. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote some 300 songs, more than half, including ``Born To Be  
Blue'' and ``The Christmas Song,'' with Robert Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	When people would ask why he kept singing old songs, Torme said  
they're simply better than new songs: ``When young rock singers 
began writing their own, they displaced the community of 
songwriters who worked with grace, wit, charm, intelligence and 
brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely the lyric to me is 95 percent of what a song is.  
The singer is portraying a playlet to the audience, involving the 
audience in what he is saying. If the melody is attractive, that's 
frosting on the cake. The lyric is the cake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 70, he said he maintained his vocal strength by taking care  
of himself: no smoking, only an occasional glass of wine, careful 
avoidance of drafts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I sing I force myself to have seven or eight hours of  
sleep. I can sing acceptably well on six hours. There is that 
little grade of difference between six hours and eight hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1994 concert at Carnegie Hall, he joked about his age. In  
``You Make Me Feel So Young,'' the 68-year-old Torme sang: ``You 
know that age is just a number,'' then interjected ``If I could 
really believe that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torme is survived by his wife and five children -- Steve,  
Melissa, Tracy, Daisy, and James. 
</P>
<P>
	Memorial services were not immediately announced.

<HEADLINE> Release Handle in Trunks Recommended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There should be a handle inside car trunks  
that would allow children who inadvertently lock themselves inside 
to escape, a government-appointed panel says. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to prevent the deaths of children, the panel recommended  
all new cars have a release mechanism inside the trunk by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration created the  
panel to study the problem because 11 children died last year after 
accidentally locking themselves into trunks in the extreme summer 
heat, often while playing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expert Panel on Trunk Entrapment, composed of  
representatives from industry, medical and consumer groups, also is 
encouraging automakers to voluntarily develop kits for trunk 
release handles for cars already on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the panel's other recommendations, outlined in a report  
obtained by The Associated Press: 
</P>
<P>
	--Educational outreach to parents so children understand the  
trunk is not a safe place to play. 
</P>
<P>
	--Trunk safety information on warning labels and owners manuals  
in cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Several automakers have taken steps to make trunk handles  
available. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. has a trunk-release kit at dealerships that  
can be installed as optional equipment. GM's yellow handle is 
illuminated in the dark cargo area. There is a separate mechanism 
for the trunk latch to prevent the trunk from shutting unless an 
adult manually resets it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. will have a T-shaped handle that glows inside the  
trunk as a standard feature on its 2000 models. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1970, 1,175 people have been victims in 992 trunk  
entrapments -- mostly adults locked in by criminals or children who 
unintentionally locked themselves in, according to the panel study. 
At least 260 people have died. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of the deaths involved a violent abduction, the  
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel asked criminology experts whether criminals might  
become more violent toward victims if they knew there was a trunk 
handle. The study concluded ``criminal behavior could not be 
predicted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The panel therefore concluded that its focus should be on  
preventing unintentional entrapments, particularly in the case of 
children,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Janette Fennell, head of the San Francisco-based Trunk Releases  
Urgently Needed Coalition, said handles must be mandatory because 
getting trapped in a trunk is a serious problem, but people do not 
prepare for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody thinks it's going to happen to them,'' said Ms.  
Fennell, who was robbed and stuffed in a trunk at gunpoint along 
with her husband in 1995. ``It's rare to get out of a trunk without 
problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They managed to escape after they dug into the trunk's  
upholstery and found the release cable. However, Ms. Fennell said 
25 percent to 30 percent of the victims entrapped in trunks are 
seriously injured, mostly because of extreme temperatures and lack 
of ventilation.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Attendants Allow Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Northwest Airlines flight attendants, who  
have been without a contract since 1996, voted overwhelmingly 
Saturday to authorize their union to call a strike if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from Teamsters Local 2000 in Detroit counted  
8,735 ballots, about 93 percent of eligible voters, said Danny 
Campbell, the local secretary-treasurer. Only 49 flight attendants 
voted against strike authorization, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen it coming for a long time. Our employees went  
through three years of pay cuts and have been at the bargaining 
table for three years,'' Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest spokesman Jon Austin said the vote was expected.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's very rare that there isn't such a vote in the negotiating  
process in this industry,'' Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, flight attendants said they would ask to be released  
from contract talks if they don't make progress during the next 
round of negotiations slated for this week. 
</P>
<P>
	If the National Mediation Board releases the attendants from  
talks, that would start a 30-day cooling-off period before a strike 
could begin. Northwest is recovering from a pilots' strike last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators for the Eagan-based carrier and its 11,000 flight  
attendants broke off talks in Washington on May 22 after the two 
sides disagreed over pay comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 2000 wants its  
members to receive pay comparable to that at Delta Air Lines, whose 
flight attendants are considered the industry's best paid. 
According to the Teamsters, Northwest doesn't want Delta's numbers 
used in the talks.

<HEADLINE> Tequila Tanker Springs a Leak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OPELOUSAS, La. (AP) -- When a tanker truck loaded with tequila  
sprang a leak, it was considered a hazard, not an opportunity to 
break out shot glasses and salt shakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who's going to Winn Dixie (supermarket) to get the limes?''  
joked Trooper John Dayries of the State Police Hazardous Material 
Unit. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 gallons was caught and disposed of safely between  
Thursday afternoon and Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``In bulk like this, it's a flammable liquid,'' Dayries said.  
``That's why we're taking all these precautions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A long discussion of whether the tequila was ready to drink or  
still raw never reached a conclusion. Nobody tasted it. 
</P>
<P>
	Some dripping continued. Friday morning, U.S. Customs officials  
supervised the tequila transfer into another tanker to complete the 
trip from Mexico to a Florida distiller. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck had stalled by some railroad tracks, Opelousas Police  
Lt. Mark LeBlanc said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it had kept bouncing down the road, it would have dumped a  
lot more product,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayries said the tank appeared to be cracked. He ticketed the  
owner, Reynolds Nationwide Inc. of San Antonio, for operating a 
leaking container holding a flammable liquid. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they give us any problems,'' he said, smiling, ``we'd  
confiscate it.''

<HEADLINE> Cities Preparing for Y2K Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With about 36,000 local governments in the United States,  
cities' and counties' preparations for possible Y2K computer bug 
problems are literally all over the map. 
</P>
<P>
	Take Lawrence, Kan., for example. The city of about 65,000  
people spent $200,000 upgrading its 911 emergency system, which 
would otherwise have failed. The city water supply should be fine, 
said Rod Bremby, assistant city manager, but if necessary it's 
small enough to operate manually, a luxury bigger cities with more 
sophisticated systems can't afford. 
</P>
<P>
	Big-city Portland, Ore., has many plans in the works, even  
organizing block leaders, possibly thousands of them, to address 
problems at a grassroots level. ``We're taking this seriously,'' 
Portland Mayor Vera Katz said. ``The purpose is not to raise a 
tremendous amount of concern, but to be prepared for an emergency. 
It doesn't mean it's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug occurs because computers programmed to recognize  
only the last two digits of a year may not work properly beginning 
Jan. 1, 2000, if the machines assume it is 1900. Some computers can 
be reprogrammed, but many have embedded microchips that must be 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Local governments need computers to operate traffic signals,  
dispatch police and fire fighters, run jails and maintain sewer 
systems. Computers are also used to run payrolls, track taxes and 
manage fleets of city vehicles. So, possible fallouts from the 
computer problem range from the grievous to the glitchy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our greatest domestic risks for Year-2000 related failures are  
at the local level,'' said John A. Koskinen, chairman of the 
president's council on Y2K. On May 24, he announced a series of 
``community conversations,'' town hall-like meetings aimed at 
sharing information between local businesses and governments, 
utilities and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, about the only thing localities have in common is  
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like to think that things will be fine,'' said Peter  
Jensen, spokesman for Environmental Services, a municipal agency in 
San Jose, Calif. ``But it's hard to guess what's really going to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult to know just what has been fixed and what  
needs to be fixed,'' said Victor W. Porlier, executive director of 
the Center for Civic Renewal in New York. He is the author of 
``Y2K: An Action Plan'' and a former information systems executive 
in the State Department's Agency for International Development. 
</P>
<P>
	Public water systems are a common worry for many of the cities  
surveyed by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation on water is very unclear,'' said Porlier. ``For  
instance, L.A. is three automated aqueducts from being a desert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, not quite, said Bob Gomperz, spokesman for the  
Metropolitan Water District of southern California. The three 
aqueducts could be operated manually if necessary. And the water 
system undergoes Y2K tests throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
	What needs to be fixed has been a priority on the federal level  
since at least 1997. But it's the cities and towns of America that 
could first face any digital dilemmas, and some say they are 
lagging. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can look at virtually every small town in America and  
discover they got a late start on Y2K,'' said Cathy Moyer, a 
cofounder of the Cassandra Project, an organization dedicated to 
fostering community readiness for Y2K problems. While many local 
governments are making good progress, she said, some are ``dragging 
their feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Burlington, Vt., acknowledges it got a late start on Y2K,  
having begun last summer. The city has only one employee dealing 
with the issue full time, but an ice storm in January 1998 gave the 
city plenty of practice if services were knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll make sure our emergency management plan is thoroughly  
updated. We'll have contingencies in place,'' said Bill Mitchell, 
as assistant to Mayor Peter Clavelle. ``For example, there is a 
possibility that someone's home heating system might fail. We have 
to have alternatives with temporary shelter available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- In Tucson, Ariz., Todd Sanders, city director of information,  
said the city was well on its way to evaluating and tallying the 
systems that need to be fixed. Emergency systems, 911, water and 
city payrolls are all in the final stages of remediation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, ``the assessment, the look, the review is continuing with  
all departments,'' he said. ``Nobody has declared victory and 
stopped dealing with the issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- San Jose, Calif., ground zero for technology, knows that not  
only its citizens are dependent on the city's efforts. In addition, 
high-tech manufacturing companies such as Intel, Cisco, Apple, 
National Semiconductor, Hewlett Packard and Sun Microsystems are 
betting that the lights come on come the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have critical factories, manufacturing environments going  
seven days a week,'' said Intel spokesman Bill Calder. His company 
is sending inspectors to local power, sewer and water companies to 
review their Y2K plans. ``We must make sure that all of their 
systems are ready. We count on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Dayton, Ohio, has a staff of 48 full-time workers looking at  
the city government's computer systems, and has already replaced 
its mainframe systems. Now, said William Hill, the city's director 
of information and technical services, technicians must test the 
city's computer servers, then each of the 1,500 to 2,000 individual 
terminals and PCs, and then the software installed in each. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mobile, Ala., started working on the Y2K problem in 1995 and  
plans to spend $6 million on its efforts. But mayoral aide 
Christopher Lee, who is in charge of Y2K compliance, said the city 
of 200,000 won't start verifying all its repairs until September, 
which some experts consider tardy. The local water company, which 
has endured hurricanes, installed backup generators on new pumps 
about two years ago to ensure continued water pressure in the event 
of disaster or power failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can handle hurricane recovery, we can work through  
this,'' said Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In New York City, most of the 400-odd priority systems are Y2K  
compliant, said Jerome Hauer, director of the office of emergency 
management. The deadline for everything to be ready is July 1. 
Starting in late summer, the city will begin a mammoth public 
outreach campaign to neighborhoods and citizens' groups. New York 
started work on the problem in September 1996, the mayor's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Portland, Ore., officials have drafted plans to organize the  
city's 200,000 households under neighborhood leaders trained to 
head off problems. The details are still up in the air. But one 
idea discussed early on has been scaled back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to go door to door and organize every  
household in the city,'' said Richard Hofland, Portland's Y2K 
project manager. ``If people want to do that, we're going to 
support them in that. That's just one of the options.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates Manager Not Angry in Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- When Gene Lamont returned to Comiskey Park for  
the first time since being ungraciously dumped four years ago, he 
didn't choke up or get nostalgic. 
</P>
<P>
	He simply turned right.  
</P>
<P>
	Comiskey is just another ball park to the Pittsburgh Pirates'  
manager now. Just another visitors' clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of old news now,'' Lamont said. ``It's a matter of  
turning right instead of left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lamont is back at Comiskey this weekend for the Pirates'  
three-game series with the White Sox. It's not the first time he's 
been back to Chicago, having been to Wrigley Field for several 
games. It's not even the first time he's faced his former team, 
thanks to two years of interleague play. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is his first trip to the South Side since June 2, 1995,  
when he was rewarded for three winning seasons and a division title 
by being fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to Gene,'' said Frank Thomas, one of just three White  
Sox players left from Lamont's days. ``He's a good friend of mine. 
I really loved him as a manager. That was one manager I hated to 
see go. He was such a good man and we played really well for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not well enough for White Sox management, though. And certainly  
not soon enough after Chicago had shelled out big bucks in hopes of 
keeping the AL Central from the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The White Sox were 247-190 in Lamont's first three seasons and  
won the AL West in 1993. They also were in first place in the AL 
Central when the players' strike shut down the season in August 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the strike-delayed 1995 season finally began, Chicago  
started a disappointing 11-20. Lamont, the AL manager of the year 
two years earlier, was fired and replaced by Terry Bevington, one 
of his assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a lot of respect for him. He was my manager when I  
had some really big years,'' Thomas said of Lamont. ``It was the 
high point when he was the manager here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the White Sox haven't been the same since. They finished 32  
games behind Cleveland in 1995, and 14 1/2 games back the next year. 
They threw a bunch of money at Albert Belle in the offseason, and 
still couldn't catch the Indians in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Bevington was fired at the end of the 1997 season, and the White  
Sox embarked on a youth movement. They finished nine games out last 
year and then let Belle and Robin Ventura go during free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago is still trying to find its identity this season. With  
the second-youngest team in the majors, the White Sox are hovering 
just below the .500 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamont, meanwhile, is running one of the hottest teams in  
baseball despite one of the league's lowest payrolls. The Pirates 
have a seven-game winning streak. They're five games above .500 for 
the first time since the end of 1992, when Pittsburgh lost the NLCS 
to Atlanta in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to keep building,'' Lamont said. ``It's been a chore  
to get over .500.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got a little help from his old team Friday night. Jason  
Kendall snapped a tie with a two-run single in the 11th inning and 
Warren Morris followed with a three-run homer to lift the Pirates 
to a 6-3 victory over the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, there was no extra satisfaction,'' Lamont said. ``We were  
just happy to win.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Raids Office of Don King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The federal probe into whether the  
IBF sold rankings and arranged fights for kickbacks has spread to 
Don King's corporate office. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all nonsense. They can look at all the documents they  
want,'' Don King said Saturday in a statement released by spokesman 
Greg Fritz. ``Had they asked for (the documents), I would have 
given them to them. I have nothing to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents with empty boxes raided the offices of the boxing  
promoter Friday looking for records involving the International 
Boxing Federation, Don King Productions and Monarch Productions, a 
company run by King's son, Carl, a boxing industry source told The 
Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury in Newark, N.J., has been investigating the  
IBF for several months -- even before the disputed draw in March 
between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, which prompted New York 
law enforcement agencies to start their own investigations of the 
IBF. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI would not confirm the raid at King's office in Deerfield  
Beach, about 40 miles south of West Palm Beach, was linked to the 
IBF investigation or if the search would be completed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can tell you is we are serving search  
warrants on his offices as part of an ongoing investigation,'' FBI 
spokesman Mike Faregas said. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for IBF president Bob Lee Sr., said Friday he knew  
nothing about the FBI raid and refused to say what he knew about 
King's possible involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 18, the Los Angeles Times quoted boxing promoters and  
managers as saying the sport's sanctioning bodies sometimes sell 
the rankings that lead to more lucrative bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported that witnesses have testified before the  
federal grand jury in New Jersey that some payments to the 
sanctioning bodies were made in cash, but that others were less 
obvious, such as those contained in overpayments of standard fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, HBO president Lou DiBella denied King's  
assertion that a rematch was set between Evander Holyfield and 
Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	And sources close to the negotiations, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said one of the stumbling blocks was the possibility 
King could be indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	DiBella said there were ``some problematic issues that need to  
be worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HBO has insisted King step aside as the fight promoter if he is  
indicted on charges stemming from a number of investigations, 
sources close to the negotiations told the AP. So far, King has 
refused such a clause in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in Newark, federal grand jurors have subpoenaed all  
IBF records since 1982 on rankings and contracts for fights, as 
well as checks, invoices, expense forms and telephone records, its 
attorney has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors, citing grand jury secrecy, will not  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Krovatin, the lawyer for Lee, said he does not want to  
give ``any sort of credibility'' to rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boxing itself seems to be a sport that is awash in rumors and  
innuendo and false allegations and rivalries and jealousies and 
paybacks and those sorts of things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF and two other sanctioning groups -- the World Boxing  
Association and World Boxing Council -- set rules and rankings that 
play a large role in determining bouts. Boxers who defy the groups 
risk losing the chance at title bouts and large purses.

<HEADLINE>  Astronauts Get Ready for Trip Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- Discovery's astronauts today packed  
up the space shuttle for their return trip home and completed one 
last task: the release of a mirrored satellite to be tracked by 
students around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle is due back at Florida's Kennedy Space Center around  
2 a.m. EDT Sunday. It would be only the 11th time in 94 flights 
that a space shuttle has returned in darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning the seven astronauts stowed gear and inspected  
Discovery's systems to ensure everything was in working order for 
landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian astronaut Julie Payette then ejected the Starshine  
satellite from the shuttle cargo bay. The 19-inch sphere, covered 
with 878 circular mirrors that were polished by schoolchildren, 
sparkled like a disco ball as it shot out of Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing we all saw was the flickering of the  
mirrors,'' Payette said. ``It was glittering, and then the ball 
just went off. It's beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of students from 18 countries will track Starshine  
over a six-month period, measuring the time it takes to orbit the 
Earth. By year's end it will plunge through the atmosphere and burn 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite deployment capped a busy 10-day mission.  
</P>
<P>
	Discovery became the first shuttle to dock with the  
international space station when the two spacecraft linked up early 
Saturday. That night, astronauts Tamara Jernigan and Daniel Barry 
conducted an eight-hour spacewalk to attach tool bags and cranes to 
the outside of the outpost. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew ventured inside the station Sunday evening to begin  
unloading 2 tons of supplies for future residents, ranging from 
water and clothes to laptop computers. The astronauts also made 
electronic repairs and installed mufflers to reduce noise from 
clattering fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery unlatched itself from the space station Thursday  
evening. NASA's next trip to the outpost is scheduled for December.

<HEADLINE> Gay Philanthropist Named Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The controversy over the new U.S.  
ambassador to Luxembourg looms larger than the tiny country. 
</P>
<P>
	James C. Hormel, appointed to the post Friday by President  
Clinton, has been dean of the University of Chicago law school and 
has built a reputation as one of San Francisco's most generous 
philanthropists. But Hormel, who has diplomatic experience, is 
likely to be remembered less for his diplomatic skills than as the 
nation's first openly gay ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's appointment, made while the Senate was in recess,  
angered Catholics and religious conservatives by bypassing senators 
who had held up Hormel's nomination since October 1997. They fear 
that Hormel, who used part of his family's Hormel food fortune to 
help create the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and 
lesbian political group, will promote a radical agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights opposes  
Hormel because he has refused to condemn the Sisters of Perpetual 
Indulgence, an irreverent group of habit-wearing drag queens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the man's sexual orientation, but his record of  
anti-Catholic bigotry,'' said William Donohue, president of the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Others, however, acknowledge that sexual orientation is the  
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that by forcing Americans to be represented by a  
radical homosexual activist like Hormel, Clinton is showing his 
contempt for traditional morality, marriage, sexual fidelity and 
any concept of honor,'' said Robert Knight with the Washington, 
D.C.-based Family Research Council, a religious lobby. ``Who's he 
going to appoint next? Larry Flynt as ambassador to the Vatican?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel, 66, who twice was named to U.S. delegations to the  
United Nations, made few public comments during the long nomination 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hardly view myself as a 'radical,''' he wrote to Sen. Gordon  
Smith, R-Ore., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1996 he described himself as a mentor to homosexuals,  
``part elder statesman for a constituency that is still in its 
adolescence in terms of experiencing its wisdom and empowerment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel's friends call him charming and funny, a good listener  
and a consummate host. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a real sense of foreign relations, always has,'' says  
Alice Turner, who was married to Hormel from 1955 to '65. ``He is 
extraordinarily well-qualified -- overqualified -- for this 
appointment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel's nomination cleared the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee in 1997 and secured bipartisan Senate support. Officials 
in Luxembourg, where 97 percent of the population of 425,000 is 
Catholic, said it would welcome Hormel as ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who has compared  
homosexuality to vices such as kleptomania and sex addiction, 
refused to schedule a floor vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``On one hand, you have these anti-gay senators saying we don't  
need legislation to protect gays and lesbians but you have the 
United States Senate discriminating against someone because he's 
gay,'' says David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign. ``It was very 
un-American and unfair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends say that, far from being a radical activist, Hormel is a  
devoted family man, to his partner, Timothy Wu, and to his children 
-- four daughters and a son, and 13 grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father has better family values than most parents I know.  
He is very dedicated to his family,'' says James Hormel Jr., who 
moved to San Francisco to live near his father. ``Our family is 
different, yes, but it is extremely strong. We love each other very 
much.''

</P>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye, an  
International Olympic Committee member implicated in the recent 
Salt Lake City bidding scandal, has died at 76. 
</P>
<P>
	The death was announced Friday by the IOC, which gave no details  
about the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
	Guirandou-N'Diaye of the Ivory Coast was one of 10 IOC members  
issued warnings in the recent scandal. Six members were expelled 
and four more resigned in the scandal. Another died before the 
corruption allegations surfaced last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Guirandou-N'Diaye was given a ``serious warning'' by the IOC in  
March for accepting an airline ticket and gifts worth more than 
$4,200 from Salt Lake City bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Guirandou-N'Diaye, appointed to the IOC in 1969, was a former  
member of the powerful IOC Executive Board and a former IOC first 
vice-president.

 *Mel Torme    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mel Torme, the jazz and pop singer whose warm  
vocals earned him the unwanted title ``the Velvet Fog,'' and the 
co-writer of the Christmas classic that celebrates ``chestnuts 
roasting on an open fire,'' died Saturday of complications of a 
1996 stroke. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Torme received a lifetime achievement award from the National  
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences at February's Grammy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his singing and prolific song-writing, Torme's career  
included acting in movies and on television, where he drew fresh 
attention in the late 1980s on ``Night Court'' as the musical hero 
of main character Judge Harold T. Stone, played by Harry Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Even people who had heard little of his singing could not miss  
his other claim to musical immortality: He was co-author of the 
lyrics and music to ``The Christmas Song'' -- ``Chestnuts roasting 
on an open fire, Jack Frost nipping at your nose.'' The song was a 
huge hit for Nat ``King'' Cole in 1946 and has been recorded by 
countless other singers, including Torme himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Torme, who began his singing career on radio at age 4, preferred  
jazz singing to the crooning that brought him his nickname. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long period I was singing mushy, sentimental songs,'' he  
says. ``I began to be called the Velvet Fog. I never liked it.''

 *Ernie Wilkins    	
</P>
<P>
	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- American-born composer and  
saxophonist Ernie Wilkins, who played with Count Basie, Dizzy 
Gillespie and Lionel Hampton, died Saturday of a stroke. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Ernest Brooks Wilkins Jr. in St. Louis, he got his big  
break in 1951 when trumpeter Clark Terry recommended him to Count 
Basie. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1950s, Wilkins joined Dizzy Gillespie's band, and  
later went on to write for Tommy Dorsey and Lionel Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Wilkins won wide acclaim for arranging and composing, he  
never lost his love for playing sax. In the 1960s, he and Terry 
recorded ``One Foot in the Gutter,'' which features a four-minute 
solo by Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins moved to Copenhagen in 1980 and started his own  
orchestra, ``Ernie Wilkins and his Almost Big Band.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also was guest conductor with several other bands. The list  
of musicians he worked with included Earl Hines, Sonny Rollins, 
Milt Jackson, Sarah Vaughn, Lena Horne and Quincy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins retired in 1991 after suffering a stroke.

<HEADLINE> Andre, Medvedev in French Open Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Andre Agassi strutted off court tapping his heart,  
a gesture to show he still has all the desire it takes to win a 
Grand Slam championship. 
</P>
<P>
	His passion for tennis had waned a few years ago, and his  
ranking plummeted, but on Saturday the old fire burned for everyone 
to see as he reached the French Open final. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven games in 24 minutes is all Agassi needed to deliver a  
quick knockout of Dominik Hrbaty, completing a rain-suspended match 
6-4, 7-6 (8-6), 3-6, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Now only Andrei Medvedev, ranked No. 100 but playing the best  
tennis of his own resurrected career, stands between Agassi and 
tennis history. 
</P>
<P>
	Medvedev has spoken all week about how his game is a reflection  
of his peace of mind now that he's in love again with the German 
tennis player Anke Huber. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to hear that,'' Agassi said. ``I prefer if he lets  
his girlfriend play for him instead, with all due respect to her 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Agassi said he doesn't believe the breakup of his  
marriage to actress Brooke Shields has made him more motivated or 
more focused in tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hate to give the impression that that's the case,'' he  
said, ``because that would mean that the beautiful years I shared 
with Brooke somehow interfered with my tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we constantly make choices in life. The choice that I  
made in my personal life was a very important personal decision. 
But the one I made with my tennis was also a very calculated 
specific decision, and that's just to continue maximizing the 
things I still feel I can accomplish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Agassi wins the French title Sunday he will complete a career  
Grand Slam and become the first man to win all four majors on three 
different surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four other men have won the four majors -- the Australian,  
French, Wimbledon, and U.S. Open -- but they did it when the 
tournaments were played on either clay or grass, not hard courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be an incredible achievement,'' said the 29-year-old  
Agassi, who also is bidding to become the first American to win all 
four since Don Budge in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi's trip to the final was threatened Friday when Hrbaty won  
six of the last seven games to take the third set and a 2-1 lead in 
the fourth. But rain gave Agassi a reprieve, allowing him to come 
back fresh on a dry day with the court more suitable to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi's kick serve was stretching the 21-year-old Hrbaty wide  
before the rain hit, and Agassi was able to dictate play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I play with a bit more spin than he does,'' Agassi said.  
``When the weather came, the court not only got a lot slower, but 
the balls got very heavy so my kick wasn't taking as well. It was 
kind of sitting up for him. So I wasn't getting the offense early 
in the point on my serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions started to favor Hrbaty's style of play, Agassi  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was glad to stop and wished we had stopped about 15 minutes  
earlier,'' Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
	When they came back Saturday, the court was dry and faster,  
perfect for Agassi. He pounced on Hrbaty and didn't relent. When he 
was done, Agassi tapped his heart in coach Brad Gilbert's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was taken directly from Jim Courier from the Davis Cup,  
the effort he put in and what he did,'' Agassi said. ``It means if 
I'm lacking anywhere, I'm not lacking here, in my desire and heart 
to win.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyers May Ease Partnership Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's largest lawyers' group soon will  
consider a major change in the face of American law practice, 
letting lawyers form partnerships with accountants, psychologists 
and other professionals. Such arrangements now are barred in all 50 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed ``one-stop shopping'' for people needing  
professional help has some lawyers worried about possible ethical 
pitfalls. An American Bar Association commission spent 10 months 
studying the misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 350,000-lawyer group's Commission on Multidisciplinary  
Practice will unveil its final report at a Tuesday news conference. 
People who have seen the report and asked for anonymity say it 
supports changing the ABA's model rules of professional conduct and 
ethical canons. 
</P>
<P>
	If the ABA's policy-making House of Delegates adopts the  
proposals in August, states would be asked to follow the 
association's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's really going to be ferment,'' Geoffrey Hazard, a  
University of Pennsylvania law professor and one of the 
commission's 10 members, told the Washington-based newspaper Legal 
Times. ``The whole issue is very controversial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier commission report stated: ``As the baby boomer  
generation ages, individual clients more than ever before need 
coordinated advice from lawyers, financial planners, accountants, 
social workers and psychologists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That report acknowledged that the existing prohibitions on  
lawyers forming partnerships or even sharing fees with nonlawyers 
are aimed at assuring loyalty to clients by insulating professional 
judgment from any third-party influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources said the commission's final report seeks to maintain the  
assurance by recommending that nonlawyers who practice with lawyers 
comply with the same confidentiality rules that now govern lawyers' 
relationships with their clients. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, which has both supporters and detractors among ABA  
leaders, is viewed by some as the legal industry's effort to beat 
back growing competition from giant accounting firms. The so-called 
Big Five firms have affiliated for years with consulting firms that 
hire lawyers to advise businesses and individual clients on taxes 
and other matters the ABA commission said are ``remarkably similar 
to those traditionally offered by law firms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In some nations, among them Britain and France, U.S. accounting  
firms lawfully offer legal services directly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rules that regulate lawyer conduct in some foreign  
countries permit various forms of lawyer-nonlawyer affiliations 
that are prohibited in the United States,'' an earlier commission 
report said. ``As a result, the Big Five accounting firms have 
vigorously entered the market for the delivery of legal services in 
those countries ... (and) have also significantly expanded their 
consulting services in the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Spurs Nearing Another Sweep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- For two rounds, the Portland Trail Blazers  
were the bullies of the West, shoving out Phoenix, then Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	In Round 3, big met bigger, tough met tougher.  
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio Spurs aren't pushed around by anybody. They are  
too big, too smart and way too together for that to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they have been beating all comers. After their 85-63  
thrashing of the Blazers on Portland's homecourt Friday night, a 
win Sunday would give the Spurs a sweep in the Western Conference 
finals and their first trip to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't wait to hit the floor tomorrow,'' Mario Elie said  
before the Spurs' practiced on Saturday. ``When you have a team 
down like that, you want to finish them off. You can't give them no 
hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	History says this series might as well be over. No team has come  
back from 0-3. And after they shot 25 percent on Friday night, with 
an NBA playoff-record-low 19 field goals, the Blazers didn't look 
like a team ready to make that kind of postseason history. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Portland coach Mike Dunleavy was trying to stay positive.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of young guys who aren't that far from the NCAA  
tournament,'' he said. ``That's the mentality we have to take, that 
it's a one-game elimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Dunleavy said, ``Just because it's never been done  
doesn't mean somebody can't do it for the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have dominated the postseason. They've won nine  
playoff games in a row and are 10-1 overall. They swept the Los 
Angeles Lakers and are on the brink of doing the same to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought we'd be 10-1 and on the verge of sweeping  
another team,'' Elie said. ``I mean, we're just on a major roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers were so sure they could beat San Antonio, especially  
after they played the Spurs so close in the first two games. Now 
they're singing the praises of the Spurs' unity and sense of 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem to have the will to win,'' Isaiah Rider said.  
</P>
<P>
	David Robinson just smiles that big smile when told of the  
Blazers' newfound admiration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the same way against the Lakers,'' he said, ``that  
slow, grudging realization. That's OK. In this league, you've just 
got to earn your respect. You've just got to go get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson reminded everyone on Friday just how important he is to  
his team. With Tim Duncan in foul trouble, Robinson took charge, 
especially on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. 50 is having a blast,'' Elie said. ``He's jumping around  
like a little kid. He's showing a lot of emotion. You can see the 
passion in his game, especially with that terrific defensive 
display he put on yesterday -- seven blocks and that didn't even 
count the shots he changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He saw when Tim went out it was his responsibility to lift the  
team and he did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers were left to ponder what would have been if Damon  
Stoudamire hadn't picked this week to spout off about his lack of 
playing time, if someone besides Rasheed Wallace could get some 
offense going, if Sean Elliott's 3-point prayer hadn't been 
answered at the end of Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Sean doesn't make that shot, it's a different series,''  
Rider said. ``Yeah, I'm shocked that we're down 3-0. I'm stunned. 
It's all about pride now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the way Elliott, Jaren Jackson and Avery Johnson are  
playing, there isn't much the Blazers can do defensively, Elie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a tough job. They double-team our big guys, and  
our other guys know down the outside shots,'' Elie said. ``Who 
knows what they're going to do tomorrow? If they play our outside 
guys, it gives Tim and Dave room to operate down low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one expects Duncan to have two bad games in a row.  
</P>
<P>
	``What's scary is Tim Duncan played 20 minutes and had five  
points,'' Elie said. ``He's disappointed. He's mad. I expect a big 
performance out of him. He feels he let the team down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach Gregg Popovich is especially pleased with Jackson,  
an NBA castoff who tied a team record with six 3-pointers on Friday 
night. Jackson has become a major weapon on the road. He also had 
big games in San Antonio's two road victories against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's played for about 19 teams but he's found a home here.  
He's comfortable here,'' Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire's outburst had an obvious effect on his game. After  
complaining about his lack of fourth-quarter playing time, 
Stoudamire was 1-for-12 Friday night and was roundly booed by the 
hometown fans. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all part of the learning experience good teams must go  
through to become title contenders, Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way you build a team is through trials and tribulations,  
going through some heartache and growing together,'' he said. ``It 
takes time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And time is running out for Portland. The Spurs are 5-0 away  
from home in the playoffs and have beaten the Blazers six times in 
a row.

<HEADLINE> Court: Do Not Call Attorneys `Babe' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Maryland's second-highest court has ruled  
that the word ``babe'' is not to be used in addressing female 
lawyers during legal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Special Appeals said Thursday the term is  
derogatory and evidence of gender bias. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling involved a deposition hearing in a 1994 lawsuit by a  
woman seeking damages from a lawyer she said had given her genital 
herpes. 
</P>
<P>
	As the woman, Betty Sue Aude, left the room, Alan Harris, who  
represented the defendant, joked that Ms. Aude was going to meet 
another boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Aude's lawyer, Susan Green, complained about the remark, and  
asked Harris: ``You got a problem with me?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I don't have a problem with you, babe,'' Harris said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Babe? You called me babe? What generation are you from?'' Ms.  
Green replied. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least I didn't call you bimbo,'' Harris responded,  
according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Green obtained an order prohibiting Harris and his client,  
who was eventually found to have negligently infected Ms. Aude, not 
to have contact with Ms. Aude or her family. Harris was also 
ordered to pay $1,500 to Ms. Aude's lawyers for time spent seeking 
the order. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've run into gender bias. However, I have never run into a  
situation where it has been so outrageous, so totally without 
provocation,'' Ms. Green said. ``Sometimes you've just got to say 
enough is enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 69, explained: ``It's just a way my generation speaks.  
There was no offense intended, and it certainly was not meant to 
gain any advantage. It was just in the casual course of 
conversation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court disagreed, ruling that Harris' behavior was a  
``crass attempt to gain an unfair advantage through the use of 
demeaning language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When used to address another attorney in the context of a  
discovery deposition or court proceeding, all of the ... 
definitions of the word `babe' are gender biased and derogatory,'' 
Judge Sally Adkins wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris said that despite the ruling, ``I'm not going to take the  
term out of my vocabulary. I have the right of free speech.''

<HEADLINE> Mia Hamm Deals With Celebrity Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- In another heady week for the U.S. women's  
soccer team, Mia Hamm found there was honor -- and humor -- in being 
the star. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm, the most famous women's player in the world, was due to  
have a massive building dedicated in her name at Nike's world 
headquarters in suburban Portland. So the day before, her team 
taped up signs around the hotel declaring the Mia Hamm Drinking 
Fountain, the Mia Hamm Supply Closet and the Mia Hamm Thermostat. 
</P>
<P>
	The ribbing provided relief for the group of 20 women who will  
face growing scrutiny as the favorites to win the third women's 
World Cup this summer. The U.S. team plays its first match June 19 
at Giants Stadium against Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's kind of this anxious excitement about it, and everyone  
can't wait to get started,'' Hamm said as the team prepared for 
Sunday's exhibition against Canada, its final World Cup tune-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm seems uncomfortable being the poster girl for women's  
soccer but gamely carries on. A national TV ad depicts her 
dribbling a soccer ball past Michael Jordan, and ends with her 
flipping the superstar over her shoulder in a textbook Karate move. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentiment -- women are just as competitive as men -- does more  
than just sell Gatorade. Hamm sees the World Cup as an opportunity 
for the United States to inspire women and girls, in this country 
and in others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always felt the potential of the sport was limitless, and I  
still think it is,'' she said. ``We've been role models since Day 
1, ever since we were in college. I think we just are now in a 
larger scale. So everyone's kind of taking this responsibility very 
seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm has talked of wanting to spend more time with her husband,  
Christiaan, and the rest of her family. But she said she hasn't 
decided what to do with her career after the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still want to play,'' she said. ``I'm looking at the (2000)  
Olympics, then after that who knows?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm played in the inaugural women's cup in 1991, which the U.S.  
team won, and in 1995, when the Americans finished third. Since 
taking the gold medal at the 1996 Olympics, the United States has 
steadily become the dominant team in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is 14-2-1 this season, with both losses coming to  
China, the top-seeded team in Group D. It is 8-1 in a 10-game 
``Road to Pasadena'' exhibition tour, outscoring opponents 37-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to think we're far and away the best in the world,''  
U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said. ``But there are other teams that are 
certainly capable of beating us on any given day and winning this 
World Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a 3-0 victory over Brazil May 22 in Orlando, Fla., Hamm  
scored her 108th career international goal, the most by any player. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States defeated Australia 4-0 Thursday in a  
closed-door game at Nike. DiCicco started eight reserves, with 
midfielder Kristine Lilly, defender Brandi Chastain and forward 
Tiffeny Milbrett the only regular starters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The object is to keep improving right through the World Cup,''  
DiCicco said of Sunday's match against Canada, which last lost its 
last 12 matches to the Americans dating to July 1986. ``So the most 
important thing now is to have a good game and stay healthy, and 
get three points June 19.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite rain in the forecast, about 25,000 fans are expected for  
Sunday's match, played at cozy Civic Stadium, the site where a 
frenzied crowd watch the U.S. men's team qualify for the World Cup 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The atmosphere's going to be somewhat similar to a World Cup  
game,'' said Milbrett, who with teammate Shannon MacMillan played 
at the University of Portland. ``It's going to be a rowdy crowd, 
it's going to be a pro-USA crowd. That's what we're going to count 
on in the World Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there's any pressure on the team, it didn't show it Friday  
during the dedication of the Mia Hamm Building, a 
450,000-square-foot behemoth that dwarfs the Michael Jordan 
building on Nike's sprawling campus. Hamm seemed speechless, and 
although she actually shed tears when talking about her teammates, 
she kept the mood light, matching co-captain and team jokester 
Julie Foudy's wit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I promised Julie I'd name a (bathroom) stall after her,'' Hamm  
said.

<HEADLINE> Throngs Rush To See High-Flying Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The excited audience clapped when Ethen Stiefel  
spun, one leg parallel to the stage, as a rather regal pirate in 
American Ballet Theater's ``Le Corsaire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was cheering when the exotic Vladimir Malakhov landed from  
his leaps. There was yelling, cheering and clapping when Jose 
Manuel Carreno scissored his legs in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience gasped at the intensity of Joaquin De Luz, who  
whipped his body fast across the stage, unpredictable and 
potentially dangerous as the pirate's friend. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, people are flocking to the Metropolitan Opera to  
see ABT's high-flying men. The word is that each night brings a 
dazzling male star. Often, as in ``Le Corsaire,'' four dance in a 
single performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The women in ``Corsaire,'' Julie Kent and Amanda McKerrow, are  
splendid, too. But the buzz this season is about the men. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the first time in Ballet Theater history they've  
had so many outstanding young men,'' says Clive Barnes, dance 
critic of the New York Post. ``The Paris Opera Ballet and Kirov can 
give ABT a run for the money but I don't think any company in the 
world has quite the depth of male dancers at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't clock how fast they go and they don't jump over a  
stick. But the human eye can see people are doing things no one has 
ever done before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Villella, a former star of the New York City Ballet and  
head of the Miami City Ballet, agrees that male ballet dancers are 
getting better. ``It's like in sports,'' Villella says. ``In the 
1950s people didn't run under 4 minutes in the mile. Now it's more 
a common idea than an extraordinary one. I think each generation 
feeds the next generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The revolutionary dancers Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov  
were models for today's outstanding male dancers, said 
choreographer Lar Lubovitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Bocca, 32, born in Argentina, has been thrilling ABT audiences  
for more than a decade. He joined in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Carreno, 30, is Cuban, and from 1993 to 1995 danced bravura  
roles in full-length ballets for the British Royal Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
	Corella, 23, from Madrid, fell during a rehearsal May 21 and  
injured a tendon, sidelining him. 
</P>
<P>
	Stiefel, 26, calls himself ``not the norm'' in the ABT. He's  
American. ``It's really an international company,'' he says. 
``Sometimes we joke and say Spanish or Russian is the company's 
first language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stiefel grew up near Madison, Wis. He and his older sister took  
gymnastics classes, and when she wanted to switch to ballet 
lessons, Stiefel went along. He joined the New York City Ballet at 
16 and six years later moved to ABT. 
</P>
<P>
	American boys often tease and deride a classmate who takes  
ballet class. It is the same in Spain and Italy, said Joaquin De 
Luz, born in Madrid, and Giuseppe Picone, from Naples. 
</P>
<P>
	De Luz's mother sent him and his brother to ballet school to  
keep them occupied. Spaniards, he says, consider ballet for girls 
only. 
</P>
<P>
	He attended every performance of an ABT season in Madrid, then  
got the money to go to America by winning a ballet competition in 
Budapest. He spent a year in the Pennsylvania Ballet before landing 
in ABT. 
</P>
<P>
	Picone had always wanted to dance, walking around on demi-pointe  
-- not putting his heel down -- at 8, before he even knew what ballet 
was. He left Italy at 16, where he says mothers send daughters to 
ballet classes to lose weight and boy dance students are made fun 
of. ``That's why I left.''

<HEADLINE> Wizards Eye Isiah Thomas As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Isiah Thomas appears to be the leading  
candidate for the Washington Wizards head coaching position. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Detroit Pistons guard and Toronto Raptors general  
manager has been involved in talks with Wizards owner Abe Pollin 
about the opening, according to Saturday's edition of the 
Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post reported that Thomas met with Pollin on Thursday, and  
had previously met with Washington general manager Wes Unseld. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old led the Pistons to NBA championships in 1989 and  
1990. After retiring, Thomas became the general manager and vice 
president of the Raptors from 1994-97 before taking a job at NBC as 
a commentator. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas addressed the issue at halftime of Friday night's  
Spurs-Trail Blazers game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm flattered and I'm honored that they would even consider me  
right now,'' Thomas said. ``We're just kind of dancing, but we 
haven't kissed yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas would replace Jim Brovelli, who took over the Wizards on  
an interim basis this past season after Bernie Bickerstaff was 
fired.

<HEADLINE> Meter Maid Forgets to Deposit Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A county employee who collected change from parking  
meters let the nickels, dimes and quarters pile up over four years, 
always putting off a visit to the bank until there was $150,000 
sitting in a storefront office. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing led to another,'' said Mayco Villafana, Miami-Dade  
County's communications director. ``She was going to get to it, but 
she didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Etta Jardine, a General Services Administration supervisor, told  
county officials she kept putting off depositing the money because 
of other duties and had no idea how much money was there. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Beaten Editor Says He Won't Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charges against two men accused of beating the  
former editor of the hip-hop magazine Blaze have been dropped 
because the journalist would not testify against them. 
</P>
<P>
	Deric ``D-Dot'' Angellettie and Anthony Hubbard, both 30, had  
been charged with assaulting Jesse Washington, 29, in his office 
last November. They could have gotten seven years in prison if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge dismissed the charges last month at the request of  
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Brison, a spokesman for prosecutors, said Washington  
didn't explain why he wanted to abandon the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington did not immediately return a message left at his home  
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Angellettie and Hubbard after Washington said  
they were two of four men who kicked him and threw chairs at him. 
Washington said he believed Angellettie was angry because Blaze 
identified him as the Madd Rapper, a performer who recorded songs 
anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington suffered fractured eye sockets that required hospital  
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Washington accused Fugees guitar player Wyclef Jean of  
pointing a gun at him in a recording studio because Jean didn't 
like Blaze's review of an album he had produced. Jean denied such 
an incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, a former assistant bureau chief for The Associated  
Press in New York, was dismissed from Blaze in March in a dispute 
with his employers over editorial policies.

</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- George Washington Bentley, the last surviving  
founder of The American Legion, died Friday. He was 101. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Bentley was awarded the Legion of Honor, the highest  
medal of the French government, for his service in France during 
World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	Bentley was assigned to the U.S. Army Engineers Purchasing  
Office in France from June 1918 to October 1919 and saw an ad about 
a meeting to discuss forming an organization of wartime veterans. 
Bentley attended the three-day Paris meeting with more than 1,000 
others in March 1919 at which The American Legion was formed. 
</P>
<P>
	All the attendees are considered founders because they took part  
in forming the organization.

                           *Peter Brough    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Peter Brough, a radio star who attracted a British  
audience of millions in the 1950s as the ventriloquist who brought 
puppet Archie Andrews to life, died Thursday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	The radio show ``Educating Archie'' served as a launching pad  
for many comics and actors, most notably Julie Andrews, a regular 
on the British Broadcasting Corp. show as a child. 
</P>
<P>
	Brough was a favorite of the royal family, playing at Royal  
Variety Performances and organizing the Windsor Castle staff ball 
for many years. 
</P>
<P>
	After performing for King George VI and the princesses Elizabeth  
and Margaret, the trio asked for the dummy's head to be taken off 
while they had a good look at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Brough retired from show business in the 1960s and went on to  
run a textile business.

                          *Zachary Fisher    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Zachary Fisher, a developer and Russian  
immigrant whose lifelong interest in the U.S. military led him to 
convert an abandoned aircraft carrier into an acclaimed naval 
museum, died Friday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher was honored by presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan  
for his philanthropic efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's avocation was the U.S. military, and his interest  
peaked after hearing of plans to consign the historic USS Intrepid 
to the scrapyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher started a foundation to save the Intrepid in 1978. Four  
years later, the battle-scarred carrier was home to the Intrepid 
Air Sea Space Museum, which is now the world's largest navel 
museum. It remains docked in the Hudson River. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, President Clinton awarded Fisher the Medal of Freedom  
for his efforts on behalf of the military. He also donated millions 
of dollars to the children of military personnel killed in the line 
of duty, starting with the survivors of the Marines killed in 
1983's Beirut barracks bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher also founded the Fisher Houses -- 28 mansions built on the  
grounds of military hospitals across the country as inexpensive 
housing for relatives of patients.

</P>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Former Gov. John McKeithen, a memorable  
stump speaker who worked to ease race relations and gave New 
Orleans the Superdome, died Friday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only was McKeithen known for his oratory skills, he was able  
to adapt them for the media age. He was the first to use television 
successfully in a Louisiana governor's campaign, becoming famous 
for his ``won't you he'p me'' ads looking directly into the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Big John, as he was called, served as governor from 1964 to  
1972. A hard-core Democrat, he appointed blacks to state government 
during the civil rights era and was remembered for his efforts to 
soothe racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	His administration drew praise and criticism over the Superdome,  
which he helped start but was completed in 1975 after he had been 
out of office for three years.

</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Keeter Skelton, the wife of former Associated  
Press Houston correspondent Max Skelton, died Wednesday. She was 
78. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Skelton was a former manager of the Press Club of Houston.  
</P>
<P>
	She was a graduate of the nursing program at Houston's Methodist  
Hospital in 1941 and was a second lieutenant in the Army Nurse 
Corps during World War II. She also conducted the Houston 
Chronicle's Goodfellows program for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband established the AP Houston bureau in 1947. He  
retired in 1982 after 35 years with AP and died in 1992.

                          *Hilda Mae Snoops    	
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- Hilda Mae Snoops, the longtime friend of  
former Gov. William Donald Schaefer who served as his official 
state hostess and unofficial first lady, died Friday. She was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Charles Snoops who introduced his wife to Schaefer, a  
childhood friend. After the Snoops divorced in 1962, Mrs. Snoops 
became Schaefer's companion. The two never married. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Schaefer was elected governor in 1986, the divorced  
mother of three took on a much more visible role. Mrs. Snoops, who 
called herself the ``first friend,'' was often at Schaefer's side 
at public and social events. 
</P>
<P>
	Her main task was to oversee the governor's mansion, and she was  
widely criticized for changes she made even though they were mostly 
privately funded. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her first acts was to renovate the mansion's public  
rooms, ripping out expensive restoration undertaken by Patricia 
Hughes, the wife of Schaefer's predecessor, Harry Hughes. Mrs. 
Hughes' use of styles representing different periods of Maryland 
history drew national acclaim, but Mrs. Snoops rejected them as too 
cold and museum-like.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ruth Whitney, who for more than 30 years was  
editor-in-chief of Glamour magazine and influenced generations of 
women during the growth of American feminism, died Friday of Lou 
Gehrig's disease. She was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Whitney increased Glamour's circulation by 1 million after  
taking over in 1967. Under her leadership, it became the only 
women's magazine to twice win general excellence honors at the 
National Magazine Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	She had been executive editor of Seventeen and editor-in-chief  
of Better Living. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Whitney introduced more than 50 regular columns and features  
to keep pace with women's rapidly changing lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a past president the American Society of Magazine  
Editors and was inducted into the 1996 ASME Editor's Hall of Fame 
for enhancing the traditional women's magazine format with a sense 
of social urgency and public service. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a son and a brother.

Cinema Handicap at Hollywood Park by one length over Eagleton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Brice Blanc and carrying 119 pounds, Fighting Falcon

<HEADLINE> IOC Vice President Criticizes Coles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Pal Schmitt, an International Olympic  
Committee vice-president, said personal notes compiled by 
Australian IOC member Phil Coles ``are against the dignity, the 
pride'' of IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitt told The Weekend Australian newspaper that there was  
``no doubt'' Coles was involved in writing material that broke 
``unwritten ethical rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was obvious Coles and partner Patricia Rosenbrock had  
written personal dossiers on the habits and tastes of IOC members 
``to help their friends in Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These personal notes are against the dignity, the pride of IOC  
members -- he should never have been involved,'' Schmitt said from 
Switzerland. ``This is not how an IOC member should behave. 
</P>
<P>
	``His personal relationships with IOC members will be frozen.''  
</P>
<P>
	The personal dossiers were uncovered in Salt Lake City last  
month after Coles had been warned by the IOC for accepting 
excessive hospitality from bid officials before and after they won 
the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles emerged confidently from a nearly three-hour hearing  
before an IOC investigating panel last week in Lausanne. The 
panel's recommendation will be forwarded to the IOC executive board 
at its June 14 meeting in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority vote of the IOC general assembly, which will be held  
in Seoul following the board meeting, is required to expel an IOC 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, a former Olympic rower for Australia who has been  
involved with the IOC for 17 years, has also been implicated in 
possible travel irregularities concerning the 1996 Atlanta bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Admitting to dispensing presents and favors in an effort to land  
the 1996 Games, Atlanta Olympic officials wrote a detailed internal 
report that was given to the U.S. House of Representatives Commerce 
Committee last week. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, Coles brought two travel companions on  
a trip to Atlanta in July 1989, which cost $13,053.21 and was paid 
for by the Atlanta group. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC rules limit members to one travel companion on such trips.  
</P>
<P>
	Coles said last week that he made one official visit to Atlanta  
-- in July 1989 -- and was accompanied by his wife and their young 
daughter. He said he was given dispensation to bring his child 
because she was classified as a minor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a normal visit,'' he said. ``It's absolutely above  
board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said a second visit -- to tour Olympic sites -- was paid for  
by the Australian Olympic Committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Diego Sonora executed a perfect give-and-go  
with Roy Lassiter and scored his first goal of the season in the 
65th minute Saturday night, giving D.C. United a 1-0 victory over 
the Columbus Crew in a match between the Eastern Conference's top 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The win extended United's unbeaten streak to five as it last  
lost May 1 at Chicago. Columbus remained winless in 10 trips to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	United had numerous scoring chances but couldn't convert until  
Sonora and Lassiter connected. Sonora started the play by sending a 
ball to Lassiter in the middle of the box. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Richie Williams jumped over the rolling ball, which  
momentarily froze the Columbus defense. Lassiter then touched it 
out to the on-rushing Sonora, who fired it past Columbus goalie 
Mark Dougherty 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter's six-game goal-scoring streak was stopped, but the  
forward had a number of chances. He nearly scored a few minutes 
after Sonora's goal, but Columbus defender Mike Lapper jumped into 
the goal as Dougherty was down and knocked Lassiter's shot away. 
</P>
<P>
	United often kept the ball in the Columbus end, forcing  
Dougherty to make 12 saves. Goalie Tom Presthus was rarely tested 
for D.C., finishing with just four saves. 
</P>
<P>
	All four of Columbus' losses have been shutouts.

<HEADLINE> Redwood Is Tallest Living Thing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UKIAH, Calif. (AP) -- A towering redwood surrounded by other  
giant trees in Northern California has been identified as the 
world's tallest living thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Named the ``Mendocino Tree,'' the 600- to 800-year-old redwood  
stands 367 1/2 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
	Measurements of the tree in Montgomery Woods State Reserve were  
conducted in mid-March by a special team led by Humboldt State 
University professor Steve Sillet. The results were videotaped and 
verified by the Guinness Book of World Records. 
</P>
<P>
	The older and more massive ``Tall Tree'' in Redwood National  
Park in Del Norte County held the previous title. It once stood 
nearly 368 feet tall, but lost 10 feet during a recent winter 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery of the ``Mendocino Tree,'' about 12 miles west of  
Ukiah, was kept quiet by park rangers and environmentalists to keep 
curiosity seekers from trampling the fragile site around it. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no official marker identifying the tree, which  
despite its grandeur is barely distinguishable from an 80-acre 
cluster of two dozen or more surrounding trees standing 350 feet or 
taller. 
</P>
<P>
	At 1,300 acres, Montgomery Woods is the least visited of  
Mendocino County's redwood preserves. Some local residents 
determined to keep it that way have started tearing down roadside 
state park signs in hopes of keeping the reserve's isolation to 
themselves.

<HEADLINE> Capital Offers Summer Entertainment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From Shakespeare and Impressionist art to  
rock, Balkan folk music and the National Zoo, visitors to the 
nation's capital have their pick of free entertainment this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Saturday, the Shakespeare Theatre will make free  
tickets available to all comers for a two-week performance of ``The 
Merry Wives of Windsor.'' Written as a farce, reportedly at the 
bidding of Queen Elizabeth I, the scene has been shifted from 
Windsor Castle to a 1950s New York mountain resort where the 
overweight John Falstaff tries his unsuccessful seductions in a 
sports jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	Performances are daily at the Carter Barron Amphitheater, which  
holds 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Every day at 6 p.m., the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts  
puts on an hourlong free show of popular, folk or classical music, 
in addition to its regular performances of films, plays, opera and 
concerts. 
</P>
<P>
	Entrance is always without charge to the Smithsonian's 15  
museums, which include the zoo and the Air and Space Museum. Many 
are open for extra evening hours through Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	So is the National Gallery of Art, which opens an exhibit Sunday  
of 55 works by Mary Cassatt, the only American artist among the 
French Impressionists. The gallery has a relaxing new sculpture 
garden next door, which matches the older outdoor sculpture park at 
the Hirschhorn Museum on the other side of the grassy National 
Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Gallery and some of the other museums have free  
films, but entry fees are charged for shows on the supersize Imax 
screens at the Natural History and the Air and Space museums. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the Smithsonian presents all-day Folk Festivals on  
the Mall weekdays from June 23 to July 4. This year's event 
highlights the arts, crafts and cookery of three strikingly 
different places -- New Hampshire, Romania and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be a special concert on June 24, which the  
Smithsonian promises will offer ``music and dance unlike anything 
most Americans have heard or seen before'' including wedding music 
from Bulgaria and Macedonia -- a blend of Balkan, Turkish and Indian 
music with jazz and rock. 
</P>
<P>
	A Conjunto Dance Party on July 2 presents music from south Texas  
that requires a diatonic button accordion and a 12-string bass 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Aug. 31 armed forces bands play daily on the east steps of  
the Capitol: Mondays, the Navy; Tuesdays and Fridays, the Air 
Force; Wednesdays, the Marines; and Thursdays, the Army. They also 
offer Sunday evening concerts on the Ellipse, just south of the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ellipse also is the site Wednesdays at 7 p.m. of a  
``Twilight Tattoo'' of the Army's Old Guard 3rd Infantry Band and 
Chorus. On Tuesdays at 8 p.m., the Navy Band and its specialty 
groups perform at the U.S. Navy Memorial, on Pennsylvania Avenue 
between the Capitol and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	More information about what's going on can be obtained at the  
new Information Center in the Ronald Reagan Building on 
Pennsylvania Avenue, a block from the White House Visitor Center in 
the Commerce Department Building. 
</P>
<P>
	If visitors come to Washington for a taste of politics, Congress  
is in session until early August. Most committee meetings are open 
to the public.

<HEADLINE> Democrat Tapes GOP's Secret Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Democratic operative tape-recorded what was  
supposed to be a confidential meeting between Republican 
presidential hopeful Rep. John Kasich and drug-addicted women at 
their shelter, according to Kathy Sullivan, chairwoman of the New 
Hampshire Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Odyssey Family Center in Canterbury, N.H.,  
complained to Sullivan, saying they invite all presidential 
candidates to speak on the condition of confidentiality. They asked 
the operative to turn over the tape during the meeting Tuesday but 
were refused, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she then apologized to the shelter official and  
promised not to make public any part of the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't enough for Kasich, however. In a letter Saturday to  
Democratic National Chairman Roy Romer, the Ohio congressman, 
chairman of the House Budget Committee complained about the episode 
and demanded an apology. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is nothing sacred anymore?'' Kasich wrote. ``Is there ever a  
time anymore when we can simply be Americans, instead of 
Republicans and Democrats looking for political advantage?'' He 
said the visit ``wasn't even a political event,'' although he 
talked about it at his next campaign stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Odyssey Family Center nor the Democratic National  
Committee immediately responded to requests for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich campaign spokesman Todd Harris insisted it was a  
non-political visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``An event is public when it's been publicized, and political  
when the purpose of the event is to garner votes,'' he said. ``We 
did not invite the media, we did not ask for votes and we did not 
distribute campaign material.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic spokeswoman Sullivan said it's ironic that Kasich,  
who said he was worried about the confidentiality of the women on 
tape, has prompted media requests to hear it. Reporters are 
wondering whether Kasich said something he doesn't want anyone else 
to hear, she suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris said Kasich is concerned about outsiders hearing what the  
women said, not about anything he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``John did very little talking and quite a bit of listening,''  
Harris said, noting he's asking that the tape be returned to the 
center, not to Kasich. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan said she has not heard the tape, does not intend to  
listen to it and won't let anyone else hear it either. She plans to 
tape over that section. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich ``should be flattered, considering his standing in the  
polls, that someone actually followed him around that day,'' 
Sullivan said.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Aims for Late-Night Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery's astronauts  
accomplished their last orbital job Saturday -- releasing Starshine, 
a glittery, educational satellite -- then aimed for a rare 
middle-of-the-night landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery was scheduled to touch down on Kennedy Space Center's  
floodlighted runway early Sunday. Mission Control informed the 
seven astronauts there was a chance that rain and wind could keep 
them up an extra day. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's space shuttles have landed in darkness only 10 times  
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Commander Kent Rominger and his crew spent six of their 10 days  
in orbit at the new international space station. They left 2 tons 
of tools, water, clothes and other supplies for the first permanent 
crew, due to arrive next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Before departing Thursday, the astronauts also fixed a broken  
radio, replaced flawed battery packs, and made it quieter by 
installing mufflers over noisy fans. 
</P>
<P>
	This was only the second crew to visit the orbiting outpost. The  
first crew connected the station's two components in December. And 
it will be this December before shuttle astronauts arrive with more 
supplies. First, the Russians must launch their long-delayed 
service module; that's scheduled for November. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's astronauts briefly set aside their packing for  
Saturday morning's release of Starshine, a 19-inch sphere covered 
with 878 small, circular mirrors that were polished by 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	It's purely an educational project; more than 25,000 students  
around the world will track the sparkling satellite over the next 
seven to eight months and, in doing so, determine the density of 
the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Reminiscent of a 1970s disco ball, the $1 million Starshine  
twinkled as it popped out of a canister in the shuttle cargo bay 
and floated away. It quickly was spotted by observers on the ground 
with the naked eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a fantastic sight,'' said Canadian astronaut Julie  
Payette, who pushed the ejection button. ``The first thing we all 
saw was the flickering of the mirrors ... We could track it with 
our cameras for the longest time because it's now and then getting 
a flash. It's beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The project's director, Gil Moore of Utah State University, said  
the satellite should remain in orbit until January before it 
plunges through the atmosphere and burns up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We invite everybody in the world to track this thing,'' Moore  
said. ``This is not just for kids. It's for students of all ages.''

<HEADLINE> Belmont Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With Silverbulletday's seventh-place finish in  
Saturday's Belmont Stakes, this year's Triple Crown races proved a 
letdown for fillies, especially for ones trained by Bob Baffert. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Kentucky Derby, Baffert's Excellent Meeting finished  
fifth despite a rough trip, and then was eased up at the top of the 
stretch in the Preakness. She hasn't run since. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Ring, who was 19th and last in the Derby, returned to the  
races on Friday and won the Acorn Stakes at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was Silverbulletday, the sensational filly who  
entered the Belmont with 11 wins in 12 career starts against her 
own sex. With Jerry Bailey aboard, Silverbulletday shot to the lead 
and battled with Charismatic before fading at the top of the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were taking a shot,'' Baffert said, a few days after trying  
to sell the Belmont as a battle between the top filly and the top 
colt. ``If we could slow them down, gotten a half mile in 49 and 
change, she'd have something to kick home. ... She's such a 
fighter. I thought we could win. If not, Charismatic would win it. 
It's a tough race to win. I feel horrible for the Lewises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob and Beverly Lewis, owners of Charismatic, saw their Triple  
Crown hopes dashed for the second time in three years. In '97, 
their Silver Charm, trained by Baffert, was second to Touch Gold in 
the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more amazing than Charismatic's career-ending injury -- two  
fractured bones in his left front ankle -- was that the colt shot to 
the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe he ran away with her,'' Bailey said. ``My hand  
was kind of made for me because I was on the inside. It's tough to 
go head-to-head that far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday was the 21st filly to run in the Belmont. Just  
two -- Ruthless in 1867 and Tanya in 1905 -- won the race. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WINNING JOCKEY:* Jockey Jose Santos finally won his first  
Triple Crown race on his 17th attempt, guiding 29-1 long shot Lemon 
Drop Kid to a head victory over Vision and Verse in Saturday's $1 
million Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scotty and I have said all along he was one of the better  
3-year-olds and he proved it today,'' Santos said, referring to 
trainer Scotty Schulhofer. ``He needed a good trip and he got that 
today. The filly and the others set a pretty quick pace to run 
at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santos finished second in the Belmont twice -- with Skip Away in  
1996 and Kissin Kris in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RECORD CROWD:* A record crowd of 85,818 showed up at Belmont  
Park to watch Charismatic's failed bid to win the Triple Crown on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record was in 1971, when 82,694 showed up for Pass  
Catcher's upset of Canonero II, who also was trying to win the 
Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 80,162 showed up to see Victory Gallop spoil Real  
Quiet's Triple Crown bid. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SPOILED AGAIN:* For the seventh time since 1978, when Affirmed  
swept the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont, a Triple Crown bid 
was spoiled. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic's loss in the Belmont also marked the third straight  
year a colt tried for, and failed, to win the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Silver Charm won the Derby and Preakness before losing  
to Touch Gold in the Belmont, and Victory Gallop stopped Real 
Quiet's Triple Crown bid last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who failed in the Belmont since 1978 were Sunday Silence  
in 1989, Alysheba in 1987, Pleasant Colony in 1981 and Spectacular 
Bid in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Slayings Could Be By Serial Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Police believe a serial killer may be  
responsible for strangling three women whose bodies have been found 
in a city park within the last several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest victim, identified as 17-year-old Alexandria Nicole  
Ison, was found Wednesday in Portland's Forest Park, popular with 
hikers and joggers. 
</P>
<P>
	Her body was discovered about a quarter-mile from where the  
other victims were found. That, along with the women's similar 
drug-related pasts, led police to believe the killings were the 
work of the same person. 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsies showed 28-year-old Lilla Faye Moler, discovered May 7,  
had been in the park for up to two months. Police say Stephanie 
Lynn Russell, 26, discovered while police searched for Moler, was 
likely killed within a week of being found. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at a downtown clinic for homeless youths said they last  
saw Ison on May 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Charles Moose said there will be a special task  
force of 12 detectives assigned to the cases. He said investigators 
have no suspects.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Lawmen Acquitted of Frame-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- After a three-year investigation and an  
eight-week trial, four sheriff's officers and a former prosecutor 
were acquitted of charges that they conspired to send the wrong man 
to death row for the killing of a 10-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the defendants were acquitted by the jury Friday after  
more than 10 hours of deliberations. A fifth defendant, a sheriff's 
officer, was acquitted by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts said they knew of no other case in which law  
enforcement officials were prosecuted for carrying out their 
official duties. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict followed the dismissal of charges last month against  
two other former county prosecutors accused in the case. The judge 
ruled that special prosecutor William Kunkle had not presented 
sufficient evidence against them. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven were indicted in 1996 on charges they lied and  
fabricated evidence against Rolando Cruz, who was twice convicted 
for the 1983 rape and murder of a 10-year-old girl in the Chicago 
suburb of Naperville. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a case that had to be tried,'' Kunkle said. ``It was  
important that it be tried and that these issues get aired and not 
just be swept under a rug somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz spent nearly a decade on death row before he was acquitted  
in 1995 during his third trial, and charges against a fellow 
defendant, Alejandro Hernandez, were later dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	While on death row, Cruz and Hernandez became the centers of a  
cause argued by law professors, journalists and death penalty 
opponents who claimed the evidence against them was fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators claimed Cruz described having a dream about the  
crime, but Cruz denied it. 
</P>
<P>
	Kunkle accused detectives Thomas Vosburgh and Dennis Kurzawa of  
concocting the statement, and their supervisor, Lt. James 
Montesano, of lying to bolster the story. Lt. Robert Winkler was 
charged with falsely testifying that Cruz made other incriminating 
statements to him while in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Former assistant state's attorney Thomas L. Knight was accused  
of using the detectives' perjured testimony and lying repeatedly 
over the years to cover up the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	But defense attorneys accused Cruz of giving different versions  
of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen years after the murder, no one stands convicted of the  
rape and bludgeoning death of 10-year-old Jeanine Nicarico in the 
Chicago suburb of Naperville.

<HEADLINE> Casino Ship Evacuated After Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A fire in the engine room of a casino  
ship forced the evacution of 143 passengers and crew. 
</P>
<P>
	No passengers were injured, but one crewman was treated at the  
scene of Friday's fire. Authorities were unsure what started the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The 156-foot SunCruz Casino ship had not yet left the dock while  
officials waited for a large party. The fire broke out just after 7 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very fortunate it was in the docks and we were able to  
evacuate everyone immediately,'' said Fire-Rescue Chief Darrel 
Donatto. ``The crew handled it very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A crew member told The Palm Beach Post that he shut down the  
generator because smoke was coming out of it, which apparently 
extinguished the fire. Donatto said the fire was out when 
firefighters arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	SunCruz refunded the $10 fee to passengers, gave them a free  
cruise for another day and the promise of a free drink.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A government troop pullback, ordered  
last year to spur peace talks with leftist rebels, has been 
extended until Dec. 7, the government's chief negotiator said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to keep troops out of rebel territory came less  
than two weeks after Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda resigned in 
protest at President Andres Pastrana's handling of efforts to end 
the 35-year-old civil conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloreda had objected most strenuously to the pronouncement by  
the chief negotiator, Victor G. Ricardo, that the pullout would be 
indefinite. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 troops were removed in November from a  
Switzerland-sized swath of southern Colombia to facilitate peace 
talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloreda had warned that an indefinite troop withdrawal could  
lead to the permanent partitioning of Colombia into government and 
rebel-held areas -- a Balkanization of this already highly unstable 
nation where guerrillas control some 40 percent of the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricardo also named the 20 members of a support committee  
designed to give advice to government and rebel negotiators.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A dispute among criminal gangs may  
have spurred nine gunmen to open fire on a crowded bar, killing six 
and wounding some 23 customers, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, it's our best hypothesis since two of the dead are  
known drug traffickers,'' Lt. Adilson Rodrigues of the 15th 
precinct told The Associated Press Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hooded gunmen fired assault rifles indiscriminately at more than  
100 customers Friday at the Friendly Bar in the Rio suburb city of 
Duque de Caxias. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident is one of Rio's most violent crimes since rogue  
police killed eight sleeping street kids and 21 slum dwellers in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Rio state Governor Anthony Garotinho, who recently signed a  
decree banning the sale of guns by authorized stores, has ordered a 
state wide manhunt.

<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Joe-Max Moore and Ivan McKinley scored  
goals as the New England Revolution defeated the Chicago Fire 2-0 
Saturday night, their first regulation victory at home this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some quick counterattacks early in the match by Chicago,  
it was New England (5-6) that scored first when Moore converted in 
the 17th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	A tackle by McKinley stripped Peter Nowak of the ball about 10  
yards into the Chicago half of the field as Chicago was mounting a 
counterattack. McKinley, temporarily free of defenders, made a 
darting run down the left side before putting a cross into the Fire 
area that was volleyed home by Moore from seven yards. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinley headed in a cross by John Harkes in the 76th minute.  
</P>
<P>
	Chicago (6-5) had a handful of chances, but couldn't convert.  
</P>
<P>
	In the 36th minute, Fire forward Ante Razov got around New  
England's Brian Dunseth on the right side and broke in on the 
Revolution goal only to put a weak shot wide along the left post. 
</P>
<P>
	In the dying seconds of the first half, Chris Armas beat New  
England's offside trap as he broke in on the right side and hit an 
awkward shot from about 13 yards that deflected off Razov and went 
just wide of the left post. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolution had not won in regulation since April 24 and had  
never beaten the defending MLS champions.

<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Padres recalled right-hander Will  
Cunnane from Triple-A Las Vegas on Saturday and announced they will 
request unconditional release waivers on left-hander Ed Vosberg, 
who refused an outright assignment to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunnane dominated the Pacific Coast League, going 2-1 with eight  
saves and a 0.55 ERA in 24 appearances. He was with the Padres for 
all of 1997 and part of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Vosberg had no record and a 9.72 ERA in 15 relief appearances.  
He missed all of 1998 after undergoing shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego also signed second baseman Carlos Baerga and  
outfielder Wayne Kirby to minor league contracts and assigned them 
to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, who had been playing for Cincinnati's Triple-A club, was  
released by the Reds on Friday so he could sign with San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga's contract calls for him to be promoted to the majors by  
a certain date or he can again seek free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego general manager Kevin Towers said signing Baerga is an  
insurance policy for the Padres, who have been ravaged by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga made his big league debut with the Padres in 1986. He and  
Kirby played with the New York Mets last year.

<HEADLINE>  Terrell Owens Signs With 49ers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Wide receiver Terrell Owens became a San  
Francisco 49er again Friday, reportedly signing a one-year contract 
worth $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement capped lengthy negotiations among general manager  
Bill Walsh, director of football operations John McVay and Owens' 
agent, David Joseph, the San Francisco Chronicle reported in 
Saturday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Owens is available for preseason minicamps, which  
continue next week in Santa Clara. He missed a three-day minicamp 
last month, saying he didn't want to risk injury without a 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``My agent's been in here for two weeks and has had some  
productive meetings with Walsh and McVay. They assured me that my 
(long-term) deal was almost finalized, so I told them I needed to 
get some work in,'' said Owens, 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll offer my services next week and hopefully we'll get  
something done real soon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several 49ers officials did not immediately return calls by The  
Associated Press seeking comment Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	While the one-year deal was a formality, the salary was the  
required tender offer made to Owens, who was designated as the 
49ers' franchise player in February. Under the rules of the NFL's 
collective bargaining agreement, Owens was offered the average of 
the top five salaries for wide receivers for the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the 49ers not signed him to that minimum one-year tender  
offer by July 15, Owens would have been free to negotiate with 
other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's some assurance that I'll be a 49er,'' Owens said. ``This  
team is on the verge of some great things and like always we're 
trying to reach the Super Bowl. I've been close for, like, three 
years since I've been here. It would have been hard to part ways -- 
not only for me, but for the fans as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's a lot of weight off my back, and a lot of guys can  
quit asking me if I'm going to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Mariucci said that since Owens hit several career  
highs in 1998 -- 67 receptions for 1,097 yards and 14 touchdowns, 
including a 79-yard scoring catch -- he would have been a successful 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't help but think other teams (might have) made a run  
at him,'' Mariucci said. ``Physically, he's as good a receiver as 
you're going to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers' regular training camp runs July 26-August 17 in  
Stockton.

the top five salaries for wide receivers for the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the 49ers not signed him to that minimum one-year tender  
offer by July 15, Owens would have been free to negotiate with 
other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's some assurance that I'll be a 49er,'' Owens said. ``This  
team is on the verge of some great things and like always we're 
trying to reach the Super Bowl. I've been close for, like, three 
years since I've been here. It would have been hard to part ways -- 
not only for me, but for the fans as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's a lot of weight off my back, and a lot of guys can  
quit asking me if I'm going to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Mariucci said that since Owens hit several career  
highs in 1998 -- 67 receptions for 1,097 yards and 14 touchdowns, 
including a 79-yard scoring catch -- he would have been a successful 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't help but think other teams (might have) made a run  
at him,'' Mariucci said. ``Physically, he's as good a receiver as 
you're going to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers' regular training camp runs July 26-August 17 in  
Stockton.

<P>
	WEST ALLIS, Wis. (AP) -- Maybe things are finally starting to go  
Jimmy Vasser's way. 
</P>
<P>
	After struggling through the first six races of the CART FedEx  
Series -- and watching rookie teammate Juan Montoya cruise to three 
victories and the series lead -- Vasser had a bemused smile Saturday 
after qualifying in the front row for the Miller Lite 225. 
</P>
<P>
	Finishing behind Helio Castro-Neves was Vasser's best qualifying  
effort of the season and the first front-row start for the 1996 
series champion since last year's finale in Fontana, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a lot of little things,'' Vasser said. ``We've had  
some failures and made some mistakes, just a lot of little crazy 
things. But we've been fortunate over time not to have those 
problems, so I'm not complaining. This is motor racing and these 
things happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is that there are still 14 races to go this  
season and we've got time to get it going. This could be what we 
needed to turn the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor in Vasser's more optimistic outlook is that he  
got some guidance last week in a test session in Portland, Ore., 
from Morris Nunn, the engineer who helped former teammate Alex 
Zanardi -- now in Formula One -- win CART championships the past two 
years and has worked with Montoya this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morris has got a deep well of knowledge and I hope we get to  
take advantage of it more this season,'' Vasser said. ``He really 
helped us turn in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Vasser's season hasn't been all that bad. He has  
finished in the points (among the top 12) in five of six races and 
is 11th in the standings, trailing Montoya by 48 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Each race has a total of 22 points, with one for the pole, one  
for leading the most laps and 20 for winning. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *POLE POSITION:* Last year, the Lola chassis was practically an  
orphan in the CART series. Now, with Castro-Neves and Hogan Racing 
helping to develop it, and Marlboro Team Penske putting Al Unser 
Jr. in a Lola, the British-built cars are having a renaissance of 
sorts. 
</P>
<P>
	The placing by Casto-Neves on Saturday was the first pole for  
Lola Cars international under the new ownership of Martin Birrane, 
who assumed control of the company in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	This is also the first pole for Lola since Andre Ribero was at  
the front for the street race in Toronto in 1996. The last oval 
pole for the company was by Scott Brayton at the 1995 Indianapolis 
500. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Andretti, who currently drives a Swift, was the last  
Lola driver to win a CART race, taking the checkered flag on the 
road course in Vancouver in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MICHAEL'S MILE:* Don't bet against Michael Andretti in Sunday's  
race at the Milwaukee Mile, even if he is starting a disappointing 
11th in the 26-car field. 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti, coming off a victory last weekend in Madison, Ill., is  
the leading active driver here with victories in 1986, 1987, 1991, 
1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	His Milwaukee resume also includes runner-up finishes in 1989  
and 1997, a third in 1995, fourths in 1984 and 1994 and fifth in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love racing in Milwaukee and I love the fans,'' said  
Andretti, who leads all CART drivers with 38 victories. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MOVING AHEAD:* Rookie Cristiano da Matta qualified seventh for  
Sunday's race, giving a Toyota-powered car its second-highest 
starting spot since the company came into CART in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Da Matta, a 25-year-old Brazilian, set the standard for Toyota  
when he qualified sixth in his CART debut in Homestead, Fla. in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 Indy Lights champion, now driving for Arciero-Wells  
Racing, will be making only his seventh start in the CART series. 
He also has registered Toyota's best finish (fourth) at the race 
last month in Nazareth, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Barron, a second-year driver, was 10th in a Toyota-powered  
car, giving Dan Gurney's All American Racers team its best start 
since the team returned to Champ car competition with Toyota in 
1996.

<HEADLINE> Mets Fire Three Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets general manager Steve Phillips  
sent a message to his struggling team, firing three coaches 
Saturday after the Mets lost their eighth straight game. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching coach Bob Apodaca, bullpen coach Randy Niemann and  
hitting coach Tom Robson were fired hours after the Mets' 6-3 loss 
to the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a tough evening for the organization,'' Phillips  
said. ``We are one-third of the way through the season and that is 
enough time to make an evaluation. There is still enough time to 
get the ship righted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advisor Dave Wallace, the Los Angeles Dodgers' pitching coach  
for three years, will take over the pitchers, minor league pitching 
coordinator Al Jackson takes over the bullpen, and minor league 
hitting coordinator Mickey Brantley becomes hitting coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets' losing streak is their longest since an eight-game  
skid from Aug. 21-30, 1996 -- a stretch during which manager Bobby 
Valentine was hired. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision was made with the intent to better build the  
pitchers, help the hitters in situational hitting and allow us to 
perform better and let Bobby make it work,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apodaca and Robson were two of Valentine's closest confidants.  
Apodaca came with Valentine from Triple-A Norfolk when Valentine 
took over the Mets two year's ago. Robson was on Valentine's staff 
in Texas from 1986-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips informed Valentine of his decision during a one-hour  
meeting Saturday night. Phillips said Valentine didn't agree with 
the moves, but didn't threaten to quit, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips stressed that this was not an indication that  
Valentine's job was in jeopardy as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I offered my feelings about him and the owner's feelings as  
well and we all believe that he can lead us out of this slump that 
we are in now and get us back into the position we expect to be 
in,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said he made the decision to fire the coaches on  
Thursday. He originally wanted to wait until after the Yankees 
series to make the announcement, but recent media reports about the 
status of the coaches prompted him to make the move Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are at a position where we have a major investment and we  
are not performing well,'' he said. ``This is not exclusively about 
wins and losses. It is about the process and the way we are playing 
the game right now. Even if we won all three games this weekend, I 
still would have made this decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After spending $165.9 million to upgrade the team this  
offseason, the Mets were the favorite for the NL wild-card and 
perhaps to even challenge the Atlanta Braves in the NL East. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Mets (27-28) are in third place in the division and  
11th place overall in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	New York began the day with a 4.84 ERA, 12th among 16 teams in  
the National League. Last year, the Mets were fourth in the NL at 
3.76. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite leading the NL in on-base percentage, the Mets are  
eighth in the league in runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed to make changes with the people who had the most  
immediate contact and responsibility with those departments,'' 
Phillips said. ``There are some areas where we succeeding but not 
finishing the job. Other areas, like pitching, we just aren't 
getting the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apodaca, who pitched for the Mets from 1973-78, has been with  
the organization for 28 years, starting his coaching career in 
1981. He had a 16-25 career record with 26 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Robson was drafted by the Mets in 1967 and has spent the last  
three seasons as their hitting coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Niemann was a member of the Mets' 1986 World Series championship  
team and has spent the last 12 years as a coach in the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Bench coach Bruce Benedict, first base coach Mookie Wilson and  
third base coach Cookie Rojas remained with the team.

fillies and mares at Churchill Downs on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Banshee Breeze, who captured the Eclipse Award as champion

<P>
	Silent Eskimo set a slow pace and gave way grudgingly in the  
stretch and paid $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Meadow Vista finished another 4 1/2 lengths back in third. With the  
field reduced to four after Whoozie was a late scratch, there was 
no show wagering.

<HEADLINE> Storm Slams S. Dakota Reservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OGLALA, S.D. (AP) -- A tornado ripped through a small town on the  
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, smashing homes and killing at least 
one person. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were unaccounted for by Saturday afternoon.  
However, they may have been staying with friends or relatives, said 
Robert Ecoffey, superintendent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs on 
the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister struck Oglala on Friday evening as violent  
thunderstorms rolled across the region of mostly open prairie in 
southwestern South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole house was vibrating,'' said Milo Sits Poor, who rode  
out the storm in a basement. ``A car that was parked out front 
started spinning in circles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Myrna Eagle Hawk said she hid under a mattress with her niece  
and nephew when the storm struck. ``The living room, one bedroom is 
demolished. The roof -- there is no roof,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 homes, a church and a church hall were destroyed and 50  
houses were damaged, said Gene Abdallah, superintendent of the 
state Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Divers were sent to search a small, debris-filled lake outside  
town for possible victims, but that search was called off before 
they entered the water. 
</P>
<P>
	National Guard members were sent to Oglala, about 80 miles south  
of Rapid City. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Janklow flew to Oglala and said the most immediate  
need was finding temporary housing for people who need a place to 
sleep, eat and bathe. ``You'll have a lot of people that want to 
help,'' he told tribal officials. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 people had spent the night in dormitories at the Pine  
Ridge High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight people were taken to a Rapid City hospital, and about 20  
were treated in Pine Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	National Weather Service spotters reported at least three  
tornadoes near Pine Ridge and hail the size of grapefruit hit 
ranches in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind gusted to 70 mph west of Oglala near Oelrichs, and 2 to 3  
inches of rain fell in an hour elsewhere in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago, on May 30, a tornado in eastern South Dakota wiped  
out the town of Spencer and killed six people.

<HEADLINE> Lemon Drop Kid Wins Belmont Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charismatic left the Belmont starting gate a  
mile and a half from becoming a racing legend. He left the track in 
a horse ambulance, his racing career over. 
</P>
<P>
	Just moments after the Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner finished  
third Saturday behind Lemon Drop Kid and Vision and Verse in the 
Belmont Stakes, a pall dropped like a curtain over the crowd of 
85,818, biggest in New York racing history, as Chris Antley pulled 
up the big chestnut colt and dismounted. 
</P>
<P>
	About an hour later, the word came that Charismatic fractured  
two bones in his left front leg -- the cannon bone and the sesamoid. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means he's through as a racehorse,'' said veterinarian  
Dr. Larry Bramlage. ``We expect him to be fine as a stallion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jim Hunt, a veterinarian for Charismatic trainer D. Wayne  
Lukas, said the horse will have surgery probably Sunday or Monday, 
but that it was not life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt's lower leg was placed in a cast and he was returned to  
his stall in the barn at Belmont Park, where Lukas said he was 
resting comfortably. Surgery at the equine hospital next to Belmont 
Park will insert screws to hold the fragments of bone together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Naturally, you hate to see a horse get hurt,'' said winning  
trainer Scotty Shulhofer. ``I would have felt better if it hadn't 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the injury hadn't occurred, it appears Charismatic  
wouldn't have been able to hold off Lemon Drop Kid and Vision and 
Verse, who were a head apart at the wire, with Charismatic another 
1 1/2 lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
	Bramlage said the injury apparently occurred just past the wire.  
</P>
<P>
	It was an unfortunate ending for the former claimer who had  
caught the public's imagination in his bid to give a Triple Crown 
to Lukas and owners Bob and Beverly Lewis. The Lewises had failed 
to win the Triple Crown two years ago when the Bob Baffert-trained 
Silver Charm finished second in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're devastated at the thought that anything could be wrong  
with Charismatic,'' Bob Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Antley's quick action drew praise from Lukas, veterinarians and  
Bob Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was simply marvelous,'' Lewis said. ``He might have saved  
the horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disappointed Lukas, who has won 12 Triple Crown races and  
all three of them in one year but with different horses, said: ``I 
think we had the right horse at the right place on the right day, 
but we didn't get the right situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's racing and these things happen. We'll deal with them.''  
</P>
<P>
	Antley said he didn't know when the injury occurred but said he  
felt Charismatic ease a bit about the eighth pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was almost like letting out air. He eased off the run he  
started on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid certainly deserved his victory but it was a  
disappointing ending, since many had hoped to see Charismatic 
become the first horse to win the Triple Crown since Affirmed in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
	The race also was billed as a showdown between the Triple Crown  
challenger and the sensational filly Silverbulletday, making her 
debut against males after winning 11 of 12 against fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened for a mile, and then Silverbulletday faded to finish  
seventh. But her presence in the race likely played a big part in 
Charismatic's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, Charismatic chased the pace much earlier than is  
his custom, laying second behind Silverbulletday from the clubhouse 
turn until less than a half-mile remained. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe he (Charismatic) ran away (on the pace) with  
her,'' Jerry Bailey, Silverbulletday's rider, said. ``It's tough to 
go head and head that far, but I could see Antley's horse was kind 
of rank. I looked over and he was trying to get him back, but he 
couldn't get him back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid, ridden by Jose Santos, was fourth with a  
quarter-mile to go, then was taken outside for his winning charge 
down the middle of the track. He took the lead from Charismatic 
with an eighth of a mile remaining and won in 2:27.88. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt, owned by Laddie and Jeanne Vance, paid a winning  
mutuel of $61.50, fourth-largest in the 131-year history of the 
race. His place and show prices were $26 and $10.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid finished a head in front of Vision and Verse,  
trying to become the first non-Derby and Preakness starter to win 
the Belmont since Shulhofer did it with Colonial Affair in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Vision and Verse paid $44.40 and $17 and Charismatic was $3.60.  
</P>
<P>
	Completing the order of finish after fourth-place Best of Luck  
were Stephen Got Even, Patience Game, Silverbulletday, Menifee, 
Pineaff, Prime Directive, Teletable and Adonis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid earned $600,000 for his second victory in five  
starts this year and fourth triumph in 11 career outings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came over to the track great and I've said ever since we  
put him in training he's been a nice horse,'' Shulhofer said. ``He 
needed a little time to get going and he peaked on the right day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Lemon Drop Kid ended up in the winner's circle, it was  
Charismatic who was on the minds of many as they left Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again the fragility of racehorses and the uncertainty of  
racing was brought home. 
</P>
<P>
	``All week, we talked about how maintenance-free this horse was  
and how durable he is,'' Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tearful Antley, who rode back into the limelight with  
Charismatic after being sidelined for 18 months with weight 
problems, said: ``He gave us a lot. He gave America a lot. The game 
goes one.''

<HEADLINE> Singer Mel Torme Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mel Torme, the jazz and pop singer whose warm  
vocals earned him the unwanted title ``the Velvet Fog,'' and the 
co-writer of the Christmas classic that celebrates ``chestnuts 
roasting on an open fire,'' died Saturday. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Torme, who had suffered what was described as a mild stroke in  
August 1996, died of complications from that stroke after being 
rushed from his Beverly Hills home to the University of California, 
Los Angeles, medical center, said his publicist, Rob Wilcox. 
</P>
<P>
	Torme's wife, Ali, and five children were at his side when he  
died, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Torme received a lifetime achievement award from the National  
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences at February's Grammy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his singing and prolific song-writing, Torme's career  
included acting in movies and on television, where he drew fresh 
attention in the late 1980s on ``Night Court'' as the musical hero 
of main character Judge Harold T. Stone, played by Harry Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a remarkable guy. What a one of a kind. It's a tremendous  
loss. He was fabulous guy, great sense of humor, as sweet as an 
elf,'' Anderson said Saturday. He recalled one episode in which his 
character said of tickets to a Torme concert: ``Woodstock was just 
a concert, this is Mel Torme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I humbly put forth that Mel and I had the best musical  
marriage in many a year,'' said pianist George Shearing, who won 
two Grammy awards with Torme. ``We literally breathed together 
during our countless performances. As Mel put it, `We were two 
bodies of one musical mind.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a very special talent, one of the most talented  
individuals in our business,'' said singer Vic Damone. ``A 
composer, musician, arranger. He was so very bright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the supreme jazz singers of all time, with the  
vocal dexterity matched only by Ella Fitzgerald. He had the best 
sense of timing and a lot of heart in his work. And he was a good 
guy,'' said singer Jack Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lost a wonderful friend,'' said comedian Jerry Lewis.  
``There could never be anyone to replace Mel, not only as a singer 
but as a dear friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even people who had heard little of his singing could not miss  
his other claim to musical immortality: He was co-author of the 
lyrics and music to ``The Christmas Song'' -- ``Chestnuts roasting 
on an open fire, Jack Frost nipping at your nose.'' The song was a 
huge hit for Nat ``King'' Cole in 1946 and has been recorded by 
countless other singers, including Torme himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Torme, who began his singing career on radio at age 4, preferred  
jazz singing to the crooning that brought him his nickname. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really wasn't until the end of my high school days, in  
1943, that I determined to be a jazz singer,'' he says. ``Then I 
got sidetracked. (His manager) felt the way to the gold was for me 
to become a crooner. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long period I was singing mushy, sentimental songs. I  
began to be called the Velvet Fog. I never liked it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was rescued by a recording executive who heard a bit  
of jazz in his style and urged him in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
	He saw his vocal career as a work in progress, ``a long learning  
curve.'' Listening to recordings in a box CD set on his career, he 
said: ``The early songs are kind of callow. I cringe a little bit 
at them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was his own arranger for much of his career, played piano and  
other instruments, acted in a few Hollywood films, had a TV talk 
show for a while in the '50s, and had his occasional appearances on 
``Night Court,'' where Judge Stone kept a photo of Torme in his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	He was nominated for a best supporting actor Emmy in 1956 for a  
role in ``The Comedian,'' a Playhouse 90 production. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote some 300 songs, more than half, including ``Born To Be  
Blue'' and ``The Christmas Song,'' with Robert Wells.	   When people would ask why he kept singing old songs, Torme said 
they're simply better than new songs: ``When young rock singers 
began writing their own, they displaced the community of 
songwriters who worked with grace, wit, charm, intelligence and 
brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely the lyric to me is 95 percent of what a song is.  
The singer is portraying a playlet to the audience, involving the 
audience in what he is saying. If the melody is attractive, that's 
frosting on the cake. The lyric is the cake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 70, he said he maintained his vocal strength by taking care  
of himself: no smoking, only an occasional glass of wine, careful 
avoidance of drafts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I sing I force myself to have seven or eight hours of  
sleep. I can sing acceptably well on six hours. There is that 
little grade of difference between six hours and eight hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1994 concert at Carnegie Hall, he joked about his age. In  
``You Make Me Feel So Young,'' the 68-year-old Torme sang: ``You 
know that age is just a number,'' then interjected ``If I could 
really believe that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torme is survived by his wife and five children -- Steve,  
Melissa, Tracy, Daisy, and James. 
</P>
<P>
	Memorial services were not immediately announced.

<HEADLINE> Court Ends Inquiry of HUD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A court this week quietly ended the nine-year  
investigation of influence-peddling in the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development, the longest inquiry under the independent 
counsel law. 
</P>
<P>
	Three federal appeals judges issued a two-page ``order of  
termination'' in the $29 million investigation and transferred the 
only remaining case, involving former top HUD aide Deborah Gore 
Dean, to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The court order was stamped Thursday and released Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Dean was convicted of conspiracy to defraud, receiving an  
illegal gratuity, perjury and concealing and covering up material 
facts from investigators. She has filed motions seeing a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	She blamed former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce and other  
department officials in the Reagan administration for deciding to 
funnel housing projects to developers who hired consultants such as 
former Kentucky Gov. Louis Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce was never charged, but he admitted in a statement to the  
prosecutor's office that his conduct ``contributed to an 
environment'' in which HUD staff members engaged in ``improper and 
even criminal conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The special appeals court launched the HUD investigation in  
March 1990 by appointing Independent Counsel Arlin Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation yielded 17 convictions and more than $2  
million in fines and recovered $10 million in federal low-income 
housing funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those convicted was former Interior Secretary James Watt,  
who pleaded guilty to withholding information and documents from a 
grand jury. Prosecutors gathered evidence that Watt had been paid 
more than $500,000 for contacting political appointees at HUD from 
1984 through 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel statute expires June 30 and appears  
unlikely to be renewed, at least not immediately. Congressional 
Democrats claim that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
investigation of the Clinton administration has been out of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans made a similar charge regarding Independent Counsel  
Lawrence Walsh and his pursuit of GOP officials in the Iran-Contra 
matter. President Bush closed out Walsh's probe by pardoning former 
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger two weeks before he was to have 
gone on trial in the scandal -- a case in which Bush's own actions 
were to come under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh's was the most expensive independent counsel  
investigation: $48.5 million for a six-year inquiry regarding the 
Reagan White House's arms-for-hostages deals with Iran and its 
secret war against the communist-led government of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's nearly five-year criminal investigation of President  
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton has cost some $40 million.

<HEADLINE> Miller Can Only Watch This Big Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Though it wasn't eight points in 8.9 seconds, it  
was the type of finish that left Reggie Miller in awe. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, the king of the improbable, seemingly unmakeable shot in  
this Knicks-Pacers rivalry, was an innocent bystander when Larry 
Johnson pulled off the kind of dramatic play Miller has perfected 
for the better part of this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm usually on the other end of a shot like that,'' Miller  
said Saturday night after Johnson's four-point play with 5.7 
seconds left gave the Knicks a 92-91 victory in Game 3 of the 
Eastern Conference finals. ``When he makes a shot like that, it 
makes it tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller could only stand there and gaze blankly, his tongue  
hanging out the way Spike Lee and so many New Yorkers have stared 
at him. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is the expert on late comebacks steeped in drama,  
especially in Madison Square Garden. But in the fourth quarter of 
this pivotal game, Miller didn't score, and in the second half, he 
had just two points on 1-for-4 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Miller, who won Game 2 of this series with two free throws  
with 2 seconds left, had to watch Johnson hit a shot that rivaled 
even some of his most crushing blows against the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I've seen a lot of things,'' Miller said. ``It was  
surprising to me. Always when you have a three-point lead, you say 
to yourself, the worst you could do is tie. But that old adage 
proved us wrong tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years in New York, the adage has been simple: Keep Reggie  
away from the Garden in the summertime. If that doesn't work, keep 
the ball away from him when he arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	So many times during the second half, as the Pacers tried to  
hold on to their dwindling lead, Miller was on the court but was 
barely noticed. 
</P>
<P>
	Even on the Pacers' last possession, Miller never saw the ball.  
When Mark Jackson missed a running 10-footer in the lane, few were 
as surprised as the Knicks defenders that the fingertips launching 
the ball didn't belong to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the ball was going to go to Reggie,'' Knicks guard  
Chris Childs said. ``It looked like nobody wanted it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What a strange sight it was for Miller, whose eight incredible  
points in 8.9 seconds killed the Knicks in Game 4 of the 1994 
Eastern Conference finals, to be left standing with his mouth 
hanging open after Johnson's shot. Even during the Pacers' final 
timeout, he appeared to be barely paying attention -- still staring 
into space, toward Eighth Avenue, and then up at the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	It read Knicks 92, Pacers 91. Miller and his teammates had a  
hard time figuring out why. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reggie really doesn't need to score 30 points for us to win  
every night,'' Pacers coach Larry Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doesn't he have to score in the fourth quarter, though?  
</P>
<P>
	It was Miller, after all, who hung 25 on the Knicks in the  
fourth quarter of Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals at the 
Garden in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little disappointing,'' Miller said. ``I felt that Mark  
did get off a pretty good shot in the paint. You want to give 
yourself a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel my moment will come.''

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Men Win Track Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- It would have been appropriate for Arkansas'  
men's track and field athletes to throw coach John McDonnell into 
the steeplechase water jump pit Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, it was steeplechaser Matt Kerr's victory that helped  
propel the Razorbacks to their eight consecutive title at the NCAA 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the wins, this was one of the closest. Arkansas finished  
with 59 points, only seven ahead of Stanford. The teams also 
finished 1-2 last year, with Arkansas winning by 7 1/2 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's title race also was a repeat of last year, as Texas  
again won the championship with 62 points and UCLA was second with 
60. The difference last year was five points. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's race was even more dramatic than the men's. Heading  
into the final event, UCLA led with 54 points, Texas was second 
with 52 and Southern California third with 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Suziann Reid, who earlier Saturday became the meet's first  
three-time winner in the women's 400 meters, ran a powerful anchor 
in the 1,600 relay, leading the Longhorns to victory in 3 minutes, 
27.08 seconds. The time was a collegiate record, breaking the mark 
of 3:27.50 set by Texas in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern California anchor Kinshasha Davis passed UCLA's  
Michelle Perry down the final straightaway and finished second, 
preventing the arch-rival Bruins from tying Texas for the title. 
The Trojans finished third with 58 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr, a senior competing for the final time for Arkansas, made  
the 3,000 steeplechase a memorable race. He bided his time before 
taking the lead from UTEP's Carlos Suarez-Gonzales with two laps 
remaining and coasted home by about 14 meters in 8:44.29. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas also picked up points in the 1,500 as two-time  
defending champion Seneca Lassiter finished second and Sharif Karie 
was fifth, in the triple jump as long jump champion Melvin Lister 
took fifth, in the high jump as 1998 indoor champion Kenny Evans 
placed third and in the shot put as Marcus Clavelle was fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	That enabled the Razorbacks to overcome Stanford's 22-point lead  
going into the final day. On Saturday, the Cardinal got only a 
fourth from Adam Connolly in the hammer throw and a seventh in the 
1,500 from Jake Maas. 
</P>
<P>
	The most scintillating individual performance of the competition  
was Florida freshman John Capel's 19.87 victory in the 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Capel tied the meet record set by Mississippi State's Lorenzo  
Daniel in 1988 and tied for fourth place among all-time collegiate 
runners. Only Joe DeLoach, Ato Boldon and Michael Johnson have run 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``If me and Coby (Miller of Auburn) came off the turn together,  
I knew it would be just like the SEC,'' Capel said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's just what happened.  
</P>
<P>
	Capel and Miller were running side by side as they entered the  
final straightaway. Just like in the Southeastern Conference 
championships, Capel had the better kick. Miller wound up second in 
a career-best 20.04. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA's Seilala Sua set a meet record in winning her third  
consecutive women's discus title at 210-10, bettering by two inches 
the mark she set last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also gave Sua a shot put-discus double, the fourth  
in the meet's history and the first since UCLA's Tracie Millett did 
it in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	There were several other sparkling performances.  
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Myles-Mills didn't pay any attention to the more  
heralded runners in the men's 100 -- and made his own kind of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The BYU senior raced to victory in 9.98, making him the first  
repeat champion in the event since Auburn's Harvey Glance in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Glance, now the coach at Alabama, was on hand to present the  
first-place medal to Myles-Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning time was a record at Boise State's Bronco Stadium  
and tied Myles-Mills for eighth place on the all-time collegiate 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into the race, all of the attention was focused on Miller  
and Capel. Neither came close to Myles-Mills as Capel was second in 
10.03 and Miller sixth in 10.21. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid got the Texas women started on their way to repeating by  
winning the 400 in 51.09, a stadium record. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were depending on me to get 10 points,'' Reid said.  
</P>
<P>
	There was a surprise in the women's 100, as Southern Cal  
freshman Angela Williams, the 1998 High School Athlete of the Year, 
beat two-time defending champion Debbie Ferguson of Georgia. 
Williams bolted into the lead at the start and finished in 11.04. 
Ferguson was second in 11.10. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the greatest day of my life,'' Williams said. ``It's  
like the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the easiest victory in one of the short races was turned  
in by South Carolina's Terrence Trammell. He won the men's 110 
hurdles in 13.45, a stadium record, and two meters ahead of 
runner-up Dawane Wallace of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	In a blanket finish, Miami's Yolanda McCray won the women's 100  
hurdles in 12.85 with Georgia Tech's Andria King second in 12.87 
and UCLA's Joanna Hayes third in 12.89. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball State's Latasha Jenkins took the women's 200 in 22.29, a  
stadium record, as Ferguson, again the defending champion, finished 
second in 22.53. 
</P>
<P>
	Other notable performances were Mark Boswell of Texas in the  
men's high jump at 7-7 3/4, LeVar Anderson of LSU in the men's triple 
jump with a wind-aided 56-2, and UCLA's 3:02.12 in the men's 1,600 
relay. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest surprises was Clyde Colenzo's victory in the  
men's 1,500. The SMU senior outdueled Lassiter to win the tactical 
race in 3:47.54.

<HEADLINE> Malnutrition Risk for Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ginevra Mattioli's husband and closest friend  
are dead, her children live elsewhere and, at 89, she can't get to 
the store on her own, much less prepare daily meals for herself. 
</P>
<P>
	The hot chicken and rice lunch on her table was brought to her  
by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	``A body gets old. ... I used to make lots of spaghetti. But now  
I can't stand,'' says the Italian immigrant. She touches a cut on 
her head from a recent fall, then mentions that she has lost five 
pounds in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many home-bound elderly, Mrs. Mattioli must rely on  
outsiders' help to provide her food. But one group that offers such 
meals -- the non-profit Citymeals on Wheels USA -- cautions that that 
for a growing number who depend on the program, one delivered meal 
is simply not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Malnutrition among the elderly is a serious national  
epidemic,'' said Marcia Stein, president of the New York-based 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem has grown in part because people live longer; it's  
being made worse by Americans' mobility, which often leaves old 
people alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The concern is widespread. In North Carolina, for example, the  
Wake County Meals-on-Wheels estimates that 52 percent of its 
recipients are at risk for malnutrition. Most of those are 80 and 
above, said Vivien Keys, director of the county program. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rhode Island, 900 people receive the $4 to $5 meals daily  
while others are forced to wait more than a year to start getting 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a major crisis. ... We have 300-plus people waiting every  
week who are quite ill or terminally ill. And the problem is 
getting worse,'' said Denise Martin, director of development at 
Rhode Island Meals-on-Wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, most of the 1 million meals delivered to homes daily  
are funded by government. In New York, the private sector provides 
about 37 percent, and Citymeals is trying to raise private 
donations in 20 cities to provide a second hot meal. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, only the most at-risk people in a handful of cities --  
including New York, Miami and Buffalo -- get a second meal. By 
contrast, 41 percent of American cities have waiting lists of 
elderly seeking home-delivered meals. 
</P>
<P>
	For many, isolation is compounded by poverty. Almost 40 percent  
of recipients of home-delivered meals are living below the poverty 
level, on $7,800 a year or less, Citymeals estimates. In New York, 
60 percent of meal recipients live in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those people is Delores Rosenblatt-Groover, 65, whose  
severe arthritis keeps her in bed most of the time as she struggles 
to survive on $277 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't afford to buy vegetables, fruits, desserts,'' she  
said. ``Sometimes I can't get out of bed to prepare a meal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wiping back tears, Ms. Rosenblatt-Groover, who is separated from  
her husband, explains that on the rare occasions someone takes her 
to the grocery she buys as much canned tuna and dry cereal as she 
can afford. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's depressing, sometimes,'' she said.

<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Thirteen U.S. service members injured in a truck  
crash in Haiti that killed two others were being treated at Florida 
hospitals for injuries such as concussions, sprains and cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The injuries are less severe than what we initially  
expected,'' said Col. Glenn Mitchell, command surgeon for the U.S. 
Southern Command in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty officers 3rd class Harleigh F. Lestrick and Scott R.  
Bryant, were killed in the accident Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2 1/2-ton naval vehicle carrying the two men and other military  
personnel overturned after slamming into a dump truck about 8 miles 
from the Port-au-Prince airport near the town of Croix des 
Bouquets. 
</P>
<P>
	The military personnel were on their way to a ceremony

	Six of eight service members taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital  
were expected to be released Saturday. Only one of five taken to

<HEADLINE> Driver Charged in Tour Bus Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRUCKEE, Calif. (AP) -- The driver involved in a Sierra tour bus  
crash last year that killed two passengers and injured nearly three 
dozen others has been charged with misdemeanor manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada County District Attorney's Office filed the charges  
against William Collier, 53, of Clearlake Oaks, Calif., in the 
Interstate 80 crash near Farad, 15 miles east of Truckee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sept. 26 accident resulted in the deaths of a 59-year-old  
Vallejo woman and a 44-year-old Berkeley man. Thirty-five other 
passengers were injured, five of them critically. 
</P>
<P>
	The criminal complaint alleges Collier was driving a Coach USA  
bus from San Francisco to a Reno, Nev., casino when he lost control 
on a curve and allowed it to overturn. 
</P>
<P>
	A California Highway Patrol investigation concluded the bus  
drifted off the roadway after Collier spent too much time looking 
into the rear view mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, he made a driving error when he was changing  
lanes,'' said CHP Sgt. Hal Koehncke. 
</P>
<P>
	``The misdemeanor arises from the fact it wasn't a grievous  
error like drunken driving or reckless driving,'' Koehncke said.

<HEADLINE> Cathay, Pilots' Talks Fruitless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Cathay Pacific Airways and its pilots held five  
hours of talks Saturday without any sign of progress to end a 
sickout that has forced the carrier to cancel half its flights. 
</P>
<P>
	After the discussions, Hong Kong's assistant commissioner of  
labor, Tsang Kin-woo, said there was an agreement to continue the 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay and the pilots had no immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The airline canceled 63 of its 119 scheduled flights Saturday --  
the largest number yet since pilots began calling in sick en masse 
on May 28. 
</P>
<P>
	But the carrier began accepting new bookings for flights from  
Hong Kong to Bangkok, Manila, Taipei, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. 
Cathay halted bookings earlier in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay is demanding that the pilots take pay cuts averaging 7  
percent over two years in exchange for stock options and has given 
them until June 11 to either take the deal, quit or be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting Thursday with Hong Kong labor leaders, Cathay  
bosses agreed to the Saturday meeting with the pilots union for the 
first time since the sickout began. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is that I am pleased that we'll be talking. No  
progress will be made unless we're talking and now we're talking,'' 
said John Findlay, general secretary of the Hong Kong Aircrew 
Officers Association, before the talks started. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay posted a net loss of $69 million last year, running up  
its first red ink since 1963 as passenger traffic plunged amid 
Asia's economic crisis and Hong Kong's deep recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots say that if any union member is fired in the dispute,  
they will take a strike vote.

<HEADLINE> Art's Conquest Wins NJ Classic </HEADLINE>

	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Art's Conquest took the lead deep  
in the stretch and gave driver Mike Lachance and trainer Brett 
Pelling their second straight win in the $500,000 SBOA-New Jersey 
Classic on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Art's Conquest, who posted the fastest winning time last week in  
the three eliminations for this race for 3-year-old pacers, 
bettered his own stakes record by covering the mile in 1:50. 
</P>
<P>
	Royalflush Hanover, driven by Luc Ouellette, finished a length  
back in second place. It was only a nose back to Grinfromeartoear, 
the John Campbell-driven colt who was the other part of Pelling's 
favored entry. 
</P>
<P>
	Pelling also finished 1-3 in last year's New Jersey Classic with  
Shady Character winning and Al For President finishing third. 
</P>
<P>
	Art's Conquest paid $3.60, $2.40 and $2.60 in winning his third  
straight race and earning $250,000 for Brittany Farms of 
Versailles, Ky. and Daisy Acres of Astoria, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an honest little horse, never does anything wrong,'' said  
Pelling, whose has seen the son of Artsplace improve since losing a 
little extra weight the past month. ``He deserves this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Royalflush Hanover paid $3 and $2.80 in losing for the first  
time in six starts this year. Grinfromeartoear, the winner of last 
year's Woodrow Wilson Pace, was $2.60 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Art's Conquest got a perfect trip behind Royalflush Hanover.  
</P>
<P>
	``Speed has been holding up pretty good, but I was right behind  
Luc until the top of the stretch and those two in front had to work 
real hard,'' Lachance said. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell got Grinfromeartoear to the front early from the No. 8  
post and they led the 10-horse field through the first quarter in 
27 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Cam's Rocket, with Kevin Sizer in the bike, took the lead on the  
backstretch, but Campbell quickly took it back and had the lead at 
the half-mile mark in 54 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	As the field reached the top of the stretch, Grinfromeartoear  
had a three-quarter length lead over Royalflush Hanover with Art's 
Conquest another 1 3/4 lengths back and closing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the stretch, those three horses -- the three elimination  
winners last weekend -- were the only ones with a shot at winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Lachance had Art's Conquest pacing the fastest on the outside in  
the final 100 yards and he put the others away. Royalflush Hanover, 
who was in the middle of the pack, just got his nose in front of 
Grinfromeartoear at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got to the front easy enough,'' Campbell said. ``I was able  
to control the pace but he just didn't have enough power to 
finish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shark St Partners finished fourth and was followed by Old  
Buzzard, Falcon's Icon, Relentless Yankee, Art De Triomphe, Card 
Shuttle and Cam's Rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	In the $250,000 Miss New Jersey final for 3-year-old fillies,  
Jack Moiseyev and Woodsie and Buster held off Celebrity Ball to win 
by a half-length in 1:52.1. The Brian Magie-trained filly paid 
$11.80, $4.40 and $4 in winning for the second time in five starts.
