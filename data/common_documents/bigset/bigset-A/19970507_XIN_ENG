<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Press Israel to Halt Settlement Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- An Indonesian political observer
today urged the United States to press Israel to halt the
construction of settlements and dismantle those blocking the peace
process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Without halting the construction of new settlement areas and
reducing the existing ones to the number agreed by the
Palestinians, a just and lasting peace in the Middle East is a
phantasmagoria," said Amien Rais, professor of Political Science
from the University of Yogyakarta, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the United Nations Asian seminar and NGO
(Non-governmental Organization) symposium on the question of
Palestine, Rais said the U.S. government since 1970 had
demonstrated half-hearted position toward the illegal Israeli
settlements, and even sometimes provided protection to Israel's
aggressive actions towards the Palestinians in the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
Rais said the U.S. had been applying double standard with
regard to the Israeli settlements, citing former U.S. President
Ronald Reagan's 1981 declaration after he was elected as president
that the settlements were not illegal.
</P>
<P>
The United States recently twice vetoed a resolution at the
U.N. Security Council which called on Israel to halt the
construction of Jewish settlements in Har Homa of the Arab East
Jerusalem, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, since the signing of the Declaration of
Principles in September 1993 in Washington, have practically
fulfilled everything asked for by the U.S. and Israel, Rais said.
</P>
<P>
"The PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization), as the
representative of the Palestinian people, has denounced terrorism,
recognized Israel, expressed its willingness to change its
covenant to accommodate the U.S. and Israel's demands, and had
done its utmost to prove its sincerity to achieve a just and
lasting peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians have no political cards anymore to bargain
with Israel," Rais concluded.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar, which began on Monday, was attended by
about 200 representatives from the host government, the United
Nations as well as diplomats in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
A number of prominent speakers, parliamentarians and Middle
East experts from Asia and other regions have presented their
papers on various issues surrounding the developments and
deterioration in the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders Down 1.6 Percent in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories dropped
by 1.6 percent in March, the largest decline in seven months, the
U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the factory orders in the month were
down to a seasonally adjusted 319.2 billion dollars. It followed
gains of 0.4 percent in February and 2.5 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. factory orders for the first quarter as a whole
were 1 percent higher than the fourth quarter and 5.7 percent
higher than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The report said that declines were broad-based and led by a
2.6 percent drop in orders for durable goods -- items expected to
last three or more years. Orders for nondurable goods also
declined by 0.3 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
Within durable goods, transportation equipment fell 4.6 percent
in March after a 7.2 percent decrease in February. That included a
20.9 percent drop in aircraft and a 1.5 percent fall in autos.
</P>
<P>
Drops in nondurable goods resulted mainly from less orders in
coal and petroleum products and paper had the largest decreases.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of manufactured goods, a measure of current U.S.
production, edged down by 0.1 percent, the first decline since
December.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders fell 0.4 percent, the first
decline since August.
</P>
<P>
The report fits with economists' belief that U.S. economic
growth was poised to slow to a moderate but still healthy pace in
the second quarter after racing ahead at a torrid 5.6 percent
annual rate in the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> China's Health Strategy Explained at World Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Chinese delegation Dr
Zhang Wenkang today explained China's health strategy of parallel
control of both infectious diseases and chronic and
non-communicable diseases in a speech at the 50th World Health
Assembly here.
</P>
<P>
Dr Zhang, vice minister of health of the People's Republic of
China, said that the Chinese delegation appreciates all the
efforts made by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the
prevention and control of chronic and non-communicable diseases.
</P>
<P>
"China and other developing countries are confronted by the
dual challenge of both infectious diseases and chronic and
non-communicable diseases," said Dr Zhang. "Any progress in the
health field necessitates integrated action against all negative
factors which affect health. The Chinese delegation approves and
supports the view point of WHO that all countries, especially
developing countries, can no longer as in the past cope with
diseases on a haphazard, case by case basis, but must launch
comprehensive control actions."
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Epidemic Prevention Department of the Chinese
Ministry of Health was renamed the Disease Control Department in
order to put emphasis on the control of chronic and
non-communicable diseases, as well as infectious diseases. At the
central and local levels, health education institutes and
professional management and technical advisory bodies have been
set up to implement important programs of the prevention and
treatment of diseases such as cardio and cerebro vascular
diseases, oncology and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee
(CCPCC) and the State Council convened the first national health
conference since the advent of new China in 1949, mainly to settle
a series of important policy issues regarding the reform and
development of China's health work. In January 1997, following
debate and revision at the conference, the Decision of the CCPCC
and the State Council on Health Reform and Development was
published. The decision calls on all localities of the country to
"eradicate and control certain infectious and endemic diseases
constituting serious hazards to the people's health," and at the
same time, "actively work for the prevention and treatment of
cardio and cerebro vascular diseases."
</P>
<P>
"China will continue its active efforts to control such
diseases, thus contributing to global health enhancement and
progress," Dr Zhang said. "The Chinese government thanks WHO and
friends the world over for their continued support and help in the
field of health, and stands ready to continue participating in and
supporting global health action programs."

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin: Reorganization of Russian Cabinet Is Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The formation of the new Russian
government is completely over, Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony to introduce Boris Nemtsov as the new
Minister of Fuel and Power, Chernomyrdin said the recent changes
in the government are "not fortuitous." The cabinet was renewed to
accelerate Russia's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said the reorganization of the government was now
over and practically all ministers have been appointed, while the
main part of the government is fully staffed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he pointed out that this does not mean there will be
no further changes and replacements.
</P>
<P>
The reorganization of the Russian government began late
February when Russian President Boris Yeltsin urged Chernomyrdin
to streamline the cabinet as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the government had been unable to cope with the
problem of pensions, wages and other payments, which gave rise to
displeasure of many people.
</P>
<P>
About 20 heads of governmental departments have been changed in
the restructure of the Russian government.

</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony to introduce Boris Nemtsov as the

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Urges for Nationwide Anti-Terrorism System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia should establish a nationwide
anti-terrorism system in the shortest possible time, Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the first meeting of Russia's federal
commission of anti-terrorism held in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The current situation is pressing for the establishment of such
a system, the prime minister said, referring to last month's
terrorist explosions in Armavir and Pyatigorsk, two Russian cities
in the Caucasus region. Five people were killed and some 30 others
wounded in the two blasts.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin stressed that the significance of the sharp
anti-terrorism struggle should not be underestimated. The
government would fully support the commission and authorize it
with enough power to crack down on terrorism, he added.
</P>
<P>
The anti-terrorism commission was set up early this year,
headed by Nikolai Kovalev, director of the Federal Security
Service.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Signs Law to Promote Small Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today signed a bill into law to spur the development of the
country's small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) through
massive lending assistance.
</P>
<P>
A news release from the Presidential News Office said Ramos
signed the bill before he left for a 10-day visit to the United
States, Mexico and Panama.
</P>
<P>
The new law requires all private and government banks, as well
as other lending institutions, to set aside 8 percent of their
loanable funds for SMEs during the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"This means," Ramos said, "that at least 64 billion pesos (2.4
billion US dollars) of the estimated 790 billion pesos (30 billion
US dollars) available for lending every year in the financial
market will be available to SMEs until the year 2007."
</P>
<P>
He said the new law will definitely enable hundreds of
thousands of small and medium Filipino entrepreneurs to grow and
prosper "on the basis of their self-reliance and resourcefulness."
</P>
<P>
The new law will address the major problem faced by small and
medium scale businessmen of inadequate access to credit facilities
and lending windows, he said.
</P>
<P>
It also reduces the problem of bureaucratic red-tape by
simplifying prevailing requirements, thus enabling more
enterprises to start and expand business, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed from 1992 to 1996, cumulative bank
loans to the country's SMEs soared to 106 billion pesos (4 billion
US dollars) and last year, the number of SMEs increased by 26
percent over that of 1995.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Crisis With Jordan Could be Solved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu today played down the current crisis with Jordan,
saying it was only a "minor difficulty" that could be solved.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was commenting on the move by Jordan's Crown
Prince Hassan to cancel a scheduled meeting with him today
at Naharayim, northern Jordan Valley, where seven Israeli girls
were killed by a Jordanian soldier in March.
</P>
<P>
They were originally to attend a memorial ceremony there
and hold political talks on bilateral issues and the peace
process. But Hassan reportedly canceled the meeting after
Netanyahu rejected a Jordanian request for a bigger share of
water from the Jordan River, a move indicating the growing
tension between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during a tour to an air force base,
Netanyahu described the incident as a "mini-crisis", adding he
believed that a solution could be found.
</P>
<P>
"We have now what I consider a minor difficulty in
implementing one of the provisions of the Jordanian-Israeli
peace treaty. We will overcome it. I'm sure it's one of
those problems that is good to have. Implementing peace treaty
is a good task, and we will implement it," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his reaction, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai denied
that Israeli-Jordanian ties were in crisis other than a
misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1994 peace treaty, Israel has allocated one third
of the promised 150 million cubic meters of water to Jordan,
which is demanding more in order to alleviate a severe water
shortage.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, the second Arab country to make peace with Israel,
is regarded as Israel's closest friend among an increasingly
hostile Arab world. Some Israeli officials blamed Egypt for
discouraging Jordan to move closer to Israel during a time
when the peace process is facing crisis. They believed that
Hassan decided not to grant Israel a high-profile meeting
without getting any payoff because of the Egyptian pressure.
</P>
<P>
On the scheduled meeting between Israeli President Ezer
Weizman and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat late today,
Netanyahu said he expected it to thaw the ice in the
Israeli-Palestinian ties and create a better atmosphere for
advancing the peace process. Peace talks have been frozen
since Israel began late March the controversial building of
Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the reports that Syria is arming its
missiles with nerve gas, Netanyahu reiterated that Israel is
keeping vigil against the missile threats from Syria and its
army has already developed necessary responses.
</P>
<P>
Does Israel face an immediate danger of war? Netanyahu said
he saw no new special danger of war currently, adding
Israeli army is well prepared because "the danger always
exists."
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the outside pessimistic assessment of prospects
for the peace process, Netanyahu said he was optimistic that
the process would move forward and Israel would make peace
with all its Arab neighbors.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Increase Rice Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The seven-nation Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has agreed to increase its rice
reserve to some 64,000 metric tons this year, a senior Philippine
food official said today.
</P>
<P>
Joemari Gerochi, administrator of the National Food Authority,
announced the news during the opening ceremony for the Senior
Officials Meeting of the ASEAN Ministries on Agriculture and
Forestry.
</P>
<P>
The three-day ASEAN agriculture meeting, which opened today in
the southern Philippine city of Cebu, will discuss trade dispute
with the European Union and other regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Gerochi said two more ASEAN countries, Brunei and Vietnam, have
committed their share in the ASEAN food security reserve this
year, which will be 18,000 tons higher than that for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Brunei and Vietnam will provide 4,000 tons and 14,000 tons,
respectively, to the food security rice reserve. The rest will
come from four other ASEAN countries -- the Philippines, Thailand,
Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has committed this year some 14,000 tons to the
ASEAN food reserve, slightly higher than its previous commitment
of 11,000 tons, according to Gerochi.
</P>
<P>
Gerochi did not say whether Singapore, another ASEAN member,
had committed a share for the food reserve.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement among the ASEAN countries, each member
country has to set aside a portion of its annual production of any
given time. But any ASEAN member country contributing to the
region's rice reserve can withdraw, especially during times of
rice crisis.
</P>
<P>
Gerochi said during this meeting, ASEAN food officials will
discuss details on how an ASEAN member country could avail of the
food reserve.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President, Arafat Meet at Erez Checkpoint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
are meeting at this hour at the Erez checkpoint between Israel
and the Gaza Strip, in a bid to resume the Israeli-Palestinian
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's director-general Arye Shumer, and Yitzhak Molcho,
senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, also
attended the meeting, which started at 6 p.m. local time
(1500GMT).
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Weizman said that he hoped that his meeting
with Arafat would help break the impasse in the peace
negotiations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"I hope we will find a way to move the peace process
forward," said the Israeli president.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior PNA official played down expectations of the
meeting, saying it would be just a formal meeting, and "will have
no political objectives."
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, Arafat's spokesman, warned against
building up expectations, adding that "Weizman has limited
ability to influence the Netanyahu government."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli media today reported that the Israeli
government is expected to adopt a more flexible policy and
propose a number of gestures to the Palestinians in an effort
to resume the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials are reportedly expecting a breakthrough with
the Palestinians at the Weizman-Arafat meeting after negotiations
between the two sides suspended for several weeks following the
Israeli decision to build Jewish settlement in Har Homa in Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu met with Weizman Monday night to lay the groundwork
for today's meeting, which was arranged with the active
participation of the United States, whose special Middle East
coordinator Dennis Ross is to arrive in the region Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As a gesture to the Palestinians, Israeli security forces
today demolished two illegal buildings at the Jewish settlements
of Yitzhar near Nablus in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army's central command Uzi Dayan also ordered to
confiscate illegal weapons among Jewish settlers in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that gestures and confidence-building
measures are now being hammered out, which include consultations
with the U.S. and large-scale construction for Palestinians,
even in Jerusalem. The construction projects also include the PNA
airport in Dahaniya in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu met with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and
Foreign Minister David Levy last Wednesday, and the three reportedly
decided on gestures to be made towards the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Package for Development of Capital Market Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
announced a new economic package to develop capital market and
promote investment, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Aziz said that the package
approved by the Economic Coordination Committee today envisaged
major decisions for the development of capital market and
promotion of local as well as foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Under the new package the period of capital gains tax
exemption, which will expire in June, 1998, has been extended by
another three years, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
This decision would help remove uncertainty among investors,
Aziz said, adding that he hoped it would motivate investors
particularly those who had a long-term investment perspective.
</P>
<P>
He said the package also envisaged exemption of bonus shares
from tax.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote foreign investment in the government
securities as well as in corporate fixed income securities, Aziz
said tax was removed on foreign investment in these instruments.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors investing in Pakistani rupee dominated
instruments were exposed to currency exchange risks and the
package would provide an environment conducive to foreign
investment in both government and corporate fixed income
securities, he said.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Host International Conference on Nazi Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Labor government
announced here today that it would host an international
conference to discuss unresolved issues on millions of dollars of
gold seized by the Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Britain's new Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement
issued this afternoon, "I am announcing today that the British
government is ready to host an international conference on Nazi
gold."
</P>
<P>
"The (British) Foreign Office will now consult organizations in
UK and other governments about how best to take this forward," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Cook, whose Labor Party snatched a landslide victory in the
general election, said that there was a strong case for looking at
compensation for individual victims of Nazi persecution or their
direct descendants.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that some gold taken from individual victims of
Nazi persecution may have found its way into the pool. This
strengthens the case for looking imaginatively for ways of
compensating victims or their direct descendants," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Tripartite Gold Commission, set up in
1946 and run by Britain, the United States and France to restore
looted gold to its rightful owners, would be able to complete its
work as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
British government officials said they expected the conference
to take place before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Tripartite Gold Commission has always maintained that all
of the gold it is holding was looted from the central banks of
countries occupied by the Nazis. But Jewish groups have maintained
that between five and 10 percent of the gold belonged to private
individuals.
</P>
<P>
The Tripartite Gold Commission has distributed about four
billion dollars worth of gold to central banks. None has gone to
individuals. It still has about 68 million dollars left in its
coffers.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliament Ratifies Oil Agreement with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's National Assembly
(parliament) has ratified an Iraqi-Russian oil agreement on the
second stage development of the west al-Qaranah oil field in
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi parliament unanimously ratified the agreement at a
session held on April 13 under the chairmanship of speaker
Saadoun Hammadi and with the participation of oil experts,
according to the Iraqi News Agency (INA) today.
</P>
<P>
On March 21, Iraq and Russia signed the agreement here for the
second stage development of the west al-Qaranah oil field at a
cost of 53 billion U.S. dollars over a period of 23 years.
</P>
<P>
The oil field, 500 kilometers south of Baghdad, is among the ten
oil fields which Iraq intends to develop in cooperation with world
oil firms during the last few years.
</P>
<P>
The total production of the oil field is expected to reach 4.4
billion barrels during the term of the contract. The agreement
will be implemented after the U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq is
lifted, INA said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, with proven crude oil reserves of more than 110 billion
barrels, expects to earn receipts of more than 70 billion dollars
over the contract period, Iraqi authorities said. The oil
reserves of the west al-Qaranah oil field is estimated at 7
billion to 8 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is the first of its kind since the U.N. imposed
sanctions on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko said today that Belarus will develop relations with
other countries on the basis of equality.
</P>
<P>
Belarus, as an independent sovereign state, has the right to
decide its own foreign policy in consideration of the interest of
the Belarussian people, Lukashenko told Itar-Tass news agency,
referring to the diplomatic disputes between Minsk and Washington.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Belarus and the United States
deteriorated earlier this year after Belarus expelled Serge
Alexandrov, first secretary at the U.S. Embassy in Minsk, on March
23, for allegedly steering anti-government protests in Belarus.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, the two countries recalled each of their
ambassadors. The Belarussian ambassador returned to Washington
Monday after his U.S. counterpart went back to Minsk last week.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegate Calls for World Attention on Chronic, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Chinese delegation Dr
Zhang Wenkang today called on the world health community to pay
attention to the prevention and control of chronic and
non-communicable diseases.
</P>
<P>
They are not problems only affecting developed countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In a debate on "World Health Report 1997: Conquering Suffering,
Enriching Humanity" at the 50th World Health Assembly here, Dr
Zhang, vice minister of health of the People's Republic of China,
said that the Chinese delegation agrees to the analysis of the
global health situation made by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and approves WHO Director-General Dr Hiroshi Nakajima's
selection of prevention and control of chronic and
non-communicable diseases as the theme of this year's health
report.
</P>
<P>
"China and other developing countries are confronted by the
dual challenge of both infectious diseases and chronic and
non-communicable diseases," said Dr Zhang. "Any progress in the
field of health necessitates integrated action against all
negative factors which affect health. The Chinese delegation
approves and supports the view point of WHO that all countries,
especially developing countries, can no longer as in the past cope
with diseases on a haphazard, case by case basis, but must launch
comprehensive control actions."
</P>
<P>
To better fulfill the task, Dr Zhang put forward the following
proposals:
</P>
<P>
-- It is necessary to publicize the significance of prevention
and control of chronic and non-communicable diseases among all
countries and at all levels of administration, raising their
awareness that this will not only reduce mortality but, what is
more important, improve the quality of life and alleviate the
social burden, cut down medical expenditure and accelerate
mankind's progress and social development;
</P>
<P>
-- To strengthen community action, create a supportive
environment and public health policies is the key to success. WHO
should make further efforts to obtain high level political
commitment and government support to this end;
</P>
<P>
-- WHO should actively encourage countries with successful
experiences for control and prevention of chronic and
non-communicable diseases, namely the USA, Finland and Australia,
to cooperate with and provide greater support to developing
countries;
</P>
<P>
-- Community health services should be strongly advocated and
an integrated community health service network should be
established. The network should consist of prevention, care,
treatment and rehabilitation, and with health as the focus, the
family as the unit and the community as the basis.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Freezes Operations of Canadian Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government today
decided to freeze temporarily the operations of Canadian Bre-X
Minerals Ltd. and its subsidiaries in the country, pending legal
certainty over a gold mine.
</P>
<P>
"Legal certainty is needed following the differences in the
findings of Bre-X and Strathcona Minerals (independent auditor),"
Mines and Energy Minister Ib. Sudjana said.
</P>
<P>
Bre-X last Sunday said it had received Strathcona's report
which said there is no economic gold deposit in the southeast zone
of the Busang mine in Indonesia's East Kalimantan province.
</P>
<P>
Bre-X stunned the world last month when it announced the gold
deposit at Busang reached 70 .95 million ounces making the shares
fly to the high position on the Toronto and Calgary Stock
Exchanges.
</P>
<P>
However, Bre-X discovery was then rejected by a U.S. mineral
company Freeport, which claimed that it has previously carried out
a research on the gold deposits and the results showed that stone
samples taken from seven holes depicted insignificant deposits.
</P>
<P>
And then an independent audit was carried out under tight
security by Canadian consulting company Strathcona Mineral Service
Ltd. to determine the size of the deposit.
</P>
<P>
Strathcona said on Monday, only trace amounts of gold have been
found in the samples assayed, and there were no samples that gave
gold values of economic interest.
</P>
<P>
Sudjana said the government also froze temporarily the
company's letters of principles dated March 17, 1995 and October
3, 1995 for explorations in Busang, as well as its contract of
work in Indonesia, including Busang.
</P>
<P>
He further said the government has ordered the police to
investigate the great disparity between the findings of Bre-X and
Strathcona to make it easier to take legal action against Bre-X.
Bre-X owns 45 percent of the Busang property, Freeport has 15
percent, the Indonesian government has 10 percent and Indonesia's
Nusamba Group has 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Freeport and Nusamba said Monday they are pulling out of the
Busang project following the stunning report by Strathcona.

<HEADLINE> Continued Gold Price Slide Worries Zimbabweans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harare, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A top Zimbabwean mining industry
official warned today hundreds of jobs were on the line in the gold
mining sector due to the continued fall in the price.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Chamber of Mines Chief Executive Derek Bain said some
companies like Falcom Gold had already retrenched staff because they
could no longer absorb the high costs, which were not being
compensated by a viable price on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are puzzled with the slide of the gold price, which was
triggered in the third quarter of 1996 by panic selling of the
mineral by European central banks in a bid to help balance books so
as to meet the strict criteria for European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
The gold price which at present is about 341 U.S. Dollars per
ounce is for the next six months expected to heave in 345-365
U.S. Dollars per ounce.
</P>
<P>
Bain said, ''If the gold price remains weak, we will see more
mines retrenching workers due to the performance of the gold
sector.''

<HEADLINE> Palm Leaves Offer Constructive Alternative to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian construction experts are
convinced that palm tree leaves could be used to replace
steel-reinforced concrete to build low-cost and energy-efficient
homes in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
Samir Abdel Azim, head of the quality control department at
Egypt's Atomic Energy Authority, said that "for developing countries
this material could mean a construction boom," the latest edition
of Middle East Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Azim, who spent four years on mechanical, chemical and
physical tests to examine the durability of fronds, said palm
tree fronds (PTF) are leaves from palm trees with a two to five
meter stalk that contains cellular tissues traversed by strands of
fibrovascular bundles that provide fluid transport and structural
stability.
</P>
<P>
PTF, which abound in Arab regions, are a "cheaper and better
tool than reinforced steel and can solve many civil engineering
problems in areas where conventional materials fail to satisfy,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Adding PTF to cement-based matrices results in the production
of an inexpensive, lightweight, heat-insulating building material
that can sustain excessive strains, he said.
</P>
<P>
It not only has a higher tensile strength compared to steel but
is also more economical, costing 38 dollars per tonne compared to
380 dollars per tonne of steel, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Azim, who built a prototype unit in 1995, underlined the
"insulation" effect of the vaulted structure, noting that a 12
degree centigrade difference was registered between inside and
outside the unit.
</P>
<P>
"This means that energy bills can be greatly reduced," said
Abdel Azim, who published his research in several specialized
foreign reviews.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Neguib, an engineering professor at the American
University in Cairo who has carried out similar experiments,
warned, however, that further research should be carried out to
ensure how well PTF reacts to cement "because PTF is not stable in
size and absorbs humidity."

<HEADLINE> Education Reform Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Opposition Zimbabwe Congress Party (ZCP)
today urged the government to include trade courses in the schools
curriculum to reduce the high unemployment rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement ZCP President Kenneth Mano said the country was
producing thousands of graduates who ended up becoming ''intelligent
criminals'' because there were no employment opportunities for them.
</P>
<P>
The country's education system churns out over 300,000 school
leavers annually, of which only a fraction is employed.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of practical subjects has been debated in
educational and employment circles but to date very little has been
done as the country's education system is still academically
oriented.
</P>
<P>
Mano said inclusion of courses like management could enable
graduates to be self reliant rather than joining the already
overflooded job market.
</P>
<P>
''Graduates in practical subjects can easily start their own
projects and the government could then chip in with financial
assistance,'' said Mano.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government should reduce the size of the 23
member substantive cabinet and the 40,000-plus army and re-direct
resources to employment generation projects. enditem

<HEADLINE> Bre-X Stock Hits Bottom on Toronto Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Shares of Canada's Bre-X Minerals
Ltd. hit rock bottom at the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) today
before trading was halted due to a system failure.
</P>
<P>
Bre-X shares opened today at six Canadian cents, down from 3.23
dollars last Friday, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Six cents a share puts the company's market valuation at 10
million U.S. dollars. It was once valued at about 4.3 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35.4 million shares changed hands in about an hour.
That was about half the TSE's normal overall daily trading volume.
</P>
<P>
Today was the first time that trading in Bre-X stock reopened
since it was revealed late Sunday that the Calgary-based mining
company had engaged in the world's biggest mining hoax.
</P>
<P>
Bre-X has acknowledged publicly that its much-touted Busang
gold discovery in the Indonesian jungle may hold no gold at all.
</P>
<P>
An independent audit report concludes that Bre-X Busang project
holds no minable gold and has been the product of a massive
campaign of deceit and fakery.
</P>
<P>
"The magnitude of the tampering with core samples... is without
precedent in the history of mining anywhere in the world," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the Indonesian government announced the freezing of
all activities of Bre-X and its subsidiaries operating in the
country until investigations are completed.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Strike Guerrilla Bases in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes this afternoon
carried out an air raid on guerrilla bases of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in southeast Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The air strike caused some damages. However, no reports on
casualties were available for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Israeli fighter-bombers dived from the blue sky at 3:30
p.m. (1230 GMT) and fired four air-to-surface missiles at targets
on the hills of Ein Tini and Tomat Niba in the Western Beqaa,
some 80 kilometers southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the area said that black smokes were
witnessed rising into the sky and shrouding the area
for nearly one hour.
</P>
<P>
The raid was followed by a violent round of bombardment
between guerrillas in the western Beqaa and Israeli outposts
on the hills of Abmadiyeh, Kaukaba, Gliyteh and Billayah.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that Israeli forces fired more than 40
mortar shells at the suspected guerrilla targets, without causing
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced that one group of its fighters launched an attack at
a position of the Israel-backed South Lebanon Army militia
near Timat Niha at 3:30 p.m..
</P>
<P>
"A fierce clash erupted between the resistance fighters and
the SLA militia in which various weapons were used," the
paramilitary force of Hezbollah said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, two civilians were killed and two others
wounded in the explosion of two bombs on the outskirts of the
south Lebanese market town of Nabatiyeh.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Radio Lebanon reported that at 11:25 a.m.
(0825 GMT) two roadside bombs exploded on the Nabih Berri
Road east of Nabatiyeh, overthrowing a pickup and killing the
two men inside.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a five-nation group monitoring the
limited truce on the Lebanese-Israeli border is to hold a
meeting at the south Lebanese town of Naqoura Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the
United States will discuss a complaint filed by Israel to
the cease-fire monitoring committee over a Monday attack by
Lebanese guerrillas on a patrol of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army militia.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, in which two
SLA militiamen and four civilians were wounded.
</P>
<P>
In the complaint, Israel accused Lebanese guerrillas of
violating the cease-fire understanding which the Jewish state and
Lebanon reached on April 26, 1996, and which demands fighting
sides in south Lebanon to keep civilians away from their military
operations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa, A Potential Emerging Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
( by Chen Cailin )
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The 32nd session of the
Eeconomic Commission for Africa (ECA) and 23rd meeting of the
Conference of Ministers responsible for economic and social
development and planning started today to discuss ''accelerating
trade and investment in Africa'' which is the theme of the 4-day
meeting.
</P>
<P>
African economic ministers and senior economic experts
believed that a new and dynamic Africa which is committed to
becoming competitive in the world markets is being recognized by
the international community as potential emerging market rathern
than aid dependent disasters.
</P>
<P>
Africa, with one-fifth of world's land and one-eighth of
world's population, is endowed with huge natural resources. More
than 500 years ago, western colonialists tried to plunder its
rich resources. Today many precious raw materials needed by the
developed world are imported from Africa. Apart from gold and
diamonds that underpin South Africa's economy, Africa has 97
percent of world's chrome, 85 percent of its platinum, 64 percent
of its manganese and 25 percent of its uranium. Africa supplied
20 percent of the world's traded oil and 70 percent of the
world's cocoa, one-third of its coffee, and about 50 percent of
its palm produce. However, Africa's share in world production and
trade has declined in last two decades, and its share in the
world exports has fallen from 5 percent in 1980 to less than 2
percent in 1996. Currently Africa's production is only about two
percent of the world production.
</P>
<P>
Africa has attained economic recovery for three years running.
Last year, Africa's gross domestic product growth surpassed its
average population growth rate of 2.8 percent, representing a
turn around in real per capita income in almost a decade. In
nearly half of African countries, economic growth has outpaced
population for two years in a row. A new and dynamic africa is
emerging in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to some senior economic experts in Africa, firstly
some African countries have opened up their stock markets to
foreigners. The enthusiasm in stock market development in africa
is evidenced by the surge of Wall Street interest in Africa, the
increase in investment funds being traded in New York and Europe
-- from zero in 1992 to over one billion U.S.Dollars -- and, by
the increased number of stock exchanges, now at 16.

</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Secondly, there are also
encouraging signs of growing interest in portfolio investment.
Since 1994, more than 12 Africa-oriented funds have been set up.
Initially focused on the South African markets, the base has been
broadened to include a number of other African countries, such as
Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the rates of return in foreign direct investments
have generally been much higher in Africa. During 1990-1994,
rates of return in foreign direct investments in sub-Saharan
average 20-30 percent, compared to 16-18 percent for developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, the U.S. trade with 11 southern african countries is
roughly equal to U.S.trade with all 15 republics of the former
Soviet Union. Significantly, U.S. exports to Africa have been
growing at over 20 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
And fifthly, Malaysia and other east Asian states are
strengthening economic and trade links with South Africa,
Botswana and Malawi. Already, South Africa has been Malaysia's
chief trading partner in Africa, with bilateral trade reaching
544 million U.S. Dollars in 1996, up from 353 million dollars a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
These promising developments have proved that Africa is being
recognized by the international community as a potential emerging
market. But, there are two challenges facing the region, one is
durable peace and stability which is sine qua non for effective
development in the continent. The other is to increase investment
to Africa, promoting economic development and trade of the
region. Meanwhile, Africans have rich experiences and lessons in
maintaining peace in the region. Since the early sixties, an
estimated 10 million Africas, the vast majority of whom are
civilian, have lost their lives as a result of armed conflicts.
Africans say: ''It is no longer good enough to cry peace, we must
act peace and live in peace.'' For the economic development of
the continent, African economic ministers and senior experts are
deliberating at the ongoing meeting with the theme of
''accelerating trade and investment in africa''.
</P>
<P>
It is certainly that Africans can develop their backward
economy and build a brighter future for themselves.

He requested the Chinese premier to convey to the Chinese people
the profound appreciation and gratitude of the Zambian people for
the untiring support which they are giving to the people of Zambia.

has China displayed any "big brother" tactics or interfered in
the internal affairs of African countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese State Councillor and Minister in Charge of Economic
Restructuring Li Tieying also spoke at the ceremony, saying the
establishment of the joint venture marks the beginning of the
economic cooperation in multiple forms between China and Zambia.

for the cooperation of mutual benefit between enterprises of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, Li Peng visited a workshop of the textiles
factory of the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture is a trial project in China's reform of the
model of giving economic aid to other developing countries. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA to Resume Security Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) have agreed to resume security
cooperation as the first step to restore trust between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Israeli President Ezer Weizman at a
joint press conference with PNA President Yasser Arafat following
their two-hour meeting this evening at Erez checkpoint between
Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said that his meeting with Arafat was aimed at
"breaking the ice" between the Israel and the PNA, and trying
to solve the current problems.
</P>
<P>
This was the first high level meeting between Israel and the
PNA after the Israeli government decided to start building a new
Jewish neighborhood in Har Homa in East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
During the press conference, Arafat praised Weizman's efforts
to push forward the peace process, stressing that "it is our
duty to protect the peace process for the sake of our
children."
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that security officials from the two sides are
to discuss ways to resume cooperation so as to bring
security to both Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's director-general Arye Shumer, and Yitzhak Molcho,
senior advisor to Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, also
attended the meeting, which started at 6 p.m. local time
(1500GMT).
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Weizman said that he hoped that his meeting
with Arafat would help break the impasse in the peace
negotiations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"I hope we will find a way to move the peace process
forward," said the Israeli president.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media today reported that the Israeli government is
expected to adopt a more flexible policy and propose a number of
gestures to the Palestinians in effort to resume the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu met with Weizman Monday night to lay the
groundwork for today's meeting, which was arranged with the
active participation of the United States, whose special Middle
East coordinator, Dennis Ross, is to arrive in the region
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the crisis in the peace talks
following Israel's decision to build the Har Homa settlement
in March, Israel appears to be softening its tone.
</P>
<P>
As a gesture to the Palestinians, Israeli security forces
today demolished two illegal buildings at a Jewish settlement
of Yitzhar near Nablus in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army's central commander Uzi Dayan also ordered to
confiscate illegal weapons among Jewish settlers in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that gestures and confidence-building
measures are now being hammered out, which include consultations
with the U.S. and large-scale construction for Palestinians and
the PNA airport in Dahaniya in the Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Ban Public Concerts, Fashion Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwait National Assembly
today passed a bill banning musical and singing concerts and
fashion shows in public places on ground that these activities
contradict the rules of Islamic Sharia Law.
</P>
<P>
The draft law was passed in a session chaired by speaker Ahmad
Al-Saadoun by 26 to two votes and the cabinet members (also members
of the parliament) abstaining in the 50-member National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Offenders would be punished by a six-month prison sentence
and a fine of a maximum 500 Kuwait dinars (1,650 U.S. dollars),
according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Information Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah said
after the session that the government had its own reservations on
the bill, indicating that the objectives included in the bill
could be realized without making new laws.
</P>
<P>
In response to complaints by some parliamentary members that
there were contraventions in some of the concerts, he said "I
hope there should be no auctioneering on this issue. The Kuwaiti
society is known for piousness and if some contraventions were
committed, then the Information and Interior Ministries are
there to deal with."
</P>
<P>
But parliamentary members backing the bill spoke of the need
for such a law to fight wrong practices against the Islamic
Sharia.
</P>
<P>
They are of the opinion that Kuwait is a conservative society
and what "we are after is to save the youth from the negative
affects of such parties."
</P>
<P>
However, other parliamentary members said specific crimes in
this respect were yet to be defined.

UNITED NATIONS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
today called for direct government food aid to the Democratic
People's Repubic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Catherin Bertini, executive director of the WFP, told reporters
that she made the appeal because the WFP can only manage and
monitor the distribution of 205,000 tons of food, which falls
short of the 1.3 million tons of food needed by the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
According to Ms. Bertini, the DPRK need altogether 2.3 million
tons of food. While the DPRK said it can by itself raise 1 million
tons of food, the other 1.3 million tons of food has to come from
the donations of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Bertini said the WFP has got 40 percent of the 205,000 ton food
appeal from the international community. This food will go to
children under six, hospital patients and elderly people.
</P>
<P>
The food shortage in the DPRK was caused by two years of severe
floods. Many lands are now covered by mud, where plantation is
impossible.

at Dhehyal Mountain, 25 km northwest of the central town
Beletuein.
</P>
<P>
According to Chairman of the Islamic Court in the town, Sheikh

He called on local geologists to visit the area and assess its
danger.

A local religious student, who also visited the area,
confirmed the death of some goats after they drank from a water

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) would have to increase economic
integration that would bring the benefits of an enlarged market
of some 130 million people in the region, South African President
Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing session of the first "Southern Africa
International Dialogue on Smart Partnership for the Generation of
Wealth", held in northern Botswana city Kasane, Mandela, the
current SADC chairman, said progress in this direction had been
made possible by the political stability that the region now
enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
The people of southern Africa had seized the opportunity to
declare their preference in the most practical way for democratic
governance, the entrenchment of a culture of human rights, and

<HEADLINE> Genscher Calls for Strengthened Cooperation With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Former German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher has made a strong call upon Western
countries to strengthen their cooperation with China, saying "a
cooperative world order is unthinkable without China."
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Genscher in an article to be carried
by the Thursday issue of the German Der Tagesspiegel newspaper in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
In the article titled "Not Without China," Genscher said the
key question for the fate of the humankind in the coming century
was: would the multipolar world order with several political and
economic power centers replace the bipolar one? And would this
lead to a cooperative world order characterized by the responsible
cooperation among the big countries and the big regional groups on
the basis of equality?
</P>
<P>
Genscher, who is also honorary chairman of the Free Democratic
Party, the junior partner of the German ruling coalition in Bonn,
and member of the German parliament, said that China, with a
population of 1.2 billion, has set off on the route towards market
economy and has meanwhile become the fastest-growing economy in
the world.
</P>
<P>
"China is playing an increasingly significant role in the world
politics and the world economy," he said. "This can be prevented
by nobody, and moreover, nobody should make the attempt to prevent
it."
</P>
<P>
"Those who wanted today to deny China the equal place in a
cooperative world order would have to play a high price for that
tomorrow," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the central task on the threshold to the new century to
make common efforts together with China towards global stability"
in the political, economical, social and ecological areas,
Genscher said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the globalization made it more urgent to create a
cooperative world order. But "whether this succeeds will also be
determined by the cooperation of China," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The more access China will be given to the international
economic organizations, the more successful the efforts towards
cooperation with China will be," Genscher said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "our actions must be characterized by efforts to
integrate the new world power China in a cooperative world order,"
Genscher said in conclusion.

<HEADLINE> AL Voices Deep Concern Over Turkey-Israel Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Cairo-based Arab League today
voiced deep concern over the recent Turkish-Israeli moves in
security cooperation which it fears to pose threat to Arab sates.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Israel and Turkey finalized their plan
during a meeting in Jerusalem Monday to hold a joint, three-way
naval exercises in the Mediterranean sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Defense Minister Turhan Tayan has reportedly said that
the recent Israeli-Turkish-U.S. agreement on security cooperation
is targeted against Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned with the threats intimated by the
Turkish Defense Minister against Arab states, especially Syria,
following his recent visit to Israel," said the league's Secretary
General Esmat Abdel Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Meguid further deplored these recent moves but he underlined
that the Turks are free in their policies and the Arabs do not
have the right to interfere in their internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the Arabs hoped that Turkey, as a
Muslim state, would have given due account to the "Arabs' feelings
and the difficult situation in the region caused by the Israeli
intransigent policies."
</P>
<P>
He termed the timing as inappropriate "as we are witnessing
Israel's insistence on hindering the peace process and
threatening the region's stability and security via its unlawful
policies."
</P>
<P>
The league is following up the Israeli-Turkey moves towards
security cooperation as Turkey is considered a neighborly state.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omar Ikbal said
that its anti-terrorist cooperation with Israel was not directed
against any country in the region and that the agreement it had
signed with the Jewish state is like those signed with other
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have bolstered defense ties with a series of
cooperation agreements, including a joint military training
agreement, heavily criticized by Iran and Arab countries, and the
632.5 million dollars project to upgrade the Turkish F-4 jet
fighters.

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts Revised Guidelines for Maritime Transport Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union (EU), today adopted revised
guidelines for state aid in the maritime transport sector.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines will replace those drawn up in 1989 and are
aimed at encouraging the development of the EU's shipping sector,
said a press release issued here today.
</P>
<P>
Action is urgently needed to prevent further decline in the
EU-flagged fleet which brings with it loss of know-how and jobs in
shipping and related on-shore activities, the commission noted.
</P>
<P>
It also said that a more transparent methodology would allow
the EU member states to exempt shipping from fiscal and social
charges, or to reimburse those charges.
</P>
<P>
The 1989 guidelines already allowed the EU member states to
compensate ship owners for the cost gap between operations under a
flag of convenience and those under an EU flag.

<HEADLINE> OAU Worries Increasing Refugees in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU) today in Abuja presented a gloomy picture of the serious
refugee situation in Africa and called for concerted efforts from
within and outside the continent to combat the issue.
</P>
<P>
In a report presented before the on-going summit of African
first ladies on peace and humanitarian issues, the OAU said that
when it was established in 1963, there were only 500,000 refugees
in Africa, but today the figure is an alarming six million.
</P>
<P>
Africa, the poorest continent in the world, is also grappling
with an estimated 20 million displaced persons, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Africa's refugee population is still
increasing at a rate of 100 percent every five years, and 75
percent of them are women and children.
</P>
<P>
Mines in Africa's 18 conflict areas have resulted in maiming
and killing of hundreds of innocent victims.
</P>
<P>
Massive movement of people was recorded in war-torn areas of
Liberia, Somalia, Sudan, Angola and recently the Great Lakes
region.
</P>
<P>
The report said the movement of refugees has brought about the
over-stretching of facilities in receiver countries and the
devastation of the environment.
</P>
<P>
It called the on-going summit to help in the mobilization of
funds to help tackling the problems.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the OAU report, the first ladies of Brudundi,
Tanzania and Niger Republic acknowledged the impact of refugees
on their countries and the need for efforts from within and
outside the contient to address the situation.
</P>
<P>
They remarked that there was inadequacy of funds to manage the
crisis, since individual countries, according to them, cannot
adequately handle the situation on their own.

LUANDA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A workshop on Angola's agricultural
rehabilitation and development started here today, aimed at
helping the Angolan government set effective agricultural policy
and development strategy.
</P>
<P>
When opening the seminar, Angola's acting Prime Minister Pitra
Neto said here today that the 20-year-long civil war has
seriously damaged agricultural production in the country, which
caused more severe poverty, unemployment and shortage of food.
</P>

He noted that to reverse such situation, the government should
take practical approaches, formulate consistent policies and
strategies to promote and protect recovery of agricultural
production in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop, jointly sponsored by the Ministry of
Agriculture of Angola and the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization, is attended by 120 participants from Angola's

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Hails Good Relations With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government and people
are waiting for the visit by Chinese Premier Li Peng to the west
African country, Minister of Information and Culture Walter
Ofonagaro said here today.
</P>
<P>
Noting this will be the highest Chinese official to visit
Nigeria, the minister said, "we are very pleased that the Chinese
government and people are, by this visit, confirming their highly
regarded friendship that exists between Nigeria and China."
</P>
<P>
"We believe the visit will further strengthen the ties and
intensify economic and social co-operation at all levels," the
minister, who is also spokesman of the Nigerian government, told
Xinhua during an interview in his office.
</P>
<P>
The minister who visited China in 1995 noted that the Chinese
government has managed to administer such a big country of 1.2
billion people while making great achievements.
</P>
<P>
"You have a lot to teach the world and we think we can share a
lot with the Chinese people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria in its own development needs the support of China and
the two countries can enhance their co-operation in political and
economic issues, as well as in fields of science and technology
and culture.
</P>
<P>
In economic and trade co-operation, Ofonagaro said, Nigeria
has proved more than 450 varieties of minerals of commercial
quantity, including coal and iron ore, to be developed.
</P>
<P>
China has rich experience in mining and the two countries can
co-operate well in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Other fields for further development and co-operation include
down-stream processing of minerals, textiles, electronics, high
technology, energy, engineering construction, railway,
agriculture and pharmaceutical industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that after the visit of the Chinese
premier, he will go to Beijing to sign with China a cultural
co-operation agreement.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to boost cultural and sports exchanges between
the two countries, as well as those journalists, student and
scholars, he added.

<HEADLINE> US Army Drill Sergeant Sentenced to 25 Years for Raping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Army Drill Sergeant Delmar
Simpson, convicted of raping six female trainees, was sentenced to
25 years in prison today by a military jury in Aberdeen, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Simpson, who could have been sentenced to life in prison on a
single rape conviction, was also sentenced to reduction in rank
and forfeiture of pay, and was dishonorably discharged from the
service.
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated for two and half hours to reach a decision
on his sentence on 18 counts of rape and 34 other offenses, mostly
other forms of sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
Simpson, 32, had pleaded guilty to 11 counts of consensual sex
and five counts of propositioning, for which he faced a maximum
sentence of 32 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
He was the first of 12 trainers charged with various acts of
misconduct at Aberdeen.
</P>
<P>
The sentence also will be automatically reviewed by the U.S.
Army Court of Criminal Appeals.
</P>
<P>
Although race was barely mentioned during the trial, there have
been accusations of racism from some black leaders. All 12
soldiers charged at Aberdeen are black while most of their
accusers are white.
</P>
<P>
However, the Army denied race played a part in its
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the jury, Simpson apologized to his wife, his
two children, his fellow drill sergeants and the trainees.

<HEADLINE> Investment in Africa Moves Into Service Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment
(FDI) flows to Africa are moving into service industries, leaving
behind a traditional concentration on the region's primary
commodities, a new report of U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCAD) said.
</P>
<P>
The World Investment Directory on Africa, released in the U.N.
headquarters today, said the reason for this is that African
countries have opted over the past decade for a favorable
investment climate.
</P>
<P>
"Countries that have traditional been relatively open to FDI,
such as Kenya and Zimbabwe, have liberalized their regulatory
frameworks further to attract more investment," the directory
said.
</P>
<P>
"During the 1990s, even countries with traditionally
unfavorable attitudes towards FDI, such as Ethiopia, Guinea and
Mozambique, introduced new legislation offering a wide range of
guarantees and opportunities for foreign investors," it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the directory said, the liberation of investment and
trade regimes is responsible for a new phenomenon: the emergence
of the African transnational corporation.
</P>
<P>
Although still modest in absolute terms (4.5 billion U.S.
dollars in 1996), FDI flows to Africa are responsible for a
significant share of gross domestic capital formation and gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The directory said FDI represents 4.8 percent of capital
formation -- approaching levels recorded in Asia and Western
Europe -- and 10 percent of GDP, compared with about 13 percent
in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the directory said, compared with other parts of the
world, overall volumes of FDI for Africa remain low, and thus a
source of concern. And African least developed countries are
even worse off. They received less than one fifth of total
inflows to the continent during the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
Western European investors still dominate FDI in Africa. Firms
from France and the United Kingdom, for instance, account for
more than four-fifths fo the Western European stock in Africa.
</P>
<P>
But a noteworthy development is that South East Asian countries
have begun to show interest in the continent, mainly for South
Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati held talks here this evening with his Lebanese
counterpart Farez Boueiz, President Elias Hrawi and House
Speaker Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
Velayati delivered to Hrawi a message from Iranian President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, in which the Iranian president invites
Hrawi to participate in a summit conference of Islamic countries
to be held in Tehran next December.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister announced at the end of the
meeting that the Lebanese president accepted the invitation.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Velayati stressed the importance of
cooperation between Arab states and Iran, and underlined his
country's support for Lebanon's efforts to liberate its land
from the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his meeting with Berri, the Iranian minister
praised a role played by the house speaker in Lebanon's
resistance movement against the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
"Every time I come to Lebanon, I always have a meeting with
the house speaker and we have very good relations with him as a
real fried of Iran," the Iranian foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Berri is the head of the Lebanese Amal movement, a moderate
Muslim Shiite organization which is competing with the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, another Shiite organization whose name is
usually translated as Party of God, for its flagship status
in the resistance movement.
</P>
<P>
"Berri has played an extremely important role in establishing
the resistance in south Lebanon," Velayati said. "There is
an important cooperation between Berri and other leaders in
Lebanon for resisting daily Israeli aggressions against the
Lebanese people."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister arrived at the Masnaa crossing
on the Lebanese-Syrian border from Damascus at 5:30 p.m. (1430
GMT) and was greeted by Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
Velayati and Boueiz held talks at the premises of the foreign
ministry on the latest developments in the region and relations

<HEADLINE> Jordanian-Israeli Ties Cooling as Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian-Israeli ties strained
after Crown Prince Hassan canceled a meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu scheduled to be held today at the
Jordanian town of Baqura along the Jordanian-Israeli borders.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources here said that the move was in protest to
Israel's failure to implement the water article in the
Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty signed in 1994, which stipulates
that Jordan shall obtain 150 million cubic meters of water from
Israel to cover Jordan's urgent needs.
</P>
<P>
The Hassan-Netanyahu meeting was supposed to be held in the
border area of Baqura in northern Jordan Valley, where seven
Israeli girl students were killed by a Jordanian soldier on March
13.
</P>
<P>
They were originally to attend a memorial ceremony there and
hold political talks on bilateral issues and the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Following the the Crown Prince move, Jordanian King Hussein
also reportedly canceled a scheduled visit to Israel next month,
showing support to the prince.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement here today, Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam Majali said that Jordan had not obtained its water
quota as specified in the peace treaty, and that Israel had not
honored its commitments to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir
Mutawe has disclosed after today's Jordanian cabinet meeting that
the council of ministers discussed the tension in
Jordanian-Israeli relations due to the Israeli government failure
to honor its water commitments to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
He added that Jordan had been seeking to resolve the water
differences with the Israeli side, but Israel insisted on denying
Jordan's water quota.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian government sources indicated that the Jordanian
Minister of Water and Irrigation Munther Haddadin and Israeli
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon have also canceled a meeting
scheduled to take place later to discuss the water issue, as
Israel is not reacy to supply Jordan with more water.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which is the second Arab country to make peace with
Israel, is considered Israel's best friend among the increasingly
hostile Arab world.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian government today
approved the merger of nine political parties which will be
the largest pro-government political grouping in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The birth of the National Constitutional Party (NCP) was in the
interest of the nation, the people and the parties themselves,
Radio Jordan quoted Interior Minister Munzir Rasheed as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new party is believed to play an important role in the
decision-making process, as its members include more than 20
lawmakers in the 80-member parliament, three of whom are incumbent
Cabinet ministers, as well as dozens of former lawmakers and
ministers.
</P>
<P>
NCP is also expected to combat the major opposition party,
Islam Action Front (IAF), who shares certain seats in the
parliament and usually lashes out at the government led by Abdul
Salam Majali appointed by King Hussein.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Zambian Deputy Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, Zambia, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng, now
on his official visit to the country, met with Somon Mwila,
deputy speaker of the National Assembly of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said he was pleased to meet with friends from the
Zambian National Assembly and appreciated the role played by the
National Assembly in the country's political life. Li Peng also
conveyed regards from Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress, to National Assembly
Speaker Robinson M. Nabulyato.
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply impressed by the the rich resources, fertile land
here and the political stability of Zambia," Li Peng said, adding
that he welcomes more Zambian MPs to visit China so as to enhance
friendship through increasing exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Mwila thanked Li Peng for arranging the meeting in his tight
schedule and briefed Li Peng on the setup and function of the
National Assembly. The Zambian National Assembly, the government
and the people all treasure their friendly relations with China
and sincerely hoped for learning China's experience, including
the experience of China's NPC, so as to keep advancing the
Zambian-Chinese relationship, Mwila said. Mwila also expressed
his satisfaction with the increasing exchanges between the
parliaments of the two countries and their cooperation within the
Interparliamentary Union.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Mwila on China's unique system of multi-party
cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of
the Chinese Communist Party, Li Peng said, this system is born
out from the long-time practice and proved to be suiting most to
China's specific conditions. As for the National People's
Congress and its Standing Committee, Li Peng said, they conduct
supervision over the work of the government and at the same time
offers strong support to the government's work.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Zambia are developing countries and they are
sparing no efforts in building their countries by following the
road suited to their specific conditions, despite the differences
in political systems and national conditions, Li Peng said. Facts
have proven that only by basing itself on the specific
conditions, can a country win success in developing its economy
and building up its democracy. "For developing countries, their
top priority is to develop economy, raise the people's living
standards and maintain social stability," Li Peng stressed.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call For Global Efforts To Stop Soil Deterioration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- At the "Soil, Human, and Environment
Interaction" seminar today, in Nanjing, capital city of East
China's Jiangsu Province, a group of Chinese and overseas experts
said that stopping the deterioration of soil through scientific
means is urgent.
</P>
<P>
The worsening of soil conditions is an increasingly serious
problem globally, according to those present at the seminar, who
said that eroded land, marshes, and deserts now make up 16.8
percent, 10 percent and 33 percent of the earth's surface,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Of the 730 million ha. of cultivated land on earth, five
million ha. become useless annually. It is estimated that a third
of the world's cultivated land will disappear within 20 years and
grain production in 117 underdeveloped countries will drop by 19
percent, if long-term protective steps are not taken.
</P>
<P>
With its cultivated land accounting for seven percent of the
world's total and its population for 22 percent, China faces a
severe shortage of farmland, which amount to only a third of the
world's average for each person.
</P>
<P>
Eroded land accounts for a sixth of the country's total,
resulting in a huge loss of the earth's nutritious elements, which
is equivalent to about half of the country's yearly fertilizer
output.
</P>
<P>
At the tree-day seminar, the participants said they agree that
developing ecologically-sound farming is an important means of
halting soil deterioration and improving the overall capacity of
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
They said that international research should be done on soil,
because there are many different factors involved in the problem
of soil deterioration.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Meets With Members Of US Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong
and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, meeting in Beijing
today with members of the American media, spoke about why the
Provisional Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) should be established.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese have always advocated a "through-train"
arrangement, meaning that, if the last Legislative Council of the
British Hong Kong government were to conform to the Basic Law and
the decisions of the National People's Congress, its members could
become members of the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong
SAR.
</P>
<P>
But, the British side unilaterally disregarded the agreement
between the two sides and sabotaged the "through-train"
arrangement, so members of the last Legislative Council of the
British Hong Kong government cannot become members of the SAR
Legislative Council, he pointed out, and the Provisional
Legislative Council had to be established to avoid a legal vacuum.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the Provisional Legislative Council is only a
provisional institution, whose job is to pass a few laws that are
absolutely necessary after the SAR government is established.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong", and high-degree of autonomy policies will be
take effect in Hong Kong after 1997. The SAR goverment can
maintain economic and cultural relations with other countries,
regions, and international organizations, in the name of "Hong
Kong, China", and can sign agreements.
</P>
<P>
The SAR will also retain its free port and a separate tariff
zone status, and have its own customs office, he added. It will be
financially independent, and commercial contracts of Hong Kong
will be valid after 1997 and will be carried out in complete
accordance with Hong Kong laws.
</P>
<P>
The US media delegation, consisting of eight members, came to
Beijing on May 3 at the invitation of the Better Hong Kong
Foundation. The members are from some US media including
Washington Times and the Journal of Commerce.

up 5-2 and he won on his first match point when Kiefer sent a
forehand wide.
</P>
<P>
Kiefer was the first to be taken on Becker's junior
team. Winner of the 1995 junior titles at the Australian and
U.S. Opens, Kiefer turned pro that year, but has not played a full

<HEADLINE> US Accuses Swiss of Aiding Germany in World War II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's neutrality during
World War II supported "Germany's capacity to wage war" and
prolonged the war, said a U.S. report released today.
</P>
<P>
The report said it was proved that gold, jewelry, coins and
melted down dental fillings of concentration camp victims were
taken by the Germans, mixed with plundered bank gold and re-melted
into bars that were traded abroad.
</P>
<P>
But the report, made by 11 U.S. government agencies and
compiled under the direction of Commerce Undersecretary Stuart
Eizenstat, said they found no evidence that neutral countries such
as Switzerland knowingly accepted such tainted gold bars.
</P>
<P>
"No proof has been found that the countries to which Germany
traded gold robbed from persecutees knew of the origin of such
gold," said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, in an introduction to the 200-page report, Eizenstat
sharply criticized both the Swiss and U.S. governments --
Switzerland for using neutrality as the excuse of doing business
with Nazis and the U.S. for not negotiating stronger post-war
agreement to force Switzerland to pay reparations.
</P>
<P>
"In the unique circumstances of World War II, neutrality
collided with morality; too often, being neutral provided a
pretext for avoiding moral considerations," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland and others "ignored repeated Allied entreaties to
end their dealings with Nazi Germany," Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever their motivation, the fact that they pursued vigorous
trad withe Third Reich had the clear effect of supporting and
prolonging Nazi Germany's capacity to wage war," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the "most inexplicable" was the persistence of a
"business as usual attitude by Switzerland" to the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. showed little "senior-level support" for
a tough negotiating position with the neutral countries.
</P>
<P>
"Neither the U.S. nor the allies pressed the neutral countries
hard enough to fulfill their moral obligations to help Holocaust
survivors by redistributing heirless assets for their benefit," he
said.

<HEADLINE> UK Industrial Output Falls 0.1 Pct in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Total industrial output in Britain
fell unexpectedly by 0.1 percent in March although rising 0.5
percent year-on-year after falling a provisional 0.6 percent in
February, showed official figures today.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics said today that
manufacturing output, which excludes energy industry output, also
dropped by 0.1 percent in the month, compared with a 0.2 percent
rise in February.
</P>
<P>
The figures gave further evidence of the country's widespread
industrial weakness. In the first three months of this year,
manufacturing output rose by only 1.4 percent, down from 1.7
percent in the year to February.
</P>
<P>
Most experts had predicted a 0.6 percent monthly increase in
industrial output in March, to give a 1.5 percent year-on-year
rise.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the lower-than-expected figures confirmed
that the strength of sterling was beginning to hurt exports and
any further interest rate rises would inflict greater damage to
industry.
</P>
<P>
Britain's new Labor Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown
raised UK base interest rates by 0.25 percent to 6.25 percent
Tuesday. Economists said that the move would probably hurt the
industrial sector even more by propelling the pound even higher.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran's paramount leader Ali Khamenei
here today warned the presidential candidates against any
compromise with the United States and the Western world.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei urged the whole nation not to vote for any contender
who would "show the slightest softness toward the U.S., western
governments' interference and their cultural invasion."
</P>
<P>
"The enemy is determined to influence the presidential
election as well as the intellectual and cultural milieu of
Iran," said the Iranian leader when meeting a group of families
of the martyrs and high-ranking officials of the Islamic
Revolution Guards Corps.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei made his statement a few hours after the Guardian
Council approved four candidates for the country's 7th
presidential election scheduled for May 23.
</P>
<P>
The candidates are Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri,
former information minister Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri, former
cultural and Islamic guidance minister Mohammad Khatami and Deputy
Judicial Chief Reza Zavarei.
</P>
<P>
Among them, only Khatami, a 59-year-old who ever served as
culture adviser for president and head of Iran's National Library,
is considered as moderate and liberal-minded.
</P>
<P>
A public opinion poll which released earlier today, showed that
Nateq-Nouri is the leading candidate that might win the
elections. Khatami, only 7 percent point behind, is the only serious
threat to Nateq-Nouri.

<HEADLINE> Direct Shipping Across Taiwan Strait To Help Fujian (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The newly-opened direct cargo linking
between two ports in southeast China's Fujian province and a port
in Taiwan province is certain to bring new opportunities to
Fujian's economy, according to government officials and scholars
in Fujian.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the shipping link will serve not only
to boost cross-straits trade and help reduce costs and time in
transit, but will also be conducive to the overall economic
development of Fujian as well as neighbouring regions of Zhejiang,
Jiangxi, and Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Fuzhou and Xiamen are 165 and 240 nautical
miles respectively from Kaohsiung port in Taiwan. But that route
was closed for nearly half a century and, in fact, it was only in
the 1970s that transshipment through countries like Japan and the
Republic of Korea was available. But even that was a waste of time
and money.
</P>
<P>
With the rapidly increasing trade across Taiwan straits in
recent years, this wasted time and money became increasingly
intolerable.
</P>
<P>
"The experiment in direct shipping provided us with the
historical chance to increase cross-straits ties and to reach
common prosperity," according to Zhang Jiakun, vice governor of
Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Fujian, in fact, has attached great importance to its economic
exchanges with Taiwan ever since the opening up and reforms
began.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians' Science, Technology Knowledge Still Low: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysians' knowledge about
science and technology (S&AMP;T) is still rather low, according to a
study on "The Public Awareness of Science and Technology Malaysia
1996" released here today.
</P>
<P>
Less than 10 percent of the nationwide sample of 5,055
respondents surveyed consider themselves as knowledgeable about
S&AMP;T issues such as aerospace, new scientific and medical
discoveries, according to the study commissioned by the Malaysian
Science and Technology Information Center.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that only 31.5 percent of the respondents said
that their knowledge in the S&AMP;T area of environmental pollution is
excellent.
</P>
<P>
The level of interest in S&AMP;T is generally moderate, according
to the findings of the study released by Science, Technology and
Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding.
</P>
<P>
However, more Malaysians report that they are very interested
in the applications of computer technology and environmental
pollution and the majority of the respondents believe that S&AMP;T has
enhanced working conditions and improved the standard of living
and public health, the findings show.
</P>
<P>
The study says that the Malaysians' awareness and understanding
of environmental terms seem to be high with regard to air
pollution, flash floods, solar eclipse and haze but only a small
proportion of Malaysians have a clear understanding about global
warming, ozone layer depletion and acid rain.
</P>
<P>
Television and newspapers are the primary source of information
for Malaysians while science publications are the least utilized
source of information, the study says.
</P>
<P>
The study recommends effective S&AMP;T promotional programs,
increasing interest and knowledge of S&AMP;T among students,
increasing youth participation in S&AMP;T activities, improving rural
population's participation in S&AMP;T activities, effective use of
media and encouraging Malaysians to visit S&AMP;T related
institutions.

<P>
By the end of 1996, the province had used three billion US
dollars of Taiwan investment, accounting for 16.9 percent of
its total overseas investment, and Fujian-Taiwan trade amounted to
2.4 billion US dollars, accounting for 17.4 percent of the
province's total foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
However, provincial trade officials were still not satisfied
with the situation, when they compared it with ties between
Guangdong and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
But, "because the direct link will help reduce shipping cost by
about 30 percent and sharpen the competitive edge, it will
certainly boost trade and direct investment by a big margin," said
Tang Hanqing, deputy director of the provincial communications
department.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the increased cross-straits shipping, Fujian
spent more than 30 billion yuan (3.6 billion US dollars) on sea
and airports, navigation channels, roads, and power supply between
1991 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
The cross-straits ties are expected to help bring prosperity to
all of Fujian, and parts of Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and
Hunan provinces, a 270,000 sq.km. area with a total population of
about 80 million.
</P>
<P>
"With a three-dimensional transportation network in Fujian and
the growth in direct shipping, Fujian is expected soon to
establish itself as an important strategic point in the opening-up
drive of the southeast coastal regions and economic and trade
cooperation with Taiwan," concludes Xia Guinian, a researcher at
the Academy of Social Sciences of Fujian.

<HEADLINE> Pak to Introduce Reforms in Financial Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance Minister Sartaj
Aziz said here today that basic reforms in financial management of
the government would be introduced besides strengthening audit
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the remarks while inaugurating a three-day workshop
on "Project for Improvement of Financial Reporting and Auditing"
jointly organized by the Pakistan Audit Department and the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that the potential of a supreme audit institution was
being explored for ensuring transparency in operations, promoting
accountability and combating malpractices and corruption.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the reforms, Aziz said, would be on good
governance and strengthening the institution of legislative audit.
</P>
<P>
He said an efficient financial system was essential for
effective management but the financial accounting and auditing
system in Pakistan did not make much headway.
</P>
<P>
The financial reporting system is inadequate, and the methods
and practices continued to be outdated, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said various reforms introduced by the government in
agricultural, industrial and banking sectors, tax collecting
system and governmental machinery were in various stages of
formulation and implementation.
</P>
<P>
The success of the reforms would mainly depend upon the timely
availability of authentic financial and other data, he said.

<HEADLINE> Top Chinese Washing Machine Manufacturer Taking Lead In Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Little Swan Co., Ltd., a state-owned
washing machine firm in Wuxi city of east China's Jiangsu
Province, managed to survive a major financial crisis to become
the largest producer of washing machines as well as a legend and a
prominent example for other debt-ridden state-owned enterprises in
China.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, before it began its overall structural reforms and
took the lead in the country's state-owned sector, company losses
were a staggering 1.89 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the company was making a million washing machines, and
generating sales of a billion yuan, with 170 million yuan in
profits, according to its annual report.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Dekun, president of the company, said that Little Swan's
success showed that the state-owned sector can come out of its
present stagnation as long as it has the following conditions:
good products, wise marketing strategy, efficient management, and
a brilliant team of leaders.
</P>
<P>
When Little Swan was running in the red in 1989, the company's
board members realized that the out-of-date technology was the
major source of inefficient operations. So, without hesitating,
they imported manufacturing technology for automatic washing
machines, which was still not available on the Chinese market,
from Japan and made the first breakthrough in salvaging the
company by themselves.
</P>
<P>
The first Little Swan washing machine earned a profit of 300
million yuan, providing greater financial support for
technological development. But this success was also attributed to
imported marketing strategy, an improved sales-service network,
and a well-educated team of sales people, explains Xu Yuan, vice
president of the company.

<TEXT>
<P>
Little Swan began to spend more on a country-wide sales network
by the end of the 1980s, recruiting a great number of university
graduates, with the result that it got a more than 40 percent
share of the domestic market, much higher than both domestic and
overseas competitors.
</P>
<P>
As in the case of other state-owned enterprises, Little Swan
had many faults in management previously, Xu noted, so, it studied
Siemens' and Matsushita's style and expanded its scale of
production and product range to reduce market risk and stimulate
the creativity of employees.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company began to issue stock in 1993, with the
state controlling most of the shares. In that way, it raised more
than 560 million yuan at home and abroad, with state-owned capital
increasing from 47 million yuan to 330 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Because of his company's success, Xu says that the changeover
to a stock-issuing company, with the state being the largest stock
holder, could be an effective method to break the capital
bottleneck in many state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to the senior managers at Little Swan, government
support can also be pointed to as another major reason for the
company's take-off. Little Swan is one of 300 top state-owned
enterprises with priority in financial and policy support from the
central government and one of the top ten enterprises with access
to aid from the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that the central government's policy of "aid the big,
let the small be free" was a turning point in reforming the
state-owned sector, providing more opportunities for the
enterprises across the country.
</P>
<P>
As the domestic market becomes more internationalized and more
overseas companies entered China, the government should concentrate
resources in some good performers and in big enterprises to
improve big money makers and the country's economic clout, Xu
noted.

HAIKOU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun,
who visited Hainan province, Chinese southern island economic
zone, from May 3 to 7, urged the island to develop tropical
agriculture to promote rapid economic growth in the province's
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged the provincial government to make efforts to
develop the island into a major production base for tropical
fruits and vegetables. He said that a profitable industry with
local characteristics should be directly established on careful
market research, because it is market demand that decides the
prospects of any industry.
</P>
<P>
In addition, farmers and investors should be provided with
preferential policies to help form an efficient mechanism to
develop agriculture with local characteristics, Jiang said, and
that the local government should encourage scientists to enter the
agricultural sector and improve the processing industry for
agricultural produce.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, the development of agriculture with local
characteristics should be based on stable grain production. Land
and proper conditions for cereal crops should be guaranteed, in
order to achieve a higher grain output country-wide, he added.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Renewed Between Warlords in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 7 (Xinhua)-- At least five people were killed
and 10 others wounded last night when armed clashes renewed
between the forces of Hussein Mohamed Aidid and those of his
rival Osman Hassan Ali Atto in South Mogadishu, said
eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the renewed fighting is not known, however both
sides have accused the other for igniting the renewed hostility.
Militia officers supporting Osman Atto's faction said they lost
none of their fighters in the armed confrontations that took
place at K-7 junction of Southwest of the capital. Nevertheless,
hospital sources reported that both sides have suffered
casualties.
</P>
<P>
During the three hours long fighting, the two sides have used
a number of technical vehicles supported by infantry militiamen.
The fighting followed two days of continuous sporadic shoot out
between the rival militiamen at K-7, Hosh militia base and Zone-K
front lines where the opposing militiamen of Osman Ali Atto and
Hussein Mohamed Aidid remain in defensive positions.
</P>
<P>
Last night's fighting came only two days after a meeting
between Hussein Aidid and Osman Atto took place in Yemen in new
efforts for putting an end to the hostility between the two sides
that could serously hamper any peace deals in Mogadishu.
Mogadishu citizens widely spoke about the new peace efforts by
the president of Yemen, Ali Abdalla Saleh.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there's a growing fear of bad harvest for the
season following severe floods that hit several farm lands in the
Southern regions of the country. At least 500 cultivated lands in
Lower Jubba are reported to have been destroyed by the floods
from the Somalia's largest river, Jubba. Many villagers are also
reported to have fled their houses and farms in the area between
Kamsuma and Yontoy, 430 Km South of the capital.
</P>
<P>
There are also news of floods from Middle Shabelle,Lower
Shabelle and Galgudud regions after heavy rains hit those areas
and the Shaba mountains of Ethiopia where Shabelle river
originates from.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Initiates Financial Market Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has initiated
financial market reforms aimed at catching up with its Asian
neighbors which are now considered as global financial centers, a
senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito told
a meeting of financiers that the government has recognized that
the financial institutional and regulatory framework may have to
be revised.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, the country's economic planners are
reviewing existing laws on foreign equity ownership in investment
companies, investment houses and financing companies.
</P>
<P>
Habito said the emerging responsibilities of the Securities and
Exchange Commission in the growing equity market are also being
studied.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines encouraged the establishment of mutual trust
and pension funds and enhanced the role of postal offices as bank
service units in the rural areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Habito said the government also plans to set up a Philippine
Stock Exchange subsidiary, the Philippine Options and Futures
Exchange, to handle the trading of derivatives in the country and
will start with the stock index futures.
</P>
<P>
Learning from the experience of Asian neighbors, he said, the
country has put tremendous efforts to further develop transport
and communications technology, keep facilities efficient and
improve information data gathering techniques.
</P>
<P>
The socioeconomic planning chief said more policy reforms will
soon be implemented through legislation to fully realize the
prospects for the country to become a world financial center.
</P>
<P>
The government is now reviewing a set of tax reforms that seek
to make the country a more competitive base of regional and global
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
A committee jointly participated by private financial experts
and government analysts is also currently reviewing various types
of taxes currently imposed on financial instruments and
transactions, he said.

WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton wrapped up his visit to Mexico by
signing joint statements with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo on
drug and border management issues. A slew of minor bilateral
agreements were also signed, but major differences were left
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
-- NATO's Secretary-General Javier Solana and Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said that they had made some progress
toward an agreement on a security charter to govern relations
between an expanded NATO and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Mobutu Sese Seko plans to leave Zaire Wednesday
for what government officials described as a regional summit in
nearby Gabon, stirring speculation that the Zairian leader is
planning his final exit from the country he has ruled for nearly
32 years.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen has decided to reduce
planned purchases of jet fighters, shrink the Navy's fleet, cut up
to 60,000 active-duty service members and seek to close more
U.S. military bases, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
The wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Orders to U.S. factories fell 1.6 percent in March, the
biggest drop in seven months and another sign that the economy is
poised to slow to a moderate but still healthy pace in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
-- In a sign that Britain's new Labor government in some ways
may be more conservative than the Conservatives, Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown took a major step toward making the Bank of
England an independent central bank and announced a base interest
rate increase of one-quarter of a percentage point.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's trade deficit for the
first three quarters of the current financial year ending June 30
stood at 2.624 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The latest official figures available here show that Pakistan's
balance of trade during the nine-month period decreased by 52
million dollars as compared with the same period of the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's exports from July 1996 to March 1997 stood at 6.129
billion dollars while imports in the same period totaled about
8.753 billion dollars, showing a balance of 2.624 billion dollars
in negative.
</P>
<P>
According to a government source today, the ratio of increase
between exports and imports is believed to be one to eight at
least, and it is hard to bring down the imports level below
exports figures.
</P>
<P>
With only one quarter remaining before the end of the current
financial year, there are no signs for major improvement in the
export sector. It is estimated that Pakistan's trade deficit is to
reach 3 billion dollars in the 1996-97 fiscal year.

KINSHASA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko
left here this morning for the Gabonese capital Libreville for a
mini-summit with several other French-speaking African leaders on
the emergency situation facing his country.
</P>
<P>
The mini-summit will begin Thursday with the attendance of
President Omar Bongo of Gabon, Pascal Lissouba of Congo, Ange
Patasse of the Central African Republic, Idriss Deby of Chad,
Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea and Gnassingbe Eyadema
of Togo.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Libreville, President Mobutu went
down from his plane with difficulty and there was a very brief
welcoming ceremony presided over by President Bongo at the airport.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first mini-summit by French-speaking African
leaders on the crisis of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Some of these African leaders have reportedly complained about
the refusal by South Africa to let them attend the face-to-face
meeting between Mobutu and the rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila
on Sunday on a South African navy vessel.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu is expected to seek the support from central and western
African French-speaking countries to his proposal for a peaceful
transition of power in Zaire and for the organization of a free
election.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu has so far refused to resign, a precondition presented
by the rebels for peace. He will return to Kinshasa on Friday,
according to Zairian presidential entourage.

<HEADLINE> China Gives Priority To Building Expressways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China will build a total of 6,500 km
freeways will be built to increase its entire length of
expressways to over 8,000 km during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
China's speed in building expressways is quite fast, even
compared with some developed countries, such as France, Britain,
Italy and Japan, whose mileages of express-roads have merely
reached 7,500 km, 3,000 km, 6,500 km and 6,000 km respectively
after 30 to 40 years of efforts.
</P>
<P>
Dong Xuebo, an official with the Ministry of Communications,
made the remarks at today's closing session of the "China
High-Level Policy Seminar for Highway Sector".
</P>
<P>
Dong, who made a closing speech on behalf of the ministry, said
that China hopes to introduce more overseas technology, expertise
and funds to develop expressways in the country.
</P>
<P>
Pan Xiaojiang, an official with the Ministry of Finance,
informed the audience of some latest figures on the cooperation
between China and the World Bank in the road-building fields.
</P>
<P>
To this day, he said, World Bank loans have been used in 18
road projects in China, with the amount totaling 3.34 billion US
dollars, including 370 million US dollars soft loans and 2.97
billion US dollars hard loans.
</P>
<P>
Of the projects, 10 have been completed, comprising 1,480 km
expressways, according to the official who is in charge of affairs
with the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Pan said that the Chinese government has made road construction
a main user of World Bank loans, adding that the policy has been
well-understood and supported by the international financial
institution.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that while providing loans for Chinese road
projects, the World Bank would bring into consideration the
countrys' practical situation and not to raise unrealistic demands
on China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Richard G. Scurfield, a World Bank official from the China and
Mongolia Department, praised the remarkable achievements made by
China in building roads, and he predicted that the two parties
would further their cooperation in the field.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day seminar, which was jointly sponsored by the
Ministry of Communications and the World Bank, over 100 local and
overseas experts and officials discussed issues on construction and
management of highways in China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Meets HK Entrepreneurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, a standing committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee, meeting in Beijing with a delegation from the
Business and Professionals Federation of Hong Kong led by its
Chairman Lo Hong-sui, emphasized that the principle of "one
country, two systems" is a fundamental guarantee for Hong Kong's
prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
In extending a warm welcome to the delegation, Li said that the
Chinese government has the sincerity and determination to apply
this principle. He noted that there are 55 days left until Hong
Kong returns to the motherland, a major historic event wiping out
the shame of the Chinese nation and the whole country will join in
the jubilation.
</P>
<P>
In the past 100 years, he noted, there are only a few events
like the victory in the Anti-Japanese War, the founding of the
People's Republic of China, and the downfall of "The Gang of Four"
that were celebrated all across the country. And Hong Kong's
return to the motherland can be described as just such an
event. So the Hong Kong compatriots and the mainland people should
make an effort to do the job well and contribute more to Hong
Kong's smooth transition and its stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Li, also chairman of the national committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, said those present at
the meeting were all influential business people in Hong Kong with
very good reputations in the mainland. In the past, he said, they
did much useful work for the return of Hong Kong to the motherland
and for the mainland's economic development as well.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that these achievements, which have not come
easily, will be treasured, and that there will be more
contributions to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic about Hong Kong's future and have confidence
in it," he said, noting that, "to implement the principle of 'one
country, two systems' is not a strategy, but is for the
fundamental interests of the Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that both Hong Kong and the mainland, the Central
government and all local departments have the responsibility to
make an effort to resolutely implement this principle to help
maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Lo said that the confidence of the people of Hong Kong in its
return to the motherland has been increasing, and that its
stability and prosperity will be partly because of the mainland's
support and development.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that after its return, Hong Kong will further
strengthen its economic cooperation and coordination with the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
CPPCC and head of the United Front Work Department of the CPC
Central Committee, was also present at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Lufthansa Reports Record Profit in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- German airline Lufthansa today reported
a record 20 million mark (11.5 million U.S. dollars) pre-tax
profit in the first quarter this year, compared with 69 million
marks (39.9 million U.S. dollars) in losses a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Cologne-based company said in fact it was the first time it
made profit in the first quarter of a year.
</P>
<P>
Revenues for the first three months rose 8.5 percent on the
annual basis to close to 5 billion marks (2.9 billion dollars),
despite a 1.2 percent drop in passenger volume and a 2.7 percent
fall in the number of flights.
</P>
<P>
According to Lufthansa, stronger long-distance transport,
especially between Germany and North America, wherein passenger
kilometers rose 23.2 percent, pushed international revenues up by
9.4 percent to 4.4 billion marks (2.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The company said that its domestic business declined in the
first quarter with passenger kilometers down 13.5 percent, due to
competition from newcomers in the market.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Lufthansa's turnover increased 4.8 percent over 1995
to 20.9 billion marks (12.1 billion dollars), with pre-tax profit
at 686 million marks (397 million dollars), down 9.3
percent.

<HEADLINE> Grassland, Forest Fires Spreading in Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 grassland and
forest fires in Mongolia's 11 provinces have destroyed 3.49
million hectares of grasslands and 5,863 hectares of woods since
February, a Civil Defense official said today.
</P>
<P>
The fires have claimed 1,600 heads of livestock and burnt down
11 yurta and 14 flock folds, Vice Director of Mongolia's Civil
Defense Committee Dornod Tserendavaa told Xinhua in telephone.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 25 prairie and forest fires are still spreading,
almost 20 more than 10 days ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian government has mobilized 8,530 people, 525 trucks
and 173 tractors to put out the fires, but the work was delayed
due to the fact that the country is vast and sparsely populated.
</P>
<P>
The country is also short of modern transport facilities and
fire-fighting equipment, Tserendavaa said.
</P>
<P>
Prairie and forest fires often break out in the dry and windy
spring in Mongolia, in which meadow and pastures account for
nearly 80 percent of the land and forests account for about 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, prairie and forest fires burnt 1.05 million hectares
of grasslands and forest in 16 out of the 21 provinces in the
country. The ecological and economic loss was estimated at two
billion U.S. dollars.

</P>
<P>
During today's trading session, 8 billion shares changed hands
with a total value of 2.2 billion pesos (about 86 million U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Singapore Should Be Conscious Of Each </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian King Tuanku Ja'afar
said today that Malaysia and Singapore should always be conscious
of each other's sensitivity and feelings in all matters.
</P>
<P>
The cooperative relations between the two countries, developed
over the years, have brought many mutual benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, being neighbors, we need always be mindful of the
realities that shape our relationship," the king was quoted as
saying by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama after
receiving the credentials of new Singapore High Commissioner to
Malaysia Kesavapany Krishnasamy here.
</P>
<P>
Tuanku Ja'afar stressed that paramount in such a relationship
is the consciousness of each other's sensitivities and feelings in
all matters.
</P>
<P>
The supreme head of Malaysia made the statement in the wake of
recent press reports by both Singapore and Malaysia on each
other's social problems, which had negative impacts on the two
countries' ties.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that certain facts of history which could
complicate our relations should not stand in the way of our
endeavor to cooperate for the common good," the king said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two countries are not only close
geographically, but also share a common history and their peoples
have inherited common traditions and family ties across the
causeway.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the proximity of the two countries offers
opportunities for fruitful cooperation and such potentials could
only be realized if leaders of the two countries draw lessons from
the past and avoid pitfalls in the future.
</P>
<P>
"While there are many ties which bind us, we must also
recognize the fact that we are two different countries, but our
differences, however, should not be a cause for division as the
differences should be harnessed for the benefit of both
countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Bernama, the new Singapore high commissioner said
the government and people of Singapore attach great importance to
 relations between the two countries, which are closely linked
through common cultural traditions, shared history and
geographical proximity.
</P>
<P>
"Family ties and people-to-people links contribute to the
unique relationship between our two countries and the governments
of Malaysia and Singapore both pursue economic policies aimed at
promoting peace and prosperity in the region," Kesavapany was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the two countries also share many common
interests in regional and international fora such as the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the United Nations.

<P>
"Essentially 'the rule of law' must be on "managing officials,"
instead of 'managing citizens,'" said Fang Tingwang, secretary of
the Taishan City Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
He asked: "How can officials ask the public to abide by the law
if they do not perform their duties according to law?"
</P>
<P>
Since President Jiang Zemin and other senior leaders attended
lectures on legal knowledge, 25 provinces, autonomous regions, and
municipalities have held such lectures for provincial officials to
learn the knowledge of laws and regulations, and study theories
and practices on the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The determination of top Chinese leaders and localities to
attain the goal on the rule of law is evident, said legal experts
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The rule of law should cover various aspects of legislation,
education on legal knowledge, law enforcement and supervision,
said Si Zhiguang.
</P>
<P>
The NPC and its Standing Committee have enacted more than 300
laws since 1979, and local lawmaking bodies have also formulated
their own regulations in line with local conditions, covering all
aspects of political, economic, and social life..
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, with a relatively developed market economy, has been
prominent in this regard, Si said.
</P>
<P>
However, an official with the Press and Information Department
of the NPC Standing Committee said that the law enforcement
situation is far from satisfactory, the public awareness of law,
especially that of officials, has yet to be boosted, and the
mechanism of supervision over power needs to be improved.

<P>
The goal for the rule of law is designed to solve these
problems, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the NPC and the Ministry of Justice, efforts to
intensify law enforcement, spread the knowledge of law and
formulate rules for all kinds of government, industrial, and business
operations are being made throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The public is enthusiastic about this drive.
</P>
<P>
"We even didn't know we broke the law in the past. Now that we
all act according to law, I must have a good legal knowledge
myself," said 42-year-old farmer Liao Tianhong, turning pages of a
yellow-covered booklet printed with selected articles of law.
</P>
<P>
Whenever he had the time, Liao, a farmer in Zhaoqing City,
Guangdong Province, read the booklet. He even found himself more
interested in televised lectures on law than soap operas, because
"they are more useful," he said.
</P>
<P>
Villagers said that after the "rule-of-law" campaign, domestic
violence and village fights have been markedly reduced, and
village officials have performed their duties more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
The NPC press official said that the current drive to promote
the rule of law will continue all over the country.

MOSCOW -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin said in an interview
published on Wednesday that his country simply can not bear the
burden of the current huge military machine, so the Russian army

cannot find a lasting peace unless through an orderly transition

LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in

</P>
<P>
The Times:

the government's decision to give operational independence to the
Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- William Hague, the former Welsh Secretary, will join the
race for the Tory leadership today after backing out of a

<P>
The Guardian:

<HEADLINE> Poll Envisages Hardliner Victory in Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- An public opinion poll published
today indicates a possible success of the hardliner Parliament
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri in the upcoming Iranian presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the National Center for Studies and
Assessing Public Opinion and carried on the English daily Tehran
Times, showed 40.8 percent of the 1,182 pollees gave their support
to Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 33.8 percent of those polled said they would vote
for former culture and Islamic guidance minister Seyed Mohammad
Khatami, 8.2 percent for former information minister Mohammad
Mohammadi Reyshahri, and 11.8 percent for other candidates.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 5.4 percent refused to make any comments,
according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the chances of success of the presidential
candidates, 63.8 percent of the pollees, including those in favor
of other candidates, said they believed that Nateq-Nouri would be
the next president.
</P>
<P>
Since there are still two weeks before the presidential
elections and the candidates have not launched their election
campaign, this opinion poll cannot be taken for granted as the
views of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
The May 23 presidential elections, the 7th of its kind since
the founding of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979, will choose
the successor of President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who has to
step down after assuming this office for eight years in light of
the Constitution.

<HEADLINE> NZ, German Leaders Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The visiting German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and his New Zealand counterpart Jim Bolger met this
afternoon shortly after arriving here for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a brief press conference this evening, Bolger said
the two leaders share "common views" on the broad issues they
discussed, including Russia and Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Bolger said Kohl was particularly interested in the reforms NZ
carried out in the past ten years and more.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope for closer cooperation between the
business sectors of the two countries. New Zealand welcomes German
companies to invest here, and supports NZ companies to invest in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether NZ supports Germany's bid to become a permanent
member of the UN Security Council in the future, Bolger said NZ's
stand on this issue is "cautious".
</P>
<P>
NZ officials have said that NZ is not backing the German bid,
because it believes the council is already too heavily weighted in
favor of European representation.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about what he has learned from NZ's
reforms, Kohl, the first German Chancellor to visit NZ, said the
two countries can learn each other. NZ's experience cannot be
transplanted to Germany as it is because conditions are different
in many areas in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also supports the mutual investment by the two countries'
business people. He said German businesses are looking at NZ as a
springboard into Asia.
</P>
<P>
NZ officials said that NZ's relations with Germany are free of
significant problems and described Kohl's visit as aiming at
strengthening the links between the two countries and enhancing
Germany's business ties with the Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
They said many German companies see NZ and Australia as entry
points into the region.
</P>
<P>
Kohl is accompanied by 13 businessmen, but the local press
noted that in his last trip to the region, which brought him to
Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan, he was accompanied by 56
industrial leaders.
</P>
<P>
NZ officials also acknowledged that the interest in using NZ as
a base in Asia is mainly among middle-sized German companies
rather than the largest firms of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Kohl will visit a winery estate north of Wellington tomorrow
afternoon and come back for an official dinner before flying out
of NZ that night.

HANOI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's inflation rate in the first
four months of this year dropped to 1.5 percent, hitting a record

the low inflation, which they said may lead to a slow down in the
nation's economic growth.

CAIRO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture and
Land Reclamation Yousef Wali inaugurated on Tuesday the first ever
International Agricultural and Food Industries Fair.
</P>
<P>
Five European states, namely, Holland, Britain, France, Ireland
and Germany, took part in the four-day fair together with some 100
Egyptian firms of international business.
</P>
<P>
Wali said the exhibition was a major step to attract
investments to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and Canada will jointly mine for gold in Egypt,
Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources Soliman Reda said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have initialled three contracts for gold-mining
within Aswan in southern Egypt and Sharm el-Sheikh at the southern
tip of the Sinai Peninsula. The four-year contracts involve three
Canadian companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The first-ever Israeli entry into Japanese Samurai
bond market scheduled for this week has been delayed, according to
Israeli Accountant-General Shai Talmon.
</P>
<P>
Talmon attributed the delay to the ongoing investigation by the
Japanese Finance Ministry on the activities of Japan's Nomura
Securities Co. Ltd., who is allegedly guilty of making
transactions in breach of the country's Securities and Exchange
Law.
</P>
<P>
If the allegations prove to be true, sanctions against
Nomura would prevent Israel's bonds from being distributed among
institutional investors in an optimum way.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- With the introduction of free trade on May 1,
trade volume between Israel and Turkey in 1997 is expected to
double over that for last year, according to Israel-Turkey
Business Council Chairman Pini Peled.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade totaled 450 million U.S. dollars last year with
military deals excluded, and in the first quarter of this year,
it stood at 150 million dollars, according to Peled.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian funding institution is
planning to expand its financial assistance in the southern
Philippines to support peace and development programs there, the
Philippine News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Paul Huddleston, chief of the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA), was quoted as saying earlier the agency
would extend its aid to Western and Central Mindanao from the
existing pilot areas.
</P>
<P>
Huddleston described the two regions as having a vast natural
resources that remain idle.
</P>
<P>
The agency will help develop these areas by helping the local
government units translate its economic vision into actual and
concrete development projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Canadian agency is the biggest donor of the
Local Government Support Fund for the Mindanao region.
</P>
<P>
The CIDA has been assisting 18 provinces in the Southern
Philippines even before the government and the Moro National
Liberation Front signed the peace agreement last September.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord ended nearly three decades of separatist
activities by the MNLF and created the Southern Philippines
Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD) covering 13 provinces
and nine cities in the Mindanao region.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Mixed, London Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe ended
mixed Tuesday, with London and Frankfurt surging to new record
closing highs while Paris ending sharply down on political
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
British shares on the London market soared to another record
close, with the FTSE 100 index 63.7 points higher at 4,519.3.
</P>
<P>
Britain's new Chancellor of Exchequer Gordon Brown gave the
Bank of England independence on setting interest rates without
political interference, which was far beyond what the market was
hoping for.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares had surged as high as 3,584.56
points before ending the session at a new peak, up 39.50 points at
3,568.28 on the DAX-30 index, supported by Wall Street's overnight
great gains and well-received results from leading companies.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse, on the contrary, staged a bad performance as
political uncertainty before the parliamentary election dominated
market sentiment, with the CAC-40 index closing 20.91 points down
at 2,651.93.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended 63.7

<HEADLINE> Landing on Diaoyu Islands Unlawful, Says Japanese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary
Seiroku Kajiyama said today that it is illegal for a Japanese
lawmaker to land on one of the Diaoyu Islands.
</P>
<P>
"It is illegal to land on the island without the permission of
land owners," Kajiyama told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Considering Japan's relations with foreign countries, the
government did not want the thing to happen, the Japanese top
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Kajiyama also hinted that Japan's Maritime Safety Agency may
conduct a hearing about the incident from the lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the Japanese government called the
lawmaker's act unlawful.
</P>
<P>
Shingo Nishimura, a lawmaker of the Japanese largest opposition
New Frontier Party, and three others landed on one of the Diaoyu
Islands Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
China on Tuesday "expressed its strong indignation and lodged a
protest against this action," saying Nishimura's action grossly
infringed upon Chinese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the Diaoyu Islands
and adjacent islands are an integral part of Chinese territory
ever since ancient times.
</P>
<P>
China's vice foreign minister has summoned the Japanese
ambassador to China on the matter, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government expressed regret over Nishimura's
conduct Tuesday.

<P>
KAMPALA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Unsanitary food has caused diarrhoea and
dysentery in some parts of Pallisa District, eastern Uganda, a report
reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Samson Nduga, the Health Inspector of the district, said the
health condition in the area is worrying.
</P>
<P>
Doodo, a local wild green vegetable like three-coloured
amaranth, is the only food for many local people and some
famine-stricken people collect it from piles of feces, the
Monitor reported.
</P>
<P>
The vegetable is cooked without proper washing and thus the
hatching eggs are not killed when people take it, Nduga told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The famine in eastern Uganda is caused by drought from late last
November to late last March. enditem

<HEADLINE> Transit Sugar Held at Kenya's Mombasa Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 21,000 tons of sugar
imported from Brazil and Sudan are held at the Mombasa port, the
biggest in Kenya, following stringent measures introduced by
the Kenya Revenue Authority last month.
</P>
<P>
The sugar, aboard three ships held mid-stream, cannot be
discharged until the high guarantees for it are presented.
</P>
<P>
The measures, aimed at curbing diversion of transit sugar into
the local market, require transit sugar dealers to deposit with
the Customs a cash guarantee equivalent to the value of the
consignment before it is allowed to leave the port.
</P>
<P>
Originally, importers were only required to deposit an
insurance transit bond cover in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
The regulations follow an outcry from local sugar factories
and the Kenya Sugar Authority that they are threatened by the
floods of duty-free transit sugar into the local market.
</P>
<P>
However, clearing and forwarding agents complained on Tuesday
that their operations are affected as they now have to incur a
lot more in demurrage charges because it is not easy to raise the
heavy sum of guarantees demanded. enditem

</P>
<P>

with China, hoping that the corporation will make greater progress
in Hong Kong and China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that China has a firm determination to carry out the
policies of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong," and a high-degree autonomy in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China is confident in the smooth transition of
Hong Kong and maintaining long-term prosperity and stability in
Hong Kong, believing that the chief executive and government of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be able to manage
well Hong Kong's affairs.
</P>
<P>
The successful development of China's economy will also have
positive impacts on Hong Kong's economy, Zhu noted.

</P>
<P>
Extending deep condolences over the death of Deng Xiaoping,

<HEADLINE> World Bank Increases Structural Credit to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Satisfied with the on-going
economic restructuring process in Tanzania, the World Bank last
weekend agreed to extend about 125 million US Dollars in a much
needed Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) facility, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ronald Brigish, the World Bank Resident Representative, said
here on Tuesday that there was complete agreement on Tanzania's
qualification for credit when a government delegation met with
World Bank officials in Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
Judging the strength of the reform program laid out by the
government negotiating team, the expected level of credit was raised
from an earlier envisaged 100 million Dollars to 125 million Dollars,
the representative noted.
</P>
<P>
He said disbursing the funds would be subjected to a set of
conditions, which specifically focuses on about 20 areas of action
which the government promised would be effected.
</P>
<P>
Both the amounts for each installment and the period of
disbursement depend on periodic review of the restructuring
performance, Brigish said.
</P>
<P>
He further said that no deadline was set for putting into effect
the agreed condition, but as soon as they have been implemented to a
certain extent, a portion of the funds would be disbursed.
</P>
<P>
The representative told reporters that splitting up and privatising
the National Bank of Commerce came top of expected lines of action in
economic reform, followed by the liberalisation and deregulation of
the petroleum sector.
</P>
<P>
Redirecting budget allocation emmphasis on the social sector,
especially the improvement of funds for primary education and health
was another vital line of action in the Washington accords, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that privatising port operations, deregulating monopolies
in the shipping agency business, privatising the Tanzania
Telecommunications Co. Ltd (TTCL), as well as completing the
privatisation process of Mbeya Cement Co., and the giant Southern
Paper Mills as detailed in the government program were also urged.
</P>
<P>
The World Band representative said, a document outlining the agreed
areas of action, would be probably approved by the executive board of
the World Bank in three weeks.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Scientists Warn of Glacier Decreasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at Kazakhstan's Academy
of Science said today that if the glacier melting in the Central
Asia region continues, the mass of ice could disappear within 100
years.
</P>
<P>
They said that the glacier in the area is decreasing rapidly,
especially in the country's Ili-Alatau Mt. area where one third of
the ice mass is gone over the past 40 years, the newspaper
Ecological Messenger reported today.
</P>
<P>
The main cause, the scientists said, is the rise in global
temperature and the increase of polluted materials, like dusts, in
the air surrounding the glacier layer. The melting also
accelerated as a result of continuous crevassing.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The East African Cooperation (EAC),
comprising Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, is considering to set up a
marine disaster plan for Lake Victoria, Kenyan Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, fast-moving boats and communications systems
will be provided by the three countries for emergency services at
the lake, said David Andere, Permanent Secretary in the Office
of Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
A vessel named MV Bukoba sunk several kilometers from the
Tanzanian shores at the lake mid-last year, claiming more than
600 lives.
</P>
<P>
Regional cooperation on weather forecasts is vital to prevent
such tragedies by helping the lake users determine where the
tides were high or low, said Andere when opening the Second World
Meteorological Core Trainers Course here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He called for the installation of data collection platforms at
weather stations to transmit data through meteorological
satellites to national meteorological centers on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"We should also explore the possibility of installing
automatic weather stations where these data collection platforms
will be installed to avoid high manpower costs," he said.

<HEADLINE> 18 Paramilitary Personnel Killed in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- At least 18 personnel of the
Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were gunned down in an ambush
by unidentified tribal insurgents in the remote Chelagung-Khumlung
area in the far east of India today, the Press Trust of India
(PTI) said.
</P>
<P>
The insurgents, armed with sophisticated weapons, showered
bullets on the CRPF party, which was returning after a combing
operation, killing 18 personnel on the spot.
</P>
<P>
The ambush, the first major strike by the insurgents since a
part of the state was brought under the Disturbed Area Act in the
wake of extremist violence in February this year, took place in a
remote area of Tripura State. The CRPF had launched the combing
operation acting on a tip-off that a militant group was active in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Disturbances in the state have claimed a large number of
innocent lives and several houses have also been burnt. The Union
Home Ministry banned two major militant groups -- the All Tripura
Tiger Force and the National Liberation Front of Tripura -- in
April last year.

CANBERRA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed weaker

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Positive About Ties With India: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani High Commissioner to
India A. J. Qazi said today that his country is positive in its
approach to develop strong ties with New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
With the election of I. K. Gujral as India's prime minister,
things are looking quite bright for normalization of relations
between the two countries, Qazi told foreign correspondents here.
</P>
<P>
Gujral is held in high esteem in Pakistan and his vision has
consistently impressed the Pakistanis, he added.
</P>
<P>
Qazi declared that Pakistan is looking forward to the proposed
meeting between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian
counterpart on the sidelines of the summit meeting of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which will
start in Male, capital of the Maldives, on May 12.
</P>
<P>
This would be followed by yet another round of talks at the
foreign secretary level between the two countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Qazi pointed out that the process of normalization
would not be easy or quick. "We have embarked upon a difficult
journey, but we have the right leadership and the mood to do the
right things."
</P>
<P>
While Pakistan is willing to address all outstanding problems,
the issue of Kashmir, which has determined the texture of
relations between the two neighbors in the last 50 years, has to
be taken up seriously, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan would show patience as it knows that there are no
overnight solutions to the difficult problems, he added.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- On the second anniversary of his election as president,
Jacques Chirac today published an article on 14 newspapers under
the title of "shared momentum," in a bid to relaunch the
legislative campaign by the ruling majority. The president recalls
the big slogans he used during his presidential campaign:
individual initiative, solidarity, liberty and justice.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States, which has so far been happy to see the
advance of the Zairian rebel forces, is beginning to worry about
the imminent victory of the troops of Laurent-Desire Kabila. The
U.S. envoy, Bill Richardson, has asked the allies of the rebels,
Uganda and Rwanda, to pressure Kabila to stage "a soft entry" into
Kinshasa. Washington will also play the last card it has to
control the rebels -- money to aid Zaire after the war ends.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac said in an article published today
in French newspapers that it is time for France to enter a new
stage of development. He said that he dissolved the parliament
because he wanted the French people to speak for themselves about
which direction this new development should take, and that he
wanted to defend the national interests of France in the next five
years, which are key for the European construction.
</P>
<P>
-- According to a poll by the SOFRES polling institute, 52
percent of the French people think that the next government of
France should accelerate the pace of reform, while only 25 percent

<HEADLINE> Rampant Crime Poses Serious Threat to S.Africa's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Unacceptably high levels of crime
in South Africa posed a serious threat to the country's tourist
industry, the South African Tourism Board (SATOUR) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the annual Tourism and Travel Expo, Indaba
'97, at the Durban exhibition centre, SATOUR said South Africa had
been perceived, particularly by potential overseas visitors, to be an
unsafe destination for tourists, said the local daily the Citizen today.
</P>
<P>
According to SATOUR's most recent survey of the international
tourism market, concern for personal safety had increased from 16 to
21 percent for the period January 1996 to January 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The most perception of personal safety in South Africa is largely
the result of the general crime problems in the country and the
negative and sensational publicity afforded such incidents of crime,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, SATOUR surveys also revealed that fewer than two percent
of international tourists to South Africa became victims of crime.
</P>
<P>
The tourism safety task group, established in 1995, was
investigating the implementation of a tourism safety communication
campaign to deal with negative perceptions created by irresponsible
reporting of crime by the local and international media.
</P>
<P>
The three-day expo in Durban attracted almost 1,000 delegates from
60 countries around the world. enditem\

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Carry out Export Support Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Association of
Manufacturers is scheduled to carry out the second phase of the
Kenya Export Development Support (KEDS) Project to promote the
export of non-traditional agro-based products.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will help small and medium-scale businesses of
fresh produce exporters and processors of agro-based products to
expand their markets in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The KEDS project which has two components of institutional
strengthening and firm-level assistance will meet half the cost
exporters incur when penetrating new markets.
</P>
<P>
Under the first phase of the project covering 1992 to mid last
year, 59 firms received export development grants totalling
505,722 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of these firms were either small or
medium-scale companies which received an average of 7,123 Dollars
each.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote export, Kenya also introduced the Duty/VAT
Remission Scheme in 1990 to provide temporary waiver on duties
and value added tax for imports which were to be incorporated in
the production of export goods.
</P>
<P>
The Essential Goods Production Support Program was also
introduced to cater for producers of duty-free goods, such as school
books, agricultural equipment and some pharmaceutical products.
</P>
<P>
Also introduced was the Manufacturing Under Contract to overseas
investors which enables local companies to receive payment in
hard currency.

China is satisfied with the smooth development of the bilateral

</P>
<P>
During their talks, Qian said that the people of the two
countries cherished the traditional friendship, and the bilateral ties
have enjoyed smooth advancement since the two countries

<HEADLINE> Feature: Rule of Law Key to Economic Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Lawless conditions once
frightened away an overseas investor and brought several million
yuan in economic losses to Boluo County in south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong businessman moved his project elsewhere three
years ago when he saw that local authorities were too weak to
control a village fight and the villagers had no idea that they
should abide by laws.
</P>
<P>
After a series of actions called "governing the county
according to law," which includes bringing despots to justice, and
a massive educational campaign on legal knowledge and citizenship
for villagers, those chaotic villages have changed, and the local
economy rebounded rapidly.
</P>
<P>
To ensure economic growth and maintain social stability, a
massive campaign to promote "the rule of law" is being carried out
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
Last March, China's National People's Congress (NPC) presented,
for the first time in a national plan for economic development and
social progress, the objective for "governing the country
according to law and introducing a socialist legal system in
China."
</P>
<P>
To date, efforts to attain the objective have been evident in
all the 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities,
according to the NPC Standing Committee and the Ministry of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, 12 provinces, autonomous regions, and
municipalities have formulated specific measures on administering
their local affairs in accordance with law; and over 60 percent of
China's villages, towns, businesses and schools have started work
to observe relevant laws concerning their daily operations,
statistics show.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Narrowing Economic Gap with Developed Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Inner Mongolia, which has the largest
grassland area in China, is reducing its gap with economically
prosperous areas, according to the region's top leader, Liu Mingzu.
</P>
<P>
The gap has been caused by historical, geographical, and
natural factors, said Liu, secretary of the Regional Committee of
the Communist Party, in an interview with Xinhua. He also pointed
out that people's conservative ideas have also hindered the
region's development.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the Regional Party Committee and
government has taken measures to emancipate people's minds,
encourage people to overcome difficulties, and change people's
complacency.
</P>
<P>
The measures have promoted the development of undertakings in
various fields, he said. In 1996, the region made a breakthrough
in social and economic development. The gross domestic product
(GDP) grew 12.4 percent, surpassing the country's average for the
first time in six years. The region's revenues increased 22
percent, also higher than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the region's grain output reached 15.35 billion kg,
soaring 45.5 percent, an increase rate ranking first in the
country. The head of domestic animals reached 66.97 million,
hitting a record high.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, its net economic profits of the industry ranked ninth
in the country, and the value of its imports and exports climbed
11.3 percent, higher than the nation's average.
</P>
<P>
These figures show that Inner Mongolia has sped up its economic
development, and gives a definite answer that the region is able
to keep up with the national development pace.
</P>
<P>
Liu calculated that if Inner Mongolia continues to develop at
1996's speed, the gap in terms of per capita GDP between the
region and the rest of the country will be narrowed from 1,115
yuan in 1995 to 557 yuan in 2000, and the gap in terms of per
capita financial revenue will be narrowed from 182 to 72 yuan, the
gap in terms of per capita income of rural residents from 278 to
20 yuan, and the gap of urban residents' income per capita from
1,306 to 720 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The period from now to the end of this century is a crucial to
Inner Mongolia's social and economic development, Liu said, adding
that to reduce the gap, the region will carry out five major
strategies related to the development of natural resources,
opening-up, science and technology, the development of human
resources, and production of brand-name products.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the region will make the best use of
its abundant resources, to process agricultural products and
livestocks, and develop energy, metallurgical, machinery and
electronics industries.
</P>
<P>
The processing of farm products and animal by-products, he
noted, will be given top priority, so that it can step up the
reform of the economic structure and the coordinated
economic development in urban and rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Former Tibetan Officials Sentenced for Separatist Activities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Intermediate People's Court of
Xigaze Prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region passed judgement
on the case of Qazha Qamba Chilai on April 21.
</P>
<P>
Defendant Qazha Qamba Chilai was sentenced to five years in
prison with political rights deprived for three years for plotting
to split the country, and was sentenced to two years in prison for
leaking state secrets.
</P>
<P>
The final sentence calls for a six-year jail term and
suspension of his political rights for three years.
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old Qazha Qamba Chilai was former vice-chairman of
the Tibet Autonomous Regional Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, and director of the Civil
Administrative Society of Zhaxi Lunbo Monastery of Xigaze.
</P>
<P>
Court hearings have testified that Qazha Qamba Chilai has,
along with Qamba Qung, former deputy director of the
Administration of Deqen Gaisang Pozhang, the Panchen Lama's
residence in Xigaze, and Samzhub, former general manager of Cham
Branch of the Gangjian Corp of Tibet, colluded with separatist
forces abroad. They have seriously jeopardized the national
unification and unity of ethnic groups, damaged the stability and
development of Tibet and have committed the crime of splitting the
country, the court verdict said.
</P>
<P>
Considering the details of the case, the court, according to
the law, diminished the penalties of the three accused on the
charge of conspiring to split the country.
</P>
<P>
Qazha Qamba Chilai and Qamba Qung also violated the country's
laws on keeping secrets, criminally disclosing state secrets.
</P>
<P>
Qazha Qamba Chilai, Qamba Qung and Samzhub confessed everything
about the above mentioned actions.

In addition, the court sentenced Qamba Qung four years in
prison and deprived him of two years of political rights, and gave
Samzhub two years of prison terms and deprived him of one year of
political rights.
</P>
<P>
Because the case was related to state secrets, the court, in

Criminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China, tried
the case without opening to the public. In court, the accused were
notified of the reason for not opening the trial to the public.
</P>
<P>
Qazha Qamba Chilai and Qamba Qung declined their right to
counsel, and the two accused exercised their right to defend
themselves in court. Samzhub entrusted a lawyer for his

<HEADLINE> China to Stop Intravenous Naftidrofuryl Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Ministry of Public Health has recently
issued a circular to stop the import of intravenous Naftidrofuryl,
which was found to cause serious adverse reactions among patients
in some foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Naftidrofuryl, a vasodilator, which is used to treat peripheral
vascular diseases, was developed overseas in the 1960s, said an
official with the Bureau of Drug Administration of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The official said China began to import the medicine in both
intravenous and oral forms in 1994. Trade names for the product in
the Chinese market are Clarantin, Naftilan, Praxilene, and Triemod.
</P>
<P>
But serious adverse reactions to Naftidrofuryl, especially to
its infusion, have been reported by users in some foreign
countries, which then decided to ban its production, sales, and
use.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts suggested the country should cease the import
of the product, though no such adverse reactions have been found
in China.
</P>
<P>
Medical units can still use the already imported intravenous
Naftidrofuryl through drip-feeding under close watch until August
31, 1997. But the medicine must not be given as a bolus, according
to the circular.
</P>
<P>
The oral form of Naftidrofuryl must be used in accordance with
the data sheet, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
Medical organizations, which discover serious reaction of
Naftidrofuryl should stop the use of the medicine and report to
the Ministry of Public Health immediately.

<HEADLINE> 3 Kidnappers Sentenced to Death in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Three Philippine kidnappers were
sentenced to death by a Manila court today for kidnapping a
Filipino-Chinese businessman in March last year.
</P>
<P>
This was the fifth death conviction for kidnapping since the
death penalty was restored in January 1994 in the country,
according to the official Philippine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Three more suspects in this kidnap-for-ransom case, including a
former policeman, are still at large.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Joseph Estrada, chairman of the Presidential
Anti-Crime Commission, was present at the promulgation.
</P>
<P>
He lauded the verdict handed down by the court, saying it was a
proof that the judicial system is effectively working in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The government restored capital punishment in 1994 due to a
continuing surge of grave crimes, such as murder, rape and
kidnapping, in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since then, 352 criminals have been sentenced to death, but so
far none of them has been executed. According to the country's
law, they should die through lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
Despite the restoration of death penalty and intensified
government crack-down on kidnappers, kidnap-for-ransom cases,
mainly targeting rich Filipino-Chinese, still happened now and
then in the country, especially the southern part.

Partnership for the Generation of Wealth", held in the northern
Botswana city Kasane, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which started on Sunday, was jointly organised by
the 12-member Southern African Development Community (SADC) and
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Masire proposed that a regional southern Africa business advisory
group be set up and round tables to bring together governments and
their private sectors be organised.
</P>
<P>
"This would create the environment for promoting southern Africa as
a growth area," he said, adding the SADC would have to promote joint
investment based on smart partnership principles.
</P>
<P>
"Smart Partnership", a concept conceived by Malaysia, is the
philosophy of creating "win-win" relationships and promoting
"co-operative competitiveness".
</P>
<P>
It is based on the premise that governments, private sectors and
individuals must work together for long-term mutual gains.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state from the SADC countries, among more than 200
business leaders worldwide, attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was a special guest of
the conference. enditem

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's ASEAN Office Not Yet in Place: Thai Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has not yet set up an office
to handle its affairs with the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), according to a Thai Foreign Ministry official
today.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar officials have claimed that budget shortage had delayed
the formation of an ASEAN department, which is a requirement for
all prospective members to enter ASEAN, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar had earlier spoken of plans to set up an ASEAN office
by April 1, the start of the country's fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Thai official quoted Myanmar Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw as
saying that Myanmar needs further study on how other two
countries, Cambodia and Laos, had proceeded.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar foreign minister made the disclosure to a group of
ASEAN officials who made a visit to Yangon last week to assess
Myanmar's readiness to join the grouping.
</P>
<P>
Absence of an ASEAN department could possibly lead to
postponement of the country's admittance into the seven-nation
Southeast Asian grouping.
</P>
<P>
It was decided late last year at a Jakarta ASEAN informal
summit that Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar would enter ASEAN
simultaneously, hopefully this year, the 30th anniversary of
ASEAN's founding.
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, the United States expressed opposition to
ASEAN accepting Myanmar as a full member under pretext of
Myanmar's "woeful human rights performance."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN countries have expressed their position that whether or
not Myanmar enters ASEAN this year, it will have nothing to do
with the U.S. stance.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN foreign ministers, who are scheduled to hold an annual
meeting in Kuala Lumpur in July this year, will make
recommendations on the entry of the three hopefuls, on the basis
of assessments by the ASEAN secretariat. The foreign ministers
will then submit their suggestions to ASEAN leaders for them to
make the final decisions.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups seven countries -- Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

BRASILIA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Gremio squeezed out a 2-1
win Tuesday over Paraguay's Guarani and then took the penalty kick
shootout by the same score to stay alive in the Libertadores Cup
soccer tournament in Porto Alegre, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first game to Guarani 2-1, Gremio needed a
victory by at least two goals in this second game in the home and
away match to avoid having the game go to a penalty kick decision.
</P>
<P>
The two squads played to a goalless tie in the first half. Then
in the second half, Paulo Nunes scored for Gremio in the 63rd
minute.
</P>
<P>
Guarani came back with a goal by Hugo Ovellar in the 86th
minute giving the Paraguayan team the tie they needed.
</P>
<P>
But in the 92nd minute a goal by Rodrigo sent the game to a
penalty kick shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
The result was a 2-1 shootout with Arce and Dinho kicking in
their shots for Gremio and Soto scoring for Guarani.

<P>
WUHAN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China has discovered a 3.26-meter-long
fossil of an elephant's tusk dating back to 250,000-750,000 years
ago, in the central province of Hubei.
</P>
<P>
The fossil was recently discovered by chance in Xinjiangkou
Town, Songzi City of the province, when farmers were leveling
ground to build houses. The tusk was left intact under the
protection of cultural relics experts who came to the scene
immediately to excavate.

The cylindrical tusk is 0.23 meters in diameter. Experts
said it is a rare tusk, as it is even 0.02 meters longer than the
fossil discovered in Dangjiangkou.
</P>
<P>
Li Tianyuan, a research fellow with the Hubei Province Cultural
Relics and Archaeology Research Institute, who participated in the

<HEADLINE> India's Software Exports Cross 1 Billion Dollars in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- India's software industry has made
great progress in the past couple of years with its exports
crossing one billion US dollars in the 1996-97 fiscal year,
official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
India conducts a detailed survey on the performance of the
software industry every year.
</P>
<P>
The initial estimates of the survey in 1996-97 indicated that
software industry in the country grossed more than 1.8 billion
dollars of revenue with software exports exceeding 1.15 billion
and a domestic market of 720 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The software industry registered a phenomenal growth rate of
52.7 percent over its 1995-96 performance while in 1996-97
software industry's growth rate reached 50 percent. Software
exports in 1996-97 recorded a growth rate of 54.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The official sources attributed the handsome growth in software
exports to increase in offshore services and new initiatives
undertaken by the software industry for increasing exports to the
United States, Europe, Japan, Australia and South Africa.

SHANGHAI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China is projected to demand 700
billion yuan to one trillion yuan worth of electronic products
yearly by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
China's electronics industry witnessed a speedy development
during the 1991-1995 period and has become a leader of the

<HEADLINE> Kasparov, Deep Blue Draw in Chess Game 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- It was advantage no one after
Game 3 of world chess champion Garry Kasparov was held to a draw
with IBM's Deep Blue super computer in Game 3 in New York on
Tuesday, leaving their series score tied at 1 1/2 each.
</P>
<P>
According to a press report, Kasparov offered the computer a
draw after making his 48th move. Deep Blue immediately accepted,
ending the 4 1/2-hour contest.
</P>
<P>
"Today I didn't play well, but the computer was a computer and
eventually it knew enough not to lose the game," Kasparov said.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov, a 34-year-old Russian, defeated Deep Blue in
Saturday's opening game of the series, when the computer resigned
after Kasparov's 45th move. On Sunday, Kasparov resigned after the
computer's 45th move, though a subsequent review of the game
showed a scenario in which he could have played for a draw.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov defeated the computer last year and has said that
barring human error, man will always be better than the machine at
chess.
</P>
<P>
But, speaking publicly for the first time since Sunday's loss,
he said he believes Deep Blue showed signs of artificial
intelligence in its Game 2 win.
</P>
<P>
"I still believe Sunday's game will be studied by all
computer specialists because I think something truly unbelievable
happened," Kasparov said. IBM scientist C.J. Tan said:"Deep Blue
was only calculating, but on Sunday it showed a sign of
intelligence. I don't know how it happened. I think that this
machine understands it's time to think."
</P>
<P>
"Game 2 shaked my belief in what Deep Blue could do."
</P>
<P>
In their first match _ held in Philadelphia in February 1996 -
Kasparov lost badly to Deep Blue in the first game, then rallied
back to win the second, fifth and sixth games. Man and machine
played to a draw in the third and fourth games.
</P>
<P>
Game 4 of the match is scheduled for Wednesday, with Games 5
and 6 to be played on Saturday and Sunday. If Kasparov wins, he
gets dlrs 700,000 from IBM, if he loses he gets dlrs 400,000 and
if the match ends in a tie he gets dlrs 550,000.

<HEADLINE> India's 6-Point Plan to Reform Subsidy Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
suggested a six-point strategy for reforming its existing
subsidies regime, which was 14.4 percent of the country's gross
domestic product in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
The discussion white paper on government subsidies, tabled in
parliament Tuesday, has come down heavily on non-merit goods and
services subsidy because of its impact on fiscal deficit.
</P>
<P>
It has called for reducing the rate of these subsidies to 25
percent over the next five years from the current 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The white paper points out that in the 1994-95 financial year,
the aggregate non-merit subsidies of the central and state
governments stood at 10.71 percent versus the combined fiscal
deficit of 7.3 percent of the center, states, and union
territories.
</P>
<P>
Reduction in non-merit subsidies would thus have a direct and
immediate impact on fiscal deficit.
</P>
<P>
The white paper highlights the wastage and inefficiency
triggered by non-merit subsidies. It notes that the extremely low
recovery rates in irrigation waters, electricity and diesel lead
to their wasteful use.
</P>
<P>
The scheme of retention prices for fertilizers and petroleum
products is not well-suited to encourage efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says, in view of this, reforming the regime of
subsidy should be focused on reducing the overall scale of
subsidies, making subsidies as transparent as possible.

<HEADLINE> Fourishing Township Industry Promotes Rural Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises have become the
pillar of rural economy in Gansu Province, southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the provincial government,
township enterprises in the province produced seven billion US
dollars in output value last year 68 percent of the rural economy,
These enterprises also provide job opportunities for over two
million farmers.
</P>
<P>
To promote rural industrial development, the provincial
government has worked hard to set up pilot zones, speed up
technology application, and raise more funds to back township
enterprises,
</P>
<P>
The 14 pilot zones, with the total investment of 72 million US
dollars, have realized 600 million US dollars in output value and
56 million US dollars in tax and profits. The annual income of
local farmers in zones amounted to 250 US dollars, about 120 US
dollars higher than the provincial farmers' average.
</P>
<P>
The province has also strengthened internal management of
township enterprises including introducing advanced technology and
equipment, encouraging enterprises to exploit new products and
developing high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, township enterprises in Gansu introduced over 60
million US dollars of funds from other parts of China as well the
rest of the world, 9.8 million US dollars were in foreign
investment, 63 percent of the total prior to 1996.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Withdraw From Local Elections in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Many candidates in several western
Nepali districts have withdrawn from the upcoming local elections
after an anti-election guerrilla group carried out explosions and
killed one candidate Tuesday, it was reported here today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 26 villages in West Nepal's Rukum and Jarjakot
districts saw all the candidates for the May 17 local polls
withdraw their candidacies, newspaper reports said.
</P>
<P>
In the Ropla district, about 250 kilometers west of Kathmandu,
an unspecified number of candidates have also reportedly opted out
of the elections, fearing for their lives.
</P>
<P>
Leftist guerrillas stabbed a candidate to death at a Rukum
village Tuesday to warn other candidates away from next week's
elections, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
They also set off a series of blasts in the area to strengthen
their death threats to those who would contest in the elections
regardless of the guerrillas' boycott call, making many candidates
change their minds.
</P>
<P>
No serious damage was caused by these explosions but the number
of candidacy withdrawals is increasing every hour, official
sources here said.
</P>
<P>
An underground leftist group called "People's War," which has
been actively carrying out armed activities in West Nepal's hilly
region since early last year, has called on all people to boycott
the local elections.
</P>
<P>
Members of the guerrilla group earlier successfully foiled the
filing of nominations for the elections at some 40 villages in the
area by spreading death threats, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Nepali Congress (NC) party Tuesday accused
the government of failing to keep law and order and ensure safety
of the general public for voting.
</P>
<P>
The NC party, which currently controls most of the local
administration bodies in the country, earlier asked for the
postponement of the elections in some terror-hit districts, but
its plea was rejected by the election authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has assured time and again that special
arrangements have been made and additional police and army troops
will be mobilized for security during the local elections.

<HEADLINE> Former Thai PM Urges Government to Focus on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai opposition leader Chuan Leekpai
has urged the government to concentrate on solving the country's
economic crisis rather than being preoccupied with disputes.
</P>
<P>
"The country is facing a serious recession of exports and
investment. Those in the most trouble are farmers who earn little
while goods prices remain high," Chuan, a former prime minister,
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government, which came to office last December, has
launched measures that are unlikely to solve the problem and in
the meantime released news on other matters which might distract
public attention from the issue of the economy.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would like the government to emphasize
economic solutions and be careful when releasing news on phone
tapping because that might affect the country's image.
</P>
<P>
His comment apparently resulted from a report on a phone
conversation implicating Democrat Party Secretary-General Sanan
Kachornprasart in a vote-buying allegation.
</P>
<P>
"That is not done in democratic countries," Chuan said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Supreme Court Rejects Broadcasting Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Supreme Court has ruled
that the Broadcasting Authority Bill proposed by the government as
a whole was inconsistent with the country's constitution, court
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court noted that in order to become law the bill
should be passed by a two-third majority in the parliament in
addition to being approved at a referendum, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court's decision, which was communicated to the
parliament speaker, was announced by Speaker K. B. Ratnayake when
the parliament met Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier there were about 15 petitions filed in the Supreme
Court challenging the bill which calls for the appointment of a
Sri Lankan broadcasting authority.
</P>
<P>
The petitions alleged that the establishment of a broadcasting
authority to be appointed by Media Minister D. Senanayake is
likely to curtail the people's right to freedom of expression,
publication and political opinion, the sources explained.
</P>
<P>
As the minister would be empowered to issue licenses to radio
and television stations, the petitioners claimed that the minister
would be vested with the authority to suspend and cancel them and
the public would be denied their right to information.
</P>
<P>
The bill was proposed by the government following criticism
directed against it by private radio and TV channels. Efforts to
take action against electronic media personnel under the
Prevention of Terrorism Act, the only way the government could
take such action, were aborted following a public outcry, the
sources added.

<HEADLINE> Thai Party to Expose Government's Failure in Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Democrat Party, the main
opposition party in the Thai Parliament, has resolved to step up a
public campaign to underline the government's failure to tackle
the country's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
The party, which commands 123 of the 172 opposition seats, has
assigned top economic veterans former Deputy Prime Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi and former Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda to give weekly press interviews analyzing the
government's economic measures.
</P>
<P>
Hitherto the Democrat Party, led by former Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai, has refrained from criticizing the government's economic
measures. It stated that the Chavalit Yongchaiyudh government
needs time to prove itself and that attacks on the government's
economic plans would damage the country's image and further weaken
investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
But animosity has resurfaced lately with both sides accusing
each other.
</P>
<P>
A Democrat Party source said the party will focus mainly on two
issues: the economy and a recent cabinet resolution on rural land
ownership.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say economic figures for the last few months show that
an economic rebound is not yet in sight.
</P>
<P>
The intensified exposure of the government's failure by the
Democrats is also seen as part of the preparations for a
prospective censure debate when the parliament reconvenes in July.

ROME, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Eritrean President Isaias
Afeworki today emphasized the role Italy can play in promoting and
consolidating a peace initiative in the Horn of Africa region,
especially in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Afeworki made the remarks during his meeting with Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
An Italian foreign ministry communique said the talks also
stressed the importance of the Inter-governmental Authority for
Development (IGAD) in the search for stability and development, as
well as crisis management and the prevention of conflict, in the
Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The communique said Dini confirmed full Italian support for the
organization, but also urged flexibility and open-mindedness in
Eritrea's present disagreements with Sudan and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The talks also noted the especially intense bilateral relations
between the two countries. Italy, the former colonial power, is
Eritrea's major aid donor.
</P>
<P>
Afeworki urged more Italian investments in the Red Sea
state. Dini hoped a framework agreement for development aid, to
set guidelines under which investments in infrastructural projects
would be matched by a social and human resource development
program.

<HEADLINE> Recovery of Sri Lankan Economy Continuing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- There has been a resurgence of the
economy in Sri Lanka despite the severe drought and power cuts in
1996, Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs G.L.Peiris
said in Parliament Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Peiris, who is also Deputy Minister of Finance, said the
agricultural and industrial sectors have recovered with the
weather turning favorable. Investments have gathered momentum as
reflected in the domestic private sector credit and foreign
participation in the stock market while the tourism sector is also
 picking up.
</P>
<P>
"What all these developments point at is the resurgence of the
economy which was at a low ebb caused by factors some of which
were beyond our control" he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the recovery became visible since the latter part
of 1996 and that trend is continuing.
</P>
<P>
On the fiscal front, attractive incentives to induce private
sector investment were introduced. On the monetary front steps
were taken to reduce interest rates. The corporate sector
responded by recording higher profits, he added.
</P>
<P>
Peiris predicted that with things looking well, and if the
ethnic conflict could be ended and peace restored, Sri Lanka would
be in for a very bright future.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Sri Lanka's per capita nominal Gross Domestic
product based on a mid year population estimate of 18.3 million
had risen to 760 US dollars with GDP at market prices growing by
15 percent to 13.9 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> American Woman Arrives in Jakarta on Round-world </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- American aviator Linda Finch arrived
in Jakarta Tuesday after crossing the half-way mark in her bid to
emulate Amelia Earhart, the first woman to attempt such a trip 60
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Finch, a 46-year-old mother of three sons, smoothly landed at
Halim air force base, east Jakarta at 2:05 local time on a 1935
Lockheed Electra 10e, the plane also used by Earhart in her
journey, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"I always had the desire to ply old planes -- especially of
World War II," the aviation historian was quoted as saying at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
The plane, one of the only two remaining, was restored in two
years for world flight 1997, a 4.5 million US dollars project. It
was similar to the one owned by Earhart but modificated with a
larger oil tank and electronic navigation equipment.
</P>
<P>
"Our purpose for this flight is to deliver a message to remind
people of Amelia and the extraordinary things she did," Finch
said.
</P>
<P>
To her opinion, Earhart has become a model role inspiring many
others.
</P>
<P>
Amelia Earhart was trying to set a new world record in 1937
when she disappeared on the leg from New Guinea to Kowland island.
</P>
<P>
Finch, born in Texas, began the journey on March 17 from the
same hangar in Oakland, California. Her journey will last two and
a half months, cover a total distance of almost 30,000 miles and
span five continents. She will stop at 30 cities in almost 20
countries.
</P>
<P>
Finch and her 550-horse-power plane will leave for Surabaya,
east Java today at 10 am. She will return to Oakland in late May.

BANGKOK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Glass Industries Plc (TGI)
plans to build a 900-million-baht (36 million US dollars) glass
factory in Vietnam, according to a report today.
</P>
<P>
The venture, to be called Vina Glass Industries (VGI), is
scheduled to begin operations by the end of 1998 in the southern
province of Binh Duong.
</P>
<P>
The plant, to be operated by 280 employees, would use local
sand to produce 200 tons of glass per day.
</P>
<P>
The plant had tremendous potential for expansion because of
Vietnam's fast-growing consumer market of more than 75 million
people, TGI managing director Prasert Maekwatana was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Total glass-making capacity in Vietnam stands at just 500 tons
per day compared with Thailand's capacity of 4,000 tons per day.
Vietnam currently import glass to meet local demand.
</P>
<P>
TGI operates two plants in Thailand with a combined capacity of
1,650 tons per day.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Vows to Carry on Military Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin says
he will push on with plans to create a volunteer and modern army,
but is reassuring the cash-starved military of no reckless
personnel and budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
The army "could be more active and decisive" in modernizing and
moving toward a professional, non-conscript force, Yeltsin said in
an interview published today by the military newspaper,"Krasnaya
Zvezda".
</P>
<P>
"No matter how unrealistic this might seem because of current
financial shortages, we must have such a goal and strive for its
achievement," he said in the interview which marked the 5th
anniversary of the Russian armed forces following the collapse of
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Reductions of the armed forces must not be mechanical
or reckless. A lessening of the troops' strength must be
compensated with better equipment, training and skills," he said,
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin tried to calm fears about coming budget cuts, assuring
the military that he will not allow its salaries and food budgets
to be slashed.
</P>
<P>
He said it was quite possible to improve financing of the armed
forces and other budget-financed organizations "with more
energetic measures to replenish budget revenues, a stricter
control over financial flows and a wise fiscal manoeuvring."
</P>
<P>
Many servicemen have been unpaid for months, along with state
workers and pensioners. The army has long had to cut back on
training and other costs.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Igor Rodionov said recently that the military
received only 40 percent of its budgeted funds for food and two
percent of its money for other supplies during the first quarter
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The budget planned by the government envisages defense spending
cuts of about 20.3 percent, bringing it down to 83.1 trillion
rubles (14.2 billion U.S. dollars), lawmakers said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also denied accusations that military reform would
weaken Russia's role in international arena, saying he would
continue to defend national interests.
</P>
<P>
Russia would do everything to minimize the consequences of
possible enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for
Russian security, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow opposes NATO's plans to offer membership to former
Soviet bloc republics, saying such enlargement threatens Russia's
security.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue working for integration of the CIS, primarily
with Belarus." Yeltsin added "We will develop cooperation with
neighbor-countries, China in the first place."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also said he was determined to uproot corruption in the
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"We need to resolutely do away with the pest of corruption,
bribe-taking and theft, that affected the armed forces and many
other state institutions", he said.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Serves to Promote Shandong Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural development has become
a driving force behind the economic development of east China's
Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, agriculture has contributed a lot to
Shandong's increased financial revenue. In 1996, the province's
agricultural revenue increased 44.5 percent, more than 10
percentage points higher than local industrial and commercial
revenue.
</P>
<P>
In counties, agricultural revenue is even important to the
local coffers. In Zhucheng, Shouguang, Yishui counties or
county-level cities, one third of local financial revenue comes
from agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural development has also made farmers
better-off. Farmers in Jinxiang County have profited from more
than 1,000 enterprises involved in processing of farm products. In
1996, financial revenue of 28 cash-strapped counties in the
province increased 18 percentage points, owing to the development
of agriculture and agriculture-related industries.
</P>
<P>
While various regions of China are seeking ways to develop the
economy, Shandong has tapped the potential of agricultural
development. It has increased investment and introduced science
and technology to produce high-yield and quality farm products.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the province, which has no grassland and few
cultivated lands, has become a major producer of livestocks,
grain, oil-bearing crops, vegetables, melons, fruits, and
aquatics.

<HEADLINE> More Attractions Built at Eastern End of Great Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A series of new tourist
attractions have been built around the Shanhaiguan Pass at the
eastern end of the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the shabby old ruins could hardly satisfy the
interests of tourists visiting one of the "seven wonders of the
world," tourist authorities of Hebei Province and Qinhuangdao City
have injected over 60 million yuan (7.228 million US dollars) to
complete over 60 construction projects within the
24-kilometer-long section of the Great Wall in the city.
</P>
<P>
As a result, six scenic areas composed of old and new spots
with different features have been opened to tourists.
</P>
<P>
A new attraction is the Great Wall Museum which displays in a
systematic way the evolution, architectural features, the military
function, and cultural impacts of the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
Another new addition is the reconstructed Laolongtou Tower that
stretches out to the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the section of the Great Wall received a total
of 30 million Chinese and overseas tourists between 1990 and 1996,
which generated a total revenue of 168 million yuan from entrance
tickets.

except those banned by the country can be stored in the
centers without any time limit, and can be freely traded, and
processed in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Also, the city further simplified customs declaration in

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's state-owned
petroleum company, Petrobras, will resume its export of gasoline
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
An environmental restriction banning such sales since 1995 was
lifted by the U.S., media reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The sale of gasoline to the U.S. could be resumed within 40
days since U.S. authorities modified its legislation on the
environment on May 5, said Regis Arslanian, head of the Foreign
Ministry's division on trade policy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government informed Brazil last week that the end of
the prohibition of purchases of Brazilian gasoline would be
published soon in the U.S. Official Gazette.
</P>
<P>
The United States suspended its imports of Brazilian gasoline
in 1995 which then totaled 280 million dollars a year based on the
argument that it polluted the air.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Two Philippine opposition parties
have made a breakthrough in their talks for merger in a bid to win
the May 1998 general elections, the local press reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago, president of the opposition
People's Reform Party (PRP), was quoted as saying Tuesday that her
party and Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP) had agreed on the
apportionment of candidates for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The PRP and the LDP, the biggest opposition party in the
country, also agreed on the funding for the electoral campaign
after weeks of talks, according to Defensor-Santiago.
</P>
<P>
But the PRP chief said the two parties stopped short of talking
on the most sensitive issues -- presidential and vice presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
"There was no problem with the apportionment of candidates,
particularly on the senatorial slate, but we decided to defer
talking on the presidential and vice presidential slots until the
mechanism for the eventual unification is resolved," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the merger talks were prompted by the need to
consolidate forces to increase the chances of winning in the 1998
national elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senate President Ernesto Maceda denied reports of
negotiations for an alliance between his Nationalist People's
Coalition and the ruling Lakas-NUCD party.

<HEADLINE> Expert Hails New Order in Internet Domain Name Registration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A noted Chinese expert on Internet
considered it a breakthrough to break the "monopoly" in Internet
domain name registration.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jinfeng, a delegate from China to an international
conference on Internet from China told the Chinese press upon
return of the advancement made in the conference .
</P>
<P>
He said the memorandum unanimously signed in the international
conference to create new international organizations for Internet
domain name registration is a important step forward on the
management and supervision of Internet.
</P>
<P>
First launched by American military and research institutions,
Internet has grown fast over the past five years. Subscribers
worldwide reached some 60 to 80 million.
</P>
<P>
"Internet should become a global resource," Zhou said. "Only
when it becomes global resource can its value be fully exploited."
</P>
<P>
Domain name registration, however, remains under the management
of a US educational association entrusted by US National Science
Foundation. "This situation," Zhou says "does not deal with the
growing internationalization of the Internet."
</P>
<P>
Chinanet, China's Internet node, witnessed marked growth in
past years. According to statistics from China's posts and telecom
authorities, the number of subscribers reached more than 100,000
last year, and are expected to increase as telecom infrastructure
improves.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje
Kontic said here today the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would
not accept acts likely to make the Kosovo issue an international
affair.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with Bernard Miyet, the United Nations
Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping operations, Kontic said
the Kosovo issue is "totally an internal affair of Serbia", the
Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On April 3, the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia denounced a
United States organization, "Project on National Relations". The
organization had proposed New York roundtable talks entitled
"Kosovo Serbian-Albanian Ethnics".
</P>
<P>
Relations between the Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo have
remained tense since early 1980s because the ethnic Albanians,
accounting for 90 percent of the two million population in the
southern province, have demanded independence.
</P>
<P>
Kontic said his country would attend talks on achieving rights
for Albanian minorities in the southern province of Kosovo, under
the international criteria.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslavia should be allowed to participate equally in
the peacekeeping mission as well as drafting the report on
achieving human rights and rights for minorities in the republic.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslavia's return to the United Nations and other
international organizations would benefit peace and stability in
the region.

<HEADLINE> New Agreement to Boost Chilean Exports to Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A new agreement between Chile and
Canada is expected to help triple Chile's exports to Canada over
the next three years to annual 500 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, said the Committee for Export Promotion at the
Foreign Ministry here today, will take effect in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Official count of Chilean-Canadian trade showed a deficit of
about 268 million dollars on Chile's part in 1996, resulting from
140 million dollars exports and 408 million dollars imports.
</P>
<P>
Chile hopes to reverse the imbalance by stimulating the exports
of products with higher aggregate value through negotiations
between its national private sector and the Canadian one.
</P>
<P>
It also hopes to increase the numbers and types of products
shipped to Canada.
</P>
<P>
The country will send a trade mission to Canada in June to seek
clients for Chilean exports and locate Canadian companies
interested in manufacturing products for the Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur, or the South American Common Market, groups
together Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Chile is an
associate member of the regional free trade bloc.

<P>
QUITO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran Interior Minister Cesar
Verduga has dismissed two police chiefs for their failure to capture
13 former legislators accused of corruption.
</P>
<P>
Verduga had General Efrain Ramirez, Chief of Staff, and General
Mario Acosta, chief of operations for the National Police, removed
from their posts yesterday and asked General Marco Hinojosa, the
general commander of the National Police, to carry out the
detentions of accused officials.
</P>
<P>
the Supreme Court of Justice issued in April an order of
temporary detention of 13 former legislators for alleged
extortion, graft and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed his dissatisfaction over the failure to
detain the former legislators but he ruled out the dismissal of
all the top-level police officers because not all of them were
involved.
</P>
<P>
Hinojosa said that an internal investigation will be
carried out to determine whether there are more people responsible
for the foiled operation, especially at intermediate levels.
</P>
<P>
Verduga did not set any deadline for the police to arrest the
former legislators.

<HEADLINE> Coral Reefs Endangered in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Seventy percent of the Philippines'
coral reefs are in deteriorating condition in the archipelago's
25,000 square kilometers of reef areas, the local press reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
Citing a recent official marine pollution bulletin, the reports
said among the 85 reef sites in 14 localities across the country
surveyed during the last seven years, about 75 percent of the
sites surveyed had less than 50 percent live cover.
</P>
<P>
Pollution and explosives used for fishing are blamed by the
survey as the two main causes for the serious damage of the reef
resource.
</P>
<P>
To save the reefs from being further damaged, the Environment
and Natural Resources Department has created the Coastal
Environment Program on the protection of the coral reefs, known as
"rain forests of the seas."
</P>
<P>
The program will promote the use of environment-friendly
coastal technologies and expand livelihood opportunities in
coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
The government also declared the month of May as the Coral Reef
Protection Month to enlighten the public on the pressing need to
preserve this resource.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (67-68) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (67-68) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: What status will mainland capital have, and what role
will it play, in Hong Kong's economic development?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Investment of mainland state capital in Hong Kong has
increased rapidly since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
With development over the past several decades, the number of
mainland-funded businesses in Hong Kong has reached 1,658 at
present, and their total assets are second only to those owned by
British businesses in amount.
</P>
<P>
Mainland capital plays an important role in Hong Kong's
banking, foreign trade, shipping, transportation, tourist, real
estate, manufacturing and retail sectors.
</P>
<P>
The growth and development of mainland-funded businesses have
contributed greatly to the prosperity and stability of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
These businesses provide a great variety of products for Hong
Kong residents, especially daily necessities in big volume such as
pork, fish, eggs, poultry, vegetables, and other live or fresh
non-staple foodstuffs and related services. They have created jobs
for the local society and pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, mainland-funded businesses have strengthened
ties between Hong Kong and the rest of the country, playing a
special role in promoting economic cooperation between them.
</P>
<P>
Question: Will the Hong Kong dollar remain in circulation after
1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to Article 111 of the Basic Law: the Hong
Kong dollar will remain as the legal tender of the Hong Kong SAR
and continue to circulate; the authority to issue Hong Kong
currency will be vested in the government of the Hong Kong SAR;
the issue of Hong Kong currency must be backed by a 100 percent
reserve fund; the system regarding the issue of Hong Kong currency
and the reserve fund system will be prescribed by law.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Article 112 of the Basic Law stipulates that the Hong
Kong dollar be freely convertible. Therefore, the basis,
conditions and mechanisms for the circulation of the Hong Kong
dollar will remain unchanged after 1997, and the free
convertibility of the Hong Kong dollar will be absolutely
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Preparations have been under way to ensure the continued
circulation of the Hong Kong dollar after 1997.
</P>
<P>
For example, colonial designs and wording on some notes and
coins will be changed, and some of them already carry the bauhinia
design, a symbol of the Hong Kong SAR.

ROME, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Monica Seles met no further
trouble to win her first match Tuesday at the Italian Open after
long time layoff.
</P>
<P>
Seles, playing here for the first time for five years,
encountered some stiff resistance from Austrian Barbara Schett in
the first set of her second round match but moved up a level to
win through 7-5, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
However, fellow American Jennifer Capriati, also coming back
from absence, lost 7-6, 6-2 in the first round to compatriot
Chanda Rubin.
</P>
<P>
The former teen prodigy should have wrapped up the first set

<P>
Instead, she let the determined Rubin, ranked one place
below her at 29th in the world, back into the match with
repeated double faults and poor service returns.
</P>
<P>
Rubin now meets champion Conchita Martinez of Spain, the third
seed and winner here for the past four seasons. She had a bye into
the second round.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Zhang Congcong, a grade-two pupil from Handan city in north

friends, and her own collection. Congcong cannot say exactly when

about it. Although she has never set eyes upon a real dinosaur,
rhinoceros, or crocodile, Congcong knows the animals quite well
because they are on her erasers.
</P>
<P>
To the little girl, these erasers are much more attractive than
candies, dolls, and pretty clothes, all favorites of other girls
of her age.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of the erasers has been held in the primary
school where Congcong attends, giving her schoolmates the chance

<HEADLINE> France Worried About Zairian Rebel Refusal of Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed its worry over
the refusal by Zairian rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila to
implement a ceasefire, and warned of a "blood-bathing" in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry said today that
Zaire cannot find a lasting peace unless through an orderly
transition of power which is aimed at the organization of
elections.
</P>
<P>
Zairian rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila said on Monday that
his troops were continuing their advance on all the fronts, one
day after he said that he had ordered them to stop attacks.
</P>
<P>
"We don't wish to see a blood-bathing, and we wish first of
all a ceasefire, the stop of hostilities and an orderly transition
toward the conciliation of the people of Zaire, " said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Violent fighting is reportedly going on in Kenge, a locality
200 kilometers east of the Zairian capital Kinshasa, between
Zairian government forces and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Zairian presidential spokesman said today that
President Mobutu Sese Seko will go to Libreville, Gabon, on
Wednesday to meet with the leaders of Congo, Gabon, Central
African Republic and Equatorial Guinea.

<HEADLINE> Solana, Primakov Fail to End Impasse over NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- NATO and Russia held the fifth
round of talks on NATO enlargement Tuesday evening, but it failed
to achieve a breakthrough, though both sides said progress had
been made.
</P>
<P>
The NATO secretary general, Javier Solana met Russian foreign
minister Yevgeny Primakov in Luxembourg for about two hours to try
to clear up lingering points of dispute.
</P>
<P>
But the meeting ended with no breakthrough that NATO officials
hoped would clear the way for a signing ceremony by NATO and
Russian leaders later this month.
</P>
<P>
NATO sources said after the talks that more meetings were
needed before the two sides could reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
A four-line joint statement issued after the fifth round of
negotiations between the two men that began in January said Messrs
Solana and Primakov agreed to intensify the negotiation in order
to reach an agreement on future relations "at the earliest
possible date".
</P>
<P>
"Some progress has been made but the work continues," the
statement said, without mentioning details.
</P>
<P>
The NATO/Russia talks on a new security relationship has been
deadlocked on the final section of the negotiated document
involving the military implications of NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The main sticking point is that Russia is demanding binding
commitments that NATO will not station troops or nuclear weapons
on new members's territory, nor move any of its military
infrastructure closer to Russia's borders.
</P>
<P>
NATO says that it has no plan to station nuclear weapons or
foreign troops on the territory of new members, but insists that
it cannot give eternal guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Moscow remains firmly opposed to NATO's plans, but NATO has
already committed itself to invite some countries of the former
east bloc to join the alliance at a summit in Madrid in July.

<HEADLINE> Six African Countries Lose 90 Percent of Their </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- For the past 50 years, six African
countries have lost more than 90 percent of their original forest
cover, local paper "Cameroun Tribune" reported today.
</P>
<P>
This unenviable revelation was made yesterday in Yaounde by
Ahmed Rhazaoui, resident representative of the UNDP in Cameroun
while addressing participants during a two-day hearing for Africa
organized by the World Commission on Forests and Sustainable
Development (WCFSD).
</P>
<P>
According to Rhazaoui, the six countries are Burundi, Rwanda,
Kenya, Madagascar and the other two.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he praised Cameroun, the Central African Republic,
Congo, Gabon, Zaire and Equatorial Guinea for having the largest
forest reserves in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The public hearing that groups close to 100 eminent
personalities across the world is the fourth in a series
organized by the WCFSD.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the Yaounde meeting is to increase the
awareness of preserving the natural environment and contributing
to economic development; broaden the consensus on data, science
and policy aspects of forest conservation and management; build
confidence between north and south on forest matters with
emphasis on international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Despite international efforts to salvage the forest in
tropical Africa, deforestation still continues at an alarming
rate.
</P>
<P>
Faced with this situation, the European Union is not sitting
arms folded. Statistics shows that between 1992 and 1995, the
WCFSD has spent about 85 million ECUs for sustainable forest
management in Africa, and since 1992, 50 million ECUs are spent
annually for the preservation of forests in the continent.
