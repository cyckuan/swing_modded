<HEADLINE> EU New Move Against Polluting Emission From Trucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- New diesel-engined trucks will
have to reduce polluting exhaust fumes and particulate emissions
by a further 30 percent by 2000 as the European Union made a new
move to improve air quality.
</P>
<P>
The move, according to today's issue of the European Report
journal, was within the framework of the union's auto-oil air
quality program to further reduce air pollution caused by motor
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, European Union's executive, set in a
proposal new emission limits for trucks and diesel engines,
requirements for new gas-powered trucks and truck engines as well
as a substantial modification of test methods for vehicle type
approval.
</P>
<P>
The proposal seeks to amend requirements on diesel emissions by
trucks first imposed in 1988 and most recently amended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The proposed measures are part of the European Community system
of type approval of truck engines and must be applied in the case
of all new type approvals granted by national authorities.
</P>
<P>
It introduces new requirements concerning polluting emissions
by engines fuelled by natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas.
</P>
<P>
The new limits will apply to emissions of carbon monoxide,
unburnt hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, particulates, and to
exhaust smoke opacity as well as to methane emissions.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that it would unveil another set of
proposals in 1999 to establish stricter limit values which are
neutral as concerns the fuel and techniques used.
</P>
<P>
The new set of limit values will apply as of 2005 at the
conclusion of a second auto-oil program and will serve as the
basis for a European tax incentive plan.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Demands Reports on U.S. School Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today ordered law enforcement and education officials to produce
annual reports on violence in U.S. schools.
</P>
<P>
"We know more about the overall patterns of car theft in
America than we do about the harm that comes to our children at
school," Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's address came a week after three girls were gunned
down by a 14-year-old schoolmate in a Kentucky school.
</P>
<P>
"We simply cannot educate our children -- and they cannot learn
and live up to their full potential -- when violence and drugs
threaten their safety in schools," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "High school seniors are more likely to take weapons
to school than to take calculus in school. This is unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Offering his proposal in memory of the three girls, Jessica
James, Kayce Steger and Nicole Hadley, Clinton said, "Now the rest
of us must do everything in our power to prevent such things from
happening again."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "Youth violence represents an insistent, angry
wake-up call to every parent, every teacher, every religious
leader, every student."

<P>
HARARE, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The 5,000 delegates to
Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu (PF)'s annual national conference which
ended today have called on the government to ensure transparency
and fairness in redistribution of land acquired from the white
commercial farmers.
</P>
<P>
A resolution adopted at the end of the two-day conference
commended the government for taking bold steps to resolve the

The government plans to acquire about 1,500 farms or five
million hectares for resettlement and commercial farming for the
landless indigenous people.
</P>

The conference also urged the government to ensure the success
of the indigenization program by formulating comprehensive
policies which would lead to increased participation in all
sectors of the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Holds State Assembly Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian military
government's transition to civil rule program took another major
step today, with the holding of the state assembly elections.
</P>
<P>
More than 55,700,000 registered voters were expected to go out
to vote, but investigations show that the turnout was
impressively low.
</P>
<P>
At a polling station in Lagos, only less than 20 ballots were
cast by the time the poll ended at 3:00 p.m., whereas more than
700 voters were registered there.
</P>
<P>
The city, however, has been quite calm and quiet, as the
authority has imposed a traffic restriction.
</P>
<P>
The country's five political parties have fielded a total of
about 4,900 candidates for the 989 state legislative seats
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In the local council election held in March, the United
Nigeria Congress Party (UNCP) sealed an overwhelming victory,
bagging more than 300 of the 770 local council chairmanship
seats. The Democratic Party of Nigeria came the second with about
130 seats.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have forecast that the UNCP is likely to maintain its
majority in today's elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the amended transition program, the state
assembly election will be followed by the national congress
election in April next and a presidential election in August.

<HEADLINE> Scarcity Doubles S. Leone's Rice Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone has been hit by
a scarcity of rice forcing the price of a 110 pound bag from 20
and 25 dollars to 35 and 40 dollars today.
</P>
<P>
The steep rise sent panic among consumers in the capital as
hundreds visit shops after being told that all rice stock had
been sold out.
</P>
<P>
Consumers blamed "unpatriotic rice sellers" mainly Lebanese of
" hoarding rice" in anticipation of a continued sanction imposed
on the country since the coup.
</P>
<P>
One Lebanese merchant reacting to charges of hoarding said "we
cannot do this as we have stood behind the Sierra Leone people
since the coup."
</P>
<P>
"We would be endangering our own security to create hardship
on the people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Trade Minister Eldred Collins told Xinhua, "we wonder over the
reason for this shortage. It is likely to undermine the people's
confidence on us, so we won't take things lightly if we find out
that our detractors are using rice as a political weapon to
derail the government."
</P>
<P>
Thousands of bags of rice are usually allocated to the Sierra
Leone military and its ally, the people 's Army each month at a
nominal rate of one dollar a bag.
</P>
<P>
The last major consignment of rice was brought into the
country in August by a Lebanese merchant.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone imports most of its rice, the country's staple
food from China, Pakistan and Burma at an annual cost of
30,000,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of crates of soft drinks including Coke,
Fanta, Pepsi and Vimto have flooded the Sierra Leone market
ending about three months of scarcity.
</P>
<P>
Customs officlals said they believed the consignment has been
brought in by civilian traders.

LUSAKA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official
called here today for collective efforts against illegal trade of
cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Amussa Mwanamwambwa told reporters that the
illicit trade of cultural heritage which has become a global
problem should be combated through collective efforts and
increased enforcement capacities supported by severe penalties.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by Mwanamwambwa when he handed over to
Livingstone Museum seven objects that were stolen in 1989 and
recovered in Brussel with the help of the International Council
of Museums.
</P>
<P>
The tourism minister pointed out that the scourge of illicit
trade in cultural heritage has continued to rob Zambia and the
whole of Africa of much of its invaluable heritage.
</P>
<P>
He added that a lot of Zambia's cultural patrimony has found
its way to Europe through the clandestine trade promoted by some
people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mwanamwambwa urged the directors in charge of national museums
to adopt effective measures to protect the country's cultural
heritage.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Renews Debt Relief Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 6 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
has renewed his appeal for debt relief to Tanzania, saying the
country's debt is at an "unburably high" level.
</P>
<P>
Talking to representatives of donor countries and agencies at
the State House in Dar es Salaam today, Mkapa said the government
is at present spending 37 percent of its revenue in debt
repayment.
</P>
<P>
Heavy debt has made Tanzania short of fund in developing
health and education undertakings, he said.
</P>
<P>
During today's informal talks with some 30 representatives
ahead of the Consultative Group Meeting (CGM) on Tanzania
schedule for next Wednesday, Mkapa said that the debt service
ration is well above the recommended rate between 15 and 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money used by the government for debt repayment
per capita stands at 11.5 US Dollars annually, while the spending
on health and education is only two US Dollars, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's external debt by October 31 had reached 8.0881
billion US dollars, according to the central Bank of Tanzania
(BOT).
</P>
<P>
CGM is a forum at which major donor countries and institutions
collectively meet individual developing countries to review
donor-funded projects and agree on future terms of cooperation.
The forum is normally held in Paris.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the State House noted that "the
decision by the donors to come to Dar es Salaam rather than
summon Tanzania representatives to Paris, is a gesture of
confidence in the Tanzanian government in the implementation of
political, economic and social services,"

<HEADLINE> Next Government to Continue Graft Fight: Moi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today said that he would "continue with the war against graft
and other forms of corruption that make good business practice
difficult".
</P>
<P>
Speaking here at a fund-raising luncheon organized by the
ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU), Moi noted that the
next KANU government would give priority to elimination of
corruption to make the country more caring and united.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that he would persistently seek peace to create
a conducive environment for the business community in the East
African country.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan President urged the business community to support
KANU during the critical campaign for the December 29 General
Election and the transition into next century.
</P>
<P>
The lunch which was attended by members of business community
raised some 100.75 million Kenyan Shillings (about 1.6 million
U.S. Dollars) for the KANU election fund.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Daily Nation reported on Friday that 35
people given red invitation cards for the top table were expected
to contribute up to five million Shillings (about 80,000
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Moi said that he would approach young executives both men and
women to organize such fund-raising events in all major towns in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Charity Ngilu, leading opposition presidential candidate for
Social Democratic Party, called for a demonstration against the
lunch, saying that the event was a sign of rampant corruption in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Nairobi residents today ignored the call and only some two
hundred Ngilu supporters showed up.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's Frank Nobilo
won the 350,000 U.S. dollars Hong Kong Open golf tournament on
Sunday to record the first back-to-back success in his career.
</P>
<P>
Nobilo, winner of the Mexico Open two weeks ago, ran away from
the pack with a closing birdie on the 18th hole to end at a
three-under-par 68 in the final round. He won the four-round,
72-hole event with a total of 17-under 267, five strokes clear of
runner-up Kang Wook-soon from South Korea, the leading player on
last year's Asian PGA tour.
</P>
<P>
Nobilo took the 58,345 U.S. dollars top prize.
</P>
<P>
American Tim Straub recorded a total of 274, 10 under par, in
the first international golf tournament after Hong Kong's handover
on July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Lianwei, China's top professional golfer, closed his race
with a collection of 275, nine under par, to tie with Chinese
Taipei's Lin Keng-chi for the fourth place.
</P>
<P>
Nobilo started poorly with two bogeys in the first three holes
but he soon showed his caliber as the world's 22nd-ranked
player. He started a winning advance with an eagle at the ninth
hole and four birdies at the 10th, 12th, 14th and final holes.
</P>
<P>
"When I dropped shots early on it opened up the whole field,"
said Nobilo. "I knew he (Kang) was up level with me and it was
not much fun for a while.
</P>
<P>
"It took me a long time to find my rhythm," he said. "After
that, I felt great again, just like the past three days.
</P>
<P>
"That's the first time I have backed up one tournament win with
another and it feels great," Nobilo said.
</P>
<P>
Nobilo praised Asian players for their improvement. "Asian
players did very well this week, such as Kang and Lin they scored
a 66, and a 67, and of course Zhang Lianwei shooting a 9 under,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang admitted that he was nervous at the start of the final
round Sunday. "But after two bogeys at the two opening holes, I
came to see that there's little chance for me to win. That helped
to be relaxed and do better in the later stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy with my performance. It was a good week for me,"
added Zhang, who is to compete in the Omega PGA Championships
later next week in Hong Kong and another event in the Philippines
for the year.
</P>
<P>
The spectators at the Hong Kong Golf Club ignored the weather
which switched from rain to wind time to time. Organizers
registered a crowd of 8,000, a record for the Hong Kong Open
history.
</P>
<P>
"It's an energetic crowd, it's good for golf," said Nobilo at
the awarding ceremony.

SHENYANG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Jie Jun scored 23 points and
added 15 rebounds to lead Liaoning Hunters to a 88-82 win over
visiting Guangdong Hongyuan in the fifth round of the Chinese
Basketball League on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hunters, last year's runners-up and fourth placer so far this
season, led Hongyuan 44-35 in the first half with well-knit
defense and effective attack inside from the 2.04-meter center Jie.
</P>
<P>
Hongyuan hit 12 three-pointers but a lack of post men proved to
be fatal to them.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not satisfied with the players' perfromance even though we
won the match," said Wu Qinglong, head coach of the Hunters. "They
failed to keep consistent and control the rebounds before the
experienced Hongyuan."
</P>
<P>
But Hongyuan's head coach Zhang Yongjun said the loss was
resonable. "We failed to regain form after the National Games in
October, so the result is normal, " Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
In the other games, Chinese Army and Shandong Baoyuan both
extended their unbeaten record to five after the Army crushed
Shenyang Army 105-74 and Baoyuan demolished Zhejiang Zhongxin
68-48.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Shougang beat the Airforce 81-62 while Shanghai
Oriental ousted Sichuan Pandas 79-64. Jiangsu Nangang, led by last
season's MVP Hu Weidong, suffered an surprise 71-77 defeat by
Jinan Army.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Reaches 47 in Russian Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian rescuers digging through
rubble have found the remains of 47 people killed when a military
cargo plane crashed Saturday morning into an apartment building
after takeoff in the Siberian city of Irkutsk.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the victims of the 23 people aboard the plane,
the crash caused a fire in several buildings which killed two
children in an orphanage and at least 22 local residents,
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The death toll was expected to rise as the rescue work went on,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The crash destroyed a 64-apartment housing some 200 people and
damaged other three apartment buildings and an orphanage and a
school, the reports added.
</P>
<P>
About 450 people have been evacuated from the area and the
rescue workers were continuing to search the debris and nearby
homes.
</P>
<P>
The Antonov-124 was reportedly carrying two Sukhoi-27 fighter
planes for export to Vietnam but plunged to the ground seconds
after taking off in Irkutsk.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the aircraft was 10 seconds into its flight
after taking off when its two left engines failed at an altitude
of about 70 meters. It slammed in to a residential area soon after
its take-off.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin has ordered Prime Minister Vikto
Chernomyridin to go to the scene and head up the investigation
into the accident.
</P>
<P>
The city also experienced a crash in 1994, in which all 125
people on aboard a Russian Tupolev-154 plane were killed.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Urges Kaunda to Help Zambia Move Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba, who is on a one-day working visit in Zimbabwe, today
expressed his hope that Zambia's former president Kenneth Kaunda
could make contribution to the resolution of Zambia's political
problems and help the country move forward.
</P>
<P>
When meeting the press soon after his one and half hours'
private talks with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, Chiluba
said he hoped that one day Kaunda would realize the need to help
the country to move forward, according to a report from the
Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Kaunda, leader of Zambia's main
opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP), has been
seeking asylum in Harare after an abortive military coup in
October to overthrow the government led by Chiluba's ruling
Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD).
</P>
<P>
Chiluba is touring the world lobbying for loans to push
forward dialogue between the MMD government and the opposition so
as to solve the political problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president denied that his reshuffle of the government last
Tuesday, in which former vice-president Brigadier General
Godfreym Iyanda, defense and foreign ministers as well as heads
of the armed forces were demoted, has relations with the October
coup.
</P>
<P>
On his talks with the Zimbabwean president, Chiluba simply
said that their meeting touched on economic, social, political as
well as defense matters.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba left this morning for Harare at the invitation by
Mugabe, and he is scheduled to return home later this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Complains Heavy Losses by UN Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHARJAH, UAE, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Minister of Trade
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said here today that his country has
sustained disastrous losses of lives and revenues brought about by
the seven-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters during an Arab-African fair which opened
here today that Iraq has lost 120 billion U.S. dollars after Iraq
was banned from exporting oil, its major revenue earner.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that 1.25 million Iraqi women and children have
died of the lack of food and medicines since the sanctions were
imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister described the sanctions as "the most severe
and comprehensive" ever in the human history.
</P>
<P>
However, Saleh said that despite the "disasters," Iraq has
managed to be "self-sufficient in vegetables and fruits."
</P>
<P>
Iraq also has successfully utilized its iron resources in the
country's reconstruction process following the 1991 Gulf War, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the oil-for-food agreement between the U.N. and
Iraq, Saleh complained that since the deal came to effect a year
ago, Iraq has only got 35 million U.S. dollars of the total
incomes of 2.35 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the oil-exporting earnings "has gone to the United
Nations, special commissions and some persons in the commissions,"
he claimed.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official called for the investigation of the funds
which are put in the French Bank to "show the world where the
money went." The funds should be used to buy food for Iraqi
children and save their lives instead, he added.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil for every six months to buy humanitarian
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Saleh stressed the importance of boosting his country's
cooperation with all Arab countries in the field of importing food.
</P>
<P>
Saleh arrived here today for the third African-Arab fair. But
there is no Iraqi delegation due to "transporting and other
special conditions," Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
The seven-day fair was staged under the auspices of the Arab
League and the Organization of African Unity. A total of 60
countries took part in the fair and a number of U.N. organizations
also attended.

<HEADLINE> Hope of Traditional Medicine Rests with Younger Generation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Gan Chun, a young practitioner
of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in Nanchang, currently spends
two days a week studying under the tutelage of a senior
colleague.
</P>
<P>
"My study program will last for three years," said Gan, who has
already amassed 12 years of clinical experience in Nanchang,
capital of east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 young doctors from throughout the nation, including
Gan, have been selected to study under renowned TCM experts. The
younger generation of doctors will form a "new force" to overcome
future challenges TCM will face from modern Western medicine.
</P>
<P>
"Future practitioners of TCM should not only
focus on inheriting, but also on creating," according to Cheng
Zhaosheng, an official in the Provincial Health Department.
</P>
<P>
"My current job is to summarize the academic prowess and
clinical experience of my teacher, and to transcribe them to books
in order to disseminate information," said Gan.
</P>
<P>
Gong Qiongmo, his teacher, noted that young people can approach
the development of TCM from new angles and in
turn combine it with the Western medicine. So doing will certainly
"bring a new hope to traditional Chinese medicine," said Gong.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 20 senior TCM experts in the
province, one of the country's TCM research centers, have had
successors.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Take Steps to Tackle Ageing Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will take steps to
counter the negative effects on the economy brought by
the problem of ageing population, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a report delivered at an intergovernmental conference on
ageing population in the Mediterranean which ended Saturday in
Malta, Cypriot Minister of Labor and Social Insurance Efstathios
Papadakis said the number of elderly people and their ratio of
the total population in Cyprus will rise sharply in the years to
come.
</P>
<P>
By 2008, people under 15 will constitute only 20 percent of
the island's population compared with the current 24.6 percent,
while those aged over 65 will jump from a population share of 11
percent to 17.6 percent. The number of people over 75 is expected
to double to account for nearly 8 percent of the total
population, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"It is evident that ageing population is expected to have
far-reaching consequences in the labor market and the economy
of Cyprus in general, and measures should be taken urgently to
mitigate the adverse effects," Papadakis stressed.
</P>
<P>
He cited low motivation and productivity and slow adaptation
to technological change as negative indicators of an ageing
workforce.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the elderly can contribute significantly to
economic development if the right incentives and facilities such
as re-training programs were provided for them.

<HEADLINE> Yu Genwei Scores Hat Trick as Tianjin Beats Yanbian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese national Yu Genwei
saved Tianjin Samsung temperarily from the brink of relegation
with a hat trick when the host edged Yanbian Aodong 3-2 in the
19th round of the Chinese Professional League here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Samsung, who stood 10th in the 12-team by accumulating 17
points after 18 rounds, has been suffered a long period of slump
and struggled to avoid a relegation this season.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Aodong, who has secured its status in Division A,
sent almost all its new bloods to the field since it has no chance
to battle for the top honors.
</P>
<P>
Samsung's Gao Fei curved a long pass in the midfield to the
box, where Yu picked the ball, shook off Yanbian's keeper and slot
it into the net in the 32nd minute.
</P>
<P>
Yu, who just returned from China's heart-breaking defeat in the
World Cup qualifying campaign, has been plagued with an injury and
stayed for more time on the bench than in the pitch.
</P>
<P>
The national midfielder then added two goals in the last 12
minutes of the first half.
</P>
<P>
Aodong stepped up offensive in the second half, with Huang
Dongchun narrowing the margin by scoring twice within three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Jumping to the ninth place in the standings by collecting 20
points after the pecious win, Tianjin remained in danger of
relegation with three rounds to go.
</P>
<P>
"We are still in a difficult situation since several starters,
including Yu, Gao Yuyong and veteran Huo Jianting, are suffering
serious injuries," head coach Chen Jingang said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Tianjin will have to win five more points in the
final three matches, including two in the road, to avoid a
disastrous relegation.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other matches, Beijing Guo'an was held to a
goaless draw by Guangzhou Apollo in a cold-hit clash, sending the
enthusiastic home crowd of 5,000 into great anger since this was
Guo'an's third consecutive home draw.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Hongyuan squandered many golden chances and had to be
satisfied with a 2-2 tie with the visiting Chinese Army.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao Hainiu suffered its fifth loss in a row as it dropped
to Shanghai Shenhua 1-3 after wasting a one-goal lead.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Wanda, who has anchored its third league champion during
four years last Thursday, was deadlocked at 0-0 by host Jinan
Taishan.
</P>
<P>
Vanguards Huangdao took a winning trip to Chengdu by beating
Sichuan Quanxing 3-2.

XUZHOU, December 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 250 scholars and

to expand the protection of historical cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
China has 99 historical cities under the State protection. The
cities represent a time span of over 5,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Rapid real estate development in recent years has seriously
threatened the ancient cities, and has led to the adoption of a number
of protection regulations.
</P>
<P>
Scholars called for protecting ancient cities as a whole,
rather than focusing protection on single sites. They also
discussed how to properly protect cities which are popular tourist
attractions.

<HEADLINE> Serbians Vote to Choose New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Serbia's voters began to cast
their ballots Sunday to elect a new president of the republic to
replace Slebodan Milosevic, who moved to the Yugoslav presidency
in July.
</P>
<P>
The three main candidates are Foreign Minister Milan
Milutinovic who represents President Milosevic's ruling Socialist
Party (SPS), Radical Party (SRS) leader Vejislev Seselj and Vuk
Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's poll was held following October's presidential
election which failed when the turnout of the 7.2 million eligible
voters did not exceed the legal minimum of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
In an October run-off, Seselj, a hardline nationalist, won the
biggest share of the vote against Socialist candidate Zoren Lilic.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll in November by Ipress said 36 percent of the
electorate would be given to Milutinovic, 34 percent for Seselj
and 15 percent for Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
Observers said Sunday's election might also be invalidated due
to voter apathy and a low-key campaign and an opposition boycott.
</P>
<P>
If none of the three candidates gets an overall majority in
Sunday's re-run, a run-off between the top two candidates will be
held, probably on December 21.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Shiite Faction Releases Taliban prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 7 (Xinhua) -- An Afghan Shiite faction
opposing Islamic Taliban militia today unilaterally released 10
Taliban captives held in their stronghold in central Afghanistan,
a Red Cross spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The released Taliban men are due to be transported from the
Hezb-e-Wahdat base Bamyan to the Taliban-held eastern Afghan city
of Jalalabad on Monday by a plane operated by the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), announced the spokesman in
Kabul, the Afghan capital, according to a report monitored here
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We feel something good has started and that this is a positive
step," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that, the Hezb-e-Wadhat, which is allied with two other
anti-Taliban forces led by Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum and former
Afghan military chief Ahmad Masood, unilaterally decided to
release 10 of the 80 Taliban fighters they reportedly held.
</P>
<P>
Hezb-e-Wadhat's decision came only days after Dostum and Masood
released 99 Taliban prisoners from their prison camps.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have been battling the coalition forces in central
and northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The hard-line militia have insisted that they would not enter
any negotiations with the rival alliance before the release of all
their prisoners held in the north while the alliance has set the
demilitarization of Kabul as one of their conditions for peace
talks with Taliban.

<HEADLINE> Potash Fertilizer Production Plant Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A microbial potash
fertilizer production plant, one of the largest plants of its kind
in the world, has entered operations in Baoding, north China's
Hebei Province
</P>
<P>
The Microbial Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of
Science commenced construction of the plant in 1996. Construction
of the facility, listed as one of the country's major trial
industrial projects, was completed at a cost of some 32 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The plant produces "Juwei" brand microbial potash fertilizer
which is highly popular with Chinese farmers due to its low price,
high-level effectiveness and pollution-free characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"Juwei" produced during the plant's trial operation period has
been shipped to 27 provinces and regions for application on more
than 30 crops planted on four million hectares. The product was
also exported to India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Viet Nam.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 10,000 tons of microbial potash fertilizer
applied to more than 1.3 million ha. of farmland can increase
output by between 300-400 million kg annually.
</P>
<P>
India has decided to join hands with the Microbial Research
Institute under the Hebei Academy of Sciences to construct a
similar plant with an annual microbial potash fertilizer
production capacity of 3,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
China currently has over 20 million ha. of farmland with a
critical shortage of potassium.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Poverty Alleviation, Unending Story For </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 7 (Xinhua) -- For the Himalayan kingdom of
Nepal, poverty alleviation is an unending story, simply because it
is among the poorest not only in the South Asia region but also in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Even though there have been concerted efforts during the past
four decades to improve the economic condition, the GNP per capita
of 190 U.S. dollars for Nepal is one of the lowest in the world
and has remained stagnant for a considerable length of time, noted
the 1997 Report on Human Development in South Asia produced by the
Human Development Center in Islamabad, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
About 45 percent, or 9.45 million of the Nepalese population
still live below the poverty line. Over four-fifths of the total
population have no access to sanitation and nearly one-half
without access to safe drinking water.
</P>
<P>
And worse still, an estimated 100,000 individuals are forced to
work as bonded laborers. Of the total eight million children in
Nepal, five million have to work to support their families, said a
survey conducted by the National Planning Commission (NPC).
</P>
<P>
"Poverty in Nepal is the result of multiple interwoven
factors," said Narendra B. Amatya, undersecretary in charge of the
Poverty Alleviation Section in the NPC.
</P>
<P>
"We have limited cultivable land area and we have no natural
resources," Mr.Amatya told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Only 17 percent of the land in Nepal is arable, while 68
percent is in the hilly area and 15 percent in the mountainous
area.
</P>
<P>
Though abundant in water resources, Nepal produces a meagre 237
megawatts of hydro-electric power, or less than one percent of its
potential.
</P>
<P>
Underdeveloped physical infrastructure like road and
telecommunications are also blamed for poverty, Mr.Amatya said.
</P>
<P>
"Then we have problem of human resources development. We lack
capital and technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
Frequent changes of government also affect Nepal's social and
economic development, he added.
</P>
<P>
Poverty alleviation has been one of the major objectives of
Nepali governments and a number of programs have been launched in
the past years.
</P>
<P>
Since agriculture has been contributing to over 40 percent of
the gross domestic product (GDP) and providing 82 percent of the
employment, the programs have been focusing on rural areas and
putting high priority on the development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1992-1997), a Rural
Self-reliance Program was launched, under which the central
government allocated a fund of 500,000 rupees (about 10,000 U.S.
dollars) to each of the 4,000 village development committees (VDC)
in the country's 75 districts, and allowed the VDCs to deduct 75
percent of the land tax at their disposal for local development.
</P>
<P>
The VDCs were authorized to decide for their own development
projects, but must have the women directly involved in at least
one project. The central government would provide technical
assistance wherever necessary.
</P>
<P>
This program has turned out a success in accelerating the
building of infrastructure and social services institutions like
road, schools, clinics, irrigation facilities and drinking water
projects.
</P>
<P>
Other successful programs include the Small Farmers Development
Program and the Production Credit for Rural Women. The first
program had such promising components as group liability and
savings and intensive technical support, while the second
organized groups of village women for developmental activities and
small-scale business undertakings for which they received
subsidized commercial financing.

<HEADLINE> China's Processing Sector Gains Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The processing sector
accounted for the largest share of China's foreign trade in the
first nine months of this year, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
China's processing trade grew by 16.8 percent to 120.8 billion
US dollars for the first three quarters of this year and accounted
for 53 percent of total imports and exports during the period,
according to an official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The official told participants of a recent symposium
that processing trade expanded by an average 22 percent
between 1988 and 1996, rising from 29.3 billion US dollars to
146.6 billion US dollars during the period. In addition, the
proportion of processing trade to total trade grew from 28.5
percent to 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, foreign-funded enterprises have replaced
state-owned collective enterprises as the main contributors to the
rapidly growing processing trade sector. Foreign-funded
enterprises accounted for 64 percent of China's total processing
trade in 1996, up 14 percent on 1988.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth in the processing trade has been recorded in both
highly developed coastal areas and less developed interior
provinces and regions, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that processing trade in capital- and
technology-intensive products has reached a considerably higher
level in recent years.

<P>
Meanwhile, the Nepali parliament passed the Amendment Bill on
Land Reforms in October 1996, which guarantees the ownership right
of the 370,000 registered tenants over the land they till. Earlier
a tiller could not claim such a right.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has also been seeking international
cooperation in its efforts to alleviate poverty. Nepal's Makwanpur
district participated in the "SAARC Seven Sisters: District
Development Coordination and Improved Poverty Project Design"
launched in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
Five other member countries of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) -- Bangladesh, India, the Maldives,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- also joined the project. Bhutan did not.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, six district-level fora were established.
They periodically reviewed and monitored the ongoing poverty
alleviation programs in the districts and identified the best
practices for replication and diagnosed possible problems and
constraints to redress them.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Nepal has been putting high priority on poverty
alleviation in its cooperation with donors, which include the
World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and a dozen of developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have borne fruit. "At the beginning of the Eighth
Five-Year Plan period, the level of poverty was 49 percent. Now it
has come down to 45 percent," Mr.Amatya said.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002) implemented as of July 15,
has set poverty alleviation as its major objective and envisages
lowering the poverty line first to 32.56 percent under the ninth
plan, then to 22.5 percent and 15 percent respectively under the
10th (2002-2007) and 11th plans (2007-2012), and finally to 10
percent under the 12th plan (2012-2017).
</P>
<P>
The focus is on production, food security, employment, increase
in income, supply of fertilizers, irrigation facilities, rural
roads, electrification and technology suitable to the agriculture
ecology.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, new special programs will be introduced for the
various communities especially in the remote areas, special
national tribes and socially oppressed communities.
</P>
<P>
A Poverty Alleviation Fund of 40 million rupees (about 650,000
U.S. dollars) will be set up to develop and expand the agro-based
industries.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Perspective Plan (APP) has also been introduced
this year with the objective of attaining high growth rate and
contributing to poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
In the first year of the ninth plan period, the APP will run an
integrated program by coordinating irrigation, technology
development and publicity, loan, production materials, rural roads
and electrification.
</P>
<P>
"Provided that we have good planning, good social mobilization
and we put in hard work, there is no reason why we should not be
able to achieve our goals," Mr.Amatya said.
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that his country is facing some quite
serious problems which are proving "big stumbling blocks in the
way of our national development and poverty alleviation."
</P>
<P>
The first is Nepal has only 17 percent land area under
cultivation and the second is there are no any significant
off-farm activity, he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that 82 percent of the population are engaging in
agriculture, but the agricultural activities last for only six to
seven months. "For the rest of the time, they have no
income-generating activities, so unemployment is as high as 40
percent in the rural areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
The third serious problem is the overgrowth of population,
which is growing at a rate of 2.6 percent annually. "Because the
population pressure, whatever we achieve it eluded," Mr.Amatya
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Universities Experimenting With Non-Major Degree Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Jingyi, one of the first
group of students to graduate from China's Nanchang University in
Jiangxi Province who will be out looking for a job next year, does
not seem too worried about his prospects.
</P>
<P>
"I've taken almost all the science and engineering courses at
the university and think I have a wider range of possibilities in
looking for jobs," he says.
</P>
<P>
The university stopped offering majors for students
like Zhu three years ago, as an experiment in education reforms
and has enrolled more than 200 students, according to Wang
Maoxiang, a dean at the university.
</P>
<P>
Wang says that they plan to extend the experiment to liberal
arts courses.
</P>
<P>
Nanchang University was formed in 1993 by merging Jiangxi
University with Jiangxi Industrial University. More and more
students from the university were facing difficulties in finding a
job. So it tried to give them a wider field to choose from and
a more solid foundation, Wang explains.
</P>
<P>
Some other colleges and universities, including prestigious
Fudan University, have decided to experiment in similar fashion.
</P>
<P>
Yang Fujia, president of Fudan University, says that
departments there will not be divided into specific majors, but
will try to build students' adaptability to the society.
</P>
<P>
According to a source in the State Education Commission, the
current 500 majors in China's colleges and universities will be
reduced by half by June, next year.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Shaosen, deputy-director of the Jiangxi Provincial
Education Commission, says that the current majors in Chinese
colleges and universities are set by the State and are too
specific to meet the needs for the growth of the market-oriented
economy in China.
</P>
<P>
"More versatile and talented people are needed by the society,"
he says.

KUALA LUMPUR, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The six-day Langkawi
International Maritime and Aerospace (LIMA `97) Exhibition
concluded today as a success.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir said LIMA `97 was successful
despite the country's economic problems because it has "got
nothing to do with the economic situation."
</P>
<P>
"Companies participating in LIMA `97 are not suffering from the
economic situation, except some Malaysian companies," he told a
news conference at the end of the exhibition, the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama reported from langkawi, some 500
kilometers north from here.
</P>
<P>
About 60 per cent of 950 exhibitors from the aerospace and
maritime industries present this year have verbally confirmed
their participation for next LIMA Exhibition in 1999, which
Mahathir said would be bigger and more attractive compared to LIMA
'97.
</P>
<P>
This year for the first time, the maritime show was held
separately from the aerospace show to serve the industries better.
</P>
<P>
LIMA '97 was the fourth in the series with the first LIMA
Exhibition held in 1991, the second in 1993, and the third in
1995.
</P>
<P>
LIMA Exhibition has been ranked the world's fourth largest
airshow after Farnborough, Paris and Dubai.
</P>
<P>
A total of 21,000 trade visitors attended this year's LIMA
Exhibition, according to the report quoting official sources.

<HEADLINE> World Court Fixes Dates to Sit for Bakassi Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Court of
Justice at the Hague has fixed March 2 to 11 next year for
hearing in the case concerning the border dispute between Nigeria
and Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
Today's Sunday Tribune newspaper quoted a court statement as
saying that the sitting will be dedicated exclusively to oral
arguments of the parties concerning Nigeria's preliminary
objections to Cameroon's case.
</P>
<P>
Both Nigeria and Cameroon have claimed territorial sovereignty
over the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula and repeated clashes have
been reported since 1994, when Cameroon instituted proceedings
against Nigeria in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
While also accusing Nigeria of militarily occupying the
peninsula, Cameroon asked the court to declare the occupation
unlawful and to cause Nigeria to withdraw unconditionally and pay
reparation for the damage.
</P>
<P>
About two months after the first application in March 1994,
Cameroon again filed an additional application to extend the case
to cover what it alleged is its territory in Lake Chad Area now
occupied by Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria subsequently contended that the court has no
jurisdiction in the case and that Cameroon's grievances are
inadmissible, according to the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency said the court has explained that by
provisions of its statute, it has to decided on preliminary
objections before proceeding to the merits of the case.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's former Minister of Justice, Chief Michael Agbamuche,
went to the court as attorney-general of the federation to meet
the president at the Hague more than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
On his return, the former minister said the court had fixed
March for the hearing and judgement would be delivered in June
next year.

LAGOS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's state assembly
election Saturday was marked by low turn-out amid a generally

In Lagos city, a polling station with 350 registered voters

Investigation by Xinhua show the same story. A polling station

The low turn-out, in fact, has been forecast by media surveys
before the election. Except a few people who said they feel a
responsibility towards the success of democracy, most of the
interviewed people said they would not go to vote.
</P>
<P>
The most cited reasons for not going to vote are general
indifference to politics, little knowledge of the candidates and
disappointment of government policies.
</P>
<P>
Despite the low turn-out, the election was undergone in a
generally orderly and peaceful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
This was made possible by the large presence of police and
security agents and traffic restrictions. The low turn-out itself
also helped.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, there were some slight hitches and
confusions during the election, but none of them was serious
enough to affect the fairness of the whole election.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's election will produce about 990 state legislative
seats, contested by the country's five political parties.
</P>
<P>
The election is part of the military government's transition
to civil rule program. It will be followed by a national congress
election in April next year and a presidential election in
August.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Opposition Parties Call Hartal in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) and other six small parties have called a
country-wide dawn-to-dusk hartal today.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the hartal was to protest against what they called
the "anti-national" agreement on the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT)
issue which was signed in Dhaka between the government and the CHT
tribal organization on December 2.
</P>
<P>
Begum Khaleda Zia, BNP Chairperson and Leader of the Opposition
in Parliament, announced Wednesday the party's hartal program,
right after the accord was signed.
</P>
<P>
Today's hartal was culminated by the participation of some
small political parties such as Jamaat-e-Islam, the Jatiya Party
faction led by kazi Zafar Ahmed, the National Democratic Alliance
and the Jatiya Ganatantrik Party.
</P>
<P>
The BNP and other opposition parties brought out torch
processions in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country to drum up
support for today's hartal.
</P>
<P>
Besides, BNP central leaders and its front organizations met
yesterday to discuss "their preparations to make the hartal
successful."
</P>
<P>
The leaders and activists of the opposition camp had organized
a series of processions and street corner meetings against the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The government took all precautionary measures to maintain
peace by monitoring law and order situation during hartal hours. A
heavy contingent of police and security forces were deployed at
all strategic points of the city during the hartal period.
</P>
<P>
However, ambulance, vehicles of newspapers and law enforcing
agencies, and medicine and food shops remained out of the purview
of today's hartal.
</P>
<P>
There has been no report about severe clashes between the two
sides till now.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba left here today for Harare on a one-day visit, during
which he will discuss the issues affecting the sub-region with
his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents will also discuss issues concerning the
bilateral relations between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
When asked before departure at the Lusaka International
Airport whether the two leaders will discuss reports that former
Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda is seeking asylum in Zimbabwe,
Chiluba said that he has no official information about the
issue, the Zambia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Kaunda, following an abortive
military coup in October to overthrow the Chiluba government, has
been seeking political asylum in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba stressed that the reports started as rumors and to
date there is no official information about them.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba is accompanied by Presidential Affairs Minister Eric
Lilwamba, Acting Foreign Affairs Minister Amussa Mwanamwambwa and
other senior government officials.

GUANGZHOU, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A below-strength Chinese team
still proved too much for Uzbekistan as the defending champion
routed the former Soviet Republic 8-0 in the group B at the 11th
Asian Women's Soccer Championship Sunday.
</P>

The young striker found a rich vein of scoringpower in the
match which saw her striking again in the 45th, 62th and 74th
minute.
</P>
<P>
The home side led 5-0 after halftime and should have changed
the scoreline more than three times in a second half where it
fluffed a dozen of gilt-edged opportunites.
</P>
<P>
Head coach Ma pat his youngsters on the back after the match
but said he had expected more goals.
</P>
<P>
"Our young players performed quite well in the match," Ma tlod
the news conference. "But they could have make more goals if they
were acting more coolly before the goal."

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese court has sentenced two
men to death for stealing the heads of five ancient stone statues,
with an accomplice sentenced to eight years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Han Huamin and Sun Guobin, the principal offenders, were
sentenced to death by the court in Xianyang City, Shaanxi
Province, for stealing the heads of five stone statues buried in a
Tang Dynasty (618-907) tomb in Sanyuan County. The political
rights of the offenders have also been suspended in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
Accessory Tu Qingmin was sentenced to eight years in prison for
leasing Han a tricycle used in the robbery.

An investigation revealed that Sun instructed Han to pillage
the tomb on the night of May 3 this year. Sun later arranged for
Han to ship the stolen objects to Guangzhou, with one relic lost
in transit. Sun sold the four remaining relics for 40,000 yuan
(4,120 US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Australians To Vote Delegates For Constitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Australians have just two days
left to mail their votes for delegates to the next year's
constitutional convention which will debate whether or not
Australia should become a republic.
</P>
<P>
Special Minister of State Nick Minchin in a statement issued
today urged all voters to exercise their right to shape the
convention due to begin February next year.
</P>
<P>
"The convention will be an occasion of great national
significance, with potentially a very big influence on the way
Australia is governed in the future," Minchin said.
</P>
<P>
All ballot papers must be received by the Australian Electoral
Commission (AEC) by 6pm on December 9. Papers can be hand
delivered and the AEC will continue reissuing voting papers to
replace lost packages until just before the close of polls on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ballot will elect 76 delegates to join the 76 delegates
already appointed by the government to the convention.
</P>
<P>
Newly-appointed Australian Democrats Deputy Leader Natasha
Stott Despoja today criticized the constitutional convention
process as failing to represent young people in Australia.
</P>
<P>
She said she was concerned that 34 percent of young people had
not received ballot papers for the convention, "I've been
concerned all along that the constitutional convention don't
necessarily reflect the diversity and difference that's evident in
our population," Despoja told Network Ten's 'Meet the Press'
program.
</P>
<P>
"And that of course means young people are usually not
represented," it was particularly distressing as 30 percent of
Australia's population were under 30 years of age, she said.
</P>
<P>
The convention, to decide if the Constitution should be changed
to create a republic and which model to adopt and a timetable for
change, will take place over 10 days next year.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets with Arafat on US Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today held talks with visiting Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat on the U.S. efforts to salvage the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here Saturday night from Geneva, briefed
Mubarak on the outcome of his talks with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in the Swiss city.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's Political Advisor Osama el-Baz later joined the
meeting together with Secretary-General of the PLO Executive
Committee Mahmoud Abbas, PNA Minister of Planning and
International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath and member of Fatah
Central Committee Hani al Hassan.
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, Albright, stepping up efforts to break the Mideast
peace deadlock, said after talks with Arafat that she would meet
him and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu separately later
this month somewhere in western Europe for the second time in a
month.
</P>
<P>
Albright met with Netanyahu in Paris on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Senior U.S. officials said that Albright had asked the two
leaders to make decisions on key peace issues before the meetings.
</P>
<P>
In hopes of staging "final status" Israeli-Palestinian talks,
Albright is pushing Israel to carry out a new troop withdrawal in
the West Bank and freeze Jewish settlements, and the Palestinians
to crack down on extremists.
</P>
<P>
But Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Zahdi Kedra, in statements
to the Middle East News Agency Saturday, said the PNA is
determined not to engage in the final status negotiations until
Israel implemented commitments stipulated in the signed accords.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is to leave here later today for Doha, en route to
Tehran to attend the 8th Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC) slated for Tuesday in Iran.
</P>
<P>
This will be Arafat's first visit to Tehran in more than a
decade. The Palestinians hope the Islamic summit would take a
strong stand on Jerusalem issue to protect Muslim shrines in the
holy city.

<HEADLINE> Tiny Village Takes Election of Deputy Seriously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- An election for deputy to the
Fifth People's Congress of Lhunze County, Tibet, is going on at
Yumai village, perhaps the world's smallest administrative region
in terms of population, with only 18 villagers.
</P>
<P>
Zhouga, head of the village on the southern slope of the
Himalayas, said that "despite our small population, villagers
attach great importance to the election as it embodies our
democratic rights."
</P>
<P>
For thousands of years the village, which covers an area of
1,900 square kilometers and lies 600 kilometers southwest of
Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, remains separated
from the rest of the world by snow-capped mountains during winter.
</P>
<P>
However, remarkable changes have taken place in recent
years. With the help of local government villagers now have access
to a hospital, schools and TV, which they had never heard of years
before.
</P>
<P>
"We used to live a lonely life during the six-month period when
we were cut off from the rest of the world by heavy snow," said
Sanggyai Paqu, father of Zhouga, whose family of three had been
the only one in the village until last year.
</P>
<P>
The boundless land of the village is a natural pastureland, but
not suitable for agriculture, as a result "all grain and
vegetables we eat had to be bought from outside of the village
before winter," said Sanggyai, "and the bumpy journey usually
takes seven to eight hours even for good horse riders."
</P>
<P>
Each year, Sanggyai's family would weave all sorts of bamboo
articles and sell them at fairs held outside the village. In
return, they would bring back clothes, salt and other daily
necessities.
</P>
<P>
Personnel from the autonomous region's department of
communications have surveyed the topography of the village. "It
seems that a highway, which is bound to tie the village closer
with the rest of the world, is expected to be built in the
foreseeable future," Zhouga said.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese City Maintaining Growth in Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The city of Shantou in south
China's Guangdong Province had 3.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
exports in the first ten months of this year, up 65.5 percent from
the same period last year, continuing its growth in exports, local
officials say.
</P>
<P>
There are 57 overseas-funded enterprises in the city, each with
exports worth 10 million U.S. dollars, according to statistics,
which is the result of combined efforts of the foreign trade
department and the local commodity inspection bureau.
</P>
<P>
During the first ten months, an audit revealed 124 money-losing
enterprises, which have now been closed down or had their
operations changed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the commodity inspection bureau has been providing
ISO9000 evaluation services for large and medium-sized enterprises
and overseas-funded companies to help them ensure the quality of
export products.
</P>
<P>
The city has also been expanding its overseas market. Some 32
trade organizations have visited 26 countries and regions this
year bringing back 14 million U.S. dollars worth of contracts on
exports.

<HEADLINE> Gulf to Build Integrated Power Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The six members of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) today decided to build their power
systems into an integrated network, the Kuwaiti News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The electricity ministers of the countries made the decision in
Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia, after examining the results of a
meeting of the project's founding committee, according to the
agency.
</P>
<P>
The project is intended for the six countries to share their
power surplus, saving them from building more power stations, said
Qatari Minister of Power and Water Ahmed Mohammed Ali al-Sebaie,
who chaired the meeting of the ministers.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar are asked to contribute
35 percent of the 2.2-billion-U.S.-dollar cost in the first phase
of the project, and the remainder will be secured through bank
loans, al-Sebaie said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that once the second phase begins, the shares of
the cost by the United Arab Emirates and Oman will be specified.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari minister anticipated that the project would start in
three or four years.
</P>
<P>
GCC, a political, economic and defense alliance set up in 1981,
groups Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Seeks Islamic Help in Lifting UN Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad
Saeed Al-Sahhaf said here today that his country will seek Islamic
countries' help in lifting the U.N. sanctions imposed on it.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf made the remarks to reporters on the sidelines of the
on-going foreign ministerial meeting of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC), preceding the OIC summit scheduled for
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf said the issue of the seven-year-old U.N. sanctions
on his country will be raised at the OIC foreign ministerial
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that Baghdad has stopped selling its oil in
protest against the United Nations' disagreement with Iraq's
demands for needed goods.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the U.N. does not agree with Iraqi demands for
purchase and distribution of basic commodities needed by the
country (Iraq), we will not export our oil," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government announced Friday that the country will
not sell oil under a U.N.-extended third term until its
grievances over delays in food and medical supplies are met.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here also said that the Iraqi crude oil sales
through Turkey stopped early Friday right after the end of the
second term of the oil-for-food deal between the U.N. and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has repeatedly complained that the
implementation of the oil-for-food programs was delayed under the
pressure of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to export 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to buy badly needed
food, medicine and other humanitarian goods.

<P>
ANKARA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz is to pay visits to Britain and Luxembourg on December 9 and
10 to rally support for Turkey's European Union (EU) membership
bid.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz will explain to his British counterpart Tony Blair
Turkey's expectations for full EU membership during his one-day
visit in London, said a Foreign Ministry statement issued here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey will ask Britain's help on the issue of Turkey's
inclusion in the planned EU enlargement process," it said.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz will fly to Luxembourg December 10 to meet his
Luxembourg counterpart Jean-Claude Juncker on Ankara's EU bid.
</P>
<P>
He will persuade Juncker, whose country holds the current EU
term presidency, to take a positive stance concerning this issue,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit is reportedly scheduled to be held in Luxembourg
later this month to finalize the policy of expanding the European
body.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been sparing no effort to strive for a full EU
membership since 1987, but so far little substantial progress has
been made due to its differences with EU, especially Germany, over
a number of issues.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Juncker held talks with Yilmaz and Turkish
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city,
but failing to give Turks an encouraging message.

<HEADLINE> Ousted Afghan President Requests for Seat at OIC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The ousted President of
Afghanistan Burhanuddin Rabbani has requested the seat of his
country at the forthcoming Islamic summit be granted to his
government, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
To grant the seat to the government of Afghanistan recognized
by the United Nations will help preserve the territorial integrity
of the country, Rabbani said in an interview with the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's seat at the summit of the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) due 9-11 this month was announced to remain
vacant at a meeting of the foreign ministers of the OIC members
earlier this year due to the serious conflicts in the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani slammed the recent offensives in northeastern
Afghanistan and the absence from a peace conference by the
Taleban, the Islamic militant group which drove him out of the
capital Kabul in September last year.
</P>
<P>
"Taleban's military operations and its absence from the Isfahan
peace conference is indicative of its warmongering policies," said
Rabbani, claiming that the anti-Taleban United Islamic Front is
dependable to bring peace and tranquility in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A peace conference was held last week in Iran's central city of
Isfahan by leaders of Afghan factions, including Rabbani, former
prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and former northern Afghan
opposition warlord Abdul Malik. But it was boycotted by the Taleban.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's special representative for Afghanistan
Alaeddin Boroujerdi said today that the OIC summit will discuss
the possibility to hold an Afghanistan peace conference in
parallel to the summit.
</P>
<P>
If possible, the conference will be held in Iranian capital
Tehran with the participation of five of the neighbors of
Afghanistan as well as Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.

CAIRO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Assistant Secretary General
Nafis Sadik, also executive director of the U.N. Population Fund,
today praised Egypt's experiment in the family-planning and
population fields.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with Egyptian Health and Population
Minister Ismail Sallam after meeting Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri here, Sadik said the U.N. Population Fund is to
generalize Egypt's experiment in other countries of the world,
especially the African and Islamic ones.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that governments, private organizations,
parliaments, mass media and educational and cultural organizations
should intensify their efforts so that the health and population
programs can achieve their desired results.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sallam praised the close cooperation between the
U.N. Population Fund and Egypt's Health and Population Ministry,
who has succeeded in cutting the population growth rate from 2.8
percent ten years ago to 2.1 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that his country is keen on its cooperation with
African nations in the health and population fields.
</P>
<P>
Sadik arrived here Friday on a visit with the aim of examining
with Egyptian officials ways of promoting cooperation between the
fund and Egypt, in addition to getting Egypt's support for her
nomination as head of the World Health Organization.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Likely to Visit Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHARJAH, UAE, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Arab League Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid said here today that he will
visit the sanctions-ridden Iraq "in the nearest opportunity."
</P>
<P>
He made the intention clear at the third Arab-African fair
which opened today in the capital of the Emirate of Sharjah. But
he did not give details on the visit.
</P>
<P>
The proposed visit will be viewed as a show of Arab support to
Iraq which is struggling for the lifting of the U.N. economic
sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, observers
said.
</P>
<P>
Meguid also called for an end to the sanctions which bar Iraqi
export of oil, the country's main revenue earner, and has crippled
the economy.
</P>
<P>
"It is the time for the U.N. Security Council to review the
sanctions against Iraq because the Iraqi people are suffering from
the ban," said the chief of the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
The seven-day fair, held under the auspices of the Arab League
and the Organization of African Unity, is attended by 60 countries
and a number of U.N. organizations.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Complains Heavy Losses by UN Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHARJAH, UAE, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Minister of Trade
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said here today that his country has
sustained disastrous losses of lives and revenues brought about by
the seven-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters during an Arab-African fair which opened
here today that Iraq has lost 120 billion U.S. dollars after Iraq
was banned from exporting oil, its major revenue earner.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that 125 million Iraqi women and children have
died of the lack of food and medicines since the sanctions were
imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister described the sanctions as "the most severe
and comprehensive" ever in the human history.
</P>
<P>
However, Saleh said that despite the "disasters," Iraq has
managed to be "self-sufficient in vegetables and fruits."
</P>
<P>
Iraq also has successfully utilized its iron resources in the
country's reconstruction process following the 1991 Gulf War, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the oil-for-food agreement between the U.N. and
Iraq, Saleh complained that since the deal came to effect a year
ago, Iraq has only got 35 million U.S. dollars of the total
incomes of 2.35 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the oil-exporting earnings "has gone to the United
Nations, special commissions and some persons in the commissions,"
he claimed.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official called for the investigation of the funds
which are put in the French Bank to "show the world where the
money went." The funds should be used to buy food for Iraqi
children and save their lives instead, he added.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil for every six months to buy humanitarian
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Saleh stressed the importance of boosting his country's
cooperation with all Arab countries in the field of importing food.
</P>
<P>
Saleh arrived here today for the third African-Arab fair. But
there is no Iraqi delegation due to "transporting and other
special conditions," Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
The seven-day fair was staged under the auspices of the Arab
League and the Organization of African Unity. A total of 60
countries took part in the fair and a number of U.N. organizations
also attended.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Trade Union Resumes Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Trade Union resumed
nationwide strike this morning as it failed to reach an agreement
with the Finance Ministry over pension reform, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Trade Union leader Amir Perez said today that he had informed
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Ezer
Weizman that the negotiations between striking workers and the
Treasury have fallen through.
</P>
<P>
Some 700,000 workers took part in the strike which was
launched Wednesday in protest against government plans for wages
reform and privatization. And today's strike will spread to
workers of the education system and public transportation.
</P>
<P>
The Trade Union permitted the striking workers to return to
work over the weekend in a bid to pave the way to renew
negotiations with the Treasury Saturday night. And it had
threatened to intensify the strike if the talks failed.
</P>
<P>
One of the key sticking points during the negotiations
was to reach compromise over the pension agreement signed in May
1996 by Perez and former finance minister Avraham Shohat, which,
current Minister of Finance Ya'acov Neeman, with Netanyahu's full
backing, refuses to uphold.
</P>
<P>
The Trade Union is demanding the agreement be retroactively
enforced, while the Treasury says it is prepared to allow
implementation from January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Paris Saturday night during his European trip,
Netanyahu said that he has been in constant touch with Neeman and
he hoped that the workers will end their strike.
</P>
<P>
The damage to the economy from the first three day of the
strike, which has paralyzed the country by effectively shutting
down airports, seaports, banks, government offices and
state-owned industries, was estimated at some 150 million to 200
million shekels (about 42 million to 57 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Labor Court will hold a hearing on the
State Attorney's demand to impose fine on Trade Union leaders and
heads of workers' committees for continuing the strike despite the
back-to-work orders issued last week.
</P>
<P>
The strike is the latest round in the Trade Union's battle
against government economic reform plans, which have sparked
fears that worker's rights would be harmed.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Economy Slows Down in Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Impacted by the financial crisis
sweeping much of Asia, the Philippine economy slowed down in the
first three quarters of this year, growing by six percent compared
with 7.3 percent in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts forecast that the economic growth would be even slower
next year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the country's economy had been growing steadily
thanks to the Fidel Ramos administration's reform efforts to
revive the economy and measures to stabilize the political
situation. The gross national product (GNP) grew by an annual
average of more than one percent from 1.4 percent in 1992 to 6.8
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
With its economic achievements and the successful holding of
the 4th informal leadership meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum last year, the Philippines was dubbed by
some international organizations "a new economic tiger" in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, the tiger fell sick this year. Its economy showed
sluggish signs in the first six months, registering a mere 5.9
percent growth compared with the year-ago level of 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Then it was hit by the region-wide financial turmoil which
started in Thailand in July and has spread to South Korea and
Japan. The Philippine peso has since devaluated by at least 35
percent to about 35 pesos against the U.S. dollar now. The
composite index of the local stock market has also fallen by a
third.
</P>
<P>
To defend the peso, the Central Bank has depleted the country's
gross international reserve to 10.3 billion dollars from 12
billion dollars early this year.
</P>
<P>
The adverse effects of the crisis have been felt in most
sectors of the Philippine economy. Industrial growth in the third
quarter dropped by one percent to 5.8 percent compared with the
second quarter, manufacturing shrank to 4.5 percent and the
service sector, a pillar of the economy, fell by one percent to
5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government's budget went into the red for first
time in four years, posting a 2.3 billion peso (65 million
dollars) deficit so far this year. Due to higher interest rates,
the business sector also reported a fall of at least 10 percent in
business since the beginning of the currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, the country was also struck by the El Nino weather
phenomenon. Suffering from a drought caused by El Nino, the
country's agriculture, which grew by 4 percent last year, has
slowed down to only 1.1 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, insisted that the country was the
least affected in the financial turmoil and its economic
fundamentals remained strong. It said the country's banks remained
healthy and major economic indicators were sound when compared
with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of this year, the country's exports grew
by 23 percent, slashing the trade deficit to 830 million dollars
from 11.3 billion dollars recorded a year earlier. Total
investments reached 15.3 billion dollars in the 10-month period,
up by 366 percent compared with the year-ago level, and inflation
stood at a low level of 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"In view of these, we are quite confident that we can actually
end the year within the 5.5 to 6 percent revised projection that
we have for GNP", said Economic Development Secretary Cielito
Habito. The Philippines would be "the first tiger out of the wood"
(the financial storm) next year with a GNP growth of 5 to 5.3
percent and a gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 6 to 7
percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
But the International Monetary Fund (IMF), from which the
Philippines is scheduled to exit before the year-end, has a
different viewpoint. It forecast that the country could manage an
economic growth of only 4 to 4.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The IMF arrived at this conclusion after sending a team to
examine the Philippines' economic conditions last month. It held
that the country's current account deficit and foreign debt were
too big, having reached 3.5 billion dollars and 44 billion
dollars, or 4.2 percent and 50 percent of the GDP respectively.
</P>
<P>
Things are likely to get worse before they could get better for
the economy, analysts said. They said the adverse effects of the
financial crisis would be in full blow next year and the economic
growth would be even slower until the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, adjustments would have to be made in the 1998
economic growth targets," Habito said, adding that the high
interest rates and El Nino would dampen growth.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the financial meltdown, other threats to the economy
also exist -- Some 35 percent of the Filipinos are living in
poverty, economic growth is felt only by the rich and in the
capital region, infrastructure is seriously inadequate and
kidnappings, corruption and other crimes are widespread in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Political instability is also threatening economic growth. Some
business leaders have accused President Ramos and his supporters
of paying attention only to revising the Constitution in order to
extend the term of Ramos and of neglecting the economic slowdown
and the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Next year, the presidential election will take the center stage
in the Philippines. Whether a new president would be elected
smoothly? Will he or she continue Ramos' reforms? Or will the new
president be able to find new ways to boost the economy?
Economists believed that all these factors would affect next
year's economic growth.

</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A nation-wide network of privatized GP surgeries is
being set up by Britain's leading health insurers in a
direct challenge to the national Health Service (NHS). The
three companies behind the scheme are recruiting hundreds
of doctors direct from the NHS, offering them higher wages
and reduced responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>

launch an urgent investigation into a fresh outbreak of a
deadly new strain of flu. Two deaths and two other suspected

in chickens, has begun to spread among humans, and could
set off a deadly world fly epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Dozens of ceremonial officials are to be stripped of
their royal status in moves to modernize the British
monarchy. Buckingham Palace advisers are pressing for the

titled and obscure posts, to be reduced to the bare minimum
necessary to oversee the Queen's day-to-day affairs.

<HEADLINE> March Calling for Peace Launched in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Some ten thousand people
took part in a march Sunday morning through Cambodia's capital of
Phnom Penh calling for peace.
</P>
<P>
Banners inscribed with slogans such as "Strive for peace" and
"Realize national reconciliation" were held by the participants
during the march, which was organized by the Khmer Nations Party
(KNP).
</P>
<P>
The people, headed by KNP President Sam Rainsy, marched for
more than two hours before they arrived at a temple in the suburbs
of the city, where they held a ceremony to pray for peace in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
A 38-year-old disabled veteran told Xinhua that the war in
Cambodia which lasted several decades has effected serious
disasters, causing innumerable people dead or disabled.
</P>
<P>
"Although no large-scale battles have broken out since 1993,
there is still no real national reconciliation. I lost my leg
during a battle near the border with Thailand last year," he added.
</P>
<P>
"My purpose of marching is to express the hope that the real
national reconciliation and peace would be realized and no
tragedies would occur any more in Cambodia," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Companies Become Victims of Web Racket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Some "pirate" operators
have been deliberately registering the names of South African
companies on the Internet and then demanding money from them if
they want to use their own names on a Web site, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Since this is reaching alarming proportions, companies are
urged to register their domain names even if they are not
considering a Web address in the foreseeable future, according to
the Sunday Tribune newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The disturbing fact is that because the amounts the pirates
charge companies to hand over their domain names are not that
high, usually no more than 5,000 or 6,000 Rand (1,040 or 1,250
U.S. Dollars), so most companies simply pay up rather than take
the more costly litigation route," said Douglas Reed, a computer
company executive.
</P>
<P>
But the ransom money could be very high, Reed warned.
</P>
<P>
A domain name registration costs only 200 Rand (a little more
than 40 Dollars). Therefore, even companies not planning a Web
site could find registration good insurance for their brands.

<HEADLINE> Cost Of Keeping Pets In Shanghai Goes Up Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- China's leading economic and
financial center has increased the cost of keeping a pet dog --
from 200 yuan (about 24 US dollars) to 2,000 yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
A new regulation from the Municipal Finance Bureau, which is
intended to slow the increase in the number of dogs, says that dog
owners in urban districts will have to pay the municipal
government that amount each year, while dog owners in the
outskirts will pay 1,000 yuan, farmers, 100 yuan, a year. The
former is a five-fold increase and the latter is twice the old
amount.
</P>
<P>
The city began to collect pet dog fees in 1994. The number of
dogs in urban districts has fallen from 8,000 in 1994 to 5,000
today, while the number in rural areas has fallen from 70,000 to
10,000.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Takes Measures to Save Wildlife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Contingency measures have been put
in place around Zimbabwe's national parks to cushion the effects of
the impending drought on wild animals, the Sunday Mail reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and wildlife non-governmental organisations
are keeping a keen eye on the El Nino situation to ensure that there
is a recurrence of the 1992 drought which saw almost half of the
wildlife population being killed in the country.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a spokesperson for the Ministry of Mines,
Environment and Tourism, saying that mechanisms have been put in place
in every national park to ensure the safety of animals if the country
does not get normal rains this season which started in November.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson said the ministry paid particular attention to
water situations.
</P>
<P>
The country's largest wildlife group, Wildlife Society, has a
program to ensure that water is available for animals. The group
is taking seriously warnings from meteorologists that Zimbabwe and the
region are likely to have one of their worst droughts because of the
El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
''Right now we are still monitoring the water situation in all
parks. However, we won't be caught unaware like what happened in
1992, because we managed to drill boreholes in every park in addition
to natural water points,'' said Chief Executive of the Widlife
Society Ian Cormack.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Warns Against Tribalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has warned aspiring candidates in the ongoing Copperbelt
provincial elections of the ruing Movement for Multi-party
Democracy (MMD) against tribalism.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Mail today quoted the president as saying that there is no room
for campaigning on tribal lines and that any one found doing so
will be severely disciplined.
</P>
<P>
He issued the warning Saturday when he opened the MMD provincial
conference in Ndola, in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba told the candidates not to insult each other in their
campaigns but to explain to the people what they would be able to
do once elected.
</P>
<P>
"Do not approach elections on tribal lines. You should elect
people on merit and those that would run the party effectively,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that he will not tolerate any one who would
start campaigning for the MMD presidency for the year 2001,
saying such people were undermining his authority because he is
still the president.
</P>
<P>
He said campaigning for the MMD presidency will only be
allowed in the year 2001 and not now.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the adoption of councillors in the forthcoming
local government elections, Chiluba said that the party will not
adopt any member who already has a party position because this
has in the past worked to the detriment of the party.

<HEADLINE> No Sign Of Swans On China's "Swan Lake" This Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Winter is here, but there's not
a swan in sight on the lakes of the southern part of Shanxi
province.
</P>
<P>
Not a single swan has landed at the nature reserve near
Yuncheng city, which has four lakes on a 4,800-hectare area of
wetlands, even though other migratory wildfowl like egrets, gulls,
and ducks can been seen. It was a major stopover in the past of
swans migrating from Siberia from mid-October to mid-November.
The birds used to number 500 or 600 at one time, local officials
say.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that swans are more cold-resistant than some other
migratory birds and their delayed appearance may be the result of
the El Nino effect that has caused a rise in temperatures in the
Northern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi Province has also suffered from drought this winter
because of less rainfall, causing drying up of some of the
wetlands.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has urged the National Democratic Front (NDF) to respond to the
government's unilateral ceasefire to pave the way for further
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, Ramos said he hopes that the
NDF will "respond to the government's 30-day unilateral suspension
of offensive military and police operations" to "enable their
members to enjoy the Christmas season with their families."
</P>
<P>
The government started the implementation of the unilateral
ceasefire on December 5.
</P>
<P>
"An extended mutual ceasefire can be agreed upon by both Panels
to provide the proper climate for their continuing formal talks on
human rights," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
"A basic human right of our people is their inherent right to
live in peace with order, a right that we must all uphold and
respect," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Ramos also praised government negotiators and
NDF leaders for effecting the safe release of captured Police
Chief Inspector Rene Francisco and Army Sergeant Joaquin Melad,
which, he said, will boost the peace talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Francisco and Melad were turned over last Friday in Tanay,
Rizal, near Manila, by NDF leaders to members of the government
peace panel and Speaker Jose de Venecia.
</P>
<P>
Through the years, Ramos said, the government has been
undertaking "confidence-building measures," which are part of its
"continuing peace process to bring about the proper climate for
peace-making, peace-building and national development."

A total of 15 candidates have been cleared to run for the
Kenyan presidency in the December 29 elections, the most crowded
presidential race since the country declared independence in
early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, 74 and in power
for 19 years, is widely expected to win the campaign with
five-year more tenure largely due to the division of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
His powerful rivals include Mwai Kibaki of Democratic Party of
Kenya, Wamalwa Kijana of FORD-Kenya, Raila Odinga of National
Development Pary of Kenya, Charity Ngilu of Social Democratic
Party and Martin Shikuku of FORD-Asili.
</P>
<P>
A presidential aspirant can be qualified as he (she) gets the
mandatory 1,000 signatures of supporters, but to be a legal
Kenyan president needs no less than 25 percent votes in five out
of the country's eight provinces.

<HEADLINE> Thai Industry Restructuring Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's National Science and
Technology Committee has urged the government to increase
competence in technology and restructure the export industries to
better compete in the global market.
</P>
<P>
The committee, chaired by Science, Technology and Environment
Minister Yingphan Manasikarn, said in a report that the government
should stress the role of science and technology in industries,
which will help tackle the economic problems facing the country.
</P>
<P>
It proposes allocation of 15 billion baht (357 million U.S.
dollars) into a fund for developing industrial competence and
export business. The money can come from loans from the World Bank
and the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be used to develop technology for potential
industries which will be fundamental in developing manufacturing
processes, management and marketing, the Bangkok Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed that the country is lacking its own
technology for industries of both manufacturing and service
business which could sustain economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yongyuth Yuthawong, director of the National Science
and Technology Development Agency, said on Saturday that
technology upgrading should be the main factor in the country's
industry restructuring.
</P>
<P>
He said spending money in fighting the financial crisis alone
is not enough for the country in the long run, adding that an
amount of money should be put to support technology and research
in order to increase industrial competence in the global market.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh President Urge Politicians to Stop Fling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Shahabuddin
Ahmed has urged political parties to refrain from flinging abuse
at each other, such as branding their rivals as "enemies of the
state, the country and the people," local press reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on "Thoughts on Election Reforms"
organized by the Supreme Court Bar Association in Dhaka Saturday,
Ahmed said the parties also should not regard themselves as the
only patriots and brand others as "villains and traitors."
</P>
<P>
"The root of all the troubles lies with the political parties,"
he noted. "Political parties should change their attitude to each
other."
</P>
<P>
"Political parties must learn from the past and forget their
bitterness," the president added.
</P>
<P>
"They must look forward and concentrate on the existing
problems," he said. "They must believe in peaceful coexistence and
give up the present politics of crushing other parties, which is
impossible in this civilized world today."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of parliamentary form of democracy, the president
said: "the Opposition must work in close cooperation with the
government, but this cooperation is totally absent in our
country."
</P>
<P>
Instead of mutual understanding and harmonious relations
between the government and the opposition, there exists bitter
animosity between them, the president Ahmed. "This reflects
necessarily on all matters of state, including conduct of
elections from top to bottom."

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Will Not Play Second Fiddle Any More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 7 (Xinhua)-- In order to enthuse its rank
and file, India's Congress Party has unveiled a new approach in
the run-up to the general elections and decided not to play second
fiddle to the United Front (UF) any more.
</P>
<P>
In the past 18 months, the Congress has been the main helper of
the UF for its rule in the central government.
</P>
<P>
Casting away its 18-month-old image as a secondary partner of
the UF, the Congress, in a statement issued on Saturday, attacked
the performance of the UF government and asserted the Congress'
primacy as the natural leader of the "secular" formation in the
fight against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), labeled as the
"communal force" in India.
</P>
<P>
The Congress has ruled out national level alliance with the UF
in election campaigns. But it added that it would have some
cooperation with some of the UF constituents.
</P>
<P>
"Without the Congress support, the UF could not muster the
majority in the House and even if the Congress remained neutral,
it could not get more members than that of the BJP combination,"
the Congress statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Congress also blamed the current economic crisis including
the devaluation of the rupee on the UF government's inept handling
of the economy and inefficient management.

<HEADLINE> 5,000 More to Lose Jobs in Suspended Finance Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 5,000 more employees
working for Thailand's 58 suspended finance companies are expected
to lose their jobs starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
Since the suspension orders were given to the 58 firms by the
former administration in June and August, about 10,000 employees
have already been laid off.
</P>
<P>
The financial restructuring agency (FRA) will on Monday
announce which of the 58 suspended finance companies will be
allowed to reopen.
</P>
<P>
Finance sector sources believe the number will not be more than
five, possibly just three.
</P>
<P>
FRA chief, Tawatchai Yongkittikul, revealed on Saturday that
only about 1,000 finance staff will keep their jobs after Monday's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Those who will keep their jobs will help the FRA to chase
debts.
</P>
<P>
Finance companies allowed to reopen are expected to be able to
resume operations within two weeks. However, the FRA will allow
them two to three months to find new partners to boost their
capital.
</P>
<P>
As for those companies which have failed the FRA's screening
and will have to be closed, their accounts will be audited to see
if dishonest management has been involved in their operations.
</P>
<P>
Private firms have been hired to help the FRA split good from
bad debts, according to deputy finance minister Pichet
Phanvichartkul Saturday.

<HEADLINE> California Tourism Shadowed by Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Travel agents and hotel
managers are concerned that the economic and currency upheaval in
Asia is causing less visitors travelling across Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The number of Asians visiting Southern California leaped 21
percent last year to 2.4 million, but industry officials believe
that number could drop significantly this year as a result of
economic turmoil in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and
Indonesia. They predict Southern California tourism to grow no
more than 2 percent to 3 percent in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
"It will be expensive for the people of those countries to
travel to the United States," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for
the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp., in a speech at the
Southern California Visitor Industry Outlook conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the number of U.S. visitors to Asia, though
also decreasing, has not been as severe, partly because U.S.-based
travelers still benefit from the dollar's strength against the
weakening Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
"The hotel prices in Asia are down and air fares are under
pressure," said Scott Mowrer, U.S. sales manager for Cathay
Pacific Airways of Hong Kong, "It is a pretty good time to be
shopping for bargains to and from Asia."
</P>
<P>
Cathay is among the Asian-based carriers that are
hurting. Others include Japan Airlines, Korean Air, Singapore
Airlines and Malaysian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. carriers suffering the most are Northwest Airlines and
United Airlines which dominate U.S. airlines serving the region.
</P>
<P>
Declines have been particularly evident in the number of Asian
tourists visiting Hawaii and the mainland United States, where Los
Angeles and San Francisco are gateway stops.
</P>
<P>
Travel agents and hotel managers believe that Southern
California would have to work harder at making overseas visitors
comfortable if it was to avoid a fall-off.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that hoteliers to hire more Asian-speaking
employees to woo limited Asian tourists and to offer discounts or
room rates, currently averaging to 106.9 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Speculatives Turn Weak on BSE Market Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 7 (Xinhua)-- Speculatives turned weak and
the sensitive index fell 91.21 points in dull trade on the Bombay
Stock Exchange (BSE) market last week following heavy selling
pressure by operators disappointed at parliament dissolution and
the mid-term poll announcement.
</P>
<P>
Failure of political parties to find a solution to form a
government, which led to dissolution of Parliament and the
announcement of elections, made traders nervous as the whole
process is likely to have an adverse effect on the economy.
</P>
<P>
The market situation would have been worse if financial
institutions had not extended their support that was termed by the
marketmen as aggressive at the fag end. The rupee's plunge to an
all-time low of 39.90/95 against the U.S. dollar during the
trading on last Tuesday also affected the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index showed a fall of 91.21 points, ending
the week at 3,469.08 as against the previous weekend close of
3,560.29. The national index lost substantially from the previous
weekend close of 1,543.10 to close the week at 1,504.38, recording
a loss of 38.72 points.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A bank sponsor system in east
China's Shandong Province has helped improve efficiency at 120
industrial enterprises that have signed bank-enterprise relation
agreements since August of last year.
</P>
<P>
The 120 enterprises accounted for 31 percent of total sales of
all industrial enterprises in Shandong last year, and their
profits accounted for more than 40 percent of the province's total.

Under the terms of the system, banks provide enterprises with
funds and other services on a relatively fixed basis, which the
enterprises use to overcome financial difficulties and improve
economic performance.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the state-owned commercial banks had
provided the 120 enterprises with 11.7 billion yuan in funds. In
September this year, another 15 enterprises were added to the
system.
</P>

The sponsoring banks say that they will increase supervision of
the enterprises to ensure their healthy development and to reduce
financial risks for the banks.

<HEADLINE> China to Burn 1.48 Billion Tons of Coal by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to burn a
total of 1.48 billion tons of coal by the year of 2000 to fuel its
express economic growth, an official source said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic consumers will use 1.43 billion tons of coal, with the
remaining 50 million tons exported, today's China Daily reported,
quoting Li Hongxun, deputy director of the Transportation and
Energy Department of the State Planning Commission, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The largest coal-consuming industries include the power
generating and heat-supplying industries, 600 million tons; the
light industry, 135 million tons; and the metallurgical industry,
125 million tons.
</P>
<P>
China's coal resources are mainly located in the northwestern
and Southwestern areas, where the economies are not as developed
as those in the coastal regions, so coal has to be transported
from the west to east.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, 382 million tons of coal in Shanxi,
Shaanxi and western Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region will be
transported to cities in East and Northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Li said that construction of new coal mines will concentrate on
eastern and central China to provide sufficient fuel for the
development of the local economies.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 and 1997, the central government put a total of 37
billion yuan (about 4.45 billion US dollars) into construction for
the coal industries, increasing its production capacity by 63
million tons.
</P>
<P>
"In 1998, coal supplying conditions will be good and coal
production and transportation will meet the requirements of
national economic development," Li said.
</P>
<P>
China's coal reserves are estimated at more than 1,000 billion
tons. This year China is expected to produce 1.42 billion tons of
coal. Coal accounts for 75 percent of China's energy needs.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Currency Stability Promised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese yuan will remain
stable despite pressure on the country's exports arising from the
recent devaluation of several Southeast Asian currencies, today's
China Daily has reported.
</P>
<P>
The Renminbi would suffer neigher sharp devaluation nor strong
appreciation at least in the first two quarters of next year said
Tao Liming, director of the Institute of International Finance of
the Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the upheaval that hit the Southeast Asian
countries will not result in any direct impact on the Chinese yuan
as China has not released its foreign exchange controls over
capital accounts.
</P>
<P>
He said enterprises producing textiles, shoes, household
electric appliances and garments will face tougher challenges as
these products are the main export products of the Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Other Chinese export products including machinery, ships,
automobiles and crude oil will not be influenced as Southeast
Asian countries seldom export these kinds of goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese currency, would be buoyed by other macroeconomic
factors including higher State foreign exchange reserves and
continuous inflows of overseas capital, Tao said.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors and domestic individuals have become more
sensitive to the fluctuations of the Renminbi in the wake of the
Southeast Asian financial crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Renminbi stability will enhance the confidence of overseas
investors and traders while providing support for the stability of
the Hong Kong dollar.

<HEADLINE> Government Should Bow to Market in Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- While mergers and acquisitions
are all the rage in China, government must bow to the dictates of
the market in order to ward off "unhappy and senseless marriages,"
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a string of government-led mergers aimed at creating
corporate giants to do battle with mounting foreign competition
have begun to break the shackles of the vested interests of
various ministries, regions and other enterprise-owners in China.
</P>
<P>
The government administrations had to loosen their grip on the
management and operation of State enterprises, said Jiang Hong, a
researcher with the National Administrative Bureau of State-owned
Property.
</P>
<P>
"The government is not supposed to be in a position to directly
handle their business activities because its limited access to
ever-changing information about technology and markets affects its
decision-making capability," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He blamed some local governments for interfering with the
process of mergers that transcend the restrictive limits of
regions and ownerships.
</P>
<P>
"Pursuit of profits and market share expansion should become
mergers," Jiang said, noting that administrative interference
might cause distortion of the economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Besides the prevention of unnecessary government-organized
mergers and acquisitions, Li Baomin, deputy director of the
Department of the Production System under the State Commission for
Restructuring Economic Systems, underscored the evaluation and
management of State-owned assets in the process of asset shake-up.
</P>
<P>
A lack of concrete measures has constituted a barrier to the
ongoing reform of State-owned enterprises, although a set of laws
and regulations are being drawn up, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
Executive managerial personnel should be selected according to
their performance, and based on the market principle of "survival
of the fittest", Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Direct Election of County People's Congress in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- As a scrutineer announced the
result of ballot counting, the 30-year-old farmer Lu Qinghua was
very excited when he got to know that he had been elected a local
deputy to his County People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The election took place on November 20 in Langxi County of east
China's Anhui Province. There are 2,370 voters in the electoral
district where Lu Qinghua lives, and 2,291 valid ballots were
recovered.
</P>
<P>
Winning 1,341 votes which exceeded half of the number of ballots
by voters participating in the election, Lu Qinghua was elected as
a local deputy.
</P>
<P>
"Thank the folks for their trust in me, and I'll live
up to their expectations," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I'll take the views and suggestions of my fellow farmers
to the County People's Congress and do practical things for them,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese laws, local people's congresses are power
organs which take charge of examining, approving and supervising
the execution of the plans concerning local economic and social
development and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
The local congresses also elect the leading officials at the
relevant corresponding levels.
</P>
<P>
The deputies to county-level people's congress have a term
of five years. Across the country, new deputies will be
elected between the latter half of the year and the former half of
following year.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Zaisen, now vice-chairman of the standing
committee of Langxi County People's Congress, a major feature of
the election this time was to further improve the mechanism that
more than ten voters may recommend candidates.
</P>
<P>
"Such a recommendation method is a crucial breakthrough in the
election system, for it is related to whether the deputies and
officials can really run public affairs well on behalf of the
people," Yang Zaisen said.

Lu Qinghua was the right candidate recommended by voters. After
graduating from middle school, he went in for house maintenance in
Wuxi City of Jiangsu Province, and returned to his hometown in
April last year to work as an accountant at his village.
</P>
<P>
Lu was not a Communist Party member, but he was able to make
clear and open accounting, winning the trust and respect from the
villagers.
</P>
<P>
In Lu's electoral district, two county-level deputies should be
elected. At the beginning, a total of ten preliminary candidates
had been recommended by voters, five of whom were recommended by
ordinary voters.
</P>
<P>
Among the three final candidates, two persons were recommended
by the joint recommendation group composed of over ten voters.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zaisen said that the standing committee of the Langxi
County People's Congress had been taking the election as an
important matter in its agenda.
</P>
<P>
After mid-September, the committee had called several meetings
to make careful preparations, working out an election schedule,
dividing electoral districts, and establishing election teams in
charge of election-related matters.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with relevant laws and regulations, Langxi County
with nearly 330,000 people were divided into 107 electoral
districts, each consisted of several voter groups with
voter-chosen heads and deputy heads.
</P>
<P>
Except those who are mentally ill or have been deprived of
political rights, all people 18 years of age up to the election
day, may be registered as voters. The roster of voters would be
put up on the wall 20 days ahead of the election.

<P>
The preliminary candidates, which have been recommended by
voters, political parties and organizations, would become formal
and final candidates through consultations.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zaisen explained that the consultation process is highly
open. Election teams would print and distribute the entire
name list of preliminary candidates to voter groups which hold
meetings to decide the final candidate in the electoral district.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the voter groups have heated consultations if the
candidates are rather competitive with each other, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
At last, there were 295 final candidate in the county, 1.6
times that of the county's quota of deputies. In this sense,
multi-candidate elections are held according to the law.
</P>
<P>
The names of final candidates were make public five days before
the election.
</P>
<P>
On the election day, scrutineers and ballot counters
recommended by voters organized the election. The ballots were
counted in public the same day, and election result was announced
on the spot right after the election.
</P>
<P>
That day, 185 county-level people's congress deputies were
elected as scheduled, and the participation rate of voters was as
high as 97.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new deputies will hold their first session around
late December and early January next year.
</P>
<P>
The election in Langxi is only an epitome of the overall
situation of the country, and elections are being held in good
order in other places, said Liu Zhi, an official with the
country's National People's Congress in Beijing, who had been
inspecting the election in Langxi County.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in China Expected to Grow in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials and
researchers agree that more foreign capital will flow into China
in the coming year, though potential investors have been waiting
to see whether China would be another domino to fall in the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Next year will witness more foreign capital inflow," today's
China's Daily quoted Zhang Shangtang, vice-chairman of the
China Assn of Enterprises With Foreign Investment, as saying.
</P>
<P>
China expects to be the world's second largest recipient of
foreign investment for the fifth consecutive year in 1997,
according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that actual foreign investment in
China during the first ten months of this year reached 41.93
billion US dollars, a surge of 26.86 percent year-on-year, though
contractual investment dropped 28.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Buy-outs, mergers, acquisitions, and auctions of shares of State
firms, which were officially endorseed by the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China in September, will offer
unprecedented opportunities to foreign investors, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Min, chairman of the Beijing-based Sinotrust, a major risk
management company, said that China still has a lower credit risk
rating than some Southeast Asian countries and till now most
foreign investors are satisfied with China's business credit.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhao said that China should have a more transparent
information system to help foreign investors analyze credit risks,
as risk analyses are becoming increasingly popular as China opens
its markets.
