<HEADLINE> S. Africa Cannot Adopt Another Country's Constitution: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- There is no way South
Africa could adopt another country's constitution model "just
like that," Minister of Provincial Affairs and Constitutional
Development Roelf Meyer said today.
</P>
<P>
Meyer made the remarks at a press conference at Johannesburg
international airport shortly after his return from a week-long
fact-finding mission to Germany.
</P>
<P>
He was accompanied by a multi-party delegation during his tour
of the Federal Republic of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Meyer said the delegation focused on three areas: the
functioning of the constitutional court, how the German federal
system operated, and the division of power between the central
and state governments.
</P>
<P>
Although the delegation had not reached any conclusions, it
had gained insight into the working of a constitutional model
similar to one which met South Africa's needs, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Baleka Kgotsitsile, who spoke on behalf of the African
National Congress in the absence of Meyer's deputy, Vali Moosa,
expressed the need for the constitution to spell out local
government's powers.
</P>
<P>
Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen said he had accompanied
the delegation to investigate devolution of power and
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Viljoen said he had observed power in Germany devolved to the
lowest levels, but stressed the level of co-ordination required
was considerable and expensive.
</P>
<P>
While Germany was far more homogeneous than South Africa,
there were a few minority groups whose rights were
constitutionalised, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German ambassador Dr. Uwe Kaestner said his
government would continue to help South Africa if requested.
</P>
<P>
The visit of South African multi-party delegation to Germany
followed an offer made by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl during a
state visit to South Africa last year.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR to Stop Funding Vietnamese Boat People Camps in  Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. High Commissioner of
Refugees (UNHCR) said today that it would stop financing
Vietnamese migrants' camps in Southeast Asia, excluding Hong Kong,
on July 1.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokeswoman Ruth Marshall told a news conference in
Geneva that UNHCR has determined that the 38,800 Vietnamese
migrants in camps around the region are not entitled to refugee
status and do not need international protection.
</P>
<P>
"These people aren't fleeing persecution, and could have a
decent life in their own country of origin," Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
However, UNHCR would still continue some support to those in
Hong Kong, where more than 20,000 of the 38,800 live. Marshall
said the UNHCR will discuss the issue with the local authorities
in the next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day conference which ended in Bangkok on Monday,
Vietnam assured its Southeast Asian partners that it would speed
up procedures for processing Vietnamese migrants in their
countries and all should be repatriated within six months.
</P>
<P>
The International Conference on Indo-Chinese Refugees were
attended by representatives from 32 countries and officials from
the UNHCR. It will be followed by a formal session in Geneva on
March 6-7 which will formally endorse the conclusions reached in
Bangkok, Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there is any guarantee that the Vietnamese migrants
would not be mistreated during the repatriation process, Marshall
said the UNHCR had reached agreements over the past few years
providing for non-voluntary return, or deportation, of these
people on the condition that no use of force occurs in the
process.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokeswoman, Vietnam also told the Bangkok
meeting that returnees could, as before, apply for a visa under
the normal immigration program and could leave Vietnam to whatever
country which would accept them.
</P>
<P>
Marshall also said the UNHCR would continue its program of
monitoring the situation of all returnees in Vietnam in the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR officials have already conducted individual discussions
with one-quarter of the 73,000 returnees about their situation.
The conclusion is that no harrassment or persecution has occurred,
she added.

<HEADLINE> Political Parties Meet to Polish Policies before Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's main
political parties will meet this week to fine-tune their policies
in order to meet the May 9 deadline that the constitutional
assembly has to adopt the final constitution.
</P>
<P>
The South African Press Association said in a report in Cape
Town today that the constitutional assembly's management
committee, chaired by African National Congress (anc) General
Secretary Cyril Ramaphosa, would meet at parliament tomorrow to
finalise the work program for the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
The main political parties, excluding the Inkatha Freedom
Party (ifp), were set to begin negotiations on crucial
outstanding matters.
</P>
<P>
About 150 National Party members involved in the
constitution-writing process, including party leader deputy
president F. W. De Klerk, were to meet at the World Trade Centre
in Johannesburg on Saturday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Democratic Party was also planning to hold its
conference in Cape Town on Thursday and Friday, while the Freedom
Front was holding a summit in Cape Town at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The ifp withdrew from the constitutional assembly early last
year complaining that its constitutional demands were not met. It
accused the anc-led government of failing to honor the agreement
reached before the 1994 general election on the international
mediation on Zulu's autonomy in Kwazulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
On top of the list of issues on which agreement still has to
be reached on the constitution is the extent of provincial
powers, with a battle expected between the protagonists of a
greater degree of centralism and those wanting the highest
measure of federalism.
</P>
<P>
Other major outstanding issues includes: the structure and
role of a second house of parliament (currently the senate), the
continuation of power-sharing vis a vis a simple majority in
the executive arm of government, national anthems and seat of
government, language policy, the death penalty, a white homeland
called Afrikaner Volkstaat and other aspects of the bill of
rights.
</P>
<P>
Constitutional assembly spokeswoman Katharine Mckenzie said
this week almost 1,000 submissions had been received from the
public in response to the publication on November 22 last year of
the first working draft of the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
All these submissions would be considered by the
constitutional assembly in the coming weeks, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Mckenzie also stressed that the constitutional assembly's
community liaison program had embarked on an intensive series of
educational workshops aimed at explaining the working draft and
the central debates taking place in the constitution-making
process.

<HEADLINE> French FM Hopes for Early Resumption of Lebanese- Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Foreign Minister
Herve De Charette expressed hope here today that the peace
negotiations between Lebanon and Israel will resume soon.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after meeting with his Lebanese
counterpart Farez Boueiz, the De Charette said he and Boueiz
discussed issues of common interests, especially the peace process
in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
De Charette underlined his country's commitment to Lebanon's
sovereignty and independence, and its readiness to contribute to
Lebanon's reconstruction process and to develop the cultural
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The French official said he briefed the Lebanese foreign
minister on the results of his tour in the Middle East region,
which took him to Amman, Tel Aviv and the Palestinian self-rule
area of the Gaza Strip, noting that it is possible to enter the
details on a French contribution to the process of establishing
peace "in accordance with a request of our friends."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether france welcomes the idea of hosting the
next round of the Lebanese-Israeli peace talks, De Charette said
that his country is a "hospitable" state.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz, on his part, said he and his guest discussed the Middle
East peace process, adding that De Charette expressed a readiness
of his country for a contribution, if it is asked, to the process
of enhancing the security, stability and peace in accordance with
requests of all the friends in the region.
</P>
<P>

support for Lebanon's efforts to regain completely its sovereignty
over a southern border enclave Israel occupied since 1985, and its
support for Lebanon in a number of issues related to peace,
stability, sovereignty and independence.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz emphasized that the resumption of the Lebanese-Israeli
talks is decided by two elements, the first is a breakthrough on
the Syrian track, and the second is an invitation by the
co-sponsors of the peace process, namely the United States and
Russia, to Lebanon to resume the peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his 24-hour stay in Beirut, DE Charette, who arrived
here earlier today, is scheduled to hold meetings with Prime
Minister Rafik Al Hariri, House Speaker Nabih Berri, President
Elias Hrawi and Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir,
spiritual leader of Lebanon's Maronite Catholic community, and
other Christian and Moslem leaders.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Calls for Massive Turnout in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ali
Khamenei today called on the nation to make a massive turnout
during parliamentary elections slated for March 8 this year.
</P>
<P>
Concerning over low turnout in the polls, Ali Khamenei made his
first statement on the parliamentary elections in his speech to a
meeting of the high-ranking officials of the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The registration of candidates would take place between January
30 and February 5, and the election campaign would be held from
February 29 to March 6.
</P>
<P>
Calling the vote by the people a "rational and religious duty"
of all individuals, Khamenei lambasted those "who are, directly or
indirectly, doing things that will lead to the apathy of people
regarding the elections."
</P>
<P>
The official obsession with low election turnout is caused by
the economic depression people are suffering and by the boycott of
elections declared by such opposition groups as Iran's Freedom
Movement.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Interior Ministry is responsible for holding the
elections. Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati who was
present at the meeting today, was quoted by Tehran Radio as saying
that "enemies of the system have invested heavily for weakening
the elections."
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, Iranian leaders have encouraged the
people to turn out at the elections. Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq Nouri told a group of clergies here recently that they
should "rouse the people's interest in the elections."
</P>
<P>
In his address to the officials of the Interior Ministry,
Khamenei urged the leaders of political factions, the clergies
and intellectuals to use all their efforts to ensure people's
presence in the elections.
</P>
<P>
"People must feel that there is no interference in the
elections and no one is allowed to abuse his rights," Khamenei
said.
</P>
<P>
Besharati assured Khamenei that elections would be held with
"complete neutrality" on the part of his Interior Ministry
officials.
</P>
<P>
Besharati came under harsh criticism by President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani after he appointed new Interior Ministry officials in
last October.
</P>
<P>
The new appointees were said to be members of the influential
right wing faction, the Society of the Combatant Clergy (SCC),
which holds the majority of seats in the parliament now.

<HEADLINE> Spate Of Riots Feared In Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Human Rights
Organization said today that it worried about the increasing rate
of riots in Harare, the Zimbabwean national news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Responding to weekend riots in Harare's Mbare high density
Suburb sparked by the fatal shooting of a teenage boy by a police
officer, the Organization said it is now clear that there is more
to the current wave of violence between police and youths.
</P>
<P>
"While the police, with the support of parliament, are now
resorting to increased use of firearms to curb the criminal
activities, the general public seem to respond by open
confrontation, leading to lawlessness," said a statement issued
by the organisations's new Executive Director Dovid Chimhini.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe needs to go about their life in peace and needs not
fear to be victims of gunfire when police have to use firearms to
apprehend suspects, the organization said.
</P>
<P>
Police on Monday defended the shooting of a 19-year-old boy
identified as Peter Maratu, saying the police officer involved
had fired warning shots to disperse a crowd trying to stop him
from arresting the boy for an alleged assault offence.
</P>

LUSAKA, January 16 (Xinhua)-- A Zambian minister said today
the majority of the Zambian people have no access to clean water

decline in public health.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Local Government and Housing Ben Mwiinga made the

supply project in Lusaka. The project will cost 46.6 million
U.S.Dollars provided by Nordic countries and the World Bank.

increases, diseases associated with inadequate water supply,and
poor sanitation and hygiene practices have increased.
</P>
<P>
"Notably the recent high cases of diarrhoea and cholera are
still fresh in our minds," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government policy in the water and sanitation sector has
been aimed at improving the quality of life and productivity of
all people, ensuring an equitable provision of an adequate
quantity of water and sanitation services to all people at
acceptable cost, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"My ministry is coordinating our efforts with the Ministry of
Energy and Water Development on the water supply system to
achieve this goal," he added.

At present, only 40 percent of Zambians have access to clean
water supply.

<HEADLINE> New York City Seeks More Rent from Port Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The New York City and the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey are seeking legal process in
a rent dispute in which the city claims for 400 million dollars in
back rent for its two major airports.
</P>
<P>
The city administration is complaining that the Port Authority
has cut the portion of the revenue it should pay to the city and
not invested enough in projects to improve the city's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Port Authority, which also runs Newark International
Airport in New Jersey, has operated the Kennedy and La Guardia
airports under a series of leases dating to 1947.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, the annual rent payments
hovered around 80 million dollars in the late 1980's, but dropped
to 3 million dollars in 1993. Although it increased to 6.2 million
dollars in 1994, the city ordered a review of the lease payments
earlier last year after which the city claimed that the Port
Authority paid 400 million dollars less between 1991 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
On December 14, the city served the Port Authority with a
demand for arbitration and asked the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants to arbitrate the rent dispute.
</P>
<P>
But the Port Authority has asked a judge in State Supreme Court
in Manhattan to stop the arbitration. It said that the rent
decrease was due to the capital improvements to the two airports
including roadway work, terminal improvement and aviation control
and guidance equipment.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Kuchma Agree to Set up Joint Commission </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOSCOW, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and his Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kuchma today agreed to set up
a joint commission for cooperation and to settle their dispute
over the Black Sea Fleet as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents discussed a range of bilateral issues during
their one-to-one meeting in the Kremlin, Yeltsin's press office
said.
</P>
<P>
Both recognised the need to improve economic cooperation, signing
an agreement on the formation of the joint commission to be headed
by the prime ministers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Kuchma also expressed their readiness to settle the
Black Sea Fleet dispute based on the principles set out last June
during their summit in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Ukraine signed their first agreement on the division
of the fleet in January 1992. Under an agreement signed in June
1993, the Black Sea Fleet is supposed to be split in half.
</P>
<P>
In April 1994, the two sides signed another agreement on a
step-by-step settlement of the fleet dispute. This agreement
stipulated that the bases of the Ukrainian Navy and the Black Sea
Fleet should be separated with 15 to 20 percent of the 833-ship
fleet remaining in Ukraine's ownership.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Kuchma also agreed to fix a date for the Russian
president to visit Ukraine to sign the friendship and cooperation
treaty.

<HEADLINE> Monetary Policy Remains Tight In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
(RBZ) today warned monetary policy will remain tight unless
inflation, which soared to 26 percent at the end of 1995, falls
to sustainable levels.
</P>
<P>
In its latest quarterly economic and statistical review, the
RBZ stressed the need for the government to contain recurrent
expenditure and domestic borrowing, which have been blamed for
fuelling money supply growth and inflation.
</P>
<P>
During the fiscal year ending June 1996, the government will
borrow about 4 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (444 million U.S.
Dollars) to finance the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
''Failure to restrain budgetary expenditures and contain the
deficit at sustainable levels will imply a perpetuation of the
tight monetary conditions which will undermine investment as
nominal interest rates remain high, thereby continuing to crowd
out the productive sector,'' the RBZ said.
</P>
<P>
The bank has been pursuing a restrictive monetary policy to
reduce money supply growthlargely blamed on heavy government
borrowing, necessitating a rise in nominal interest rates, which
once peaked at over 40 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The RBZ said that there was till pressure on inflation due to
fiscal imbalances, drought-induced supply shortages and a rash of
price and sales tax increases announced recently.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the expected fall in inflation to around 18
percent in the first half of this year would pave the way for a
softening of the monetary policy and a reduction in nominal
interest rates.

A dusk to dawn curfew was declared and all ministered were

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Warns Against Neo-Nazis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- In the first speech by a foreign
head of state to the German parliament since re-unification,
Israel's president, Ezer Weizman, said he could not forgive the
crimes of Hitler's Third Reich against the Jews.
</P>
<P>
The 71-year-old president said he could "mourn for" the six
million Jews killed in the Holocaust in World War II, but could
not "forgive in their name".
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Hebrew, Weizman warned Germans to guard against the
reemergence of neo-Nazism.
</P>
<P>
"I can only urge you, ladies and gentlemen deputies of the
German parliament, that you look to the future with a knowledge of
the past. That you recognize every stirring of racism and smash
every stirring of neo-Nazism," Weizman told a special joint
session of parliament attended by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
President Roman Herzog.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli president said it is not easy to be in Germany, "to
listen to the memories and the voices screaming to me from the
earth."
</P>
<P>
While stressing the vital need to eliminate racism at its
roots, Weizman also thanked Germany for its efforts to help Israel
in trade, scientific research and security and to foster the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Recalling German presidents' visits to Israel, he said Israelis
remembered "their stand toward a hopeful future."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the new understanding between Israel and its Arab
neighbors, Weizman said Israel is now "at the high point of an
encouraging and moving development, that is also worrying and
frightening."
</P>
<P>
"We uphold the fragile and delicate peace, because we are full
of hope," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a welcoming speech, the president of the Federal Assembly,
Germany's lower house, Rita Suessmuth, said Germany "has learned
its lesson from hate and genocide, war and expulsion and is aware
of its responsibility."
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Germany will try its best to support the Middle
East peace process, she said the European Union also should share
its responsibility in promoting peace in the region, as Israel is
"a natural partner of the EU."

Service, and army officers met to finalize plans for securing the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The police and Postal Authority have already contracted a
security company that employs Israeli Arab guards to help with
crowd control and other safety matters at the post offices.
</P>
<P>
The major concern is for unrest provoked by Jewish extremists,
according to police sources. Police will likely not allow
protesters to get near the post offices to be used for the
elections, even though the offices are officially open to the
general public.
</P>
<P>
"The roads around the post offices will be closed to traffic,
and large police contingents stationed to keep protesters far
away," said the sources.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Astronauts Retrieve U.S. Research Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Koichi Wakata, the Japanese
member of space shuttle Endeavour's six-man crew, hauled a
satellite aboard this morning, the second he did it in three days.
</P>
<P>
The first satellite retrieved was launched in March 1994 from
Japan and the second was released overboard two days ago, or three
days after Endeavour lift off into orbit.
</P>
<P>
The retrieval of the Japanese satellite was considered the
primary task of the year's first shuttle flight planned by the
U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
</P>
<P>
Wakata, who has received training in the United States since
1992, used Endeavour's 15-meter robot arm to capture the
10-million-dollar American satellite this morning.
</P>
<P>
The gleaming boxy probe, which contains four experiments,
including one on spacecraft contamination, had been flying some
305 kilometers above ground for about 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Science data gathered by the free-flying reusable platform will
be analyzed after Endeavour and its crew returns to Kennedy Space
Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on January 20.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, besides satellite release and retrieval,
two Endeavour astronauts have performed more than six hours of
spacewalk to test new tools and modified spacesuits.
</P>
<P>
Leroy Chiao, one of the two spacewalkers, will be joined by
another partner Wednesday to further the tests designed to prepare
for the assembly of an international space station.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Describes Papandreou's Decision to Resign a "Brave Act" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government today
described Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's decision to
resign a "courageous act on an equal par with his history".
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Papandreou's decision, announced Monday evening,
government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said at his daily
press briefing that the Cyprus government "is in agony over the
developments in Greece".
</P>
<P>
He added "we wish the parliamentary group of the Pasok Party
(ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement founded by Papandreou in
1974) elect the best as the new prime minister of Greece."
</P>
<P>
Referring to what extent Papandreou's resignation would affect
the Cyprus problem, Cassoulides said Papandreou's experience was
particular useful and wished him speedy recovery so that he would
able to offer his advice from another post.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the spokesman continued, having a new Greek
prime minister will be helpful during the deliberations and the
efforts that will be made for a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
Greece, together with Turkey and Britain, were guarantors of
Cyprus' independence under the 1960 Treaty of establishment of
the Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece signed a joint defense pact in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old Greek prime minister announced his resignation
after nearly two months of illness.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, whose father George was also prime minister in the
1960s, headed the Greek government from 1981 to 1989 and again
from 1993 until his resignation.

<HEADLINE> US Housing Starts Up 5.7% in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. housing starts rose 5.7
percent in November after falling 4.6 percent in October, the
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that housing starts totaled 1.42 million units
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in November, up from 1.34
million units in October.
</P>
<P>
For the first 11 months of 1995, housing starts were 7.4
percent below the same period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Housing activity had plummeted earlier in 1995 when 30-year
mortgage rates jumped above 9 percent, with starts falling to a
1.24 million rate last March. But as rates fell, making housing
more affordable, activity picked up.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.35 percent in
November, down from 9.15 percent in last January.
</P>
<P>
The 5.7 percent gain was the largest increase since a 5.9
percent advance in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
Still, many analysts expect housing activity to level off
because of a slowing economy and growing debt burdens.
</P>
<P>
Originally scheduled for release on December 19, the housing
starts report was postponed until today by the federal government
shutdown.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Reclassified as "More Advanced Developing  Country" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) has reclassified Singapore as a
"more advanced developing country", instead of a "developed
nation" as earlier announced, local television said today.
</P>
<P>
It said that Singapore Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow
Tong had commented that the new definition was a "more accurate
description" and it came after a clarification sought by Singapore
from the OECD.
</P>
<P>
Yeo said that Singapore would need another five to ten years to
achieve an overall structure that was more in line with that of a
developed country.
</P>
<P>
The country still lacked the depth and breadth of a developed
economy although it had a fairly high per capita gross domestic
product, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore still had very little home-grown technology, he said.
 In order to boost development in this area, Yeo said that the
government was now formulating the Second National Technology Plan
to take Singapore into the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Another area that needed more emphasis and upgrading was human
resource development, he said, adding that more investment was
also needed to upgrade Singapore's business infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> One Million Women to Be Lifted From Poverty by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China's largest women's
organization plans to help one million women shake off poverty by
the year 2000 through teaching them practical production skills.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) will continue to
conduct a national campaign to encourage women in rural areas to
make contributions to local economic development by learning
production skills and becoming better off.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, led by the ACWF's branches across the country,
has trained about 96 million rural women to master useful farming
techniques in the past seven years. Meanwhile three million female
illiterates learn to read and write each year.
</P>
<P>
Rural women's enthusiasm for acquiring knowledge and learning
production skills should be further enhanced, Chen Muhua,
chairwoman of the ACWF, told a national conference on the campaign
today.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will not only eliminate illiteracy among rural
women, but also teach them more scientific methods to do farm work
and develop sideline sectors, so as to shake off poverty.
</P>
<P>
The ACWF's plan is supported by the State Council, China's
highest governing body.
</P>
<P>
A leading group for developing the economy in poverty-stricken
areas under the State Council has promised that women in poor
areas will enjoy priority in obtaining support from the government
for developing the local economy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has announced in its 1995-2000
Development Program for Chinese Women that about 800,000 job
opportunities will be provided for poor women in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
Ten million women in poor areas will be trained to obtain at
least one kind of production skill in the same period.
</P>
<P>
In China about one in every three women, mostly in rural areas,
is illiterate at present, which is thought to be one of major
obstacles in their way to a better life.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today met visiting Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma to discuss a
range of issues, including the Black Sea Fleet which has been
hindering the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Present at the "one-on-one meeting" were their respective
international affairs advisers, according to a Kremlin source.
</P>
<P>
Russian presidential spokesman Sergei Medvedev said that
Yeltsin and Kuchma are expected to discuss a treaty on friendship,
cooperation and partnership between their two countries. The
treaty is expected to become the main political document laying
down a legal basis for bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet, a hangover from the disintegration of the
former Soviet Union, has been a thorn in the relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Kuchma met last June in the Black Sea resort of
Sochi but failed to reach a comprehensive agreement on the issue.
Heart trouble prevented Yeltsin from a scheduled visit to Ukraine,
during which he was expected to sign an agreement for a 50-50
split of the fleet between Russia and Ukraine. The Russian navy is
also ready to buy 32 percent of the Ukrainian share of the fleet.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China's packaging industry
reported 114 billion yuan-worth of output value last year, an
increase of 152.2 percent over 1990.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years the sector has registered some 40
billion yuan-worth of fixed assets investment, about nine billion
yuan of which was spent on infrastructure construction and 31
billion yuan on technical renovation.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the improvement of the quality of packaging
materials, losses caused by poor packaging dropped from one
percent of the gross domestic product during the 1986-1990 period
to 0.47 percent during the past five years, according to the China
National Packaging Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Also during the past five years, eight packaging material
trading markets have been built across the country in Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Jinan, Chongqing, Hangzhou and
Chengde, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The sector has also utilized over one billion US dollars in
foreign investment in the period.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a number of enterprises have started to edge
into the international market.
</P>
<P>
China's packaging industry, which took off in the late 1970s,
supplies packaging materials for over 3,000 billion yuan-worth of
domestic commodities and huge amounts of export commodities, and
is basically capable of meeting the demands of national economic
development.

LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- British doctors are calling for
a crackdown on illegal cigarette sales to children under 16 and an
advertising ban in a bid to reduce the number of girls who start
smoking in their early teens.
</P>
<P>
The British Medical Association (BMA) reported that far more
girls than boys take to smoking at 13 or 14 and warns that the
incidence of lung cancer among women will overtake men if the
trend continues.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Vivienne Nathanson, head of the BMA health policy
department, proposed banning smoking in public places, regularly
increasing taxation to keep the price of cigarettes high and
renewing health education campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Anne Charlton, of the Child Studies Research Group at
Manchester University, said that health educators should warn
girls of the dangers of smoking in pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
The doctors, speaking at a BMA meeting, said smoking has
become a major public health epidemic, claiming more than 100,000
lives a year in Britain alone.
</P>
<P>
A bill to outlaw tobacco advertising is scheduled to be
discussed in the Commons today but the bill, sponsored by Liberal
Democrat MP Simon Hughes, stands little chance of progress as most
ministers are opposed to a ban.

</P>
<P>
Some 40 governments and 20 agencies were invited to a one-day
meeting of the humanitarian issues working group of the
International Conference on Former Yugoslavia to hear the
Commissioner unveil the plan.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR plans a phased and orderly voluntary return program
which will focus on three categories of returnees: some one
million internally-displaced people inside Bosnia; more than half
a million Bosnian refugees currently living in Croatia, the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Slovenia and Macedonia; some of an
estimated 700,000 refugees from former Yugoslavia currently under
temporary protection in other countries.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR officials said earlier that the repatriation work may
take two years and they do not expect any large, organized returns
before the coming spring.
</P>
<P>
Some 870,000 people may need help in returning to or relocating
within Bosnia during the year, according to a UNHCR estimate --
500,000 internally-displaced people, 170,000 from other republics
of former Yugoslavia and 200,000 from other European countries.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR is asking asylum-offering countries to be patient and
maintain temporary protection for the people from former
Yugoslavia until the military provisions of the Dayton peace
accord which ended the four-year war are met, an amnesty is
proclaimed for crimes other than serious violations of the
international humanitarian law and when human rights establishment
is fully operational in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Twins Set Guinness Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Three-year-old Chinese twins have
been recorded in the Guiness Book of World Records as the world's
youngest readers, as well as the youngest Guiness record makers.
</P>
<P>
The twins, one boy and one girl of a family in this capital
city of east China's Shandong Province, can read, pronounce and
understand about 2,400 Chinese characters and nearly 1,000 English
words, according to sources from the Shanghai office of the
Guiness book.
</P>
<P>
"Zhuang Zezheng and Zhuang Zefang can clearly, correctly and
fluently read more than 80 books for preschool children," two
preschool education experts confirmed after they conducted an
overall test of the twins.
</P>
<P>
"They are in good health, cheerful, rich in imagination and
intelligent," said Zhao Jianhua, a professor of preschool
education at the Shandong Normal University, and Zheng Tongjin, a
children's literature critic.
</P>
<P>
The experts consider that the twins' outstanding abilities were
fostered by their parents' proper teaching methods, which are of
value for research into preschool education.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is to develop their interest in
reading," said Zhuang Shikui, father of the two "shentong", or
child prodigies.
</P>
<P>
When the twins were about one year old, Zhuang, a school
teacher, and his wife read stories to them and taught them a few
Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
But one day Zhuang was stunned at hearing the daughter reading
a newspaper. Then he found that the twins could also read books
for preschool children.

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns Against Drug-Resistant Bacteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) has warned that antibiotic-resistant bacteria is now one of
the world's most serious medical problems.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is rapidly getting out of hand and the
implications are devastating," said a WHO spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"It is costing billions each year to keep drug-resistant
strains under control and one is seeing resistance in all manner
of diseases. For some there is no effective treatment," he added.
</P>
<P>
In May, the WHO will report on how many bacteria have fought
back to become one of the biggest health problems of the decade.
</P>
<P>
To combat drug-resistant bacteria, the WHO has set up a rapid
response unit to control and prevent the growing incidence of
epidemics caused by reemerging diseases.
</P>
<P>
The unit will expand WHO's network to detect and monitor
antibiotic resistance on a worldwide basis.
</P>
<P>
Though it was believed 30 years ago that bacteria-related
diseases were under control, bacteria has been fighting back by
resisting antibiotics used to treat infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
Diseases such as tuberculosis and gonorrhea have already become
resistant to first and second-line drugs and the development of
new antibiotics to replace them is lagging far behind.
</P>
<P>
One strain of staphylococcus, the most common cause of skin
boils, wound and blood stream infections is renowned for its
ability to build up resistance to drugs.
</P>
<P>
In 1952, almost all strains of staphylococcus could be cured
with penicillin. But now fewer than 10 percent of all cases are
curable. There are strains of staphylococcus which are resistant
to all but one antibiotic -- vancomycin.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts predict that it is only a matter of time before
multiple resistance develops.
</P>
<P>
St. Thomas' Hospital in London found that it is possible to
transfer vancomycin resistance to "super staph", another form of
staphylococcus, which may in turn develop full resistance to
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
"That will have very dire implications," said Professor Bill
Noble of the London University's Institute of Dermatology.

<P>
NEW DELHI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- India will test this month a
longer range version of the surface-to-surface Prithvi missile in
the wake of successful completion of the user trial of the 150 km

has so far been test fired at Chandipur 14 times and has undergone
user trials by the Indian army on June 4 and 6, 1994. It was
first tested on February 22, 1988 from the rocket launching center
at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh (state).
</P>
<P>
With successful completion of the 150 km version, Indian
scientists would now test fire the longer range version of the

Song, also minister in charge of the State Science and
Technology Commission, made the remark recently at a plenary
meeting of the NSF.
</P>
<P>
With economic development taken as the major task, the research
should be aimed at raising productivity, comprehensive national
strength and the people's living standards, and contributing to
solving problems related to population, grain, resources and the
environment, Song said.
</P>
<P>
One should not demand that basic sciences produce returns in a
short period of time, but some breakthroughs in basic research can
promote social, economic and high-tech developments, or help form
new industries.

<HEADLINE> BAA Handles Record Passengers in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's largest airport
operator BAA said Monday a record 91.8 million passengers used
its seven airports last year, up nearly six percent on 1994.
</P>
<P>
The increase was achieved despite the first full year of
competition from the Channel Tunnel linking Britain with Europe
and the impact of mass transport strikes in France, said BAA
(British Airports Authority).
</P>
<P>
The record passenger handling was boosted by a 9.1 percent
increase in flights across the north Atlantic, an 11 percent
rise in other long haul routes, fuller aircraft and sterling's
weakness against other currencies.
</P>
<P>
BAA, which operates Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Glasgow,
Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Southampton airports, said domestic air
traffic grew by 8 percent thanks to the launch of a new low fare
service.
</P>
<P>
Passenger numbers at Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport, rose
by 5.3 percent to 54 million while the number of flights increased
by 2.3 percent to 418,811.
</P>
<P>
BAA is seeking to build a fifth terminal at Heathrow which is
expected to increase annual passenger numbers there to 80 million.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft seat occupancy was also higher than 1994. The
average number of passengers per flight rose 3 percent to 130.
</P>
<P>
BAA research director Stan Maiden attributed the record
passenger number to the weakness of sterling against European
currencies.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Civil Affairs Minister Doje
Cering has urged that more efforts be made to safeguard people's
basic well-being rights and interests, maintain social stability,
and promote cultural progress and social development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national meeting of civil affairs bureau directors
that closed here yesterday, Doje Cering said that before the end
of this century civil affairs departments at all levels must fulfil
six major tasks focusing on the introduction of a social security
system.
</P>
<P>
The tasks include accelerating the reform of the old-age
pension, unemployment and medicare insurance systems,
and instituting a social insurance system, a social relief system,
a social welfare system and a mutual assistance system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, new policies will be formulated to protect the
legitimate rights and interests of women, the handicapped, minors
and senior citizens, Doje Cering said.
</P>
<P>
He asked civil affairs departments to improve community services
to make the life easier for residents, spur the development of
cultural and welfare undertakings, develop democracy in
grassroots units, and encourage a scientific, civilized and sound
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
He said that governments at all levels have scored successes in
social security work in both urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years civil affairs departments have reformed
the relief system in a bid to increase local governments' sense of
responsibility in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary statistics show that in 1995 the central government
earmarked 1.9 billion yuan and local governments 900 million yuan
to aid victims of natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The urban social security system has also improved, Doje Cering
said. For example, Shanghai, the leading manufacturing center in
China, led the country in introducing a new security system in
1993 under which urban residents in financial difficulty receive
assistance from the government to maintain a basic living standard.
</P>
<P>
So far, the new system has been instituted in the major cities
of Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shenyang, Dalian, Guangzhou and Wuhan, Doje
Cering said, adding that another 20 cities plan to introduce the
system soon.
</P>
<P>
Insurance funds for old-age pensions total five billion yuan
in 1,500 counties, he said, adding that old-age insurance
administration departments at all levels have been set up
throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Court Issues Order for Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Appeal Court today
ordered the National Election Commission to stop nominations for
elections of North central and Sabaragamuwa Provinces.
</P>
<P>
The court in its ruling said that elections in the said
provinces could not be held until it takes final decisions on the
two petitions filed by the chief ministers of the provinces.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga early this month
dissolved the two Provincial Councils which were controlled by the
opposition United National Party and called for fresh elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the chief ministers of the two Provincial Councils
filed two petitions to the court, saying the presidential decision
was illegal as they still enjoyed the support of the majority in
the Provincial Councils.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that the government was planning to hold
fresh elections of the opposition controlled Provincial Councils
as a step to prepare for fresh parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Among the nine Provincial Councils in Sri Lanka, five were
controlled by the opposition UNP.

<P>
BUDAPEST, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Hungary soared 28
percent last year, up from 18.8 percent in 1994, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Domestic electricity prices jumped most, up 50 percent on
1994, while the cost of food rose 31 percent, the latest figures
released by the Central Bureau of Statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Durable consumer goods prices jumped a quarter, while service
charges were up 26 percent and clothes 20.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has been a serious problem in Hungary over the past
five years as the government's austerity programs, including
sharp reductions in subsidies on food and housing, were carried
out to solve the country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, inflation reached a high of 35 percent, falling to
just under 19 percent in 1994. The finance ministry has predicted
that inflation will be between 19 to 20 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Devaluation has also contributed to high inflation and
Hungary's National Bank recently announced that it will continue
its devaluation policy to make the country's currency, the forint,
depreciate 1 percent on a monthly basis.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China has signed bilateral
ocean shipping pacts with 46 countries across the world, as an
important part of exchanges and co-operation by its shipping
industry with its overseas counterparts.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Jiansheng, a division chief in charge of
international co-operation in water transportation with the
Ministry of Communications, China signed bilateral pacts with
Chile and Lebanon, and extended or revised its pacts with Germany,
Greece and Argentina last year.
</P>
<P>
He said, "With about 95 percent of China's imports and exports
shipped by sea, China has made great efforts to promote
international co-operation and exchanges in ocean shipping. The
country has signed ocean shipping pacts with most of its major
trading partners."
</P>
<P>
The official said China is to negotiate with some of the
world's leading shipping powers for the signing of more pacts this
year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Ministry of Communications,
China has approved the opening of offices here of nearly 300
overseas shipping companies, the establishment of branch companies
of 13 foreign cargo and passenger transport dealers, and 64
Sino-overseas jointly funded international shipping businesses.
</P>
<P>
Since China opened the field of regular international shipping
services to foreign companies in 1990, nine Sino-overseas joint
companies and 11 foreign ones have been registered here. They
operate 105 regular shipping routes and 1,105 scheduled services
from 29 Chinese ports.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ocean Shipping Giant Keeps Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The China Ocean Shipping
(Group) Company (COSCO), the flag carrier of the country's
commercial fleet, has seen further expansion of its fleet and
other businesses in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
COSCO officials said that at the end of 1995 the group had
nearly 600 vessels of various types, totalling 17 million dwt. It
has transported more than 100 million tons of goods annually in
the past year.
</P>
<P>
With the world's largest bulk carrier fleet and the
fourth-largest container ship fleet, COSCO now serves 1,100 ports
in over 150 countries and regions worldwide.
</P>
<P>
COSCO's major subsidiaries, the China Ocean Shipping Agency
(PENAVIC), China Marine Bunker Supply Company and China Road
Transportation Company (CRTC), all witnessed remarkable business
growth after joining the group in 1993.
</P>
<P>
PENAVIC now holds 70 percent of China's shipping agency market,
after being deprived of its monopoly in 1985. And CRTC is firmly
in the lead in the transportation of super-large cargoes and
containers.
</P>
<P>
COSCO is also among the top 20 Chinese companies in the field
of labor export. Over the last five years it has exported 50,000
person/times ships' crews, computer technicians and crane drivers,
netting 280 million US dollars in income from this.
</P>
<P>
COSCO's overseas business is also growing. The group has set up
103 overseas joint ventures, agencies and representative offices,
employing some 2,500 people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, COSCO has been diversifying its businesses over the
past few years. It is now involved in ship repair, container
manufacture, wharf construction, insurance, tourism, housing
development, hotels and trade -- altogether 21 fields. Revenues
from non-shipping sectors now account for 40 percent of the
group's total sales.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the group issued 160 million US dollars-worth of bonds
in the United States, which is said to be the largest sum of money
ever raised by a Chinese company overseas.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995 the profits of the group rose by 91 percent
compared to the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
Looking to the future, COSCO officials said that the group will
continue to diversify its operations, though ocean shipping will
remain the backbone of its business. As its chairman Chen
Zhongbiao put it: ``Wherever there are cargoes to be shipped,
there you will find COSCO vessels.''

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 16 (Xinhua) - Chechen militants seized 30
hostages in a local district heating station in Grozny, capital of
Chechnya, Russian security services said today.
</P>
<P>
The captives, most of whom were Russians working on night shift
at the plant in a Grozny suburb, were seized early on Tuesday and
driven away by bus to an unknown destination, the Itar-Tass news
agency quoted a Moscow-based spokesman for the FSB Federal
Security Service as saying.
</P>
<P>
An FSB official in Chechnya confirmed the hostage-taking
incident, saying "It is unclear so far who staged the action."
</P>
<P>
Interfax news agency said there had been no news from the
rebels or their captives, but it quoted authorities in Grozny as
saying that they expected the rebels to seek a ransom for the
captives.
</P>
<P>
Russia had already stepped up security in Grozny after a bomb
exploded in the center of the town on Monday, the latest in a
series of explosions in which dozens of people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops captured Grozny from the rebel fighters of
Dzhokhar Dudayev in March, four months after they were sent to
crush the region's independence bid.
</P>
<P>
The new hostage-taking incident took place one day after
Russian troops stormed a village in southern Russia, where about
200 chechen rebels were holding some 100 hostages.
</P>
<P>
The storm operation started at 09:00 Moscow time (06:00 GMT) on
Monday and by Tuesday morning 11 hostages had been released and
some 100 Chechen rebels killed or injured in the village of
Pervomaiskoye in Daghestan bordering Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the other rebels, whose number is estimated at
over 100, continued their resistance in the southern part of the
village. They were still holding dozens of hostages.

BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China's individual income tax
revenue grew by a record 80.8 percent to 13.1 billion yuan last

</P>
<P>
China started to collect individual income tax in 1980. The

<HEADLINE> New Gas Deposit Discovered in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China has discovered an
additional 24 billion cu m of gas in a large field in the
northwest part of the country, which is said to be among the 100
biggest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The gas field, in the middle of a basin spreading into Shaanxi
and Gansu provinces and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, has 230
billion cu m in proven reserves and promises bright prospects for
exploration, geologists said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China made new explorations in the south and north of
the field and made careful analyses of the older wells there. The
field was discovered in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
One success was 100,000 cu m of industrial gas a day from an
older well, the "Shaan-9", which was reactivated.
</P>
<P>
The field plans to transport 500 million cu m of gas a year to
Xi'an and one billion cu m to Beijing through pipelines. Both
pipelines are scheduled to be completed before the end of
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the pipeline to Xi'an, nearly 500 km long, was
kicked off last October. The pipeline to Beijing is expected to be
laid at this year, as its design has been completed.
</P>
<P>
Yulin Prefecture, in the heart of the gas field, has taken
advantage of the abundant gas resources to build a chemical plant
focusing on the development of fertilizer and methyl
alcohol. Construction of another chemical plant, a Sino-Australian
joint venture capable of producing 60,000 tons of synthetic
ammonia annually, is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
With high purity and low content of sulphur, the field's gas is
ideal for making chemical raw materials and fuel.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that further development of the gas field will
have a great impact on China's energy structure and promote the
development of the less-developed northern part of Shaanxi.

<HEADLINE> More-Efficient Agriculture Projects to Enjoy Loan Preference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
(ABC) plans to provide 45 billion yuan in loans to agricultural
and township industry projects which are more efficient and whose
products sell well on the market.
</P>
<P>
The amount is a growth of 14 percent over that of 1995, said
Shi Jiliang, president of the ABC, here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national conference attended by presidents of
provincial and regional branches of the bank nationwide, Shi said
that the ABC will never change its commitment to supporting
agricultural development, although it, together with three other
specialized banks, have been asked by the State Council to turn
themselves into commercial banking institutions in the course of
the nation's building a market economy.
</P>
<P>
To achieve both social and economic efficiency, Shi said, bank
loans will mainly be directed toward a number of high-quality,
high-efficiency agricultural projects whose products are in
greater demand on the domestic or international markets.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that the bank will support larger-scale farming
in order to develop more farm products with local
flavor. Agricultural product processing enterprises, and those
making chemical fertilizer, plastic sheeting and pesticides as
well as supply of agricultural production means will also be given
priority in obtaining bank loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 deposits in the ABC came to 868.79 billion
yuan, a net increase of 34.1 percent. Meanwhile, loans outstanding
amounted to 655.3 billion yuan, up by 18.6 percent. The bank
increased its loans by 41.3 billion yuan for agricultural projects
with good economic efficiency, and major grain and cotton
producing areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the bank made 4.2 billion yuan in profits, the
president said.

<HEADLINE> China's Light Industry Sees Sustained, Stable Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The output value of China's
light industry kept an average annual growth rate of 13 percent
during the 1991-1995 period, hitting about 2.15 trillion yuan last
year, according to Yu Zhen, chairman of the China National Council
of Light Industry, here today.
</P>
<P>
Yu told a national work conference on light industry that the
sector's export value reached 40 billion US dollars last year, at
an average annual increase rate of 20 percent within the period.
</P>
<P>
The product variety of the sector has climbed to 240,000, with
about 10,000 products newly added every year. The pre-tax profits
last year were nearly 40 billion yuan, following increases of an
annual rate of 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The output of light industry products has also been sharply
increased, with certain products ranking first in the world in
terms of overall output, such as bicycles, household washing
machines, gourmet powder, agricultural plastic sheeting and citric
acid.
</P>
<P>
The output of crude salt, beer and detergents ranks
second in the world.
</P>
<P>
Light industry has become one of the pillar sectors of the
national economy, Yu said. The sector's output value accounts for
one third of the country's total industrial output value, with the
export value also accounting for one third of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The market for light industry products has changed from a
seller's to a buyer's one, with the traditional scarcity of
commodities greatly relieved, Yu said.

<HEADLINE> HK Vows to Speed Up Repatriation of Boat People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong official
announced that the territory will speed up its repatriation of
Vietnamese boat people by raising the repatriated number to 1,800
a month from last year's 200 every six weeks.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Hong Kong Standard, a local English
newspaper, the pledge was made by Secretary for Security Lai
Hing-Ling yesterday following agreement at a UN refugee meeting in
 Bangkok that the 40,000 boat people in Hong Kong and Southeast
Asia should be swiftly sent home.
</P>
<P>
Association of South East Asian Nations delegates said that
they were aiming to clear the camps in their countries within six
months.
</P>
<P>
But Lai said it would take longer to clear the 21,000 boat
people from Hong Kong, even at 1,800 a month.
</P>
<P>
He said that those who refuse to volunteer would be
deported. Last year only 1,700 boat people returned voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
"We will be sending out a very clear message to the camp
population that your only future lies in returning to Vietnam,"
Lai said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Hong Kong officials will meet
Vietnamese government representatives within the next few weeks to
overcome remaining problems.

<HEADLINE> HK Shipping Accidents on Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Serious shipping accidents in
 Hong Kong have dropped by a half over the past year, but the
overall number of collisions has risen by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Figures released on Monday by the Marine Department showed
there were 346 collisions involving local and river trade traffic,
 compared to 277 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Most of the increases were attributed to minor collisions in
and around the public works areas, according to sources from the
department.
</P>
<P>
Accidents involving death, serious injury or serious damage
dropped from 47 to 23, a decrease of 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tang Chung-keung, assistant director of the department, said
the reduction in serious collisions was possibly due to traffic
management such as fairway control and increased marine patrols.
</P>
<P>
Combining the figures of various shipping accidents, total
collisions cases increased 12 percent from 377 in 1994 to 423 in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Director of the department Ian Dale said that temporary works
areas and the rise in marine traffic increased the risk of
collisions.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Renews In Northwest Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 59 people were
killed and as many as 130 people were wounded when a serious
fighting broke out recently in Burco, northwest of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts were between forces loyal to the President of
the break away Republic of Somaliland, Mohamed Ibrahim Egal and
those supporting General Aideed's vice-President Abdurahman Ahmed
Ali (Tuur) according to field radios communicated from Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Opposition sources supporting General Aideed's government said
the attack was one of Egal's provocation in destabilizing the
area and was repulsed back with heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
During the fighting all kinds of weapons including anti-
aircraft missiles, multiple rocket launchers, heavy and small
machine guns and rocket propelled grenades were used. However,
both warring sides in Burco claimed victory, but independent
sources indicate that the city, the second largest in Somaliland,
is abandoned and has become no man's land controlled by freelance
looters.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the northwestern region of Somalia, also
anticipate that this new round of fighting might most probably
spread to the capital of Somaliland, Hargeisa, where the clashes
between the self styled government of Egal and those of
Abdurahman Tuur had Originated. There was peace negotiation effort
going on in the region. However General Jama Mohamed Ghalib, the
Foreign Secretary of General Aideed and the spokesman of the
opposition groups in Somaliland said no negotiation would be
possible as far as Egal was claiming presidency in Somaliland.
</P>
<P>
In Burco, no single aid agency or international NGO has been
operating since the beginning of the civil war in Somaliland in
early 1995. Dozens of families are believed to starving in the
villages surrounding Burco after fleeing the fighting with out
food, water and shelter. Somaliland declared its independence
from the rest of Somalia in May 1991.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Opposes US Plans to Rescreen Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has expressed
opposition to the United States' plans to rescreen Vietnamese
refugees now staying in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The US plans have given false hope that Indochinese refugees in
first asylum countries and regions, such as Thailand, would have
an opportunity to settle in the United States.
</P>
<P>
These plans have led many Vietnamese to refuse repatriation,
disrupting efforts to send them back to their home country,
according to a Thai official.
</P>
<P>
Atchara Suyanan, head of the Thai delegation to an informal
international meeting on Indochinese refugees held here, said that
as a result, the number of Vietnamese volunteering for
repatriation from Thailand had dropped "alarmingly" -- from 1,472
during the last six months of 1994 to only 578 during the whole of
1995.
</P>
<P>
She said Thailand might welcome the US proposal if the
rescreening interviews for possible resettlement were open only to
those who volunteered to go back to Vietnam, and the interviews
were to be conducted only after their return to their home
country.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN countries said in a joint statement issued Monday at the
end of a two-day informal meeting of the Steering Committee of the
International Conference on Indochinese Refugees, expressed their
"common will to end the repatriation of non-refugees as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
They also stressed, "there should be no other actions or other
new initiatives, which will interrupt or adversely affect the CPA
(comprehensive plan of action for repatriation) implementation,
particularly repatriation."
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, a UNHCR (United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees) official said that the UN agency is
considering cutting off funds to camps housing Vietnamese
non-refugees.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are 36,800 Vietnamese living in
camps in the region, of whom about 20,000 in Hong Kong, and some
5,000 in Thailand.

today pledged the unwavering U.S. support for Israel to achieve
peace with Syria and Lebanon, stressing the U.S. promise to ensure
Israel's security for the risks it will take for peace.
</P>
<P>
Gore made the pledge while speaking to reporters at a joint
press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
following their meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The United States will be a full and active partner (in the
Middle East peace process)," said Gore.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that he and Gore had an "extensive survey of major
issues on the agenda" of the Middle East peace process. "It is a
very encouraging meeting, and we learned a great deal on many
issues (from Gore)," said Peres.
</P>
<P>
Gore arrived in Israel Monday night from Cairo where he held
talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Gore said that he had three purposes for his trip to Israel.
</P>
<P>
First of all, he wants to pay condolences to the family of late
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated last November,
and the Israeli government on the tragic event.
</P>
<P>
Then he wants to affirm the unwavering commitment of the
U.S. to help Israel to achieve peace with Syria and Lebanon, and
to achieve a comprehensive peace in the Middle East to bring an
end to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Gore said that the current negotiations between Israel and
Syria have a potential not only for making a full peace between
the two sides, but also for a comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"That will be a new reality," he said.
</P>
<P>
The third purpose, he said, was to reaffirm the U.S. commitment
to Israel's security as a result of Israel's risks for making
peace. "This is an unshakable commitment," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Gore also said that Mubarak told him
Egypt will continue to work with leaders of the region and the
U.S. for a comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
He described the latest visit to the region by U.S. Secretary
of State Warren Christopher as "extremely productive," adding that
"the progress will continue in the right direction."
</P>
<P>
Gore is due to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in
Jericho this afternoon before returning home Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the Palestinian elections scheduled to be held on
Saturday, Peres said that he "is satisfied that the Palestinian
elections are taking place" and that he wants to see a democratic
and free society of the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Awareness Of UN Convention On Desertification Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 16 (Xinhua)-- There is no way in which
journalists can be obliged to report on the United Nations
convention to combat desertification, but a way has to be found
to popularize the convention.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were maded by UN institute for training and
research program officer Christopher Nuttall on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nuttall told journalists from the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) member states meeting in Windhoek, Capital of
Namibia, to develop an information campaign on the convention,
the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The journalists' seminar will be followed by a three-day SADC
conference beginning today in Windhoek, to develop an
institutional framework for a sub-regional action program to
implement the convention, adopted on june 17, 1994 in Paris.
</P>
<P>
It is organized by the Maseru-based SADC Environmental and
Land Management Sector (SADC-ELMS).
</P>
<P>
Nuttall and the other seminar participants have made several
proposals on popularizing the convention, including an
information network for the exchange of information among
journalists and other interested parties.
</P>
<P>
The problem Is not about how environmental journalists should
get information, but rather how to get them to report on the
implementation of the convention and on desertification,
SADC-ELMS information facilitator Pernillar Strid said.
</P>
<P>
While opening the seminar, SADC-ELMS Director Bataung Leleka
said the convention would fail to make sustainable achievements
if the media did not raise awareness of its aims.
</P>
<P>
The convention drafters said it had the potential to reduce
the vulnerability of the affected populations by securing their
environment, increasing food security and creating new
opportunities for alternative livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
SADC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Singapore, Philippines Agree to Exchange Ambassadors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and the Philippines
have agreed to exchange ambassadors between the two countries,
about ten months after recalling their respective envoys in the
wake of the Flor Contemplacion case, which strained the bilateral
ties to breaking point.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Singapore Foreign Ministry said today that
Singapore had agreed to the appointment of Alberto Encomienda as
the next Philippine Ambassador to Singapore, while the Philippines
had agreed to the appointment of Simon Tensing de Cruz as the next
Singapore Ambassador to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"This follows from the agreement on December 15, 1995 between
President Fidel Ramos and Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong that the
two countries exchange Ambassadors within two months," the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of ambassadors should contribute to the bilateral
relationship and cooperation between the two countries, and
promote mutual understanding, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors will take up their posts soon, it said, adding
that Singapore and the Philippines share a wide range of common
interests, including bilateral economic and defense ties as well
as cooperation within the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) and the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation).
</P>
<P>
Singapore and the Philippines recalled their respective
ambassador last year after bilateral relations went sour as a
result of the execution in Singapore of the Filipino maid Flor
Contemplacion on March 17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Contemplacion was sentenced to death by the Singapore High
Court on April 25, 1994, for the murder of a fellow Filipino maid
Della Maga and a four-year-old Singaporean boy Nicholas Wong.
</P>
<P>
At the time, many Filipinos were convinced that Contemplacion
was innocent, despite her confession.

authority by the Kenyan government, the local daily "the New
Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The military sources were quoted as saying that among them is
Captain Elias Byaruhanga, who had escaped from detention in
Kampala's Makindye military barracks after allegedly embezzling

The group will be soon produced to answer criminal charges,

<HEADLINE> Trial of Chun's Slush Fund Case to Be held Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The first trial on the slush fund
scandal involving former South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan will
be held in the Seoul District Court on February 5, a court
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chun will be the second former head of state of South Korea to
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
Former President Roh Tae-woo, who was arrested on November 16
last year, has stood trial twice already as he was indicted for
taking 370 million U.S. dollars in bribes from businessmen during
his 1988-1993 presidency in return for winning state projects or
other favors from the government.
</P>
<P>
Also to be tried for their alleged involvement in the amassing
of Chun's slush funds are former Finance Minister Sagong Il,
former Director of the Agency for National Security Planning Ahn
Moo-hyuk, former presidential chief bodyguard Ahn Hyun-tae, former
National Tax Administrator Sung Yong-wook and ex-lawmaker Lee
Won-joe.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the slush fund scandal, Chun has also been
indicted along with Roh for masterminding the military mutiny on
December 12, 1979.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the forthcoming trial of Chun will
entirely deal with graft charges as in the case of Roh.
</P>
<P>
Chun was initially arrested on charges of the 1979 military
mutiny on December 3 last year, but charges of receiving 270
million U.S. dollars in bribes from businessmen while in office
were added to the complaint on January 12.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has said that Chun amassed a 1.2
billion-U.S.-dollar unbudgeted fund from 42 major business tycoons
during his 1980-1988 presidency. Of the total, prosecutors
initially classified 270 million U.S. dollars as bribes and the
remainder as political funds.
</P>
<P>
Chun is currently receiving medical treatment at the National
Police Hospital here due to symptoms of dehydration and
malnutrition resulting from his three-week-long fast protesting
his arrest.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman on US Intention Against China on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman asked the United States here today to give up its
practice of creating a resolution against China on human rights
issue.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Chen Jian said this when asked to comment on the US
intention to seek an anti-China resolution at the UN Commission on
Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that, to do so, the US would not only jeopardize the
co-operation on human rights issue in the international community
but also damage the smooth improvement of Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, a group of countries led by the US
had tried for five consecutive years to produce anti-China
resolutions at the UN Commission on Human Rights and their attempt
had ended up in failure.
</P>
<P>
It is China's consistent position that the international
community should conduct extensive dialogue on human rights issue
so as to promote the co-operation and exchanges in this respect,
Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is firmly opposed to the practice of making
use of the human rights issue to interfere into other country's
internal affairs and strongly opposes making use of the UN
organizations and conferences to bring up the so-called human
rights issue and criticizing wantonly on other countries.
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to advise the US to change its course and give up
its practice of doing what it has intended to do." the spokesman
added.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Lift Foreign Exchange Ceiling Partially </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China will lift the ceiling on
the amount of foreign exchange used in trade and for payment of
debts overseas within five years, official sources say.
</P>
<P>
At present, quotas on foreign exchange now allowed for
individual use are comparatively low and the foreign exchange
needed for non-trade activities such as overseas exhibitions and
training must be approved by the foreign exchange authorities, the
sources pointed out.
</P>
<P>
They explain that the amount of foreign exchange permitted for
personal use will be raised and the requirement that foreign
exchange used for non-trade purposes must be approved will be
abolished.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign currencies traded on the national foreign
exchange market will also be increased in the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to improve the governing of the
exchange rate of the local currency, the renminbi (yuan), so as to
tie the rate more closely to the market.
</P>
<P>
The yuan's exchange and interest rate will be made better use
of by combining it with other financial instruments of the central
bank in the years to come, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said that supervision of foreign exchange will be more in
the hands of financial institutions than enterprises, and added
that increased attention will be given to the mangement of the
country's ballooning foreign exchange reserves to ensure safety,
liquidity, and profitability.
</P>
<P>
The management of foreign debts will also be improved over the
next several years, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Battle Field Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Scholars from north China's
Shanxi Province said recently that they have found the site of a
famous battle 2,000 years ago in which a weak state defeated a
stronger with a small force.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Jin Shenghe from Shanxi University, and Xie Hongxi, chief
editor of the local magazine, "Map of Shanxi", identified Wusu
Village of Qinxian county in the province as the site of the
Battle of Yuyu between the Qin and Zhao States.
</P>
<P>
In 270 BC, the Qin State, the strongest of seven states of the
Warring States Period (475-221 BC), launched a campaign against
neighboring Zhao.
</P>
<P>
Some 100,000 Qin warriors laid siege to the Zhao city of Yuyu,
but was crushed by a surprise attack of 30,000-50,000 Zhao
warriors led by an outstanding general, Zhao She.
</P>
<P>
The defeat was one that Qin had hardly encountered in
conquering the six other states, and one which slowed Qin down in
its attempts to unify China. Qin did not take Yuyu until 236 BC.
</P>
<P>
The site of the battle remained a topic of debate throughout
the following dynastic periods, but focused on three
candidates: Wu'an County in north China's Hebei Province, and Wusu
Village of Qinxian county and Heshun County in Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
After having closely studied the three sites last summer, the
two scholars from Shanxi pointed out that Heshun County on the
Mount Taihang Ridge had little military importance for Zhao State
and its terrain was impossible for a large campaign.
</P>
<P>
Wu'an county was also out of the picture because historical
records show that it took two days and a night for the Zhao
Warriors to march from Wu'an to the site of the Yuyu Battle.
</P>
<P>
The only possible choice, Wusu Village, is located some 100 km
from Wu'an and its geographical position, between the capital and
another important city of Zhao, would merit that large campaign,
the scholars say.
</P>
<P>
In the village the scholars found many objects commemorating
Zhao She, the distinguish general. The mountains around the
village were named after him and there were ruins of a temple
built for him, in which tiles dating from the Warring States
period have been found.
</P>
<P>
Also discovered in the village was a bronze belt hook similar
to those found in the capital of Zhao, and remains of several dry
wells, which, according to the scholars, were made by Zhao
soldiers who were under siege in Yuyu for two years.
</P>
<P>
About one km to the northwest of the village a tombstone with
the inscription "some one km to the southeast is Yuyu Xu" (Yuyu
ruins) was unearthed, leading the scholars to deduce that the name
of the village Wusu was a corruption of Yuyu Xu.

</P>
<P>
Egyptians had distinct advantage over the Angolans in the
first half, but were made to sweat for their win in the end.

It was a performance which led Egypt's Dutch coach Ruud Krol

"They are a very good team and played with great verve and
tenacity," Krol said.
</P>
<P>
Krol said that Egypt would come up against Cameroon in their

<HEADLINE> 11 Hostages Freed, 100 Rebels Killed or Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A total of 11 hostages have been
released and some 100 Chechen rebels have been killed or injured
in the village of Pervomaiskoye in Daghestan bordering Chechnya by
this morning, the Russian news media reported.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the other rebels, whose number is estimated at
over 100, continue their resistance in the southern part of the
village. They are still holding dozens of hostages.
</P>
<P>
The Russian special forces and Interior troops launched a
full-scale attack on the Chechen rebels who were holding some 100
hostages in the village on Monday morning. "Fighting had been
going throughout overnight," reports said.
</P>
<P>
The village of over 20 houses has been cordoned off by three
rows of Russian troops, and attempts made by the rebels to break
through the cordon at night were prevented.
</P>
<P>
The well-armed rebels led by Salman Raduyev, the son-in-law of
rebel Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, made strong resistance
from their strongholds in the village. The Russian troops had to
use heavy artillery guns, aircraft and tanks to suppress the
resistance.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Russian troops broke through into the village
this morning and are now continuing their heavy strike on the
remaining rebels. "Intensive submachine and machine gun fire is
heard from Pervomaiskoye," reports said.
</P>
<P>
On January 9, the rebels slipped past border guards and entered
Kizlyar, a town in the Russian republic of Dagestan, holding some
3,000 local residents hostage. At least 40 people were killed in
previous fightings.
</P>
<P>
Following negotiations with Russian officials, the rebels
released most hostages and headed for Chechnya with the remaining
more than 100 captives in a convoy of buses. They were stopped by

<HEADLINE> Zambia, AAC Meet In London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the Zambian
government and the Anglo-American Corporation (AAC) are meeting
in London to discuss the final modalities of development of the
Konkola deep mining reserves in northern Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The AAC proposal on investment into Konkola mine is being
discussed at the meeting which was progressing well on Monday,
according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors led by AAC are prepared to put some 600
million US dollars into the Konkola project which is envisaged to
be the great hope for Zambia's mining industry.
</P>
<P>
AAC announced over the weekend that it plans to invite a
consortium of companies from South Africa to pump investment into
the Konkola project.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba revealed
that his government has agreed in principle with the AAC proposal
and the details of the project will be worked out by experts from
both sides.
</P>
<P>
The development of Konkola deep mine by foreign investors is
regarded here as "a test piece" for the privatization of the
country's mining industry.

BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A 15-year-old middle school
student was killed recently and a classmate injured in a fight
with an unknown man on a Beijing street, police said today.
</P>
<P>
The boy, Zhou Fen, was stabbed when he and the classmate, Ma
Qianli, began to fight with a passerby who had been bothering a
girl student of Beijing's N0. 3 Middle School.
</P>
<P>
Local police are conducting a thorough search to try to find
the man. He was described as being a male of about 30, speaking an
unfamiliar dialect. At 5:40 pm, on December 5, 1995, he assaulted
the girl student at a bus stop and tried to drag her inside a bus.
</P>
<P>
When the frightened girl told Zhou and Ma about this in tears,
they went to question the man, grabbing him by the arms in an
attempt to take him to the police.
</P>
<P>
The man struggled to escape and when the two boys tried to
seize him again, he pulled out a knife from his pocket and stabbed
them.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was stabbed in the heart, but managed to follow the man
for 15 more meters, then collapsed. He died the next morning after
medical efforts failed to save his life. Ma received three stab
wounds on the left arm.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Finland is optimistic
that Tanzania will hasten the pace of its development following
measures taken for good governance, financial discipline, revenue
collection and the war against corruption.
</P>
<P>
This was said by Finnish Minister of Environment and
Development Cooperation Pekka Haavisto, when talking to
journalists here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Haavisto who is on a four-day official visit to Tanzania said
that the impression he got during his meetings with all the
dignitaries including President Benjamin William Mkapa was that
the current government was all out to alleviate peoples' poverty.
</P>
<P>
He held discussions with vice-President Omar Ali Juma, Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye, Finance Minister Simon Mbilinyi and
the Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete.
</P>
<P>
He said that Finland wanted to assist Tanzania through
bilateral arrangement rather than the international Monetary Fund
(IMF) with the linkage to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that it was imperative for Tanzania to
observe the demands of the IMF since donor countries' aid was
linked to ESAF.

<HEADLINE> Dry Sowing, Sparse Planting Rice Technology for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Rice-growing that uses dry
sowing and sparse transplanting technology will go to southern
parts of China from the north for use on 16.6 million ha of
farmland by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the technique, which
was developed by Japanese, is one of the major farming advances
listed by the ministry for nationwide use to increase grain
production. It has been shown to increase per-hectare yield by an
average of 40 kg.
</P>
<P>
The technique was first introduced into northwest China's
Heilongjiang Province in the 1980s. It increased rice production
in the province, turning the rice-importing province into a rice
exporter.
</P>
<P>
The technique involves less consumption of water and higher
yield, and was used on a total of six million ha of farmland last
year, giving 3.87 billion kg of rice in increased output.
</P>
<P>
The ministry allocated 13.62 million yuan for spreading use of
the technique to the southern part of the country, while local
governments in the south collected a matching amount of money for
the extension programs.
</P>
<P>
The technique has been used on 266 million ha in the south, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
About 20 million people in the south have been trained annually
since 1990.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Hopes Keating's Visit Improves Understanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today that his talks with visiting
Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating would help improve mutual
understanding between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Describing the one-hour discussion as "harmonized," Mahathir
said Keating's visit could help overcome minor misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Malaysian and Australia were strained
when Keating described Mahathir as "recalcitrant" for not
attending the Seattle APEC informal leadership conference in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the understanding he expected from Australia
was acknowledging that Malaysia is a multi-racial country and has
its own sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
"Before people pass on their opinion, at least they should
understand the situation we are facing," Mahathir said, adding
"off and on, we as politicians sometimes burst out and say
something which we regret later."
</P>
<P>
According to Mahathir, each country has different values and
Malaysia does not think that it has the right to tell other people
how to run their country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Keating said that his talks with Mahathir were
"useful and fruitful," and said he "very much enjoyed" his visit
to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Keating said that there was no strain in the Australia-Malaysia
relationship but he agreed with Mahathir's statement Monday that
hiccups had occurred in the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the two leaders attended the signing of a memorandum
of understanding on education between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum aims to promote the exchange of scholars,
twinning programs for universities, scholarship and places for
Malaysian students in Australia's institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
Keating arrived here Monday for a three-day official visit to
Malaysia, and will leave for Singapore Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and British sides
of the experts group of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group
(JLG) today reached consensus on the schedule and procedures for
the handover of documents, blueprints and materials about the
defense sites in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Chinese JLG representative Chen Zuo'er at
a news briefing at the end of the 19th JLG experts meeting on
Hong Kong's defense and public security here today.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the documents, blueprints and materials to be
handed from the British side over to the Chinese side involve 14
defense sites.
</P>
<P>
He said that since June 1994 when the two sides signed an
important agreement on the arrangements for the future use of the
existing defense sites in Hong Kong, the experts of both sides
have engaged in sound cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, in the past 18 months, with the cooperation
of the British side, several groups of Chinese defense experts
have come to Hong Kong for investigation, and they have achieved
much progress.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that in such a positive spirit of
cooperation, the smooth handover of Hong Kong's defense sites can
be realized after June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he hopes the cooperative spirit between the two
sides on the defense site handover issue will be extended to other
sectors concerning the sovereignty handover.

cooperate in exploration work.
</P>
<P>
This message comes from Zhang Yunzhong, general manager of the

this island.
</P>
<P>
According to its plan, CNOOC will increase the amount of proven
natural gas reserves to a total of 300 billion cubic meters, and
oil reserves to 100 million tons in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Annual production capacity of gas will reach eight to ten
billion cubic meters, and that of oil refineries, two million tons.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that the Ya13-1 gas field, newly-built by Chinese,
American, and Kuwaiti companies is China's largest offshore gas
field, and a successful example of Sino-foreign cooperation in
developing natural resources.
</P>

<P>
NAIROBI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Government on
Monday imposed a ban on maize exportation from any part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Minister for Agriculture, Livestock Development and
Marketing, Simeon Nyachae said in a statement that the measure
will remain in force until the government assesses the food
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Various parts of the country are facing poor short rains,
which threatens the food production.
</P>
<P>
"I therefore take this opportunity to emphasize that no maize
exportation will be allowed while the government continues to
evaluate the food situation in the country to determine the full
impact of the poor short rains realized nationwide in the recent
past," Nyachae said.
</P>
<P>
Nyachae said maize exportation has been under close government
control. The approval of maize exportation was granted in
November last year solely to the National Cereals and Produce
Board to sell its surplus stocks to drought stricken Southern
African countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said the exportation was purely to enable
the board to raise money to clear outstanding payments to
farmers.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- World number one Pete Sampras
of the United States defeated Australian Richard Fromberg 7-5, 6-3
and 6-2 in the first round of men's singles at the Australian Open
in Melbourne on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who was not in his best form under the scorching sun,
ousted the world 118 ranked Fromberg in front of thousands of
cheering fans at Flinders Park.
</P>
<P>
He chose not to play on the first day of the Australian Open on
Monday because of the effect of a flu.
</P>
<P>
He suffered a bleeding nose when he arrived in Melbourne last
weekend. The flu virus kept him in bed at home and from
participating in the Peter's International in Sydney last week.
</P>
<P>
With a successful season in 1995, the tennis super star faces
crucial challenges at the Grand Slam event, which features 28 of
the world's top 30 men's players.
</P>
<P>
The champion is expected to emerge from the five big guns
attending the tournament, namely Sampras, Andre Agassi, Thomas
Muster, Boris Becker and Michael Chang.
</P>
<P>
Sampras rendered his Australian Open title to Agassi last year
under the impact of the sudden illness of his coach Tim Gullikso.
</P>
<P>
He won his third consecutive Wimbledon and second U.S. Open
title last year. He also led the American team to take the Davis
Cup in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't set myself the goal of winning (all four) grand slam
matches," he told local press before the tournament.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other matches, Muster, winner of last year's
French Open, easily beat France's Thierry Guardiola 6-3, 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's former top seed and twice Open winner Stefan Edberg
met tough challenge in the clash against Czech Republic's Jiri
Novak.
</P>
<P>
Edberg, 29, who is to retire this year, allowed Novak to pull
back from two sets down. But the veteran held on to fight back to
take the last set, winning 7-6, 7-5, 3-6, 5-7, 6-1.

<P>
WUHAN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province is
set to invest 3.35 billion yuan during the 1996-2000 period to
clean polluted lakes and rivers.
</P>
<P>
The investment will come partly from a 150-million-US dollar
World Band loan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Binglin, chief of the provincial Environmental Protection
Bureau, says that East Lake (Donghu Lake) and Mushui Lake in the
provincial capital of Wuhan, Cihu Lake in Huangshi city, and the
Xiaoqing River in Xiangfan city are at the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 cu m of waste water are released every day into
East Lake, some parts of which are dark and have an unpleasant
odor. The lake, which used to be called the pearl of Central
China, is five times the size of scenic West Lake in Hangzhou, the
provincial capital of Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
To treat waste water discharged into the lake, three plants
with a total capacity of treating 380,000 tons of waste water
every day, will be built near it.
</P>
<P>
A 65-km pipeline will be laid to connect the source of the
waste water to the three plants, and facilities will be built to
keep the water in the lake clean.
</P>
<P>
A waste water treatment plant will be built and a 16-km pipe
laid to treat waste water in Cihu Lake in the heavy industrial
center in the eastern part of the province. The lake water will be
up to or close to drinking water standards.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province plans to build facilities to handle
garbage in the cities of Wuhan, Huangshi, Xiangfan, and Yichang,
and to help large and medium-size enterprises with pollution
problems use technological innovations and build water treatment
plants, or relocate the polluting businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the environmental protection projects will
take three to five years and that a feasibility study and resident
relocation report for East Lake has received domestic and World
Bank approval.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- In recent years, a number of
Tibetan scholars have contributed to Tibetan culture, improving
the quality of their culture.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, Tonggar Losang Chilai has written 17 books,
including "On Tibet's Social System Combining Political Power with
Religious Power", a "Tibetan Grammar", and the "Historical
Documents and Records of Tibet".
</P>
<P>
He recently finished the "Almanac of Tibetan History" and a
two-million-character Tibetan Language Dictionary, both of which
have just been published by China Tibetology Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
Qamba Chilai, a well-known physician of Tibetan medicine,
edited the Tibetan-Chinese, Tibetan-English, and Tibetan-Japanese
editions of "The Charts of 'The Four Tantras'" with a group of
scholars. "The Four Tantras" is a classic Tibetan medical
reference book, compiled in the 8th century.
</P>
<P>
The book has 80 colored charts of Tibetan medicine, 4,700
pictures, and 230,000 characters, providing the first
colored-chart collection of Chinese medicine. The book was a
winner of the China Book Award and an international book award,
and was described by Chinese President Jiang Zemin as a "priceless
treasure".
</P>
<P>
Qamba Chilai spent 10 years completing "Biographies of
Historical Figures of Tibetan Medicine," which contains the
biographies of 141 famous physicians of Tibetan medicine since
1703.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Qamba Chilai, who is also a prominent figure in
calculations using the Tibetan calendar, has written 30 papers,
four books, and 13 textbooks in the Tibetan language. He was given
the title of expert making outstanding contributions to the
country by the government.
</P>
<P>
Chilai Giozha, a folklore expert, wrote "Study of Local
Conditions and Customs of Tibet" in the early 1980s and it became
a best seller in China and sold well abroad. The book has gone
through four reprintings, and an English edition has been
published.
</P>
<P>
Another of his books, "Tibet -- My Home", has been translated
into German, French, Japanese, and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
Others who have succeeded in the area of literature and art
include Ngawang Kecen, a famous dancer, Cedain Zhoima, a famous
singer who was nicknameded "the lark of the holy land", and
novelists such as Yexe Dainzim, Zhaxi Dagwa and Yang Dron.
</P>
<P>
The scholars and many other people share the view that in order
to help the Tibetan people and accelerate social development in
Tibet, it is imperative that science and technology be developed,
and that the cream of other ethnic groups' culture be absorbed,
and that knowledge and talented people be respected.

<HEADLINE> Some Afghan Ruling Party Workers Revolt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 activists of the
Afghan ruling Jamiat-i-Islami have revolt against their party
chief, President Burhanuddin Rabbani, and took control of the
party offices in Peshawar, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper "The News" reported here today said that
the activists marched into the Jamiat headquarters at Chamkani on
the outskirts of Peshawar and managed to occupy it.
</P>
<P>
Some eyewitnesses were quoted as saying that a showdown was
averted even though both pro-Rabbani and anti-Rabbani party
workers were heavily armed.
</P>
<P>
Those anti-Rabbani Jamiat workers also seized Jamiat offices in
Pabbi and Kababiyan in Peshawar.
</P>
<P>
Ismat Qanay, leader of the anti-Rabbani Jamiat group, was
quoted as saying, "It wasn't a forcible occupation as those in
possession of these offices joined hands with us."
</P>
<P>
Qanay strongly criticized Rabbani and his top commander Ahmad
Masood for deviating from the party's political program.
</P>
<P>
He accused Masood of hijacking Jamiat-i-Islami and converted it
into a military machine, fighting everybody in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We want Jamiat to function as a political party instead of a
military outfit," he said, adding, "Jamiat must hold talks with
all Afghan groups to bring about national reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
So far, no reaction of the Afghan regime to this revolt has
been obtained.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Government Resumes Talks with Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi ruling and opposition
parties have resumed their backstage parleys on the possibilities
of resolving the country's prolonged political impasse to pave the
way for the upcoming general elections, reliable sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
They said that the parleys resumed Monday with the mediation of
US Ambassador to Dhaka David Merrill who had separate meetings
with Commerce and Information Minister Shamsul Islam from the
government side and Amir Hossain Amu, the key negotiator of the
opposition side.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators discussed the possibilities of sharing
executive powers between the president and the head of a proposed
advisory council to oversee the elections, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They also exchanged views on deferring the election schedule,
seeking judicial reference on the interim administration and
postponing the polling date further, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
A negotiator from the government side said that "contacts
continued to resolve the crisis" and that he was hopeful of a
solution although no progress was made yet.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators from the two sides had had informal contacts
earlier but stopped doing so after no compromise was made on the
power sharing in the interim period.
</P>
<P>
The government proposed that the country's president should
enjoy the power of the prime minister and head an advisory council
to be formed with the equal number of representatives from both
sides.
</P>
<P>
The opposition disagreed and suggested that there be a chief
advisor who enjoys the power of the prime minister as the head of
the caretaker government.

<HEADLINE> Czechs, Venezuelans to Increase Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A trade delegation from the
Czech Republic, headed by Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir
Dlouhy, will begin a two-day official visit to Venezuela today to
promote bilateral economic links.
</P>
<P>
A trade and investment agreement will be signed during the
visit by Dlouhy and Venezuela's Development Minister Werner
Corralesto, making Venezuela the first Latin American country to
sign such a document with the Czechs.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is to replace the one signed in 1986, since
things are notably different from 10 years ago with about 70
percent of the Czech Republic's gross national product (GNP) now
stemming from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Dlouhy is expected to meet with Venezuelan President Rafael
Caldera, Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas and other
prominent government officials on diverse issues of mutual
interest, including privatization and the possibility for the
Czech Republic to import oil from Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Czech businessmen accompanying Dlouhy will visit several
Venezuelan companies and they have showed interest in cooperation
in the automotive, energy, metallurgical and mining industries.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that bilateral trade favored the
Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Before Czechoslovakia was split into two independent countries,
its exports to Venezuela stood at 18 million U.S. dollars while
imports totaled 3 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
But trade shrank in the years following the Czech Republic's
separation from Slovakia. It exported 8 million dollars' worth of
goods to Venezuela in 1993, 3.7 million dollars in 1994 and 3.5
million in 1995 while imports amounted to 200,000 dollars, 1.4
million dollars and 900,000 dollars respectively in the three
years.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls For Ban Of Land Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A top U.N. official
today called on all governments to ban the production, export and
sale of land mines.
</P>
<P>
Peter Hansen, under secretary general for Humanitarian Affairs,
said at a news briefing here that governments must work toward a
total ban on land mines.
</P>
<P>
"It is ironic that while the international community has
managed to ban sophisticated weapons that are capable of killing
indiscriminately on a massive scale, the world is faced with the
unbridled proliferation of simple, easy-to-build weapons whose
effects are equally devastating and equally indiscriminate," he
said.
</P>
<P>
There are 110 million land mines around the world, which kill
more than 800 people per month, maim thousands more and leave some
countries devastated and unable to resume normal life for a long
period, according to Hansen.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the number of land mines is still rapidly increasing,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Humanitarian Affairs, as the focal point for
mine-related activities within the U.N., is determined to
accelerate mine clearance, launch new programs in countries
requiring assistance and redouble efforts to develop national
capabilities for mine clearance, he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Focus on Rural Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Public
Health Chen Minzhang said here Monday that China will give top
priority to improving health conditions and medical services for
farmers in remote and mountain areas this year, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the central and local governments will
work out preferential policies and grant more funds for health
work in those areas.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that a special fund for health improvement in poor
rural areas should be set up and urban areas should send medical
teams to help the farmers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country should continue to construct and
improve medical and preventive health care networks in the rural
areas. Over 80 percent of the population live in those areas.
</P>
<P>
The layout and management of local health establishments must
be rearranged to meet the needs of farmers, co-operative health
insurance should be expanded and campaigns carried out to help
farmers live a healthier life, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1994, 843 counties, or about 40 percent of the
country's total, have reached the state's requirement for
expanding the basic health care for farmers, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the central government allocated 300
million yuan (about 35.2 million US dollars), while local
governments accumulated some 8.65 billion yuan (about one billion
US dollars) to renovate local health institutes and improve their
facilities and technology.
</P>
<P>
the Ministry of Public Health selected 50 new health techniques
and spread application of these techniques in the countryside
during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Water improvement projects have expanded, and about 86 percent
of the rural population now have clean drinking water, an increase
of 20 percent over five years ago. More than 40 percent have tap
water available, a 10 percent increase over five years before.
</P>
<P>
The official also disclosed that a national conference on
public health, the first of its kind sponsored by the central
authorities since the founding of new China in 1949, will be held
later this year to outline strategic policy decisions in this
regard.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Not to Help in Extraditing Drug Warlord to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has declined a request
from the United States to help persuade Myanmar to extradite drug
warlord Khun Sa to stand trial in the US.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Kasem S. Kasemsri said Monday that any
legal action against Khun Sa would be done in accordance with
Yangon's laws.
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa, the drug warlord in Myanmar's Shan state who had been
fighting for independence of Shan state, surrendered his Mong Tai
army to the Myanmar government early this month.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Kasem last Saturday, visiting US Assistant
Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord
requested Thailand's cooperation in the matter.
</P>
<P>
The US has offered a reward of two million dollars for
information leading to the arrest of Khun Sa, who was indicted in
the US in 1989 on drug trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
However, the Myanmar government has made it clear that it has
no extradition treaty with Washington and ruled out the
possibility of an extradition.
</P>
<P>
Reports said earlier that the US regarded as the legal
foundation a 1948 agreement it made with the then U Nu government.
</P>
<P>
But Kasem said that he did not think the document was still in
effect.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica's Economic Growth Slowest in Central America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica reported an
economic growth of 2.5 percent in Central America last year while
El Salvador recorded a growth of 6.5 percent, according to the
U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's low economic growth, below its population
increase, was the result of a year of economic uncertainty. The
government's tax package was only approved by parliament after a
tough battle.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican government is confident that it will achieve a
growth of more than 4 percent this year with its new policies of
economic reform.
</P>
<P>
The most important reform policies include a tax package,
spending cuts and public tariff hikes in an effort to offset a
fiscal deficit that reached 8.5 percent of its 1994 GNP.
</P>
<P>
The deficit was reduced by more than a half last year, which
the government plans to lower to 0.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government also tried to reduce its high interest rates
that have a direct on production.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has reached an emergency agreement with the
International Monetary Fund and thus normalized relations with
other international financial organizations such as the World Bank
and the Inter-American Development Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski said today that his country is willing to establish a
relationship of "understanding and sincerity" with its eastern
partners.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with foreign diplomats in Poland, Kwasniewski said
it is both a challenge and an opportunity for his country to
integrate with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of NATO, which Poland is trying to join, will not
pose a threat to other countries, especially the country's two big
neighbors, Ukraine and Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Poland is willing to develop its relations, based
on understanding and sincerity, with its eastern partners
including Russia, which he described as a great country with great
potential.
</P>
<P>
This will help create conditions for lasting security and
constructive cooperation in Europe and the world as a whole, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Poland's relations with the United States,
Kwasniewski said that his country has a traditional friendly
relationship with the United States and that he will make efforts
to further develop it.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- German President Roman Herzog said
today that his country will make further efforts to promote and
strengthen its relationship with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Germany aims to foster close relations with Israel and make
contributions to the construction of security and peace in Middle
East, Herzog said at a dinner given in honor of Israeli President
Eser Weizman, who arrived in Germany Sunday on a four-day state
visit.
</P>
<P>
Herzog said no one believed that the two countries could
develop a "close relationship of mutual understanding" after
they established diplomatic ties 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Weizman pointed out that the relations between the two
countries are "good and close." However, he stressed that history
cannot and should not be forgotten. The two sides must make
"sincere and serious efforts" to safeguard their ties through
cooperation and mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, about 6 million European Jews died in the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
Weizman also held talks with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on
the bilateral relations and the peace process in the Middle
East. The visiting president is scheduled to deliver a speech
tomorrow at the German parliament.

<HEADLINE> Romania Needs Much More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Romania had obtained a total
of 1.59 billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment by the end of
1995, leaving a huge gap between the country's demand for and the
actual inflow of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Only 190 million dollars of foreign money flowed into Romania
last year, far from meeting the demand of its economy, which local
economists say at least needs another 10 billion dollars of
foreign money for invigoration.
</P>
<P>
Of the total foreign investment the country has so far
received, 59 percent came from western Europe, 16 percent from
Asia, 10 percent from North America and 7 percent from the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, Germany, Italy, France and the United States
ranked as the five largest foreign investors in Romania.
</P>
<P>
Most foreign investors put their money in the country's
commerce and the processing industries, which call for little
investment but can quickly bring in profit. They seemed to be
unwilling to invest in such industries as coal mining and oil
exploration, which usually yield low returns on investment.
</P>
<P>
Local economists say it is quite difficult for Romania to
attract enough foreign investment in the near future, especially
for the existing big industrial projects and the country's
infrastructure, which need to be updated urgently.

PANAMA CITY, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Panama's federal government
hopes to gain more than 1 billion U.S. dollars from the
privatization of state-owned institutions before 1999 with about
100 million dollars received this year, said a senior government
official.
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Macia, head of the State Divestiture Unit, said more
than 500 million dollars are expected to come from the sale of the
National Institute of Telecommunications (INTEL), 50 million
dollars from the privatization of cellular telephone services, and
the rest from the transfer of gambling and other facilities,
including the President Remon race track, national casinos, sugar
cane mills and the Atlapa Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
As gambling has to be managed by the state only according to
Panama's constitution, the government will grant licenses to
investors, especially foreign investors with experience so that
they can run race tracks and other gambling activities in the
country lawfully, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital will take
steps in 1996 to attract more overseas investment and establish a
new economic and trade strategy that matches international
practices more.
</P>
<P>
According to Yi Xiqun, director of the city's foreign economic
and trade commission, Beijing will try to attract foreign
investment worth 1.2 billion US dollars and set up 25 more firms
overseas in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The city will also export commodities and services worth 2.6
billion dollars and get labor contracts worth 800 million dollars,
hoping to earn 400 million dollars and send 4,000 laborers abroad.
</P>
<P>
Yi said that, in the foreign economy and trade sector, the
opening to the outside world and development of export-oriented
economy will be improved in a move to give an impetus to the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, Beijing had foreign trade worth
4.23 billion US dollars, a rise of 5.4 percent over the previous
year, and the local economy registered a 12.6 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
This year, the city will place greater importance on the
quality and efficiency in using overseas investment. It will also
move to shift overseas investment to hi-tech industries,
technological upgrading of old enterprises, local infrastructure,
and housing.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will also streamline export companies and plans to set
up more large export groups in industry, technology, and trade.
</P>
<P>
Yi said the city will also give an even greater push to its
service industry, as it constituted 47.1 percent of the local
gross domestic product (GDP) last year. By the year 2000, the
industry is expected to surpass 50 percent of the total local GDP.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the local government will strive to improve the
investment environment and provide better service for those who
intend to invest here.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Sees Level Growth after Wild Swings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- After surviving wild swings,
China's real estate sector appears to have leveled off in 1995,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Meng Xiaosu, president of China National
Real Estate Development Group, as saying that after two and a half
years' correction, "business has become stable and fears that the
sector would remain in the doldrums can well be cast aside."
</P>
<P>
Meng made the remarks Monday when a summary report on the
latest issue of China Real Estate Index (CREI) was released. Today
marks the 15th anniversary of the company's founding.
</P>
<P>
China's real estate investment through last November rose 27
percent from a year ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of last year, commercial housing sales
growth averaged 20.1 percent to overtake an 14.6 percent increase
in new projects going under construction, an indicator that an
appetite is growing to consume the inventory housing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Evaluation by the Ministry of Construction put the overstock of
commercial housing at 32.9 million sq m in floor space by the end
of 1995, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Launched in late 1994, the index system released 10 industry
survey reports in 1995. After passing state-level scrutiny last
September, it expanded its coverage of sample cities from an
initial five to over 20.
</P>
<P>
Of the 15 cities involved in the calculation of this issue of
the index, Shenzhen topped the list at 1,223 points, to be
followed by Beijing, at 1,089 points, and Shanghai, at 922 points.
</P>
<P>
He noted that of commercial housing built from January to
October last year, residential housing accounted for 83.29
percent.

CANBERRA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- World co-number one Monica
Seles of the United States scored an easy win over her fellow
Janet Lee in her opening match at the Australian Open in Melbourne
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Seles, haunted by a groin injury, needed only 46 minutes to
fight off the less known Lee with straight sets 6-3, 6-0, sailing
into the second round.
</P>
<P>
With the win, the three time Australian Open title-holder Seles
extended her unbeaten record here to 22-0.
</P>
<P>
Seles made her comeback to tennis in last August after being
stabbed in the back by a Steffi Graf's fan in April 1993.
</P>
<P>
She won the Canadian Open last August and finished runner-up to
Graf in the U.S. Open. But she didn't play the WTA Championships
and the Federation Cup due to knee injury.
</P>
<P>
Seles strained her groin muscle during her three-set victory
over American Lindsay Davenport in last Sunday's final of the
Sydney International at White City.
</P>
<P>
But Seles met no difficulty in the practice-like match against
the 19-year-old Lee, ranked 164 in the world.
</P>
<P>
Seles will now take on 78th-ranked Katarina Studenikova of
Slovakia, who booked a second-round berth after beating Belgian
Dominique Van Roost on Monday.

BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China's largest insurer, the
People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), will have transformed
into a group company with three subsidiaries engaged in life

</P>
<P>
The transformation is expected to be completed by the end of

Official estimates have put China's insurance at 200 billion
yuan (about 24.1 billion US dollars) by the year 2000, as against
only 60 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
The PICC's monopoly was smashed in 1985 and since then nearly
20 domestic insurance companies have emerged in the country and
more companies are expected to be set up in the coming
years. However, to date the PICC still has a market share of more
than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since China opened its insurance sector to foreign competition,
The cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou are only places where foreign
insurers are allowed to operate.
</P>
<P>
The PICC's annual profits rose by 37.4 percent to 884 million
yuan last year, Ma said.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Open Insurance Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The American International
Assurance Co. Ltd (AIA) has gotten a green light from China's
central bank to open a branch in this financial center of south
China.
</P>
<P>
This is its second branch in China. The first one is in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony of the Guangzhou branch was held
Monday. It indicates that China will continue to open its
insurance market since the newly-born Insurance Law has paved a
way for foreign insurers' entering into China.
</P>
<P>
The law, going into effect last October, allows the foreign
insurance organizations to be gradually introduced to China, the
country which resumed such business only in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"China will allow foreign insurance companies to start business
in major coastal cities by the year 2000," said an official of the
People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The government will reduce the waiting period from three to two
years for the upgrading of a foreign insurance company's office in
China to an operating branch, the official said.
</P>
<P>
AIA, a leading insurer with the American International Group,
became the first foreign insurance company to open in China when
its Shanghai branch was set up in 1992.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by the Tokyo Marine and Fire Insurance Co. Ltd
of Japan and Britain's Sedgwick Insurance and Risk Management
Consultant Ltd, both of which started doing business in Shanghai,
China's largest city.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers Life Insurance Company of Canada has been
approved for a joint-venture insurance company, with the Chinese
partner to be announced in the near future. Other European, North
American, and Asian insurers have applied for approval to set up
branches in China.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign insurance companies not only introduce new
services and management methods, but also offer job
opportunities," said an official from the People's Bank. By last
October, 77 overseas insurance companies had set up 119 offices in
China.
</P>
<P>
They will help the development of China's insurance business
and strengthen awareness of the Chinese public about insurance,
the official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Foreign insurers' business in China can help meet Chinese
demand for insurance services, which has increased dramatically,
along with the rapid growth of the national economy, said a member
of the China Insurance Society. And, a more complete legal system
is being created to protect foreign companies' interests in China,
she added.
</P>
<P>
China will issue a circular on the Insurance Law and
regulations on certification of insurance agents, in order to
guarantee full compliance with the law.
</P>
<P>
A regulation on management of foreign-funded insurance
organizations will also be revised in accordance with the law, so
that the monitoring of foreign insurance companies can be
strengthened.

<HEADLINE> Poor Students Aided Through College with Donation Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 400 high school
graduates from poor families in Hubei Province are to be sponsored
through university by a privately-donated bank fund, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The Hubei provincial branch of the people's Construction Bank
of China will sponsor the students over the next 10 years using a
four million yuan (about 482,000 U.S. dollars) fund donated by its
employees.
</P>
<P>
President of the bank branch He Guangchang said that the fund
was established last year with donations from the branch's 18,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
China Daily said it is the first of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
At least 40 high school graduates will be sponsored each year
in the province.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the first group of 40 high school graduates, who were
too poor to pay for college living and tuition expenses, entered
the country's key universities thanks to the fund.
</P>
<P>
Students who are qualified to receive the aid must be the best
high school graduates, from a family with an average per capita
monthly income of less than 100 yuan (about 12 U.S. dollars) in
urban areas and less than 40 yuan in rural areas. And they must be
enrolled by one of China's key universities.
</P>
<P>
The chosen students will receive 3,000 yuan (about 361
U.S. dollars) each year from the fund and are required to report
on their studies to the fund during their college years. The fund
may cancel the sponsorship if their performance is not good enough.
</P>
<P>
By September this year when the new semester starts, about half
of the country's 1,000 universities and colleges will charge
freshmen tuition fees, which would be some 1,000 yuan (about 120
U.S. dollars) more than the previous 400 to 500 yuan (48 to 60
U.S. dollars) per year.
</P>
<P>
College education used to be paid by the government which in
turn has the responsibility to assign jobs to college
graduates. In 1994, some 30 universities and colleges in China
began to charge their students with part of their college
education fees. Students who pay would be able to choose jobs by
themselves when they graduate.

<HEADLINE> Accusations Against Shanghai Orphanage Refuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Embassy here
rejected as "biased and totally untenable" recent allegations of
maltreatment made by the U.S. media against a Shanghai orphanage.
</P>
<P>
"The legitimate rights of orphans and disabled children in
China are equally guaranteed as the rest and great care and
concern have been shown toward them by the Chinese government and
the whole Chinese society," Yu Shuning, press counselor of the
Chinese Embassy, said in letters to some leading U.S. newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. newspapers in the past few days published articles
based on a report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch/Asia,
asserting that "hundreds of children" died abnormal deaths in the
Shanghai orphanage.
</P>
<P>
They charged that there were "torture, as well as physical and
mental abuse" of children there and that China has a policy of
letting children die in the orphanages.
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate in the Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute
(SCWI) in recent years averages about 4 percent, Yu noted in the
letters, parts of which were recently published by the Washington
Times and the New York Times. It is "a sheer fabrication with
ulterior motives to claim that 'hundreds of children' died
abnormal deaths," he declared.
</P>
<P>
In their stories about the Shanghai institute, the U.S. media
also relied heavily on the "information" provided by Zhang Shuyun,
a former SCWI staff member, who spread lies about her superiors
after she was criticized for her poor work performance and who
fled to the United States after a libel suit had been filed
against her.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the claim of the Human Rights Watch/Watch that the
timing of its report had "no political consideration," the Chinese
Embassy official pointed out it is not the first time that this
group launched attacks on China.
</P>
<P>
As deliberations of the U.N. Human Rights Commission will start
in March, he queried: "What purpose will this report serve if it
is not for lending a helping hand to push through a resolution
condemning China on the human rights issue?"
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of American friends in letters addressed to
the Chinese ambassador expressed concern about possible negative
impact of what they called "grossly unfair" reports in the
U.S. media.
</P>
<P>
"It is terribly unfair to suggest China is letting children die
in orphanages based on one person's dated and uncorroborated
report on one orphanage," one letter said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Ahmed El Kass scored
double to give Egypt a 2-1 win over Angola in an African Nations'
Cup group A match here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
El Kass, a World Cup veteran, converted a cross from Yasser
Radwan to net his first goal in the 30th minute.
</P>
<P>
Only three minutes later, the same combination repeated the
feat, with Radwan delivering a pass and El Kass blasted home a
close-range shot.
</P>
<P>
Angola pulled one back in the 77th minute through Quinzinho,
who volleyed the ball into the net on a Abel Campos cross.
</P>
<P>
Angola repeatedly threatened the Egyptian defence in the last
ten minutes but failed to find a way through to equalize.
</P>
<P>
The win put Egypt level on points with hosts South Africa, who
had a 3-0 win over Cameroon in Saturday's opening match of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
In the other match Monday, Sierra Leone beat Burkina Faso 2-1
in Group B in Bloemfontein, South Africa.

ZAGREB, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian government refused
to release Serb prisoners Monday, threatening to defy a key
deadline of the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"The Bosnians say they are not going to comply," said Jacques

</P>
<P>
The Dayton peace plan, signed in Paris on December 14, demands
that all conflicting parties in Bosnia release their prisoners by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC arranged the Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs to
release more than 500 prisoners Monday, but the plan failed
because of the refusal of the Muslim-led government.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian government said that there would be no release of
Serbs unless thousands of missing Muslims were accounted for and
released.

<HEADLINE> Mexico to Produce More Crude Oil for U.S. in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Pemex, Mexico's state-owned
petroleum company, will increase its crude oil production by 10
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Pemex was quoted today by the local press as saying it will
export 42 percent of its total crude oil production to the United
States this year, but no increase in domestic consumption is
expected.
</P>
<P>
It said 47.5 percent of its 2.86 million barrels of oil to be
produced daily in 1996 will be earmarked for the national market
and 10.5 percent will serve to satisfy the needs of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Pemex's petroleum to be sold to the United States in 1996 will
be 84 percent more than that of 1986 when it reached 652,300
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
However, Pemex's oil exports to some other countries have
declined in the past five years. Spain, for example, acquired 7.8
percent of its crude oil exports last year compared with 11.8
percent in 1994 and 18.1 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Japan received 5.7 percent of Mexico's crude oil exports in
1995 versus 6.2 percent in 1994 and 10.1 percent in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Taiwanese investors Favor Port City of Dalian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The port city of Dalian in
northeast China's Liaoning Province has become an investment hot
spot for business people from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Taiwan is Dalian's third-largest investment partner,
after Hong Kong and Japan. Taiwan-invested firms are scattered in
all the 11 cities, counties and districts of Dalian.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that in 1995 the number of newly-approved
Taiwan-invested firms in the city stood at 80, concluding
contracts worth over one billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year the total number of Taiwan-funded firms
in the city had exceeded 500, with a total investment of 1.1
billion US dollars with pledged investment from Taiwan reaching
550 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
All the three figures rank first in northeast China and seventh
in the whole country after the cities along the coast in southeast
China which are geographically close to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Of the 500 firms, 35 involve investment of five million US
dollars each, while two of the 35 involve over 100 million US
dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan investors have particular interest in a dozen fields
such as machinery, processing, foodstuffs and electronics.
</P>
<P>
Investment in agriculture has also seen an upswing in recent
years. Statistics showed that Taiwanese businessmen have launched
nearly 30 projects in farming, animal husbandry and aquatic
production in Dalian, leading all cities in northeast China in
number of such projects.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Taiwanese investors have been rewarded with good
economic returns, local officials said, adding that some firms
have become "export giants".
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of the investment environment, a better
understanding of mainland policies and encouraged by success in
the initial stage, some investors have increased their financial
input into Dalian. Investment in building materials, color
printing, metals, electronics, processing and foodstuffs have kept
growing with a strong momentum.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in southwest China plans to use more foreign funds to
accelerate its economic construction, said an official with the
regional government.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a Regional Planning Meeting which closed
here recently.
</P>
<P>
The region plans to make use of 1.2 billion US dollars for this
purpose this year, 30 percent more than in 1995. The funds will
consist of 300 million US dollars in foreign loans and 900 million
US dollars in direct foreign investment, the official said.
</P>
<P>
While the central and regional governments increase their
allocations, the region has to try to attract more foreign
investment and to use it more efficiently, he said.
</P>
<P>
The regional government will try to win more favorable loans
from international financial organizations and foreign
governments, the official said.

The foreign funds will be used for the overall management of
shipping on the Xijiang River, environmental protection projects
and the construction of the Tianshengqiao Hydroelectric Power
Station, the Nanning-Kunming Railway, the Luzhai Fertilizer Plant

In the 1991-1995 period the region made use of 3.2 billion US
dollars, 7.45 times the amount in the 1986-1990 period. The figure
for last year was 914 million US dollars, the official said.

WELLINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Student unemployment in New

The scheme's national director Lindsay Wright said that at the
end of last December, over 23,900 tertiary students registered on

However, more employers contacted the scheme offering work to
students.

would peacefully resolve their differences over the pininsula.
</P>
<P>
The peninsula, which is famous for its strategic location, is
situated at the mouth of Bay of Kotor, an important sea port of
Serbia at the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
Being afraid that the peninsula might be used by Croatia to
harass its ships going in and out of Bay of Kotor, Serbia has been
insisting that the United Nations continue to keep the peninsula
demilitarized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile it has been trying to trade a piece of fertile land
in Bosnia for the peninsula. But so far, Croatia has refused.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission on Prevlaka peninsula started in 1992 with 14
military observers.
</P>
<P>
Under the new resolution, another 14 military observers will be
added to the force. They will stay in the peninsula for a period
of three months and if necessary their mission can be extended for
an additional period of three months.
</P>
<P>
The council also promised in the resolution to consider the
possibility that another international organization may assume the
task of monitoring the demilitarization of the Prevlaka peninsula.

<HEADLINE> US Economy May Get Slow, Economists Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Weak holiday sales coupled
with blizzard and declining confidence may slow the gear of the
U.S. economy for the first quarter this year, according to
economists here.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that December chain-store sales across the
country were extremely weak, despite a post-holiday surge in
response to sharp discounting.
</P>
<P>
The severe snowstorm in the northeast, though only temporary,
and a prolonged government shutdown led by an uncertain budget
deal could shake consumers' confidence, which will be enough to
slow down the economy, some economists said.
</P>
<P>
Economists forecast the growth in the first quarter of this
year to an annual rate of between 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent.
That's down from estimates of roughly 2.25 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
Some experts gave a projection of 2 percent increase rate for
the whole year of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Economists called the attention to the stockpiles of retailers
and factories, which, they said, will continue to force more
retailers to cut prices aggressively.
</P>
<P>
The government shutdown has delayed the release of most
official economic reports.
</P>
<P>
Statistics revealed by the New York Times indicated that
inventories have built up dramatically in the past two years, with
a value of between 35 billion U.S. dollars and 40 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Retailers have been unable to boost prices for at least two
years, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In December, retailers laid off more hands than any other
industry -- 7,744 workers in number -- even though retailers
were entering the crucial holiday selling season.
</P>
<P>
The reduced profit margins will make companies hesitate to
expand investment and slash the number of employees, experts
said. Starting from Tuesday, AT&AMP;T will start its first wave of
lay-off which will lead to a cut of 13 percent of its employees in
three years.
</P>
<P>
According to Joseph Ritter, a senior economist at the Federal
Reserve Bank, employment growth rate now stands at only 1 percent.
But he said that a drop in jobs growth is not necessarily a
harbinger of a recession.
</P>
<P>
It is widely accepted that recessions are not likely to occur
during presidential election years, because the government will
usually take measures to ease the financial sector and cut taxes
to win more votes. But it has become harder for the president this
time because of the unsettled budget deal.

<HEADLINE> UN Sets up New Peace-keeping Operation in Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council
today decided to establish a United Nations peace-keeping
operation for the territories of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and
Western Sirmium in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The peace-keeping operation named "United Nations Transitional
Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium
(UNTAES)" consists of both military and civilian components for an
initial period of 12 months, according to a resolution adopted
unanimously at the council this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed its support for the Basic
Agreement on the region signed on November 12, 1995, between the
Government of Croatia and the local Serbian community.
</P>
<P>
The military component of UNTAES should consist of a force with
an initial deployment of up to 5,000 troops, according to the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Their mandates included supervising and facilitating the
demilitarization as undertaken by the parties to the Basic
Agreement; monitoring the voluntary and safe return of refugees
and displaced persons to their home of origin; contributing to the
maintenance of peace and security in the region; and otherwise
assisting in implementation of the Basic Agreement, according to
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The civilian component of UNTAES would have the mandates of
establishing a temporary police force; undertaking tasks relating
to civil administration; undertaking tasks relating to the
functioning of public services; facilitating the return of
refugees; organizing elections and certifying the results;
assisting in the coordination of plans for the development and
economic reconstruction of the region and undertaking other
activities described in the UN Secretary-General's report on
December 13, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also decided that, at the request of
UNTAES and on the basis of procedures communicated to the United
Nations, Member States may take all necessary measures, including
close air support, in defense of UNTAES.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, said at the council that the main task of UNTAES was to
assist the parties concerned in implementing the Basic Agreement
and its action should be strictly restricted to what was requested
in the Basic Agreement.
</P>
<P>
"At present, the two Croatian parties have clearly pledged
cooperation and the military component of the Transitional
Administration will be mainly engaged in monitoring and assisting
demilitarization. Under such circumstances, it is not necessary to
invoke Chapter VII in the authorization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, the use of close air support as appropriate in case
of lack of enough manpower in peace-keeping operations should be
limited to self-defense. Peace-keeping forces should not use force
indiscriminately, still less make it a means of retaliation," Qin
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Major reminded of facing Possible Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major was reminded today that he would still be possibly
challenged as leader of the Tory party this year.
</P>
<P>
According to reports here, Marcus Fox, chairman of the Tory
backbench 1922 committee, said that the current system, which
allows a party leadership contest each Autumn if 10 percent of
Tory parliament members demand one, remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that both Major and his predecessor, Baroness
Thatcher, had asked for a change to render a prime minister in
office immune from annual mutiny.
</P>
<P>
Fox said that although new rules were being considered, there
was no reason to reach a hasty decision.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Tory parliament members were consigned
today to another bout of leadership jitters as omens are not
favorable for the embattled Major.
</P>
<P>
With two by-elections pending in seats, the Tory party is very
likely to be defeated, and with some parliament members in poor
health, the government is generally considered to lose majority in
the House of Commons this year.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed that the prime minister would preside over a
special campaign strategy meeting of the cabinet next week, in
which, plans, policies and prospects for the next general
elections would be discussed.
</P>
<P>
But the cabinet members would also face up to the more
immediate hurdle of the local elections in May.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that the Conservatives could lose up to 700 of
the 1,000 local seats they are contesting. And that, in turn,
could kindle new doubt over Major's leadership.

<HEADLINE> (Updated) Greek PM Submits Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Andreas
Papandreou submitted his resignation tonight after nearly two
months' hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the Central Committee of the ruling
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) and the PASOK Party
parliamentary group, Papandreou said,"the first responsibility" of
the Party is the effective governing of the country and
safeguarding of the unity and future of the movement.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that my incapacity during this time should not
act as a break on the country, the government and PASOK. I have
put, and we have always put, the interests of the country and the
people above all," the 76-year-old PASOK leader and three-time
prime minister of the Socialist governments said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Following Papandreou's resignation, the Party's Executive
Bureau decided to bring forward the Party's Central Committee
meeting, scheduled for the weekend, to this coming Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The setting of a date and time for a meeting of parliamentary
group for the election of a new prime minister is expected any

<HEADLINE> US, DPRK Discuss Issue On MIAs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the United
States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have met to
discuss a joint mission to recover the remains of thousands of
American servicemen killed in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
During a four-day talks which ended on Sunday in Honolulu, the
two sides seriously discussed the joint effort, but failed to lead
to an agreement, because two members in the seven-men DPRK
delegation opposed a joint mission, the New York Times today
quoted U.S. officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
After all, the talks were the first of their kind since the
Korean War ended in 1953, and the meeting was seen as a
significant diplomatic development.
</P>
<P>
About 8,100 American servicemen are listed as missing in action
during the Korean War. The DPRK has so far returned 208 sets of
remains to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK had submitted a bill for 4 million dollars for the
remains returned in 1993 and 1994 before the talks began, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the U.S. delegation, led by Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense James Wold, offered the DPRK delegation 1
million dollars to settle the bill they submitted.
</P>
<P>
Kim Byong Hong, who heads the foreign policy division of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, led the DPRK delegation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the frustrating conclusion of the talks, "the door is
open" for talks in the future, said a member of the American
delegation.

<P>
LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian federal government
today in Lagos filed an application challenging the federal high
court's jurisdiction to hear any suit on the executions of Ken
Saro-wiwa and eight others.
</P>
<P>
The nine men were hanged on November 10, 1995, after being
found guilty of murdering four Ogoni leaders.
</P>
<P>
After the executions, a Lagos lawyer, Gani Fwehinmi, filed a
suit at the federal high court seeking a declaration that the
executions were "illegal".
</P>
<P>
In its objection, the federal government said that section 8
of the civil disturbance decree, under which a specil tribunal
was formed to try the nine, precludes courts from entertaining
any inquiries on the validity of its decision, or confirmation of
its sentences.
</P>
<P>
The federal government also claimed that the supremacy and
enforcement of powers Decree No. 12 also ousts the jurisdiction
of the court from entertaining the action.
</P>
<P>
Jutice Obafemi Aina adjourned the case till January 30.

LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian armed forces today
in capital Abuja rounded off this year's remembrance day
celebrations with a special parade mounted by 17 officers and 200
men from the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Nigerian head of state General Sani Abacha
laid a wreath at the memorial arcade as a mark of respect for the
"unknown soldier".
</P>
<P>
Among those present on the occasion were the Chief of General
Staff, Lt.-General Oladipo Diya and other military leaders.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony featured prayers, the observance of a two-minute
silence in honour of the souls of the departed soldiers and the
release of pigeons symbolising peace.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces remembrance day is marked on January 15 every
year. It used to be marked on November 11 until the Obsanjo
administration adopted the new date in 1978 to reflect the
nation's peculiar history.
</P>
<P>
On January 15, 1966, the Nigerian military marched into the
centre stage of Nigeria's politics, with the late Maj. Chukwuma
Kaduna Nzeogu leading a coup against the first republic
government of then Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Dissidents Raid Bus in Mozambique: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Armed men raided a bus on the
no. 1 highway in central Sofala province last Friday, killing one
passenger, the Mozambican News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was the second incident of armed raid in Sofala, and
police considered that it was committed by Zimbabwean dissidents.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, ten gunmen attacked three buses on the same
road, resulting in one dead and three wounded.
</P>
<P>
Police said the Tuesday raid was committed by Zimbabwean
dissidents together with individual Mozambican Resistance
Movement members. Police ran across these guys in Manica Province
last Saturday, and killed eight after exchange of fire.
</P>
<P>
Armed Zimbabwean dissidents crossed into Mozambique and
settled in Manica a year ago. After setting up headquarters in
former camps of the Resistance Movement, they have time and again
infiltrated into Zimbabwe to carry out sabotage and armed raids.
Officials of the two countries have met to discuss the issue but
have found no solution so far.
