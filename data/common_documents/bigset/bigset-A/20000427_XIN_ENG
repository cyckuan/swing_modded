the first of its kind in more than a decade, will be hosted in
India between October and November 2001, a joint press release by

The decision to hold the exhibition was a result of an official

With a theme of "The Living Religious and Cultural Tradition of

According to the initial schedule, the exhibition will be held

Singh and several other Indian cabinet members during his 10-day
stay, the release said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Reaffirms Help to Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Japan reiterated its pledge to
extend cooperation to Bangladesh and expressed the hope that the
South Asian country will soon cross the least-developed country (
LDC) period through economic development, a senior Japanese
official told reporters here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Bangladesh at the head of a 10-member consultation
delegation, Yutaka Yokoi, director of the loan aid division in the
Economic Cooperation Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
said many factors contribute to the positive attitude of Japan in
its commitment for economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan has formulated country aid plan (CAP) in
conformity with Overseas Development Assistance Charter of 1992
for Bangladesh, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Egypt, Ghana,
Kenya, Tanzania and Peru.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthening relations with Bangladesh will contribute to
Japan's relations with the LDCs and also to political stability in
South Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out priority areas for Japanese assistance, Yokoi said
projects related to agriculture, rural development, productivity
improvement, improvement of basic living standards, health care,
basic infrastructure for investment and export promotion and
disaster management were earmarked as the key issues to be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
However, he said a 0.2 percent cut was made in the overseas
development assistance as Japan is under pressure to ensure
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Yokoi said that until 1998, Japan's overseas development
assistance disbursement to Bangladesh includes 3 billion U.S.
dollars as loan aid and 2.8 billion dollars in the form of grant
aid and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said a Japanese appraisal mission will arrive in Dhaka in
early May to evaluate and determine the volume of assistance for
Bangladesh in the next fiscal year.

the one in Beihai Park is in the middle in business volume.

<HEADLINE> Official Calls MPF Crucial Step in Providing Retirement Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of the
Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) schemes in December this year is an
important step in providing the workforce with a retirement
protection system, a Hong Kong official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon hosted by the Rotary Club, MPF Executive
Director Hendena Yu said the introduction of MPF "will mean that
for the first time in Hong Kong, employers will be required by law
to make contributions for their employees' retirement benefits."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the workforce will also have to save for their old
age," she said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to suggestions that the MPF system should be
deferred, Yu reiterated that it was not in the interest of
employees to delay the system.
</P>
<P>
"MPF schemes are long-term investments and in order to
accumulate a sufficient amount of funds to meet their needs after
retirement, it is important for employers, employees and self-
employed persons to start making contributions as early as
practicable.
</P>
<P>
"Delaying the commencement of MPF contributions would only
reduce the amount of funds available at retirement," she said.
</P>
<P>
Yu also stressed that the MPF was never meant to replace the
existing Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) Scheme.
</P>
<P>
"We consider that MPF and CSSA are indeed complementary to each
other in protecting the old," she said.
</P>
<P>
"With the introduction of MPF, Hong Kong will have in place all
the three retirement protection 'pillars' recommended by the World
Bank, namely a mandatory, privately managed retirement protection
system, a publicly financed social security system and voluntary
personal savings and insurance," she added.

<HEADLINE> Leaving Imperial Park Understandable: Kentucky Fried Chicken (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kentucky Fried Chicken
Corporation today expressed its understanding at having to leave
Beijing's famed imperial-era Beihai Park.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jianzhong, a spokesman for the corporation, said here
that it is a normal business procedure for the Beijing Municipal
Administration of Parks and Gardens to discontinue the company's
contract to operate in the park when it expires in 2002, saying, "
We have no doubt about that."
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Administration of Parks and Gardens
recently decided in order to maintain the integrated imperial
style of Beihai Park, the fast food restaurant should move from
the park when its seven-year contract runs out.
</P>
<P>
This decision is based on a proposal by the Beijing Municipal
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference.
</P>
<P>
An official of the administration said that in the future, no
foreign fast food restaurants will be permitted to operate in the
city's imperial-era parks, because their presence clashes with the
classic environment.
</P>
<P>
A taxi driver named Liu said that the government's decision is
right, suggesting that all those buildings not fit for these
imperial parks should be removed.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Refutes U.S., British Allegations Over Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 27 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi military spokesman on
Thursday refuted allegations made by the U.S. and Britain that they
bombed only military targets Tuesday in the no-fly zones in
southern and northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the spokesman said that facts have proved that
the U.S. and British warplanes on Tuesday bombed civilian
facilities such as villages and filling stations, resulting in the
death of a driver who was driving a water-carrying truck.
</P>
<P>
The truck driver, identified as Tahsein Hussein Mohammad, was
killed Tuesday when the U.S. and British planes bombed two
villages, Al-Erbeid and Abu Nashka, in addition to the Al-Eidan
filling station in the northern Neiveva province.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the continued aggressions of the U.S.
and Britain will not suppress the Iraqi people's will of
steadfastness to challenge the aggressors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long claimed the U.S. and British planes patrol and
bomb civilian and service facilities in the two so-called no-fly
zones.
</P>
<P>
A total of 295 civilians have been killed and 860 others injured
in the regular bombings of the U.S. and British planes on Iraq
since December 1998, said Iraq in letters to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and president of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have maintained that their planes bomb only
military targets in the no-fly zones and have been trying to
minimize the potential for collateral damage and risk to civilians.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British aircraft use bases in Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait to mount their patrols of the southern no-fly zone which was
set up after the 1991 Gulf War by the U.S. and Britain with their
claimed aim of protecting the region's Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
A similar air exclusion zone, patrolled from Turkey, was imposed
over northern Iraq to protect the Kurdish community there as
claimed.

<HEADLINE> Chissano: Southern Africa Needs More Investments in Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries need
more investments to better its infrastructures with catastrophe-
preventing system at first, said Mozambican President Joaquim
Alberto Chissano in Berlin Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chissano attended the "African Economy Forum 2000" here,
leading delegates from 12 Southern African Development Community(
SADC) countries.
</P>
<P>
The African delegation included Botswana President Festus G.
Mogae, Lesotho Prime Minister Mosisili, Mauritius Prime Minister
Ramgoolam, King Maswati III of Swaziland, as well as ministers
from Angola, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said the most devastating flood in his country last
month had killed 700 people and affected over 2 million.
</P>
<P>
"The damages were by far extensive because the country lack a
viable system of prevention," he said, adding that Mozambique had
planned to build a few dams to prevent floods but was unable to
proceed while lack of financial resources.
</P>
<P>
In less favored countries such as Namibia and Botswana the
loss will be more huge if they are hit by floods, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chissano urged more western investment into the region's
infrastructure, including transport, communication, energy and
water, to help creating sustainable environment.
</P>
<P>
Although SADC countries have made progress in their macro
economic reforms and their finance are healthy, foreign
investments in the region remain in low level especially compared
with Asia and Latin America, said Chissano.

<P>
LIMA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian ambassador to Peru Valentin
Bogomasov said Thursday that the election of Vladimir Putin as
president of Russia promises more trade between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The Russian diplomat said that bilateral relation with Peru
will intensify because Putin's presidency represents the
continuity of the policy of promotion of trade relations with
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Peru is seen by Russia as an strategic partner for its
geographical location and of great importance for the increase of
Russian exports and imports to and from the region, according to
Bogomasov.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian businessmen are interested in buying fish meal,
seafood, cotton, handicrafts, and Peruvian textile products.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian-Russian trade exchanges amount to 60 million U.S.
dollars, of which 35 million dollars give Russia an edge, although
there is a positive trend in the increase of Peruvian exports to
that country.
</P>
<P>
Bogomasov said that the visit of Peruvian Fishing Minister
Cesar Luna Victoria is being prepared to let him know the
potential of the exports of fish meal to Russia.

<HEADLINE> Georgia's Accession to NATO Possible: NATO Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Georgia may join the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in the future, said a high-
ranking NATO official in Georgian capital of Tbilisi on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
NATO regards Georgia as an important partner, and it is very
important for NATO to maintain stability in the Caucasian region
where Georgia plays a major role, chairman of the NATO Military
Committee Admiral Guido Venturoni told a news briefing at the
Georgian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and he Wednesday
discussed bilateral cooperation under NATO's Partnership for Peace
program and the possibility of Tbilisi's joining the North
Atlantic Alliance. The sides agreed that Georgia's accession to
NATO would take time.
</P>
<P>
Venturoni arrived in Tbilisi on Wednesday for a three-day visit.
He said the goal of his visit is to support Georgia's involvement
in NATO's Partnership for Peace program.
</P>
<P>
Georgia joined the program in March 1994, since then the
political and military relations between the former soviet
republic and NATO have developed fast.
</P>
<P>
According to the Georgian Defense Ministry, the two sides have
planned nearly 200 joint events in 2000. Georgia has taken part in
NATO's military exercises for nine times. The sides will conduct
more maneuvers on Georgia's territory in the framework of NATO's
Partnership for Peace program this year and in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Georgian defense Minister David Tevsadze told the press that
the visit by the chief NATO military official is very important
for Tbilisi and various questions will be mulled over, in
particular,including the organization of NATO international
military exercises in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
This year Georgia intends to host exercises in which Georgia, U.
S.,Azerbaijan and possibly Armenia will participate, while other
large-scale NATO military exercises are also planned for 2001 in
West Georgia, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Shevardnadze has repeatedly said that Georgia plans
to"knock on NATO's door by 2005" when his second mandate as state
of head ends.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Georgia and Russia held talks in Moscow over the
withdrawal of about 10,000 Russian army servicemen currently
deployed in Georgia. Tbilisi demanded Moscow close all its
military bases in Georgia in three years, the latter agreed to
pull out its units by steps.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Praises Foreign Armed Forces for Aid in Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi Thursday met with representatives of the foreign armed
forces involved in rescue operations in the country during the
February-March flooding to thank them for their work.
</P>
<P>
He told the representatives from South Africa, Malawi, Britain,
Libya, the United States, Spain, the Netherlands and Portugal that
"although previously we did not know each other, all of us,
civilian and military, worked together in good coordination and
harmony and united in the same objective of saving Mozambican
lives."
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi said that in the three weeks of the joint rescue
operation in March, about 26,400 people were saved from the
waters.
</P>
<P>
The foreign military teams also transported 9,430 tons of
humanitarian aid and distributed about 3.5 million litres of clean
drinking, he said.
</P>
<P>
He observed that military medic staff, particularly from Spain,
were also involved. They treated about 6,000 patients and carried
out 43 surgical operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the foreign military aircraft
had been flying for over 5,000 hours, and the costs of this are
estimated at 25 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi recognized that for any government, "it is not easy to
send its armed forces to other countries, even for humanitarian
missions. The missions are risky and they involve high logistical
and financial costs."
</P>
<P>
He told the representatives that the Mozambican government was
very pleased "at the massive public support in your countries for
your mission in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"So apart from your armies, you represent the solidarity of
your peoples with the Mozambique people," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the lessons learned from this operation could be
used to help Mozambique and the entire southern African region
face future disasters effectively.
</P>
<P>
This involved the capacity building of Mozambique's own defense
force, the FADM (forca armada de defensa mozanbicana), which
should have a key role to play whenever disasters strike, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi expressed the hope that those present at the meeting
would help Mozambique develop its armed forces "so as to make them
a powerful instrument for saving people who fall victim to natural
disasters."
</P>
<P>
"It is our desire to acquire the necessary capacity so that we
can take part in humanitarian missions in other countries, just as
your armies did in Mozambique," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Defense Minister Tobias Dai, in the first phase of
the disaster in February before the foreign military teams
arrived, the FADM had just one helicopter and two light planes for
rescue missions.
</P>
<P>
With these few resources, the Mozambican military rescued
17,612 people, transported 101 tons of cargo and removed 55
corpses, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) Thursday donated two passenger planes to the Tanzania
People's Defense Forces (TPDF).
</P>
<P>
A TPDF statement said that the two planes, Antonov 28 with a
capacity of carrying 17 passengers, two pilots and a one-ton
cargo, were handed over to Tanzanian Defense Minister Edgar
Maokola-Majogo in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Majogo said at a brief ceremony held at Ukonga air base that
the two planes would greatly help in distribution of drugs and
other national commitments of immediate urgency.
</P>
<P>
He commended the UAE for its donation, saying that "the
Tanzanian army has a myriad of aviation issues to handle but is
handicapped by shortage of planes."
</P>
<P>
UAE representative Colonel Hussein Al Moalla said that his
country would also look into possibilities of providing spare
parts for the planes.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not mention the total value of the planes. It
is reported that Tanzania has an air force of some 4,000-men with
a small amount of military planes including fighters and
transportation planes.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes 3 Tons of Narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's security forces seized about
three tons of various narcotic drugs last week in the eastern
Kerman Province, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The drugs were seized from passing vehicles and during an armed
clash with the drug traffickers in northern and southern parts of
the province, said Brigadier General Abbasali Rouhi, provincial
commander of the security forces.
</P>
<P>
A number of vehicles and motorbikes were among the confiscated
items, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a main transit route for drugs smuggled from neighboring
Pakistan and Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer, to
Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
It started strict anti-drug campaigns in 1989 after the Iranian
Majlis, or parliament, passed an anti-drug law authorizing capital
punishment for drug traffickers.

<HEADLINE> Israel Should Withdraw Completely From Lebanon: U. N. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel should pull its troops
completely out of south Lebanon in the planned withdrawal this
July, U.N. Middle East Special Envoy Terje Larsen stressed here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy Thursday
afternoon, the visiting envoy said that the pullback should be
implemented to the 1923 international border between Israel and
Lebanon, with no Israeli positions remaining in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Larsen also confirmed that a team of senior advisors and legal
experts accompanying with him would try to finalize the issue of
the redeployment line with Israeli defense establishment officials
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The envoy, dispatched by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
arrived in Israel earlier in the day to begin his "fact-finding
tour" to the Middle East region, lasting from April 27 to May 9.
</P>
<P>
Focusing his works on ensuring a quiet Israeli withdrawal from
Lebanon, he is also due to visit Lebanon and a number of relevant
countries in the region, including Syria, Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Larsen is scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Thursday evening to discuss all these issues regarding the
withdrawal, such as the redeployment line, the presence of U.N.
peacekeeping forces in areas evacuated by Israel, and the exact
pullback timetable.
</P>
<P>
On March 5, Israeli cabinet agreed to withdraw Israel Defense
Forces (IDF) from the so-called security zone in south Lebanon,
which was set up by Israel in 1985 to prevent cross-border
guerrilla attacks against its north, by July as Barak had pledged.
</P>
<P>
Since then, some military experts were worrying of the possible
escalating Lebanese guerrillas' dangerous infiltration into Israeli
settlements along the international border after the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
In a pullback plan prepared by IDF General Staff Lt.Gen. Shaul
Mofaz, code-named "Morning Twilight", Israeli troops will withdraw
to the borderline before its invasion into Lebanon in 1978, leaving
some large outposts in Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
However, most Israeli politicians, including Barak, believed
such a withdrawal should be wrapped in international legitimacy
under the U.N. Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426 to leave
the responsibility for keeping peace along the border on the
shoulders of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The two resolutions, passed in 1978, call for an immediate and
unconditional Israeli pullout from all Lebanese territories and a
return of full sovereignty to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Levy sent a letter to Annan on April 17 to formally notify the
U.N. that it would complete the withdrawal from Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
Israel officials are garnering Annan's support in the past weeks
for extending the mandate of the current U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) to the whole security zone to fill the security
vacuum left by the departing IDF.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong peacekeeping troops, established in 1978 on the
basis of Resolution 425 from nine countries, are currently deployed
primarily in the western and central sectors of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the outbreak of the 1982 Lebanon War, UNIFIL was
authorized to expand to 7,000 personnel. Although this was never
implemented, some legal experts had argued that the precedent could
be used to meet future requirements.
</P>
<P>
Larsen is expected to meet with senior officers of the UNIFIL in
Jerusalem to define the possible expansion of the U.N. peacekeeping
mission.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Provides 83 Million Dollars in Grants to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 27 (Xinhua)-- The United States has agreed to
provide 83 million U.S. dollars in grants to Jordan to help the
kingdom build and innovate water projects and improve the
management system in the water sector.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the grants was signed here on Thursday by
Jordan's Minister of Trade, Industry and Supply Mohammed Halayka
and U.S. Ambassador to Amman William Burns on behalf of their
governments.
</P>
<P>
The grant was the first portion of an overall U.S. economic
assistance package for the kingdom in the year 2000, which is
expected to total 200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the U.S. government will provide 83 million
dollars to develop and implement urgently-needed water projects in
the southern harbor city Aqaba, Amman and other big cities.
</P>
<P>
Amman itself reported a yearly shortage of 250 million cubic
meters of fresh water and water leakage remained largely unchecked
in the capital city due to its ageing pipe system and poor
management.
</P>
<P>
The new grant was also part of an on-going five-year and 400-
million-dollar U.S. aid package to the kingdom, which was launched
in 1997, to improve management and facilities in the water sector.
</P>
<P>
Washington takes Jordan as an ally in the Arab world after it
signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, the second Arab country
after Egypt to strike such a peace deal with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
It has been steadily increasing its economic and financial
assistances to the kingdom in recent years to award its role as a
major peace broker between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government provided some 300 million dollars in various
economic and military aid packages to the kingdom in 1999.

<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A group of Jewish demonstrators
and Israeli police clashed Thursday with the Palestinians in East
Jerusalem while the two sides scuffled over a piece of land that
the Jewish demonstrators tried to take over.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, senior Palestinian official in charge of
Jerusalem affairs, said the Israeli police punched him when he
tried to stop the Jewish demonstrators from entering the land.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish demonstrators, led by Knesset (parliament) member
Benny Elon, tried to enter the cave on the spot and take over the
land.
</P>
<P>
Husseini and a number of members of the Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) rushed to the scene to prevent the Jewish protestors
from entering the site.
</P>
<P>
The two sides then clashed with each other.
</P>
<P>
Later, Husseini and the PLC members as well as local
Palestinians staged a sit-in at the site.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Appoints New Deputy Chief of Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Major General Moshe Ya'alon,
Commander of Israel's Central Command, had been promoted to Deputy
Chief of General Staff, Israel Defense Forces spokesman announced
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ya'alon will replace his predecessor Major General Uzi Dayan in
the next few months, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Dayan, also a former central commander, was once considered as
the most promising candidate to succeed the current Chief of
General Staff Shaul Mofaz after the Lieutenant General's term ends
in July 2001.
</P>
<P>
Dayan is a relative of Moshe Dayan, one of Israel's founding
fathers and a military legend.
</P>
<P>
He has been serving in his current position since July 1998 and
is expected to finish his three-year term in September. According
to the IDF tradition, the popular general should be given another
term before his possible promotion.
</P>
<P>
However, Mofaz managed to persuade Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak earlier in the month to adopt his plan to explore more
candidates as his successors.
</P>
<P>
In the plan, Mofaz would switch deputies in his midterm to
ensure that there will be more than one name to be placed on the
table of decision-maker to decide his replacement.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Mofaz and Dayan had a chilly relationship,
which was the real drive behind Mofaz's proposal.
</P>
<P>
However, Mofaz denied the report by saying "My considerations
regarding the replacement of Uzi Dayan are totally free of any
personal considerations and are completely pertinent."

ANKARA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Black Sea and
Danube Commission began a two-day meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, on
Thursday to further their anti-pollution cooperation, reported
the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania
and Georgia attended the meeting which is being held within the
framework of the Bucharest Agreement signed in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Fugen Ok, Chairperson of the commission and an official of the
Turkish Foreign Ministry, urged an agreement on setting up a
permanent secretariat to make sure that the Bucharest Agreement is
fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
She said that Turkey wants the secretariat to be based in
Istanbul or in a Russian city if other countries prefer it.
</P>
<P>
Ok also asked the participants to seek ways to raise anti-
pollution funds to meet the demand of the projects required under
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Littoral states of the Black Sea have in recent years made big
efforts in order to achieve wide-ranging cooperation in the fields
of sea traffic control, safety of passage, environmental pollution
monitoring, search and rescue, humanitarian assistance and the
monitoring and protecting of fishing fleets.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Judge Rejects Request to Delay Lockerbie Trial Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A Scottish judge on Thursday
rejected a request from prosecution to postpone the trial of two
Libyan suspects for the 1988 Lockerbie airliner bombing.
</P>
<P>
Presiding Judge Lord Ranald Sutherland said: "I am not
satisfied that a postponement is necessary."
</P>
<P>
"I should feel obliged to refuse the request," he added.
</P>
<P>
The judge based his decision on the fact that the accused had
already been in custody for 416 days, an unprecedented length of
time under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution now has 48 hours to appeal against the refusal.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had sought a delay to the scheduled start on May 3
of the long-awaited trial, because of surprise defense plans to
produce 119 witnesses from a range of countries. Prosecutors had
wanted the trial to be delayed until June 28.
</P>
<P>
The ruling by the Scottish judge followed two delays since
Libya extradited the defendants on April 5, 1999, to face charges
in the mid-air bombing. Each of those delays was at the request
of the defense.
</P>
<P>
Sutherland agreed last December to postpone the trial by three
months to May after the defense said it needed more time because
of the huge amount of evidence and witnesses involved.
</P>
<P>
At a pre-trial hearing, lawyers for Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and
Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima revealed plans to try to prove that others
were involved in the bombing of a Boeing 747 airliner over the
Scottish village of Lockerbie on December 21 of 1988, killing 259
aboard and 11 others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
A three-year investigation concluded to obtain a warrant for
the arrest of the two Libyan suspects, both staff of the Libyan
Arab Airlines in Malta in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The hearing was at Camp Zeist, a former United States military
base ceded to Britain by the Netherlands for the trial.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal brokered by the United Nations last year, Libya
handed over the two men to stand trial in the Netherlands under
Scottish law.

<HEADLINE> Gene-based Pharmaceuticals Promise Immortality Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Two of Canada's largest drug
companies are working toward "virtual immortality to coming
generations" and urging governments to assess how well therapies
work to contain costs and maximize benefits.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail newspaper reported Thursday that the Tronto-
based Glaxo Wellcome Inc. and the Montreal-based Merck Frosst
Canada &AMP; Co. hold the promise that future generations could live
for 200 years with the development of drugs that are designed to
prevent illness and aging.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Glaxo's vice-president Michael Levy as
saying advances in genetics will soon allow pharmaceutical
companies to develop such drugs.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, designer drugs could be tailored to specific
individuals based on their genetic makeup.
</P>
<P>
Companies such as Glaxo are already working on the development
of identity cards that would contain a person's genetic code and
its medical implications, he said.
</P>
<P>
But with the development of the new drugs, there will arise
complex ethical, legal and social issues, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Among those issues is how society will pay for the enormously
expensive task of developing such genetically based
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
The brand-name drug companies are expected to invest 1 billion
Canadian dollars (about 678 million U.S. dollars) in medical
research this year.

<HEADLINE> CBI Warns Recession Alarm For Manufacturers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Confidence among UK manufacturers
is falling for the first time in a year,according to the latest
survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
The CBI's quarterly survey found that business confidence,
export orders and employment levels had all fallen in the last
quarter - alarming signs that the recovery in the manufacturing
sector has stalled.
</P>
<P>
The warning came as further weakness in the euro sent the pound
to a 14-year high of 111.9 in index terms - up from 111.4
overnight and 107 at the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
The results have led to renewed calls for the Bank of England
not to raise interest rates again at next week's monetary policy
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Describing the survey's results as depressing, Nick Reilly,
head of the CBI's economic affairs committee,highlighted a
collapse in investment intentions which he said was particularly
worrying.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the Bank of England to hold interest rates
unchanged, claiming that the economy was now showing signs of
slowing and that a rate rise would risk pushing the pound higher
still.
</P>
<P>
Reilly said: "There is now an opportunity for the Bank of
England to leave interest rates on hold, indicating that they have
peaked, and encouraged a decline in the exchange rate."

PARIS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The French government has decided
to strengthen the teaching of literature in public high schools by
increasing classes of French, literature, history, foreign
languages, and ancient languages like Latin and Greek.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a package of reform proposals for schools, the new

wants to give ``an attractive character'' to the literature
classes which have been losing its importance in the schools for
years.
</P>
<P>
The obligatory hours for attending classes of French will be
increased from five to six hours each week, while that for
literature will be added to four hours instead of 2.5 hours and
foreign language class given an extra hour.
</P>
<P>
Students can also have two alternative hours of class for Latin
and Greek each week.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Belgian Stripper Gets Suspended Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A former Miss Topless Belgium
was given suspended sentence on Thursday by a French local court
for her role in a poolside sex trap that led to the marriage break-
up of Princess Stephanie of Monaco.
</P>
<P>
Muriel Houteman was given a suspended six-month sentence while
Stephanie de Lisiecki was given one year and Houteman's former
companion Yves Hoogewys was given six months, also suspended,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Houteman was seen frolicking with the princess' then-husband
Daniel Ducruet at a private swimming pool in pictures and videos
taken in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ducruet, who was the princess' bodyguard before they got
married, was banished in disgrace by Monaco's Prince Rainier after
pictures and videos of him with Houteman at a Riviera villa hit
the mass media.
</P>
<P>
De Lisiecki, who claimed to have spent 70,000 French francs(9,
775 U.S. dollars) on plotting the trap and sold his pictures for
250,000 francs (34,910 dollars), has admitted organizing the trap.
</P>
<P>
Houteman said that she had no idea that she was being used as
part of the trap.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian stripper and de Lisiecki were ordered to jointly
pay Ducruet 200,000 francs (27,930 dollars) in damages for
breaching the intimacy of his private life.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Rejects Accusations Against Its Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States software
company Microsoft on Thursday dismissed suggestions that its
Windows 2000 operating system has broken the European Union's
competition rules.
</P>
<P>
The company, already facing the threat of being split up in two
after anti-trust problems in the United States, was responding to
an investigation by the European Commission, the executive body of
the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The commission is investigating whether the software could give
the American company a stranglehold over server software and
ultimately electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
John Frank, Microsoft's senior director for European law and
corporate affairs, told the press on Thursday that Microsoft's
competitors had complained just before the launch of Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
The commission launched in February a probe into Windows 2000
after complaints that Microsoft had designed parts of the new
operating system in a way which would allow it to extend its
dominance in personal computer operating systems to server
operating systems and ultimately electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
Mario Monti, European Union commissioner for competition, said
that the new operating system is designed "in a way which permits
only Microsoft products to be fully interoperable".
</P>
<P>
If the allegations against the American software company were
proven, the commission could force the company to make changes to
Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under EU rules, if a company refuses to come into line it could
face fines of up to 10 percent of its worldwide revenues though
such a fine has never been levied before.
</P>
<P>
A United States judge ruled on April 3 that Microsoft had
violated the U.S. anti-trust laws by abusing a monopoly it held in
personal computer operating systems.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands on Thursday
kicked off an assortment of measures aimed at drawing students and
small businesses to the Internet and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
A total of 710 million U.S. dollars will be spent on 12,000
Dutch schools to encourage the use of computer network services.
</P>
<P>
"We have moved up from the 23rd place to eighth for Internet
education," said Dutch Education Minister Loek Hermans. "But we
need to be number one."
</P>
<P>
The Dutch government is also spending 2.9 million dollars on
launching an e-commerce awareness campaign among small and medium-
sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Dutch newspapers, radio and television advertisements will urge
firms to embrace business-to-business or B2B e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Government authorities said that only one in five small and
medium-sized enterprises in the country now sells their products
and services via the computer network, with a further 14 percent
saying that they have planned to do so.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of information technology is enormous," said
Dutch Economy Minister Annemarie Jorrtsma. "But we are not all
taking advantage of them. If we compare ourselves with Sweden and
Finland we have some ground to make up."
</P>
<P>
The education and awareness-raising campaign will also cover
such areas as justice and transport. The campaign is called"
Netherlands goes digital".

Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Thursday called on the world's donor
countries to forgive immediately the debt of poor countries that
have a viable plan for achieving the goal of education for all.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, Carol
Bellamy, Executive Director of UNICEF, urged delegates and the
international community to accelerate efforts to ensure that
education plans and programs receive adequate support.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said the efforts can only succeed with the active
support of all sectors of society -- families and communities,
governments and funding agencies, service providers of all sectors,
the media, the private sector and civil society.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Bellamy urged the Forum to try to ensure that
all children are in school by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy urged that five key areas be embraced by the 1,500
participants of the Forum: enrich early child care and learning,
reach excluded children, enhance girls' education, improve
education quality and restore education in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
The Forum is the largest meeting on education since the 1990
World Conference on education for All, which aimed to achieve
education for all by 2000. The Dakar meeting is expected to reset
the target of quality basic education for all children to the year
2015 and to end disparities between girls and boys in school by
2005.

<HEADLINE> NATO Needs New Strategy to Employ Force: Clark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The western military alliance
needs a new strategy for using force in future crisis environment,
said Wesley Clark on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. army general, speaking at his final press conference
before handing over May 3 to U.S. air force general Joseph Ralston
the NATO command in Europe, said: "We need a new strategy where
there is better appreciation for the proper way to employ force in
the post-Cold War environment."
</P>
<P>
"Once the threshold is crossed to employ force, then force
should be employed as rapidly and decisively as possible," the
outgoing general added.
</P>
<P>
NATO began bombing the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia last
March 24 in the hope that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
would soon concede to international demands but the air campaign
lasted 78 days though with radical reinforcements from the 19-
nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The general said that the Balkans where NATO has got almost 70,
000 troops on the ground as peacekeepers would remain the main
challenge for his successor as it had been for him.
</P>
<P>
But the American admitted that the military mission would only
succeed unless the international effort on the political front is
a success.
</P>
<P>
"I think that will remain the principal challenge for the(NATO)
headquarters," Clark said.

<HEADLINE> British and Irish PMs to Host Northern Ireland Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern are scheduled to hold talks
in London next week with parties concerned to the deadlocked
Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman said Thursday that the talks will be
held on next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Ahern will hold separate meetings with members of
Sinn Fein, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the largest Protestant
party in the British province, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace accord reached in 1998 came into
jeopardy in February when Britain suspended the province's
Protestant-Catholic coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Britain took the action on the grounds that the Irish
Republican Army had failed to disarm.
</P>
<P>
Both London and Dublin are now cautiously confident that they
can revive peace process.
</P>
<P>
"This is a continuation of the discussions begun before Easter
on how we can move the peace process forward. There was the
understanding there would be an intensification after Easter,"
Blair's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Blair flew to Northern Ireland last week to meet Northern
Ireland politicians and then travelled on to Dublin to see Ahern.
</P>
<P>
The two men met in London again last Thursday in a signal they
intend to launch a new push to seal lasting peace in the province.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Classmates To Go to United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The group is made up of four Elian's classmates, two girls and
two boys, and three mothers, a father and a pediatrician, who
accompany the minors.
</P>
<P>
Castro said in a brief chat with the press that he is confident
that the children's trip will contribute to Elian's rehabilitation,
who together with his father, his step mother, and baby brother
remains in the Wye Plantation residence, in Washington's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban boy joined his cousin Yasmany Betancourt and his
kindergarten teacher Agueda Fleitas in Wye Plantation, who
traveled Wednesday from Havana, via Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Elian Gonzaloes survived in November a wreckage of immigrants,
in which his mother and stepfather drowned, after being picked up
off the Florida coast, and was given in custody to some far-
removed relatives who live in Miami.
</P>
<P>
These relatives refused to hand the boy over to his father Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, who lives in the island, and after a five-month
controversy, he was pulled out of the house in Miami in a U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service flash operation.
</P>
<P>
The boy joined then his father, who had traveled to Washington,
and now they must await for the decision of an Atlanta Court of
Appeals, which will decide May 11 on a request of political asylum
for Elian filed by the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
The retention of Elian in the United States, considered a
kidnapping by the Cuban authorities, created a wave of
demonstrations in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban authorities considered sending a group of children,
Elian's classmates, for the psychological recovery of the minor.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Implements Environmental Support Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's implementation of the
Environmental Support Program (ESP) would stimulate interest and
investment in environmental and natural resources management
within a framework of economic growth, a senior government
official has said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the official opening of the Dissemination workshop
under the auspices of the Pilot Environmental Fund (PEF) here on
Thursday, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Environment and
Natural Resources Jewitte Masinja said the major focus of PEF is
to support community-based programs.
</P>
<P>
PEF has two components, namely the Community-Based Investment
Fund (CBIF) and the Environmental Study Fund (ESF), he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that CBIF and ESF encouraged community ownership
and management of the environment through the promotion of
community-based micro-projects.
</P>
<P>
Masinja also noted that financing practically oriented natural
resources management and environmental studies is especially of
national importance to CBIF and ESF.
</P>
<P>
"The ESF is financed by a credit to the government from the
World Bank and this credit is administered by the International
Development Agency through the environmental support program in my
ministry in conjunction with the Social Recovery Project," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He observed that all the studies financed were practical and
geared to problem solving and relevant to policy issues rather
than being solely of academic interest.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Needs 310 Million U.S. Dollars to Build Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government has not
yet raised the 310 million U.S. dollars required to rebuild the
Sena railway line that runs from the port of Beira to Malawi and
to the coal mines of Moatize in the western Province of Tete.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Thursday in the Mozambican parliament, the Assembly
of the Republic, Deputy Transport Minister Antonio Fernando said
that although there was a general agreement that the Sena line is
vital to economy of central Mozambique, nothing could be done
until the funds have been mobilized.
</P>
<P>
Fernando, who was speaking during the debate on the
government's budget and plan for this year, pointed out that it
was not a question of rehabilitating the line, but of completely
rebuilding it "because the line no longer exists, it's just bush."
</P>
<P>
The line was comprehensively sabotaged by the apartheid-backed
Renamo (a Resistencia Nacional de Mozambique) rebels in the early
1980s, with the rails torn up, stations burnt to the ground and
rolling stock destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Only when the Sena line is rebuilt will there be possible
export of significant quantities of Moatize coal, Fernando said.
The line is also of key importance for taking agricultural
products from the Zambezi valley to port, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy minister, 210 million U.S. dollars is
the cost of rebuilding the line, and a further 100 million U.S.
dollars is needed to buy new locomotives.
</P>
<P>
The total projected income from Mozambican commodity exports
this year is 296 million U.S. dollars. "Even if we used all of
that, it's not enough to rebuild the Sena line," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government is looking for partners for BOT
(Build-Operate-Transfer) scheme for this railway. Under this
arrangement, the private investors would rebuild the line, operate
it for a specific period to recoup their costs and make profits,
and then hand it over to the government.
</P>
<P>
"We are in intensive negotiations with China and Canada for the
 financial engineering required," said Fernando.
</P>
<P>
A second problem railway is the branch line from Cuamba to
Lichinga in the northernmost Province of Niassa. This line should
be the most economic means of supplying fuel and other basic goods
to Lichinga and all the central and northern districts of Niassa.
</P>
<P>
A full rehabilitation of the Lichinga line would cost 126
million U.S. dollars. This sum of money is not available yet, but
the publicly owned rail company, CFM (Companhia Ferroviaria de
Mozambique), is planning to spend 8 million U.S. dollars by April
2001 in replacing the sleepers, and making the line somewhat
safer.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian PM Calls for More British Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye Thursday urged British business community to make
use of Tanzania's conductive environment to invest, especially in
the energy and tourism sectors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the British in East Africa
Trade Exhibition here, the prime minister said Tanzania invites
exhibiting British companies to come and invest in the country.
</P>
<P>
On the inhibiting hurdles to investors and bureaucracy, Sumaye
said Tanzania is doing its best to wipe out the anomaly.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania is currently strengthening its Investment
Promotion Center (IPC) so that it can readily improve its services
and reduce unnecessary bureaucracy when dealing with prospective
investors.
</P>
<P>
As for the exhibition, Sumaye said it is an encouraging note to
promote the long existing trade between Britain and East African
countries, especially Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it is unfortunate that Tanzania's exports to
Britain are still very low while Britain is relatively selling
more to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye urged Tanzanian business community to establish contacts
and explore possibility to effectively do business with British
business community so as to increase Tanzania's export value.
</P>
<P>
Britain is one of Tanzania's leading investors and trading
partners. The exhibition is featuring British companies in sectors
like finance, manufacturing, agriculture, horticulture,
electronics, education, health and information technology.

"The move to establish a Free Trade Area in the region was in
line with the shared vision of prosperity through enhanced trade
and economic cooperation," said Indian Commerce and Industry
Minister Murasoli Maran, adding that the concept paper is expected
to be readied within six months.
</P>
<P>
The initiative would also act as a bridge linking India to
ASEAN, Maran noted.
</P>
<P>
It was also decided at the BIMST-EC meeting that the member
nations would move ahead with a proposal to establish proper

NEW DELHI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- India has released 41 Pakistani

<P>
The move came close on the heels of Pakistan having released 19
Indian Fishermen who were lodged in various jails in Pakistan.

<P>
The 41 Pakistani fishermen were released in two batches. On

</P>
<P>
Indian officials said that Pakistan is yet to release 115

an agreement reached by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement specifies that civilians and fishermen in each

MANILA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Manila-based Asian Development
Bank (ADB) approved Thursday a 20-million-U.S.-dollar project to
Cambodia to give the country's rural households better access to
rural finance.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said the Rural Credit and Savings Project will

a wholesale banking institution, which will channel funds through
microfinance institutions to their subborrowers.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loan has a maturity of 32 years, including a grace
period of 8 years. The interest charge will be one percent per
annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Rises 5.4 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy, driven by
the biggest jump in consumer spending in nearly 17 years, grew at
an annual rate of 5.4 percent in the first quarter of 2000, the
Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the gross domestic product (GDP), the total
output of goods and services in the country, was slightly slower
than the breakneck 7.3 percent rate posted in the fourth quarter
of 1999, the strongest showing in nearly 16 years.
</P>
<P>
First-quarter growth was led by a whopping 8.3 percent rate of
increase in consumer spending, the largest gain since a 8.6
percent rate posted in the second quarter of 1983.The consumer
spending increased 5.9 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve, fearing that unchecked growth could worsen
inflation, has raised interest rates five times since June 30 to
slow the speeding economy. Given the outlook for continued strong
growth, many economists believe the Fed policy makers will boost
interest rates once again when they meet on May 16.
</P>
<P>
An inflation gauge tied to GDP that is closely watched by Fed
chairman Alan Greenspan rose at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in
the first quarter, the largest increase since a 3.5 percent rate
in the third quarter of 1994. The inflation measure rose at a 2.5
percent rate in the fourth quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
Americans' spending spree pulled the nation's savings rate,
savings as a percentage of disposable income, to a record
quarterly low of 0.7 percent, down from the previous all-time low
of 1.8 percent recorded in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Businesses, confident that consumers will continue spending,
boosted their investment in new equipment and plants in the first
quarter by a sizzling rate of 21.2 percent, up from a 2.9 percent
rate in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
That 21.2 percent rate marked the largest increase since the
first quarter of 1998 and was another major factor adding to the
overall economy's growth in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to first-quarter growth was spending by state
and local governments which grew at a 7.4 percent rate in the
first quarter, up from a 6.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit, however, continued to be a drag on
economic growth. Imports rose at a rate of 9.5 percent in the
first quarter, up from a 8.7 percent rate. Exports fell at a 0.2
percent rate, compared to a 10.1 percent increase in fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses increased inventories of 31.1 billion U.S.
dollars in the first quarter, following increased of 66.7 billion

<HEADLINE> ECB Raises Rates by Quarter Percentage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECD)
Thursday raised its three leading interests rates by 0.25-
percentage point amid record weak euro.
</P>
<P>
The ECB governing council made the decision at its routine
meeting in Frankfurt, warning against "upside risks to price
stability" in the euro region and the present exchange rate of the
euro.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, the ECB said its main refinancing rate
would be set at 3.75 percent, the marginal lending facility rate
at 4.75 per cent, and the deposit facility rate, 2.75 percent,
after this Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The governing council expressed concern about upside risks to
price stability which arise from strong growth in monetary and
credit aggregates, as well as from the present level of the
exchange rate of the euro," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The weak exchange rate does not reflect the booming economy in
the euro zone, the ECB stressed
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the exchange rate of euro hit its record low
of 0.9139 U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming this move as "absolutely right," the German
business did not expect the euro to be stronger until this summer.
</P>
<P>
"This decision is absolutely right and well-grounded," said
Norbert Walter, chief economist of Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
 But the common currency of 11 European countries will stay
weak until this summer since "no positive impulse is expected," he
said, adding that the low exchange rate against U.S.dollar would
not hurt the "internal stability" of euro.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Association of German Industry said, euro would
become stronger only after the euro nations pass their "reform jam.
"
</P>
<P>
"Not the ECB, but the economic policy of the euro states
should be responsible for the weak currency," the powerful
organization said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wages, Benefits Rise 4.3 Percent in 12 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Americans' wages and benefits
increased 4.3 percent in the 12 months ending in March, the
fastest growth in pay in eight years, the Labor Department said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index
was the biggest 12-month advance since a 4.3 percent increase in
December 1991. In the 12 months ending in December, wages and
benefits rose by a more moderate 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
While higher wages and benefits are good news for workers,
economists are concerned that if companies pass on rising labor
costs to buyers of their products, it could trigger higher
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has already raised interest rates five
times since June in an effort to slow the booming economy to a
more sustainable growth rate and keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
The boost in pay pressures reflected a 4 percent increase in
wages and salaries and a 5 percent rise in benefit costs, items
such as health insurance and pensions.
</P>
<P>
For just the January-March quarter, wages and benefits rose by
1.4 percent, the biggest quarterly increase in more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The Employment Cost Index is closely watched for signals it can
provide about underlying price pressures in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has been expressing
fears that the tightest labor market in three decades will
eventually spawn inflationary wage increases as employers are
forced to pay higher and higher wages to attract a dwindling
supply of workers.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Completes New Public Health System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- With the last establishment
today of a disease prevention center and a public health
institutions supervision bureau in the Pudong New Area, Shanghai
now has a citywide disease prevention system.
</P>
<P>
Two components of the new system will be responsible for
closely monitoring and carrying out laws related to prevention
efforts, and this is expected to strengthen public health
institutions in their epidemic prevention and research and studies,
said officials with the local public health bureau.
</P>
<P>
Emerging new diseases such as AIDS requires a public health
system for stern controls, and the new structure will also
intensify work in the area of non-infectious illnesses studies and
prevention, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
The old system, made up only of epidemic prevention stations,
did, however, play a positive role in public health since its
establishment along with the founding of new China in 1949, and
life expectancy in Shanghai is now 77.3 years.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China's External Trade to Rebound in 2000 (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economic analysts noted that the recovery of external trade in
the first quarter this year indicates a better economic situation
for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration of integration into the global economy has
promoted scientific and technological progress, as well as the
growth of world economy in general. It is estimated that the
growth rate for the global economy this year will reach 3.5
percent, and the rate for international trade will be 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Continued economic growth in the United States is expected to
stabilize economic growth in Europe and Asia, and expand trade.
</P>
<P>
China continues to adopt positive financial policies to improve
its investment environment while it expands exports with favorable
factors such as the campaign to develop western China and the
anticipated entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
However, analysts also point out that there are still unstable
factors in the world economy, such as fluctuations on the stock
market in the United States and regional economic protectionism.
</P>
<P>
China must prepare for entry into the WTO this year, while
facing many readjustments to its economy and external trade. The
country must also make efforts to overcome many difficulties that
lie on the road ahead, the analysts said.

BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- In the first quarter of this year,
China's macro-economy saw rapid growth with the GDP rising 8.1
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The growth momentum of China's national economy is closely
related to the fast growth of the country imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the first three months, import and
export volume rose 40 percent over the same period of 1999, with
export volume up 39 percent and import value growing 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the country has also begun to increase
again. In the first quarter, contracted foreign funds increased
by 27 percent, indicating strong potential for the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
Actual foreign investment dropped by 2.72 percent, but compared
with the decline of over 10 percent in the first quarter of 1999,
the drastic downward trend has been checked.
</P>
<P>
Since China began its reform and opening up in 1978, foreign
trade has maintained rapid development, with annual growth rate of
import and export volume reaching 15.6 percent, much higher than
then annual growth rate of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade has played an increasingly important role in
stimulating the growth of the national economy, and the
development of foreign trade has directly affected this growth. (

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative judiciary on
Thursday closed down two more reformist papers, Sobh-e Emruz and
Mosharekat, bringing the total number of papers and periodicals
suspended to 16.
</P>
<P>
Sobh-e Emruz (This Morning) is published by Saeed Hajjarian, a
prominent reformer who was shot and seriously wounded in an
assassination attempt last month, the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The judiciary had ordered the closure of the daily on Monday,
but revoked the order later, citing Hajjarian's hospitalization as
the reason.
</P>
<P>
Mosharekat (Participation) is run by Mohammed Reza Khatami,
brother of pro-reform President Mohammed Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Both reformers are leaders of the major reformist party the
Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF), which led reformers in the
country to an overwhelming victory in the parliamentary election in
February, bringing an end to the long time domination of the
conservatives in the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Two separate statements made by the Justice Department of Tehran
on Thursday said the two dailies had been informed to stop
publication due to violation of the press law, IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
This brings to 16 the total number of dailies and periodicals
closed down by the judiciary in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
The Mosharekat daily had received a warning from the
conservative press court on Tuesday for reprinting and changing its
looks after other reformist papers were closed.
</P>
<P>
"If the paper fails to pay attention to the legal note of the
court, proper decision would be taken against it," press court
judge Saeed Mortazavi warned in a letter sent to Mohammad Reza
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The judiciary's move was part of the stepped-up effort of the
conservatives, who are the real rulers of the Islamic country, to
curb the reformist campaign which has been growing since President
Mohammed Khatami took office in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Manila Appoints Negotiator for Hostages Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that it has appointed a negotiator for the safe release
of some 20 people kidnapped from Sabah, Malaysia on Sunday and are
now believed to be in Sulu province in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao, told reporters in the Presidential Palace that President
Joseph Estrada has given him a "general and comprehensive" mandate
to negotiate with the hostage takers.
</P>
<P>
"I will try my best to help facilitate the safe and quick
release of these people," said Misuari.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the president has instructed the Armed Forces of
the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to fully
cooperate with him to ensure the welfare and safety of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview Thursday morning, Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora said the government will not accede to any ransom
demand from the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
Misuari, head of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF),
said he will consult with the Office of the President regarding
any ransom demand but added: "Offhand, I do not like to entertain
any financial demand" from the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
The MNIF, once the country's largest Muslim rebel group, signed
a peace treaty with the government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Misuari said that as part of his strategy and to ensure that
the government negotiates from a position of strength, he will
place on alert some 2,000 to 3,000 MNLF members in the area where
the hostages are held.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said the hostages seized at Sipadan island
include Malaysians, Filipinos, Germans, French and Finnish
nationals, South Africans and a Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the governments of the foreign nationals kidnapped
have agreed not to make this an international issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the Malaysian, Finnish, and German ambassadors have
told Secretary Domingo Siazon of the Department of Foreign Affairs
that they are leaving it to the Philippine authorities to handle
the situation.

<HEADLINE> No Change in India's Position on Dialogue: Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday discreetly
shrugged off India's statement on "talks about talks," saying it "
does not appear to reflect any change in India's position
prescribing conditions for dialogue with Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman
Tariq Altaf in a press release issued here.
</P>
<P>
India's Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said on Wednesday his
government would consider holding "talks about talks" with
Pakistan to avoid increasing tension between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
However, he said "the right climate" must be created for a
resumption of dialogue and Pakistan should not indulge in "endless
hostile propaganda and continuous call of Jihad (holy war)."
</P>
<P>
On the part of Pakistan, Chief Executive General Pervez
Musharraf has repeatedly expressed the hope for dialogue with
India.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Pakistan has stated its position at the
highest level," said the Foreign Office spokesman. "Pakistan is
prepared to enter into talks with India for resolution of
outstanding issues including the Kashmir issue."
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan will never accept any pre-conditions for
dialogue. "We have never suggested nor will accept any conditions.
"
</P>
<P>
Official talks between the two arch-rivals in South Asia were
disrupted last May when they battled along the Line of Control in
the disputed area of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Since then India has made clear its position that it would not
resume dialogue with Pakistan until the latter stopped its support
for "Jehad" in the Indian-controlled Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Foreign Ministers to Discuss Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The first meeting of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) foreign ministers
on peace and security opened in Zambian capital Lusaka on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will discuss how to implement the decision
by COMESA summit last year in Kenyan capital Nairobi that the
regional body should play a positive role in maintaining peace and
security, and the report adopted at this meeting will be submitted
to the COMESA summit to be held in Mauritius next month.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said in the opening speech
that peace is necessary not only for the development and
integration of COMESA, but also for Africa as a whole and the
entire world.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi summit was convinced that the economic integration
of the grouping will not be accomplished unless and until there is
durable peace and security in the sub-region. Conversely, it is
true that without sustainable development there will be no real
peace either, he said.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha said on the same
occasion that more than half of the COMESA member countries have
been involved in conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty, hunger, diseases and under-development that prevail
in the region are directly linked to armed conflicts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts lead to diversion of resources from economic sectors
to military expenditure, he said.
</P>
<P>
There is general consensus that the economic and political
agenda of any regional organization are two sides of the same coin
and to attain sustainable economic development requires political
stability, said Mwencha.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, established in December 1993 and headquartered in
Lusaka, is composed of 21 countries, including Angola, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi where the civil
conflicts are raging.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Police Warn Political Parties Against Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Police Commissioner
Augustine Chihuri on Thursday warned politicians against
perpetrating violence in the run up to the parliamentary elections
scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Chihuri refuted allegations
that the police force was biased.
</P>
<P>
He said abductions of supporters of rival parties had to stop
and those who went about throwing bombs to intimidate the nation
would be brought to book and dealt with severely.
</P>
<P>
He said police would use its meagre resources to the maximum to
deal with anyone found to have participated in violence and police
had invoked sections of the Law and Order Maintenance Act to deal
with violence.
</P>
<P>
"We have concluded that political parties and their officials
were playing a big role in fueling violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said party officials made inflammatory statements which
stirred violence among supporters.
</P>
<P>
There have been 194 cases of violence and 10 deaths since
January. Seven of the deaths resulted from political violence
while three including a policeman and two white farmers were
related to farm invasions.

<HEADLINE> 2,181 Russian Servicemen Killed Since Chechen War Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Russian federal forces have
lost the lives of 2,181 servicemen with another 6,388 injured
since the anti-terrorist campaign in the Northern Caucasus began
on August 2, 1999, said a senior Russian officer Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The losses include 1,447 army servicemen and 734 Interior
Ministry servicemen and policemen, first deputy chief of the
Russian Armed Forces General Staff Col. Gen. Valery Manilov told
journalists.
</P>
<P>
In the breakaway republic of Chechnya, as many as 1,901
servicemen have been killed and 5,401 injured since October 1,
1999, Manilov said. Of the dead, 1,329 were army servicemen and
the rest 572 interior servicemen and policemen. Among the wounded,
3,671 were from the national army forces and 1,730 from the
Interior Ministry and the police.
</P>
<P>
He reminded that during April 20-27 a total of 37 federal
forces were killed, consisting of 32 army servicemen and five
interior servicemen and policemen, with another 63 injured: 30
army soldiers and 33 interior servicemen and policemen.
</P>
<P>
The ten Russian Interior Ministry servicemen killed in the
Serzhen-Yurt area on Wednesday are not included in the casualties,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops confronted another rebel ambush
Wednesday in Chechnya. At least ten servicemen, including a senior
commissioned officer, and 17 rebels were killed in the battle, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In increasing fresh clashes between Russian forces and Chechen
rebels in recent days, Russian troops' losses have kept rising
with more rebel tolls reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian units have also come under frequent rebel ambushes
lately. 15 federal servicemen lost their lives in a rebel attack
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As a counterattack, Russian forces have stepped up air raids
on rebel positions in the southern mountains of Chechnya and
strengthened the control over the province's borders with
neighboring regions.
</P>
<P>
The Russian media said hostilities in Chechnya might intensify
in the next few days. Interfax quoted sources as saying that the
purpose of the stepped-up campaign is to strip the rebels of their
leaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Belarussian National Assembly
(the parliament) ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
on Thursday, six days after Russia made the same move, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
By ratifying the pact, Belarus has confirmed its support for
steps to eliminate nuclear weapons and Belarussian President
Alexander Lukashenko's plan to set up a nuclear-free zone in
Europe, said the Belarus Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Under the CTBT treaty which was signed by Belarus in 1996, the
country will not conduct any nuclear blasts. Belarus is the 55th
country to sign the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The United States, with the largest and most advanced nuclear
arsenal in the world, has not approved the CTBT yet. The U.S.
Senate rejected it in late 1999.

<HEADLINE> French Minister Regrets ECB Decision to Raise Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister Jean-
Pierre Chevenement Thursday expressed his regret about the
decision of the European Central Bank (ECB) to raise its leading
short-term interest rate.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement to the press after a cabinet meeting
chaired by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, Chevenement said it would
not help the "elan of growth" being experienced by France.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the French Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry
Laurent Fabius said that by raising interest rates, the ECB will
not help the euro, whose exchange rate with the U.S. dollar has
fallen by 20 percent over the past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt-based ECB board of governors decided on Thursday
to raise its leading short-term interest rate by 0.25 percent to 3.
75 percent in order to avoid the risk of inflation in the euro
zone.
</P>
<P>
Euro immediately plunged to a new record low of one for 0.9143
dollar in the exchange market in London after the ECB announced
its decision.

Yuan has learned to swim, play the piano, knit, and do other
things that sighted children are able to.
</P>
<P>
When she was very young, Yuan liked to listen to fairly tales

tales. She is now a student at a local school for blind children.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Headway In Household Appliance Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to become a
world giant in the production of household appliances in the next
10 years.
</P>
<P>
This announcement was made recently by Jiang Feng, secretary-
general of the China Household Electrical Appliances Association
in the coastal city of Xiamen in eastern China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
China has secured a foothold in the world's household
electrical appliance market, with a total output value of more
than 150 billion yuan (about 18.1 billion US dollars) in 1999,
with exports standing at 4.2 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China exports household electrical appliances to more than 180
countries and regions, including 1.4 billion US dollars worth of
merchandise to the U.S. last year, the largest amount to any one
country.
</P>
<P>
Washing machines, refrigerators and air conditioners produced
by China have made 24 percent, 16 percent and 30 percent
respectively of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
An overseas analysis shows that China has become the third
largest household electrical appliances producer in the world,
after the U.S. and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Brand names have become increasingly important part of the
country's output, and these include such brands as "Kelong," "Hai'
er," "Xinfei," "Gree," "Chuanlan," and "Little Swan."

<HEADLINE> Illegal Drug Sales in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman with the Beijing
Municipal Public Security Bureau disclosed today that they have
uncovered the largest case yet involving the sale of some 2,313
MDMA pills, a type of amphetamine.
</P>
<P>
They captured nine members of the gang and found a total of 70,
000 yuan (8,400 U.S. dollars) in their possession.
</P>
<P>
Six caught in Beijing disclosed that they began selling MDMA at
100 yuan per pill in the city's discos and bars in March this year,
and that they got the drug in Guangzhou in south China's Guangdong
Province. With information offered by those arrested, public
security captured the other three in Guangzhou as they were
dealing the drug.
</P>
<P>
The MDMA dealer suspects confessed that they have sold more
than 30,000 MDMA pills in Beijing and other places and gained
illicit money of nearly one million yuan since January this year.
</P>
<P>
The case is still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Cunyi, deputy director of the Narcotics
Control Bureau under the Ministry of Public Security, MDMA is an
addictive substance which stimulates the nervous system, causing
drug-users to become easily excited and often to act violently.
And an overdose can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
MDMA is no longer a strange sight to young people in the discos
of Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, as it was
in 1997 when Chinese police cracked the country's first MDMA case
in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Records show that the Chinese police handled 64,000 cases of
drug trafficking and production last year, 2.4 percent more than
in 1998. Some 57,000 criminal suspects, or 7.9 percent more than
in 1998, were arrested.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: New Strategies Sought to Boost New Economy in Asia (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- While a vigorous recovery is
underway in the former crisis countries in Asia, investors
confidence is still fragile, as the substainability of the
recovery depends on the successful completion of structural and
institutional reforms, participants to a regional financial forum
in Hong Kong said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Up to 150 Asian business leaders attended the Business Week's
CFO Forum in Hong Kong from April 26 to 28, focusing their
attention on issues on remaking Asian business, aligning
information technology strategy with business objectives, treasury
and risk management, and e-commerce in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We are starting to see new growth all around Asia and that
includes the advent of some sweeping changes in corporate finance
and treasury services, including banks and service centers," said
Sam Moon, managing director of dumStrategies and organizer of the
forum.
</P>
<P>
"This is a truly exciting time as the economy is starting to
change, to reflect, and take advantage of, these new developments
in the corporate financial landscape," Moon stressed.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders believed that while the recessionary
environment in much of Asia is abating, many markets are fraught
with the inconsistencies that indicate the reforms and governance
efforts in many companies were incomplete and not thorough enough.
</P>
<P>
The recession saw dramatic changes to corporate structure. Now,
the surviving firms are faced with interpreting the lessons

<P>
As investors scrutinize Asian companies and closely monitor the
inflow and outflow of funds, companies with solid business
infrastructures will be more likely to regain investor confidence
during the economic recovery.

The participants also explored the roles of government and
business in ensuring best practice corporate governance, financial

<HEADLINE> Analysis: New Strategies Sought to Boost New Economy in Asia (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As about 80 percent of corporate bankruptcies are due to
illiquidity, it's important to have funding available at the right
place at the right time. The three areas that need to be
considered for effective liquidity management and financial
control structure are rationalization, coordination and
centralization, some participants said.
</P>
<P>
Different corporate structures and distribution of resources
across the globe require different models of treasury and finance
operations. While centralization may work for one organization,
process distribution and service centers may be the right approach
for another.
</P>
<P>
The business leaders stressed in an open discussion that Asia's
recovery depends on both the world economy including a sustained
growth in the United States and the domestic policies on fiscal
consolidation and institutional structure reforms. Improvements
should be made in at least four areas, including financial sector,
corporate sector, competition, and legal system, they said.
</P>
<P>
The forum is being held at a pivotal juncture - almost two
years after the initial economic downturn, and in the mist of a
very encouraging regional recovery that sees new capital and a new
dotcom economy blossoming in the region.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that as e-commerce continues to gain momentum,
it is beginning to impact and change business practices worldwide.
They cautioned that when developing the e-business strategy, one
must consider his or her tax risks and planning opportunities at
each phase of the e-business life cycle and must be aware of the
accounting implications when operating the business under an "e-
mode."
</P>
<P>
"As information and services move more and more toward the
Internet, we see large migration from traditional business
measurement and operational parameters," said Byram Johnston,
managing partner of the business consulting department of Arthur
Andersen.
</P>
<P>
Compliance with various governments is an oxymoron in a
borderless marketplace, people no longer adhere to traditional
principles in valuation of corporate entities, and new revenue
streams must be developed constantly, as first to market has
become the standard grail of new initiatives and new services,
Johnston said.

The article peculated the names of some Falun Gong
practitioners in the CAS to spread its own opinions.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, biological death represents the end,
but in fact it is just a natural diversifying process of evolution,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have not said they have all the answers, but they
have opened a way to know about the truth through practice. Darwin
's Theory of Evolution and other theories on the origin of the
human beings are already enough to bury Li Hongzhi's ideas, though
they are not absolutely true, he said.
</P>
<P>
The article said that it is totally reasonable in scientific
terms that the practice of Falun Gong can lead to huge changes in
the human body, but it did not say how, he said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it is a shocking fact that Falun Gong has claimed a
large number of lives, destroyed many families, and caused social
instability in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang also emphasized that the cult is a new horror, a most
serious harm to people's political and spiritual rights, and a
profanity of human civilization.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that people will not take part in
inglorious political activities in the name of a cult, and the

<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Falun Gong is absolutely
superstition, not science, a Chinese scientist has pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yusheng, a research fellow in the natural sciences with
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), made the remarks in
response to the puffery about Falun Gong in a Chinese newspaper
published in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper recently carried an article titled "Not
Superstition, But Profound Science," bearing the names of some
Falun Gong practitioners in the CAS. It claimed to be a "
scientific paper" with a dozen references.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that it is really too bad that the newspaper extols a
cult, and the paper used words even more weird than science
fiction to demonstrate the "profundity" of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi, the founder of the cult, notes that there are
second and third layers of our universe, and he himself represents
the top layer, while all other human beings are rubbish that have
fallen to the Earth; and the Earth will burst regularly.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that Li Hongzhi does not know the physical and
philosophic meaning of the universe at all and cannot provide any
evidence for the "other space" theory.
</P>
<P>
Li denied all the achievements made by Copernicus, trying to
drag people's knowledge of the universe into the darkness in the
Middle Ages, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> HK External Trade Continues Robust Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total exports and
imports continued to record robust growth last month, according to
external trade figures released Thursday by the Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports, comprising re-exports and domestic
exports, increased markedly by 26.4 percent in March over a year
earlier to 122.8 billion HK dollars (15.74 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Within the total, the value of re-exports rose by 27.1 percent
to 108.2 billion HK dollars (13.87 billion U.S. dollars), and
domestic exports by 21.5 percent to 14.5 billion HK dollars (1.86
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of imports also increased by 25.9 percent to 136.4
billion HK dollars (17.49 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A visible trade deficit of 13.6 billion HK dollars (1.74
billion U.S. dollars), equivalent to 10 percent of the value of
imports, was recorded in March, compared with the deficit of 11.2
billion HK dollars (1.43 billion U.S. dollars) recorded a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 2000, the value of total exports
increased by 20 percent over a year earlier. Within this total,
the value of re-exports increased by 20.8 percent and domestic
exports by 14.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the first quarter of 2000 with the fourth quarter of
1999 on a seasonally adjusted basis, the value of total exports
had an increase of 6.8 percent. Within this total, the value of re-
exports and domestic exports rose by 5.9 percent and 13.3 percent
respectively. Over the same periods of comparison, the value of
imports increased by 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to a government secretariat spokesman, it is for the
fifth month in a row that Hong Kong's total exports recorded a
double-digit growth, which was also the largest year-on-year
increase since January 1994.
</P>
<P>
The big exports rise was a result of broad-based rebound in
domestic demand along with the further pick-up in the economy, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Grassroots Judicial Work for Social Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China will step up efforts to
upgrade the professional level of grassroots judicial workers and
train more legal mediators to help solve the ever-increasing
social conflicts and disputes arising in the countryside, Justice
Minister Gao Changli said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a five-day national conference that began on Monday,
Gao said that "judicial workers play an important part in cracking
down on and preventing crime, and should be made diligent and
clean and honest in their conduct."
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 million legal mediators have handled 130 million
civil disputes over the past 20 years, preventing these disputes
from escalating into criminal cases, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Gao announced a series of ambitious plans today for
strengthening administration over judicial work.
</P>
<P>
At the top of his agenda is the establishment of a "National
Data System on Ex-Inmates" covering everyone who has been released
from prison after serving their terms, including those from "
education-through-labor camps."
</P>
<P>
"The new network is expected to further reduce the recidivist
rate in China," Gao said. In addition, a comprehensive social
network should be improved to assign ex-inmates and reformed
juvenile delinquents to proper jobs and positions, and provide
help and assistance.
</P>
<P>
To maintain social justice, Gao said that special centers for
legal aid to the poor should be set up in all the provinces,
autonomous regions, and municipalities by the end of this year,
and two-thirds of all counties should be equipped with such
centers. In two or three years, each county and town with a people
's court should be accompanied by at least one legal aid center,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Legal service hotlines with the uniform number "148" have been
opened across the nation, and their services will be further
improved in the years to come, the minister pledged.
</P>
<P>
The services of judicial administrative bodies have been
extended to towns and villages, and according to statistics, there
are 2,640 county-level judicial administrative bodies in the
country, under which there are more than 3,000 law firms and 2,793
notary offices and one million legal mediation centers.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Finance Minister Urges Doctors to End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Minister Avraham
Shohat Thursday called on the doctors nationwide to return to the
negotiating table to solve their wage problems and end immediately
their strike.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry is ready for further negotiations with the
representatives of the doctors to discuss their wage increase and
any further strike by the doctors can only add more hardships to
the citizens, Shohat said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's health system was hit by a general strike Thursday,
with all public hospitals operating only on emergency cases.
</P>
<P>
The doctors and physicians at public hospitals and other health
centers nationwide have been striking for almost six weeks for wage
increase.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Medical Association (IMA) and the Physicians Union
ordered the doctors and physicians nationwide to continue their
strike Thursday after their talks with representatives of the
Finance Ministry's wages department and budgetary branch at the
beginning of the week yielded no solution.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has so far offered an average 5 percent
annual wage increase for the doctors and physicians, but this offer
has been rejected by the IMA.
</P>
<P>
The IMA's demands include doubling the hourly salary of hospital
residents, counting duty hours at night as overtime and giving
financial incentives to medical specialists who devote all their
time to public hospital work.
</P>
<P>
It calls for changing the wage structure in which most of a
doctor's income comes from evening and weekend work and less from
work at regular hours.
</P>
<P>
The IMA also demands that public hospital doctors be given the
opportunity to work in community medical centers to increase their
income and award doctors who work in medical research and
development and do academic work.
</P>
<P>
It wants the authority to allow patients to choose their own
physicians in all public hospitals within the framework of health-
fund supplementary insurance system.

ANKARA -- Turkish Tourism Minister Erkan Mumcu and his

developing the tourism cooperation between the two countries. This
was announced during the first meeting of the Turkish-Palestinian
joint economic commission held in Ankara on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The economic daily Al Alam El Yom on Thursday quoted Mumcu as
saying that about one million Turkish people are willing to visit
the tourist attractions in Palestine and the other religious
places.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Al Alam El Yom on Thursday reported that the United
States Agency for International Development is planning to grant 83
million U.S. dollars to Jordan to support its water improvement
project.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. agency also approved to grant Jordan another 46.1
million dollars to increase the economic opportunities of the
private sector and improve the investment climate in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Director of the agency in Amman, Louis Look, said the agency
plans to allocate a grant worth 200 million dollars to Jordan this
year and 250 million dollars in 2001, thus raising the total value

ANKARA -- An energy report prepared by the Turkish Treasury
Undersecretariat, the State Planning Organization and the Minsitry
of Energy and Natural Resources said that Turkey's electricity
shortage will continuously increase in 2001 and 2002, reported the
Anatolia News Agency on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the upcoming shortage, according to the report, the
government, the Treasury and the World Bank support optimum
minimization in the number of the so-called build-operate-transfer
(BOT) projects to only three or four with firms which have a higher
chance of finding foreign financing.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank says that by giving financial guarantees to BOT
projects, the Treasury is actually exacerbating public deficits and
causing distortion in free market conditions.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey has banned imports of certain chemical
substances from countries that are not party to the Chemical
Weapons Convention, reported Turkish Daily News on Thursday.

ISLAMABAD, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
expects the GDP growth in Pakistan at 4.5 percent during 1999-2000
and 5 percent for the next year, according to its annual report --
the Asian Development 2000 Outlook.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that the country's industrial growth may
remain stagnant, but the agriculture sector could improve because
of more investment. However, the report says the medium-term
outlook depended critically on the political stability and the
pace of economic reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the economic performance in the first half of the
1999-2000 fiscal year showed a slow but fragile recovery. While
the industrial growth remained sluggish because of low investment,
improvement in the agriculture sector partially offset the loss.

NEW DELHI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
Thursday unveiled in Mumbai its Monetary and Credit Policy for the
year 2000-01, which aim to further strengthen and improve the
financial system of the country by proposing a series of
liberalization measures for the money markets and banks, the Press
Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the PTI, the RBI has decided to progressively
implement in stages a full-fledged liquidity adjustment facility (
LAF) to be operated through repo and reverse repos in order to set
a corridor for money market interest rates.
</P>
<P>
RBI Governor Bimal Jalan, in an address to the chief executives
of scheduled commercial banks Thursday, said the LAF would help
the short term money market interest rates to move within a
corridor and impart greater stability, thus facilitating the
emergence of a short term rupee yield curve.
</P>
<P>
According to the new Monetary and Credit Policy, the use of
interest rates implied in foreign exchange forward market as a
benchmark will be permitted in addition to the existing money and
debt market rates, while the minimum maturity of certificates of
deposits will be reduced to 15 days from three months.
</P>
<P>
The policy will also allow entities to sell securities after
they have been allotted, enabling sale, settlement and transfer on
the same day, the PTI added.

<HEADLINE> 700 Children Die of Malnutrition Daily in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Malnutrition is responsible for
premature deaths of over 700 children under 5 years of age
everyday in different parts of Bangladesh, Nutrition Forum
Bangladesh (NFB), a non-government organization, disclosed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Despite significant improvement in the field of health and
nutrition, the prevalence of malnutrition among women of child-
bearing age and children under six in Bangladesh is still high,
NFB General Secretary Dr. Anisul Awwal told a seminar.
</P>
<P>
And 60 percent of children under six are suffering from
moderate and severe grades of malnutrition, Awwal said.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar jointly organized by the NFB and the Bangladesh
Integrated Nutrition Program, speakers said about 57 percent of
women, including adolescent girls, have BMI (Bangladesh
Malnutrition Index) below 18.5, which means the majority of
adolescent girls are suffering from chronic energy deficiency.
</P>
<P>
They said over 70 percent of pregnant women and children under
5 years of age are suffering from nutritional anemia (iron
deficiency anemia), while 30 percent of the population are
suffering from iodine deficiency disorders.
</P>
<P>
The nutrition experts termed the cases of low birth weight (LBW-
weighing less than 2.5 kilograms) as stigma, which reflects one of
the most important manifestations of maternal malnutrition in the
country. They said adolescent mothers are the major contributors
of LBW babies.

<HEADLINE> France Against Raising Banking Rates to Support Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Economy, Finance
and Industry Laurent Fabius said on Thursday that it is not proper
for the European Central Bank (ECB) to help the euro by raising
greatly its interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Radio-Television Luxembourg, Fabius said
what is important is to show that the European economy is on the
way of improving strongly.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think personally that it is by raising greatly the
interest rates that we can solve this question," he said.
</P>
<P>
The council of governors of the ECB is due to decide Thursday
afternoon whether to raise the interest rates on a big scale or
not,
</P>
<P>
Euro has fallen below 0.92 U.S. dollar this week and its value
has decreased by 30 percent since it was launched in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
Fabius said that an intervention by the ECB by raising interest
rates can only solve the problem of inflation, but France is not
experiencing any inflation for the moment.
</P>
<P>
"This type of measure can justify itself while there are the
inflationary pushes, in France we don't see them today," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU to Bridge Gap Between Bio-Scientists, Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) formed a
special group on Thursday to better inform the general public
about the new advances of life sciences and their benefits for
humans.
</P>
<P>
Philippe Busquin, EU commissioner in charge of research, urged
Europe to promote biotechnology and to adopt a general strategy by
taking greater account of the scientists' views on the
opportunities and risks associated with biosciences.
</P>
<P>
Eleven bio-scientists, chosen to form the high-level group on
biosciences, will examine the wide-ranging challenges and
opportunities that the development of life sciences raises for the
society.
</P>
<P>
"I want to ask scientists back to the debating table as Europe
needs to make sure that it has a sound basis for discussing these
issues," said Busquin. "A conscious political decision in this
field is not possible without informed advice and public debate,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
"Advances in life sciences research are generating significant
opportunities for improving the quality of life for European
citizens," stressed the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Complex issues associated with these advances, however, are
raising considerable uncertainty and concerns among the general
public and policy makers, Busquin said.
</P>
<P>
A recent EU-wide survey found that the European public is now
well informed about the bioscientific issues.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether they were adequately informed on
biotechnology, among the 16,082 people surveyed last November and
December within the 15-nation bloc, only 11 percent of them said
they "yes", while 81 percent felt they were not adequately
informed and the remaining 8 percent could not be sure.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the EU citizens were more worried
about the food safety than environmental protection though both
have been undergoing changes caused by genetically modified
organisms.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Government's Role Crucial to Economic Recovery, Neiss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- In Asia's economic recovery,
the most important role of a government is to create a favorable
climate for sustainable economic growth, a former International
Monetary Fund official said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his exclusive interview with Xinhua here on Thursday, Hubert
Neiss, chairman of the Asia Pacific Head Office of Deutsche Bank
AG in Singapore, said that in the past few years since the crisis,
the most important role of the government was to promote the
recovery and make the recovery sustainable, and this has been done
by completing a number of reforms, because only in a climate of
economic growth can all the new technologies be absorbed.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next two years, there will be major adjustments and a
technology revolution, and governments of the Asian countries
should provide the overall favorable conditions," Neiss said.
</P>
<P>
Neiss, who used to be the chairman of the Asian Regional
Department of International Monetary Fund, said that it is the
governments' duty to maintain strong economic growth and to reform
financial systems and corporations so that financial support is
available to channel into new technologies. And governments have
to support redirection of education to produce right qualified
people to be efficient with new technologies, Neiss stressed.
</P>
<P>
What the Asian countries have learned from the recession is
that they need a sound banking system, Neiss said. "If the banking
system is weak, the whole economy is vulnerable to any shocks," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
So they have closed unreliable banks, improved the management,
set up corporations that take the bad assets from the banks so
that banks' balance sheets get clean, Neiss said. Very importantly,
he added, they have set up strong banking supervision authorities
so that banks are obliged to correspond to regulations which
reflect the best international practices.
</P>
<P>
Also, the crisis has shown that many corporations' financial
structure was very weak, Neiss said. Credits to corporations have
been rescheduled or converged into expertise, or, in some cases,
the debts of corporations are reduced so that corporations are
merged with the sound financial structure and the cleaned balance
sheets and corporations are qualified again to receive credit, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
In many countries, Neiss said, the degree of competition in
economy has been strengthened, and monopolies have been dismantled,
particularly in Indonesia. Also, the economies have become more
open, bringing in capital and expertise from abroad to strengthen
their competitiveness and efficiency, he added.
</P>
<P>
Changes have taken place in the legal system. Several countries
have made new laws to improve bankruptcy proceedings, especially
in Thailand and Indonesia. "That is very important to speed up
economic restructuring, but new laws alone are not enough, and you
need the courts which actually implement these laws in an
effective way," Neiss added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on China's economic reforms, Neiss said that China
has done very well during the crisis, the economic growth was
maintained at a high rate, and by keeping the Renminbi stable, it
has contributed to the stability in the regional markets.
</P>
<P>
Now, China started to get used to keeping economic growing,
particularly to rely more on private demand and consumption rather
than public, and tackle the same reforms that other countries are
to make in banking system and in corporations, which means the
state-owned enterprises in China.
</P>
<P>
"The difference is that many countries had to make these
reforms during the recession while China can make the reforms in
an expanding economy. It is much more easier," Neiss said.
</P>
<P>
Neiss has studied China's economic policies for over 20 years
and paid close attention to the country's development. He has
visited many of China's big cities and met scores of Chinese
officials in banking and financial sectors, including Premier Zhu
Rongji when Zhu was the governor of the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Neiss was attending the Business Week's CFO Forum from April 26
to 28 in Hong Kong. Over 150 Asian business leaders attended the
regional financial forum, focusing their attention on issues on
remaking Asian business, aligning information technology strategy
with business objectives, treasury and risk management, and e-
commerce in Asia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China will link major habitats of
giant pandas in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces in western
region to facilitate breeding of the world most endangered animal.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in "Science Times", 17 "belt zones for
panda propagation" will be built to connect the Minshan, Qionglai
mountains in Sichuan, Qinling Mountain in Shaanxi and the vast
panda habitat in the southwestern region of Gansu.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 700 giant pandas, or 80 percent of
the total population in wild, are living in these regions.
</P>
<P>
Vegetation in the regions will be restored, and farmer
residents will be moved away to minimize the influence of human
activities to giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ruisheng, secretary-general of China Wildlife Conservation
Association, was quoted as saying that building the belt zones
aims at providing the pandas with a wider living space to avoid
inbreeding.
</P>
<P>
Recent research results show that genetic diversity of the
panda has decreased by 40 percent compared to two decades ago, and
the danger of extinction of small population less than 50 has
greatly increased.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan New Leaders Urged to Recognize One-China Principle At Earliest Date (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
urged the new leaders of Taiwan to recognize the One-China
Principle as early as possible so as to bring about a turning
point in cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of the mainland's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), made
the remark here today at a press conference sponsored by the "
Opposing Taiwan Independence and Promoting Reunification of China"
forum.
</P>
<P>
The two sides of the straits had once reached a consensus on
adhering to the One-China Principle and "One China" has been an
internationally recognized reality, and a reality resulting from
the long development of cross-straits relations, Tang noted.
</P>
<P>
The earlier the new Taiwan leaders recognize the One-China
Principle, the more possible it will be to bring a turning point
in the stability and development of the cross-straits relations,
Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that some people in Taiwan have used words like "peace,
" "goodwill," and "harmony." But if they do not recognize that
Taiwan is part of China and the One-China Principle, this will
lead to disaster instead of peace, confrontation instead of
harmony, and hostility instead of goodwill, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The One-China Principle has resulted in peace across the
straits over the past five decades, in the 1987 opening allowing
Taiwan compatriots to visit their relatives in the mainland by the
Taiwan Authorities, in the increase in economic and personnel
exchanges across the straits, and in peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific Region, according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan New Leaders Urged to Recognize One-China Principle At Earliest Date (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adherence to the One-China Principle has brought about hopes
and opportunities for the complete reunification of the motherland
and the overall rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and has
ensured that Taiwan compatriots will share the space, status, and
dignity of the great motherland, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tang stressed that if Taiwan new leader really care about the
interests of the 23 million Taiwan compatriots and peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific Region, they should recognize the
One-China Principle without any hesitation.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the central government position on cross-straits
ties, stressing that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's
territory. Cross-straits negotiations are not that between the
central government and local authorities, but talks on an equal
footing to be held under the One-China Principle.
</P>
<P>
He cited the 1993 talks between Wang Daohan, chairman of the
ARATS, and Koo Chen-fu, head of the Straits Exchange Foundation (
SEF) of Taiwan, and Koo's mainland tour in 1998 as examples
demonstrating that the One China Principle will lead to equality
between the two sides, dignity and safety for Taiwan, benefits for
the Taiwan people, as well as the equality the Taiwan authorities
need.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the One-China Principle means "degrading Taiwan
" and "bringing humiliation to Taiwan." This does not conform to
reality, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The ARATS official also clarified another claim by some
Taiwanese who said the two sides had reached a consensus on "One
China, different descriptions."
</P>
<P>
In 1992, he recalled, the two organizations reached an
agreement on the description which is clearly listed in relevant
documents and newspaper reports. And the consensus between the two
bodies must not be altered, he stressed.

Tang went on to say that the Taiwan issue cannot be delayed
indefinitely, and the two sides should abandon ideological burdens
and reunify as early as possible in order to safeguard state
sovereignty and territorial integrity and the interests of the
entire Chinese nation, and to prevent overseas anti-China forces
to profit from the separation of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In a certain sense, he noted, the "timetable" for reunification
is in the hands of the Taiwan side.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to safeguard state sovereignty and territorial
integrity with our lives and blood," if splittist forces in Taiwan
openly declare "Taiwan independence" or "write 'two-state'
statements into the 'constitution'", Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The situation is becoming clearer as the Chinese people in the
mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong and Macao have been increasingly
unified against "Taiwan independence" and for safeguarding peace
and promoting reunification, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that those people for "Taiwan
independence" should face reality as early as possible and stop
challenging the State sovereignty and territorial integrity of
China.

<HEADLINE> 646 Chinese Officials Investigated for Malfeasance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China's procuratorates have
handled more than 76,000 cases related to malfeasance of
government employees over the past three years, in which 646
officials involved have been investigated or further punished.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total 76,069 cases, 26,827 cases are undergoing the
investigative procedure, in which the suspects were accused of
abusing power, malpractice, bending the law for personal benefit,
or infringing citizens' personal and democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
Two minister-level officials were among the investigated
officials whose previous ranks were at the county level or higher,
including Xu Yunhong, former alternate member of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party secretary
of Ningbo in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Xu took advantage of his position to seek personal benefit and
was the first minister-level official prosecuted in the history of
China.
</P>
<P>
China's top prosecutor Han Zhubin has urged procurators
nationwide to "seriously investigate and deal with malpractice and
power abuse among government staffs, particularly law-enforcers,
as part of the nation's anti-corruption campaign."
</P>
<P>
"Grave neglect of duty of some government employees has caused
frequent and horrible disasters such as collapsed buildings and
bridges, and fires and explosions," Han, procurator-general of the
Supreme People's Procuratorate, said at a national meeting here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Blind policy-making by some officials has caused huge losses
of state property to threaten the country's economic safety," he
told the procurators, who discussed how to fight against
malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
Major cases handled in the 1997-1999 period also included
substandard construction projects as a result of quality
negligence, confessions forced by law-enforcers, and infringement
of personal rights in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Because of the procurators' effort to handle malpractice cases
in state-owned enterprises, direct economic losses totaling 1.45
billion yuan (175 million U.S. dollars) have been prevented over
the past three years.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Experts Urge Less Medicine Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- As Nepal is importing more
medicines than necessary, drug experts called on the Nepali
government to limit the importation of medicines, The Kathmandu
Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is currently importing 11,000 brands of medicine, which
is one of the highest in terms of brands to the population ratio
in the world, the English daily said.
</P>
<P>
However, the avalanche of such medicines has made it difficult
for the regulatory authority to control the quality of drugs,
thereby increasing the risk for patients, the paper quoted drug
experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
The experts urged the government to revoke drugs import
licenses and reduce the import of medicine gradually.
</P>
<P>
"Import of a wide variety of drugs has messed up the monitoring
mechanism of drugs and has increased the use of ineffective
medicines," said Pradeep Pandy, chairman of the Association of
Pharmaceutical Producers of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of Nepal's imported drugs come from India,
including antibiotics and many other medicines.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to streamline the brands of imported drugs, the
Department of Drugs Administration issued a public notice recently
to ban the import of 186 drugs which failed to meet the standard
set by the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
But experts believed the government should do more to change
the scenario. They argued for the development of domestic medicine
production.
</P>
<P>
"More than 80 percent of the necessary drugs can be produced in
the country if the government provides facilities to the domestic
manufacturers," said Shanker Ghimire, managing director of Asian
Pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
At present, the domestic drugs manufacturers produce over 1,200
brands of medicine which meets 20 percent of the national demand.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC) has delivered its penalty on the Daqing Lianyi
Petrochemical Co., Ltd. for providing misleading information
during its initial public offering (IPO) in 1996 and in its 1997
annual report.
</P>
<P>
According to the company's announcement on the Shanghai
Securities News today, the CSRC charges the company in northeast
China's Daqing City, an oil-producing town in Heilongjiang
Province, to recover 480 million yuan it raised through the IPO
and invest it in projects promised in its prospectus.
</P>
<P>
Xue Yonglin, former chairman of the board of directors, was
banned from taking senior management positions in any listed
company or securities companies for signing the 1997 annual report,
which recorded a non-existent profit of 28 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Eight members of the board of directors were warned and fined
for signing the prospectus and the 1997 annual report.

Zhang Dasheng, chairman of the board of directors during the
IPO, escaped penalty for falsifying documents and fraud because of
his sudden death.
</P>
<P>
According to information disclosed by Chinese authorities in
November 1999, officials of the company were also suspected of
bribery, corruption and embezzlement of public fund. Thirty-nine
government and company officials involved in the case were
punished.

other company officials were imprisoned.

<HEADLINE> Legislators Show Concern for Rights of Seed Breeders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators have shown
deep concern for the rights of seed breeders during a group
discussion on the draft of the Seed Law at the current session of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Wang Youhui said the rights of the breeders have for long been
ignored, as they merely get a token pay for breeding new species.
</P>
<P>
Many speakers proposed that the rights of these breeders be
defined more clearly in the law.
</P>
<P>
Wang also suggested protecting the rights of those who are
engaged in spreading new seed species.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jisong expressed disagreement over Clause 27 of the draft
which allows farmers to sell extra seeds they have bred for their
own use. Wei said he has discovered in a local market in Nanjing,
the provincial capital of Jiangsu, that the quality of seeds are
getting worse because farmers are selling their seeds there.
</P>
<P>
He asked that the clause be abolished, insisting that the
administration of seeds may become out of control if farmers are
allowed to sell seeds without government certification.
</P>
<P>
But Tao Siju aired a different view, fearing that the adoption
of a certification system may hamper the breeding of farm seeds.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion, Xie Youqing proposed stricter control on
transgenetic seeds by "adopting stricter safety-control measures."
But Zhang Haoruo opposed Xie's suggestion, saying that an
appraisal of the safety of transgenetic seeds would take too long
and increase the cost.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that it is necessary to create a seed
law that protects the interests of farmers and boosts the
development of agriculture and forestry in China.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Criticizes Britain for Conditional Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Industry and Commerce
Minister Nathan Shamuyarira Thursday criticized the British
government for laying down pre-conditions prior to the crucial
negotiations on the land acquisition program of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The minister questioned the British conditional offer a day
before Thursday's meeting expected to pave the way for the
resumption of financial assistance for the land reform program.
</P>
<P>
Shamuyarira, who is a member of the Zimbabwean delegation in
London, for the talks, described the move by Britain as
unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that they have put minimum conditions," he
said in a telephone interview with The Zimbabwe News Agency.
"You do not start negotiations by putting conditions. We will
discuss these conditions at the meeting," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain has offered financial assistance on condition Zimbabwe
ordered the war veterans from commercial farms they had been
occupying, parliamentary elections be held soon and the rule of
law is upheld.
</P>
<P>
Britain is prepared to offer a conditional package of 36
million pounds Sterling for the Zimbabwe's land acquisition
program.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions are not difficult to fulfil," said Shamuyarira.
 "We, as a government, want to see the end of violence. We have
been fighting for the rule of law. Police are arresting people.
The issue on elections is a none issue."
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe would not order war veterans to pull out from
about 1, 000 commercial farms they had been occupying in the last
two months.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean delegation, he said, was still optimistic about
the outcome of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
London insists it was committed to supporting a transparent,
fair and cost effective program of land reform.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has told London it would compulsorily acquire farms
for resettlement if Britain failed to provide funds for
compensating farmers.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champ Nearly Quits over Doping Suspicion (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Olympic and world singles and
doubles champion Liu Guoliang had thought of quitting the sport
and running away from spotlight after being notified last October
of a positive test of his.
</P>
<P>
"You can hardly imagine what kind of life I led in the past six
months," said the 24-year-old Chinese, who was on Wednesday
cleared by the International Table Tennis Federation of any doping
offense.
</P>
<P>
"I told my brother that I would retire although I am able to
win at least one gold medal from the Olympic Games this summer and
the 2001 world championships," said Liu. His brother Guodong is a
coach on the Chinese Army Team.
</P>
<P>
Liu had tested positive for elevated levels of epitestosterone
August 8, when he won the world singles championship in the
Netherlands. He had tested negative a day earlier after taking the
men's doubles with Kong Linghui.
</P>
<P>
ITTF notification of his positive test came on October 24, 1999,
when he was playing the Austrian Open.
</P>
<P>
The world table tennis ruling body cleared Liu after a three-
month investigation, including two unannounced tests in February.
The Chinese Table Tennis Association told Xinhua on Wednesday the
ITTF investigation showed "no evidence for exogenous origin of
epitestosterone" and "no doping offense".
</P>
<P>
"It was a shock when I heard of positive test," Liu recalled,
voice shaking. "How could this happen to me. Someone said I had
been lucky, but I won 10 Olympic, world championships and World
Cup titles with my own efforts, and I won cleanly and fairly.
</P>
<P>
"Should I have been punished for winning too many, don't punish
me in this way. Just let me lose forever. Or just take away 10
gold medals and give me a clean name."
</P>
<P>
Liu didn't know why a positive test followed a negative one. "I
was negative on August 7. I didn't eat breakfast next morning. I
just drank a cup of milk before the games. I have been very
careful with eating and drinking. I never drink a bottle of water
which is not opened by myself," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to look back the past six months. When I was driving
alone, tears rolled down my cheeks. I couldn't help it," Liu
admitted.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the Chinese officials and coaches had never lost trust
in him.
</P>
<P>
"Minutes after we lost to Sweden in the final (of the world
team championship in Kuala Lumpur in February), when Li Furong
whispered into my ears: 'Guoliang, I understand you, trust you, I
nearly burst into tears," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Li, a former world table tennis champion, is vice president of
both the Chinese Olympic Committee and the Chinese Table Tennis
Association.
</P>
<P>
"The nightmare is over. I feel relieved now," said Liu.

HONG KONG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong

<HEADLINE> China's E-Commerce Websites Tops 1,000: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide survey released
China had had more than 1,100 consumer related e-commerce websites
by the end of the first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese e-commerce is still at very preliminary stage,
with sales volume much lower than developed countries, according
to a survey released here today.
</P>
<P>
The survey was jointly conducted by the Computer and
Microelectronics Industry Development Research Center under the
Ministry of Information Industry and CCIDNET Consulting, a network
company.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, China's e-retailing sales volume totaled 55 million
yuan, accounting for merely 0.018 per thousand of the country's
total retail sales.
</P>
<P>
Only 20.3 percent of Internet users have on-line shopping
experience and only 40 percent of them are satisfied with on-line
transactions.
</P>
<P>
Among all the e-retailing websites, 8848.net is mostly used by
Chinese Internet users. Eachnet and Yabuy both rank first among on-
line auction websites. More than 80 percent of the Internet users
worry about the security of on-line transactions.
</P>
<P>
Although consumer related e-commerce is still at its early
stages in China, Chinese Internet users are confident in on-line
transactions, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 percent of Chinese Internet users would like to take
part in at least one kind of on-line transaction this year, and 70
percent of them will experience on-line shopping, which shows that
this market has great potential in the future.

<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China will launch health care
reforms to cut off redundant staff and encourage competition,
according to a meeting of personnel held by the Ministry of Health
in Beijing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health has decided to spend three to five
years to form a new personnel system under which medical
organizations at all levels have the rights to select their
employees while medical staff can choose positions according to
their ability.
</P>
<P>
The new system will provide a more flexibility in management,
payment and promotion. Everybody will be judged according to their
performance, and no position will be permanent.
</P>
<P>
After the reforms are implemented, the number of people with
professional skills will make up 80 percent of the total number of
staff in the medical system. Work of officials at the grass-roots
levels will be appraised by their subordinates.
</P>
<P>
The distribution system will also be reformed to guarantee that
those who have higher professional skills provide better medical

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Urges to Improve Social Security System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- To accelerate the building of a
unified, standard and sound national social security system is
fundamental to deepening reform, stabilizing society, and
developing the nation.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji made the remark during an inspection tour
from April 19 to 27 in Liaoning Province, a major industrial base
and home to a large number of state-owned enterprises in northeast
China.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with local officials and residents, the premier
stressed the importance of ensuring that the social security
benefits are given to pension-holders and laid off factory workers
timely and in full amount.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China and the government have attached
great importance to the fundamental rights and interests of the
working people as well as social security, Zhu said, and a series
of policies and regulations have been drawn up for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
A pressing job at the moment is to seriously implement these
policies and regulations to ensure the basic life of the majority
of laid off state-owned factory workers and retired workers, as
well as the minimum standard of living for unemployed urban
residents, said the premier.

<HEADLINE> Barak Mulls Release of Palestinian Murderers: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is examining the possibility of releasing Palestinian
inmates "with Israelis' blood on their hands," who were jailed in
Israeli prisons for murdering Jews.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of such releases, including seven Palestinian
killers who have served their terms for more than 20 years, will be
discussed at some stage in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, the
local Ha'aretz daily Thursday quoted a senior political source as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The new position might mark a policy change on the issue as
Israel's traditional release criteria prohibited freeing those
prisoners convicted of murdering Israelis, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Israel's General Security Service (Shin
Bet) submitted a recommendation to Barak about the release of
Palestinian prisoners within the framework of the 1993 Oslo peace
accords between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Shin Bet recommended that any future release of the
prisoners should not be carried out on the basis of their criminal
actions, but only on the basis of their affiliated organization.
</P>
<P>
All prisoners, who belong to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
Fatah movement and other Palestinian organizations supporting the
Oslo peace process, should thus be released immediately,
irrespective of what they were convicted of.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all prisoners belonging to the Islamic militant group
Hamas and Islamic Jihad, who are adamantly opposed to the peace
process, should remain in jail until their terms are finished.
</P>
<P>
The new release criterion of Shin Bet was reportedly based on
experience of previous releases, showing that the released Fatah
prisoners would join the Palestinian National Authority bureaucracy
and become an adamant force supporting the peace talks, while the
Hamas prisoners tended to return to their militant operations.
</P>
<P>
The Shin Bet opinion reportedly garnered support from some
cabinet ministers, including Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-
Ami, and officers of other security bodies and the Israel Defense
Forces.
</P>
<P>
However, the right-wing Likud party had warned that such a
recommendation should be rejected by the government as the new
release approach is "politically foolish and a moral crime."
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure, Barak initially decided to turn down the
recommendation. But the Ha'aretz report said Thursday that Barak
will reconsider his position on the issue if the final-status talks
between Israel and the Palestinians are concluded successfully.
</P>
<P>
A two-week session of such peace talks between negotiators from
both sides is scheduled to begin in Israel's Red Sea resort city of
Eilat on April 30, after two rounds in the United States earlier
failed to bring about any major breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Palestinian chief negotiator for interim issues Saeb
Erekat and his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran already met in Jericho
to discuss further release of Palestinian prisoners, but no
substantial progress was made.
</P>
<P>
Erekat reportedly had submitted a list of prisoners it wants
released. The Palestinian side insist that the two sides must agree
on who are to be freed, while Israelis said the list can only be
decided by them.  Israel has freed nearly 400 Palestinians and
other Arab prisoners in the past few years under a series of
interim peace deals, including the Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum,
which Barak and Arafat signed last December.
</P>
<P>
The latest release of 15 prisoners happened on March 20, at the
end of the four-day Muslim festival Eid al-Adha, or Feast of
Sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
According to Palestinian senior political sources, Israel is
still holding 1,550 Palestinian prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Judiciary Defends Closure of Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative judiciary on
Thursday defended its recent closure of a number of reformist
papers and periodicals, criticizing "certain groups and people" for
objecting the move.
</P>
<P>
These periodicals and dailies were closed down because they had
published articles against religious sanctities and social rights
as well as pillars of the holy Islamic system, said a statement
issued by the Justice Department in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, the judiciary suspended the publication of
10 dailies and 4 periodicals in an unprecedented move to crack down
on the country's reformist press.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the stepped-up efforts of the conservatives,
who are the real rulers of the Islamic country, to curb the
reformist campaign which has been growing since President Mohammed
Khatami took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Reformers allied to Khatami won a landslide victory in the
February parliamentary election, ending the long time conservative
majority in the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The victory, however, has prompted a backlash from the
conservatives, who have recently used their power to jail reformist
journalists and close down reformist papers.
</P>
<P>
The statement criticized "certain groups and people", especially
the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, for expressing
unsound and unexpected views on the "legal and religious" move to
order the temporary closure of the papers, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It referred to certain articles of the Press Law, saying that
dailies shall be free to publish unless they violate the
foundations and rules of Islam and public rights.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance Tuesday frowned
at the closure of reformist papers, saying the act will damage the
press freedom atmosphere in the country.
</P>
<P>
To muzzle the press will be to prevent healthy public
information system nationally and generate and reinforce
politically destructive rumors, said an official communique issued
by the ministry, which has constitutional supervision over the
publications in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, led by press freedom advocate Ataollah Mohajerani,
called on government branches to recognize the dignity of the craft
of journalism and eschew from any measure that might restrict the
constitutional freedom of the press in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Other groups, such as the Association of Journalists and the
Islamic Commission of Human Rights, also condemned the judiciary's
move. Students from major Iranian cities also launched protests
against the move.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Presidential Election Starts Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Eleven candidates will be competing
for the next Turkish presidency as the first round of voting takes
place in the parliament after 15:00 local time (1200 GMT) on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among them, the presiding judge of the Constitutional Court
Ahmet Sezer, who is the joint candidate of the three ruling parties
and the two main oppositions Virtue Party and True Path Party, and
parliament speaker Yildirim Akbulut are seen as the strongest
contenders.
</P>
<P>
While Sezer, who is from outside the parliament, has secured the
support of the leaders of all five parties represented in the
legislative body, Akbulut is relying on the support he expects to
get from those deputies who resent the party leaders' nomination of
a non-deputy candidate.
</P>
<P>
Akbulut poses serious challenge to Sezer as he reacted angrily
to the consensus reached by the five party leaders, saying that "
you will do an injustice to parliament if you say that no president
can come out of this parliament. As the speaker, I protest such an
attitude."
</P>
<P>
As a former prime minister and interior minister as well as a
three-time Speaker, "I am an impartial and sufficiently experienced
candidate for the presidency," Akbulut told the deputies.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Sezer will likely win out in the first round
if deputies submit to their party leaders' will.
</P>
<P>
In the secret ballots, however, some maverick deputies may
repeat their defections seen during last month's vote, which dashed
the coalition leaders' hope to pass a constitutional amendment for
President Suleyman Demirel's second term in office.
</P>
<P>
Party leaders are attempting to have Sezer elected by the end of
the first three rounds without having to stage a fourth and final
round.
</P>
<P>
According to the election procedures, a candidate needs a two-
thirds (367 votes) majority in the 550-seat Grand National Assembly
(parliament) to win the electionsin the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
If deputies fail to choose a president in the first two rounds,
276 votes will be sufficient in the third and fourth rounds.
</P>
<P>
The third round will take place on May 5, and in case of
failure, two candidates who win the highest votes in the third
round will attend the last round.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election in the parliament must be concluded
before Demirel steps down on May 16.
</P>
<P>
If agreement can't be reached in the fourth round, parliament
will be dissolved immediatly for a new general election in
accordance with the Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Parliament Supports Wahid's Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We still gives support to the president (Wahid). But we urge
him to pay more attention on the on-going economic recovery
program. So far, we still don't think about withdrawing our
political backing. But we will remind him and may criticize him,"
House Speaker Akbar Tandjung told reporters after attending a
Consultation Meeting with the president at the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
But, Tandjung said that there is no guarantee from the House
that in the future there will be no problem in connection with
such support to keep its political backing to the president to run
this country for five years.
</P>
<P>
"No, I can't give such a guarantee that there will be no
problem in the future,"Tandjung said without details.
</P>
<P>
"I can say that so far, there is no problem at all with our
support. But we see that there is many critical views, and will be
many critical views which are directed to him in connection with
his policies," Tandjung added.
</P>
<P>
Tandjung further said that in the course of the meeting, both
sides(president and the House) discussed many recent issues such
as replacement of cabinet ministers, the on-going economic
recovery program, and the possible removal of the MPR decree on
communism.
</P>
<P>
"But the most important point is that we urge the president to
pay more attention on economic issues. Because, as we know, so far
there is no significant signs that foreign investors are
interested to come and invest their capital here due to
uncertainty of the political situation in this country. We are
really concerned and have urged the president to be serious on
this point," Tandjung said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid infuriated his main coalition partners on Tuesday when he
sacked two ministers, and some party leaders had threatened to
withdraw their members from the cabinet in protest.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal of the ministers from the two biggest political
parties in the parliament caused deep concern in local financial
markets, sending them to six-month lows on fears that a growing
divide between Wahid and some of his coalition partners would
further delay the country's ongoing economic recovery program.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champ Nearly Quits over Doping Suspicion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Olympic and world singles and
doubles champion Liu Guoliang had thought of quitting the sport
after being notified last October of a positive test of his.
</P>
<P>
"You can hardly imagine what kind of life I led in the past six
months," said the 24-year-old Chinese, who was on Wednesday
cleared by the International Table Tennis Federation of any doping
offense.
</P>
<P>
"I told my brother that I would retire although I am able to
win at least one gold medal from the Olympic Games this summer and
the 2001 world championships," said Liu. His brother Guodong is a
coach on the Chinese Army Team.
</P>
<P>
Liu had tested positive for elevated levels of epitestosterone
August 8, when he won the world singles championship in the
Netherlands. He had tested negative a day earlier after taking the
men's doubles with Kong Linghui.
</P>
<P>
ITTF notification of his positive test came on October 24, 1999,
when he was playing the Austrian Open.
</P>
<P>
The world table tennis ruling body cleared Liu after a three-
month investigation, including two unannounced tests in February.
The Chinese Table Tennis Association told Xinhua on Wednesday the
ITTF investigation showed "no evidence for exogenous origin of
epitestosterone" and "no doping offense".
</P>
<P>
"It was a shock when I heard of positive test," Liu recalled,
voice shaking. "How could this happen to me. Someone said I had
been lucky, but I won 10 Olympic, world championships and World
Cup titles with my own efforts, and I won cleanly and fairly.
</P>
<P>
"Should I have been punished for winning two many, don't punish
me in this way. Just let me lose forever. Or just take away 10
gold medals and give me a clean name."
</P>
<P>
Liu didn't know why a positive test followed a negative one. "I
was negative on August 7. I didn't eat breakfast next morning. I
just drank a cup of milk before the games. I have been very
careful with eating and drinking. I never drink a bottle of water
which is not opened by myself," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to look back the past six months. When I was driving
alone, tears rolled down my cheeks. I couldn't help it," Liu
admitted.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the Chinese officials and coaches had never lost trust
in him.
</P>
<P>
"Minutes after we lost to Sweden in the final (of the world
team championship in Kuala Lumpur in February), when Li Furong
whispered into my ears: 'Guoliang, I understand you, trust you, I
nearly burst into tears," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Li, a former world table tennis champion, is vice president of
both the Chinese Olympic Committee and the Chinese Table Tennis
Association.
</P>
<P>
"The nightmare is over. I feel relieved now," said Liu.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A five-year project to provide
China with 80,000 tons of wheat for poverty relief was launched
here today by the UN World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
According to the project, the aid will help some 400,000 poor

relief. China's poor population were reduced to 34 million in 1999
from 230 million in 1978, Liu said, adding that eradicating
poverty is still a tough job for the government.
</P>
<P>
Else Larsen, WFP Representative in China, said that China has
recorded impressive achievements in eliminating poverty. " We are
very pleased with the Chinese government for gradually increasing
cost sharing with WFP for this and future projects," she said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, WFP has provide China with 64 food aid projects
worth near 900 million US dollars, the largest among all UN
institutions. The aid has played an important role in improving
the life of farmers and production in China's poor areas, said Liu.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Recreation facilities across
China will be carefully examined and checked before "Children's
Day" on June 1.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made recently by nine departments, including
the State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision, the
Ministry of Construction, the Ministry of Public Security, and the
National Tourism Administration. Similar check-up were done the
same time last year.
</P>
<P>
Safety of the recreation facilities has once again caught the
attention of the public, especially after two high school students
in Tianjin were badly injured when they took part in "bungee"
jumping on April 16.

<HEADLINE> Barak Set to Transfer to Palestinians Village Near Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak intends to transfer soon to full Palestinian control the
village of Abu Dis, as an "advance" of Israel's next troop
redeployment in the West Bank, the local daily Ha'aretz Thursday
quoted a senior political source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Barak is expected to bring the proposal to his Security Cabinet
for approval next week and such a move will allay Palestinian
suspicions that Israel intends to use delaying tactics in the talks
so as to avoid transferring significant territory to the
Palestinians, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dis, which is adjacent to Jerusalem, is now part of the so-
called Area B, where Israel is in control of security while the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) exercises civilian
administration.
</P>
<P>
PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat requested Barak a few months ago to
transfer Abu Dis to full Palestinian control as stipulated in the
Sharm el Sheikh peace deal signed last September.
</P>
<P>
When Barak brushed aside the request on the account that the
transfer of areas close to Jerusalem entailed political problems
and that it would be better to wait for the permanent settlement,
Arafat suspended the talks with Israel for two months.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, Israel
will transfer to the Palestinians the areas of the West Bank that
are not "specified military locations" or areas the status of which
will be decided in the permanent settlement, such as Jerusalem and
the Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Based on this, the PNA's position is that Israel must vacate at
least 90 percent of the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Vacillates on U.N. Presence in South Amid Syrian "Doubts" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
drew back what he said on Wednesday about the presence of
international peace-keeping force in south Lebanon after scheduled
Israeli pullout, Oriental Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said Lebanon will not "guard the border for Israel" and the
presence of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in
south Lebanon should get the Lebanese government's permission
</P>
<P>
Hoss held Israel responsible for any blunder that may happen in
south Lebanon after its withdrawal as the Jewish state did not
realize a comprehensive peace with Arabic countries, the radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Hoss said on Wednesday that Lebanon will invite UNIFIL
to fill the vacuum in south Lebanon after Israel's pullout by July
and assured that the situation will be under control so as to
enable the legitimate authorities to extend their sovereignty of
the sea, air and land to the liberated areas.
</P>
<P>
However, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh, whose country is
Lebanon's main power broker, cast doubt on Wednesday on the ability
of the U.N. to maintain security in south Lebanon, saying a
deployment of international forces after the impending Israeli
withdrawal was "highly sensitive and hypothetical."
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL is expected to be reinforced from the current 4,500
members to 7,000 if it should take on the peacekeeping task in
south Lebanon after Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese leaders have never declared that the Lebanese army will
be deployed in the vacated area in south Lebanon. Lebanon has
reiterated that it will not guarantee the security of northern
Israel as Palestinian guerrillas will fight for the right to go
home.
</P>
<P>
Some 360,000 Palestinian refugees have been taking shelter in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has notified the U.N. that it is determined to pull out
its troops from south Lebanon completely by July with or without an
agreement with Lebanon or Syria, which has 35,000 troops deployed
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978. It set up
the present "security zone" in 1985 with the excuse of protecting
its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> Target Date for Framework Deal May be Postponed: Israeli Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The target date for concluding a
framework agreement on the final-status issues between Israel and
the Palestinians will likely be put off again from the end of May
to the end of June, the Israeli daily Ha'aretz reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted political sources as saying that two months
of work will be needed to complete the agreement and prepare for a
trilateral summit in Washington at which U.S. President Bill
Clinton will host Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
A similar signal was sent by United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who said in Washington on Wednesday that in the
six or eight weeks ahead, "very intensive" work will be needed on
the Israeli-Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Clinton told Arafat in Washington last
week that a summit will be held only if substantial progress is
made in the talks with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The previous round of Israeli-Palestinian talks, held at a U.S.
Air Force base near Washington, ended two weeks ago with the
preparation of a two-page "skeleton agreement," which specifies the
clauses to be included in the framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are supposed to ameliorate the skeleton agreement and
start fleshing it out in the next round of talks to be held on
April 30 in the Israeli Red Sea city of Eilat, about 200 kilometers
south of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Mideast special envoy Dennis Ross is expected to
monitor the Eilat talks and conduct a shuttle between Barak and
Arafat in a bid to speed up the adoption of decisions.
</P>
<P>
Ross will give Barak a detailed report on the Arafat-Clinton
talks when he arrives in Israel at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sharm el Sheikh agreement signed last year,
Israel and the Palestinians were to have reached a framework
agreement on the final-status issues on February 13.
</P>
<P>
After missing the deadline without anything on paper regarding
the final-status issues such as the fate of Jerusalem, the Jewish
settlement and Palestinian refugees, both sides compromised over a
three-month postponement of the framework deadline.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't Negotiates for Release of Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao,said in a radio interview that he has sent a
representative to negotiate with the rebels who are demanding a 2.
4-million-U.S.-dollar ransom for the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Misuari, also heading the Moro National Liberation Front, was
appointed Wednesday by Philippine President Joseph Estrada as the
government's negotiator with the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado confirmed
Wednesday that the hostages abducted from Malaysia had been found
in Sulu province, about an hour's boat ride from Sipadan Island,
Malaysia where the abduction took place.
</P>
<P>
Mercado, who visited Sulu on Wednesday, also confirmed the
participation of the Muslim rebel group Abu Sayyaf in the
abduction.
</P>
<P>
He said the hostages have been divided into several groups and
are being moved around the town of Talipao, 16 km away from Jolo,
the capital city of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said the hostages are "safe, sound and alive" in the
hands of the captors, adding that "our prime concern will always
be the safety of the captives."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mercado said he has given military officials the
blanket authority on what actions to take against the captors.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller of two groups fighting for an
independent Islamic state in Mindanao. They are under attack at
their stronghold in Basilan province by Philippine troops trying
to rescue some 27 hostages kidnapped on March 20.
</P>
<P>
The other rebel Muslim group is the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front which has been fighting for an independent Muslim state
during the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
The hostages seized in Malaysia on Sunday include two Filipinos,
at least eight Malaysians, three Germans, two French nationals,
two South Africans, Two Finns and a Lebanese woman.

<HEADLINE> Many Australian Aborigines Live Without Reliable  Water, Sewerage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Many Australian Aboriginal
communities are living without reliable power and water supplies
or working sewerage systems, the Australian Bureau of Statistics
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's survey found that while almost all permanent
dwellings in Aboriginal communities were connected to water, power
and sewerage, there were substantial problems with the operation
of the services.
</P>
<P>
It found that in the 348 communities with a population of 50 or
more people, 58 communities' water supply failed testing.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found 57 communities had frequent power
interruptions and 204 had leakage or overflows in the sewerage
systems.
</P>
<P>
The survey, commissioned by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Commission, found that almost 110,000 people, or 27
percent of Australia's estimated indigenous population, live in 1,
300 locations identified as discrete indigenous communities.
</P>
<P>
About one in three permanent homes in the communities required
major repair or replacement, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> Alliance Formed to Lobby for Australian Aboriginal Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Australia's peak medical groups
Thursday joined forces to try to disprove myths that the problem
of Aboriginal health is too hard to fix and that money spent on it
is wasted.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) and the National
Aboriginal Community Control Health Organization (NACCHO)
announced an alliance aimed at advancing the cause of indigenous
health.
</P>
<P>
AMA President David Brand said poor health outcomes for
Aboriginal Australians continued to be a major blemish on the
national health care record.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to see an acceleration in improved health outcomes,
we need additional resources allocated at a national, state and
territory level," Brand said.
</P>
<P>
"This new partnership will help focus national attention on the
problem, promote better understanding of the issues and - we hope -
build on what has been achieved to date," he added.
</P>
<P>
NACCHO Chairman Puggy Hunter said the new alliance would bring
greater coordination to the battle to improve Aboriginal health.
</P>
<P>
"A stronger, better coordinated and more sophisticated approach
to lobbying presents a way forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two groups would also work to counter the view that little
could be done to improve poor health outcomes for indigenous
Australians.
</P>
<P>
They said that evidence from New Zealand, Canada and the United
States showed that substantial improvements in the life expectancy
of the Aboriginal people can be achieved in just two or three
decades.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Presidency Denies Plot to Oust Senate President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Presidency Wednesday
refuted allegations of sponsoring a plot to oust Senate President
Chuba Okadigbo, stressing that events in the National Assembly
were purely internal.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper quoted Information
Minister Jerry Gana as saying at the end of Wednesday's Federal
Executive Council (FEC) meeting that he wondered why the
Presidency could embark on such a scheme in view of its pledge to
uphold the integrity of the nation and the public good.
</P>
<P>
Most Nigerian newspapers Wednesday reported alleged attempt of
the presidency to organize impeachment of Okadigbo and his deputy
Haruna Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The National Assembly may have created problems
within itself. The reaction to the impeachment moves against
President Olusegun Obasanjo has been that of wide condemnation
all over the country and in some parts of the world and if there
are certain reactions to that, they have nothing to do with the
Presidency."
</P>
<P>
Gana said the problems of the National Assembly were purely
internal, he pointed out that if anything was happening with the
leadership of the Upper House, it might be a fallout of the
impeachment plot against President Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that "the crisis is not from the
Presidency of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, because both the
Judiciary, National Assembly and the Executive are one
government.
</P>
<P>
"The three are very important to the survival of democracy. The
 Presidency having the overall leadership cannot afford to
destabilize any arm of government because that will cause
instability in the whole administration."
</P>
<P>
The information minister said, "people underrated Nigerian's
reactions and resolve to protect their democracy and against
dictatorship. We should even be pitied and now what they started
is backfiring on them.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you, Nigerians would be angry with anybody who
wants to destabilize their most cherished democracy. Please don't
blame the executive for the crisis in the National Assembly," he
said.

<HEADLINE> World Price Fluctuation Blamed for Ghana's Currency Devaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's Finance Minister Kwame
Peprah said the steep decline in the price of cocoa and rise in
the price of oil in the world market led to the devaluation of the
country's currency cedi, Ghana News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cedi devaluated more than eighty percent last year, according
to the agency.
</P>
<P>
Peprah said in the west African country's capital Accra on
Wednesday that in 1998 Ghana sold a ton of cocoa for 1,600 U.S.
dollars and bought crude oil at 11 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we are selling a ton of cocoa at 800 dollars and buying
a barrel of crude oil at about 22 dollars."
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said "there is light at the tunnel" as
government has initiated moves with its donor partners to fill in
the projected gap of 150 million dollars in cash flow as export
earnings have steeply declined.
</P>
<P>
Peprah said the government has advanced the inflow of 200
million dollars due in the second half of the year to the first
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
He announced that 50 million dollars has already been received
and the remaining 150 million dollars is expected shortly.
</P>
<P>
Peprah said the Ghanaian economy has been and is still too
import dependent in spite of efforts made to curb it.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that the nation's ability to continue to maintain
current import levels depends on its ability not just to export
more, but to change its export patterns by reducing its dependence
on cocoa with items better withstand price fluctuations in the
world market.
</P>
<P>
He said the country must reduces imports with substitution of
locally made product.

<HEADLINE> China Asks U.S. to Honor Its Pledge on PNTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China hopes the United States
will take concrete actions to honor its pledge on the issue of
permanent normal trade relations, Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Sun Yuxi said today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said at a press conference that the U.S.
Administration has made a solemn pledge when it reached a
bilateral agreement with China last year that it will endeavor to
pass the PNTR.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the U.S. side ...will pass the PNTR issue in a timely,
clear-cut and unconditional manner," said Sun.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned that if the PNTR issue is not passed,
China-U.S. relationship will suffer. In particular, the interests
of U.S. companies in China will be affected. It will also be
unfavorable for the U.S. to compete with other countries in the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.S. pledge on the PNTR issue is a
prerequisite for the China-U.S. WTO agreement. If this problem is
not resolved, the bilateral agreement will have no basis for
implementation.
</P>
<P>
"We are unwilling to see that happen any way," Sun said.

<HEADLINE> White Ants Damage 15 Reservoir Dams in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- White ants dug their way through
dams of 15 reservoirs in the rural part of Wuhan, capital of
central China's Hubei Province, posing a serious threat to the
reservoirs, China Youth Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The biggest white ant nest found inside the Xiao'ao Reservoir
dam was over two meters in diameter, spacious enough for a small
motor vehicle, the paper said, quoting a local government source.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one out of the 65 reservoir dams surveyed were damaged to
varying degrees by white ants, posing a threat to the reservoirs
and residents nearby.
</P>
<P>
Some 160 white ant nests were discovered along the embankments
of nine large reservoirs and 56 smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, leading water conservancy officials in
Wuhan have ferreted out the white ants by using pesticides just
before the flood season starts on May 1.
</P>
<P>
White ants have been constant threat to dams and river banks in
the region, including the Hubei section of the Yangtze River in
the middle reaches.

<HEADLINE> Symposium Statement Opposes Taiwan Independence (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A two-day symposium of Anti-
Taiwan Independence and Promoting China's Reunification concluded
in this southern Chinese city today.
</P>
<P>
The seven organizers of the symposium, including the Beijing-
based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and
Taiwan-based China Reunification League, expressed in a statement
their strong will to fight against "Taiwan independence", their
desire for peace and reunification of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The statement stresses that there is only one China in the
world and Taiwan is part of China, and that China's territorial
and sovereignty integrity will not be severed.
</P>
<P>
Any form of separatist activities goes against the fundamental
interests of the Chinese nation and the general wishes of people
on both sides of the Straits.
</P>
<P>
Separatist activities should be checked resolutely, as they
will surely lead to tensions and crises in the cross-Straits
relations and threaten the interests of people on both sides of
the Straits.
</P>
<P>
The statement notes that the one China principle represents the
basis and prerequisite of the development of cross-Straits ties.
It also forms the basis and prerequisite of China's peaceful
reunification.

<P>
To have dialogues and negotiations with the one China principle
as the basis constitutes the only way for the realization of peace
and reunification between the two sides on the Straits, it says.
</P>
<P>
The document points out that the change of leaders in Taiwan
does not mean that Taiwan has become independent or that the
hostile status between the two sides on both sides of the Straits
has come to an end.
</P>
<P>
At present, the most important thing is to make the Taiwan
authorities accept the one China principle and recognize Taiwan as
part of China.
</P>
<P>
Only in this way can relations between the two sides of the
Straits be improved and bring about lasting peace in the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
The statement stresses that the cross-Straits relations have
entered a crucial stage and that the evolution of the relations,
towards peace or towards war, has a direct bearing on the
fundamental interests of people on both sides of the Straits and
the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
It calls on all organizations and people from all walks of life
on both sides of the Straits to unite, resolutely oppose "Taiwan
independence" and separation, strive for the peaceful growth of
cross-Straits relations and promote peaceful reunification.

and Taiwan attended the two-day symposium, and had heated
discussions on the present cross-Straits relations, the peaceful
growth of relations and the promotion of China's eventual
reunification.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Lebanon Wednesday gave its strongest hint that it will
cooperate in international efforts to maintain peace and stability
in the south of the country after the Israel Defense Forces'
scheduled withdrawal to the international border.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss said in a statement that his
country is likely to agree to the deployment of United Nations
peacekeepers in areas vacated by the IDF.
</P>
<P>
"We have to remind ourselves that the Israeli withdrawal will
not lead to a vacuum threatening security and stability as some
pessimists like to portray," Hoss told news agencies."
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak intends to transfer soon to
full Palestinian control the village of Abu Dis, which is adjacent
to Jerusalem, as an "advance" on account of the IDF's third
redeployment in the West Bank, a senior political source said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Barak is expected to bring the proposal for approval by the
security cabinet next week. Political sources said Barak will also
ask the security cabinet and then the entire cabinet to approve "
dramatic decisions" which will reflect "Israeli positions that are
more far-reaching than in the past" with respect to the Palestinian
independence.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Barak has become much more flexible with regard
to the major issues of the permanent settlement, particularly the
amount of territory that will be transferred to the Palestinian
National Authority.
</P>
<P>
The first such decision will involve the transfer of Abu Dis,
which is now part of Area B under Israeli security and Palestinian
civilian control.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is expected to confer with
the ultra-orthodox religious Shas party's spiritual leader Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef soon, possibly on Friday, to end a long spell during
which the two have not met.
</P>
<P>
Confirming that preparations for the meeting have taken place,
high-ranking One Israel ruling coalition members said that
finalizing the Barak-Yosef encounter hinges on development in the
crisis between Shas and the left-wing Meretz party.
</P>
<P>
The impasse between the two parties has worsened in recent days,
owing to a Shas demand that a 10-million-shekel (about 2.5 million
U.S. dollars) advance be allocated to the party-affiliated
religious school system.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's health system will be hit by a general strike on
Thursday, with all state hospitals operating on Shabbat schedule.
The resumption of the strike is part of the physicians' six-week
struggle for increased wages.
</P>
<P>
The physicians' union, the Israel Medical Association (IMA),
decided to order the strike after their talks with representatives
of the Finance Ministry's wages department and budgetary branch at
the beginning of the week yielded no solution.
</P>
<P>
No further negotiations are planned for Thursday, although the
heads of the IMA struggle will convene, at which point the doctors
are expected to voice their intention of continuing the work
stoppages.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Court Closes Down Another Reformist Weekly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative judiciary has
ordered another reformist weekly to suspend publication, raising
the number of the banned dailies and periodicals to 14.
</P>
<P>
The Ava, a socio-cultural weekly based in Najafabad of the
central Isfahan Province, was told to close down temporarily in a
press court session on Wednesday, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The session was held to investigate charges involving Mostafa
Izadi, managing director of the weekly.
</P>
<P>
Izadi was charged of libel and publication of false news,
distortion of speeches of different people and desecration of the
late supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the
Islamic Republic of Iran, an informed source said.
</P>
<P>
The conservative judiciary closed down nine reformist dailies
and three journals on Sunday and Monday following a warning of the
supreme leader Seyyed Ali Khamenei that a section of the domestic
press was propagating against Islamic principles and becoming bases
of the enemies.
</P>
<P>
The move was considered a stepped-up effort by the
conservatives, who are the real rulers of the country, to crack
down on the reformist campaign fostered by President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's allies won an overwhelming victory in February's
parliamentary election, bringing to an end the long time
conservative majority in the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
But the conservatives, despite their defeat in the election,
still control most of the powerful state organs, including the
military and the judiciary, which they can use to exert pressure on
the reformists.

<HEADLINE> Australian Governor-General to Take Part in  Reconciliation Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deane's official secretary Martin Bonsey also said there was no
suggestion his participation in the ceremony would preclude Prime
Minister John Howard from taking part.
</P>
<P>
A Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation spokeswoman said Deane
had been invited to accept a declaration of reconciliation on
behalf of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman could not say what role Howard would play or
why he had not been invited to receive the document at the
Corroboree 2000 ceremony at the Sydney Opera House on May 27.
</P>
<P>
Deane's leading role could spare Howard the embarrassment of
accepting a document that is likely to contain an apology to
Aborigines that he has ruled out supporting, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The council will begin a three-day meeting Friday to finalize
the wording of the declaration.
</P>
<P>
Howard has already said he will be at Corroboree 2000. The
ceremony will be attended by 2,000 political and community leaders.
</P>
<P>
Bonsey said Deane had sought the advice of the government
regarding aspects of his participation in the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"In the circumstances, the Governor-General is seeking the
advice of the prime minister generally in relation to the ceremony,
" he said.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Tourist Town Isolated Because of Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The tourist town of Daintree, in
the far north of the Queensland state in northeast Australia, was
isolated by floodwaters Thursday as rain continued to cause havoc
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Police said roads to the town were cut, but there were ample
food supplies.
</P>
<P>
The continuing wet has stranded residents and motorists
throughout the waterlogged north, which has been hit by three
cyclones this year, causing hundreds of millions of Australian
dollars worth of damage to property and crops.
</P>
<P>
Emergency services were expected to make food drops to isolated
properties north of Daintree as it was not yet known when roads
would reopen, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 12 students and research assistants from the
University of Sydney, stranded in outback Queensland were expected
to be airlifted to safety later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said a helicopter that had been due to pick
them up Thursday morning had been diverted to make food drops to
properties in the north.
</P>
<P>
The group, which is studying flora and fauna in the region,
have been isolated by flood waters at their camp site since last
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Freezes Cult Leaders' Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Police have frozen two
bank accounts belonging to leaders of the Kanungu doomsday cult,
the New Vision daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One account belonged to the Dominic Kataribaabo at the
Centenary Rural Development Bank, and the other is registered
under Ishayuriro rya Maria Primary School, said the report.
The cult, the Movement for Restoration of the Ten Commandments of
God, burnt to death at least 500 of followers on March 17. Since
then the Police have discovered mass graves on the properties of
the cult leaders, bringing the number of the dead to more than
1,000.
</P>
<P>
"The Police came with a court order and we gave them the
details of the bank accounts," said Mbarara Centenary bank branch
chief Athanasius Mwesigye.
</P>
<P>
Ishayuriro rya Maria bank account had several signatories and
they withdrew most of the money days before the fire in Kanungu
on March 17, a bank official said.
</P>
<P>
The primary school, which was started by the cult, was the
headquarters of the cult. It was closed down after complaints
that the children were abused.
</P>
<P>
The Police launched an investigation last month into the
finances of the cult leaders after discovering that they had
collected millions of Uganda shillings from their followers, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Followers of the cult were required to sell all their property
and give the money to the cult before being admitted as members.

KAMPALA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said that religious extremism will not be tolerated in Uganda,
and he will ensure that Uganda remains a peaceful and organized

<P>
The forces of law and order are still investigating the matter
to establish whether it was a case of mass suicide or mass murder
or a combination of both, the president said in a speech read
Wednesday by Second Deputy Prime Minister Moses Ali at the
seventh graduation ceremony of the Islamic University in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
 The Movement for Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God,
a cult in the east African country, burnt at least 500 of their
followers in Kanungu in southwestern Uganda on March 17. Since
then mass graves were discovered on the properties of the cult
leaders, bringing the number of the dead to more than 1,000.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Sector Still Largest Income Payer in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- State-owned businesses,
government units and organizations in Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong province, still provide the largest source of
income for local residents.
</P>
<P>
Some 66.8 percent of the disposable income for local residents
comes from the state-owned sector, reaching 8,032 yuan (967 US
dollars) per capita last year, according to the latest statistics
from the Municipal Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
This figure is due to the increased income of government
employees as well as retired civil servants last year. The annual
salary of a teacher in Guangzhou averaged 18,000 yuan (2,168 US
dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, improved performance of state-owned enterprises
resulting from restructuring also yielded more profits to pay
salaries. There are 944 state-owned enterprises in Guangzhou,
generating 5.3 billion yuan (638 million US dollars) in profits
last year, up 54.9 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth continued through the first three months of
this year. Statistics showed that the industrial added value in
Guangzhou amounted to 17.7 billion yuan (2.1 billion US dollars)
in the first three months, up 16.7 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned sector earned 22.9 billion yuan (2.7 billion US
dollars) of output value, representing an increase of 20.9 percent
compared with the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Consumer Confidence Surges to New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese consumers have expressed
their highest-level confidence in 20 months in the bright
prospects of the national economy this year, an official report
said today.
</P>
<P>
According to figures in a National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)
report released here today, steady economic growth and development
in the western part of the country helped boost the Consumer
Expectation Index to 95.7 points in March, the highest level since
August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Some 63 percent of consumers believe that the economy will be
better than last year, and 39 percent of consumers expect higher
incomes in the next 12 months, according to the report. The
figures represent an increase of three and two percentage points,
respectively, higher than in February.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the consumers think that the consumer market was
better than their expectations in March.
</P>
<P>
The report also attributed the increase in consumer confidence
to the rapid growth of Internet and the high-tech industry, the
recovery of the global economy and the rebound of China's stock
market in the first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the consumers believe that the government's
move to develop the vast western areas of the country will greatly
push forward economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
According to NBS, the Index of Current Economic Conditions also
continued to rise in March, reaching 92.8 points.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan New Leaders Urged to Give Up Separatist Stance (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The newly-elected leaders of
Taiwan have been urged to recognize that there is only one China
in the world and give up their separatist stance of promoting "
Taiwan independence".
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xun, chairman of the Subcommittee for Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan Compatriots and Overseas Chinese of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the call in his
closing speech here today to the "Anti-Taiwan Independence and
Promoting China's Reunification Symposium."
</P>
<P>
At present, relations between the two sides on the Taiwan
Straits have reached a crucial stage, the CPPCC leader said in his
speech.
</P>
<P>
How relations evolve, towards peace or to war, depends entirely
on whether the Taiwan authorities will maintain the fundamental
interests of the Chinese nation and the happiness of people on
both sides of the Straits, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC leader noted that the mainland has taken note of the
seemingly good gestures from new leaders of Taiwan on some minor
issues of the cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
However, "we also note the fact that the new leaders of Taiwan
have showed no sign of change on whether they recognize the
principle there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part
of China," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that the one China principle represents the
basis and prerequisite of the development of cross-Straits
relations.

<P>
The principle also forms the basis and prerequisite of the
peace and reunification of China, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
To have equal dialogues and negotiations based on the one China
principle constitutes the only way for the realization of peace
and reunification between the two sides of the Straits, Zhu
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the change of leaders in Taiwan does not mean
that Taiwan has become independent or that the hostile status
between the two sides on the Taiwan Straits has come to an end.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing for the time being is that the Taiwan
authorities must accept the one China principle and recognize
Taiwan as part of China.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way can the cross-Straits relations be improved
and the Taiwan Straits enjoy peace," the CPPCC leader stressed.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC leader called on all Chinese on the mainland, Taiwan
as well as overseas to unite in their efforts to oppose "Taiwan
independence" and strive for the growth of cross-Straits ties and
the early realization of peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
For the past 5,000 years, national unity has been the
mainstream of the Chinese history. "This is an inevitable historic
trend that no individuals and forces can alter," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC leader expressed the belief that with the efforts of
people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits and the Chinese in
other parts of the world, the Chinese nation will surely achieve
its goal of national reunification.

</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- If the five parties of Turkey keep their promises to support
the Constitutional Court Presiding Judge Ahmet Sezer as their
single candidate, Sezer will be much likely to receive 367 votes to
be elected as the new Turkish president in the first round of

Milliyet (National):

applications of 13 people for running for the next president on

Virtue Party and Turhan Imamoglu from Democratic Left Party
withdrew later.
</P>

Among the 11 applicants, Sezer and Parliament Speaker Yildirim
Akbulut are considered the favorites in the first round of the
presidential election.

<HEADLINE> NZ Gov't Gives Cool Response to ANZAC Currency Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Zealand Minister of Finance Michael Cullen said here
Thursday that a joint currency with Australia "is not on the
government's agenda", though the issue is worth debating.
</P>
<P>
Cullen was responding to a study released Wednesday evening by
the Wellington-based Institute of Policy Studies, which suggests
New Zealand would benefit economically from a common currency with
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The 130-page report, commissioned by the lobby group, the
Australia-New Zealand business Council, said that an ANZAC dollar
(the proposed name for a common currency of Australia and New
Zealand)would be the logical next step in getting the two
countries' economic relations closer.
</P>
<P>
Chris Mackay, executive director of the Council, said the
growing pressures of global commerce make an Australasian currency
inevitable and it could be the first step to joining a wider
currency bloc, probably led by the United States.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement, Minister Cullen said he welcomes the debate,
but doesn't think the move is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
He said Australia's economy is about seven times bigger than
New Zealand's and a joint currency would lead to Australia
dictating New Zealand's monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of New Zealand's independence, and capacity to
control its own economic destiny, tend to weigh the balance
against monetary union," the New Zealand minister stressed.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- High ranking police officers from
the east African sub-region are attending a three-day meeting in
Kenya's capital Nairobi to map out the strategies against
escalating crimes.
</P>
<P>
The police chiefs from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, the Sudan,
Ethiopia, Rwanda, Burundi as well as representatives from Interpol
Wednesday began their discussions on such issues as cross-border
crimes, illegal drugs and firearms traffic, theft of motor
vehicles and terrorism, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's police chief, Philemon Abong'o, urged the delegates to
deliberate appropriate and workable solution to tackle
cross-border crimes by developing mechanisms to increase vigilance
and genuine cooperation at all major border points.
</P>
<P>
Crimes in the region had become more complicated due to easy
movement of people, goods and services and access to fast and
modern communication facilities, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said modalities and methods must be devised to curb the high
rate of vehicle theft and eradicate illicit cultivation and
traffic in drugs in the region.
</P>
<P>
Peter Kimundi, head of Interpol's Eastern African sub-regional
bureau, emphasized that the joint security was important because
forces could not achieve much by operating solo.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Speaker Slams IMF Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Speaker of the National
Assembly Amusaa Mwanamwambwa has criticized the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) policies for being stiff and hindering the
economic and social development of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the IMF parliamentarian workshop in Lusaka on
Wednesday, Mwanamwambwa said Zambia's obligation to meet IMF
benchmarks and conditions had eroded the country's ability to
adequately provide the basic social needs of the people, Times of
Zambia newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Our country's social and economic development plans are
tailored to meet the benchmarks and conditions set by the IMF and
its co-operating partners in order for Zambia to qualify for
financial assistance in form of loans and grants," the speaker was
quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said while acknowledging the efforts of the IMF and other
creditors in reducing Zambia's debt burden, it had become apparent
that debts were simply unsustainable. The total debt cancellation
would enable Zambia to jump start its economy and face the
challenges of poverty elimination more effectively.
</P>
<P>
Mwanamwambwa said Zambia had been paying debt service of about
200 million U.S. dollars a year which was twice the expenditure on
education and health over the same period.

<HEADLINE> Nike, Adidas Sue U.S. Wal-Mart Over Counterfeit Sportswear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Nike Inc., the world's
largest sportswear maker, and Adidas America, Inc., the U.S. unit
of the German sportswear giant, Wednesday jointly filed suit
against Wal-Mart Stores, alleging the retailer sells counterfeit
Nike and Adidas T-shirts at its wholesale club stores.
</P>
<P>
Adidas and Nike become the fifth and sixth major sportswear
companies to sue Wal-Mart for selling counterfeits in the last two
years, the two companies said in a statement. Nike also alleged
that Wal-Mart has been selling other counterfeit Nike products at
Sam's Club.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Tommy Hilfiger brought two actions against Wal-Mart
for selling counterfeit goods in Sam's Club, in Wal-Mart stores,
and on Wal-Mart Online. Wal-Mart paid out an unprecedented 6.4
million U.S. dollars to settle those lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
In November 1998, Polo Ralph Lauren, Nautica and Fubu lodged
similar claims for counterfeit sales against Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart
recently settled the Polo and Nautica claims by paying 565,000
dollars, while Fubu's claims are still pending.
</P>
<P>
"A suit against Wal-Mart should put the retail industry on
notice that Adidas will not tolerate sales of counterfeit goods
anywhere in the country," said Michael Heilbronner, Associate
Counsel, Intellectual Property, of Adidas America, Inc.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Fight Rebel Ambush, 27 Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Ten Russian servicemen, including
a senior commissioned officer, and 17 rebels were killed when
federal troops confronted another rebel ambush in Chechnya on
Wednesday, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A search group headed by Lieutenant Colonel Shevelyov
encountered a rebel band of over 50 armed men in the southern
outskirts of Serzhen-Yurt Wednesday morning. As the fighting was
raging, another group of rebels attacked the servicemen from the
rear.
</P>
<P>
A special army unit was dispatched to aid Shevelyov's men. The
rebels were scattered and 17 of them were killed, Interfax quoted
Colonel General Valery Manilov, first deputy head of the Russian
General Staff, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops have come under frequent rebel ambushes lately.
Fifteen federal servicemen lost their lives in the previous rebel
attack last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The federal air force has stepped up air raids on rebel
positions in the southern mountains of the breakaway republic,
flying 70 combat missions on Wednesday alone that involved Su-25
attack planes, Su-24 bombers, An-26 and An-30 reconnaissance
aircraft and Mi-24 helicopter gunships, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian media said hostilities in Chechnya might intensify
in the next few days. Interfax quoted sources as saying that the
purpose of the stepped-up campaign is to strip the rebels of their
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Japan's View on Aggressive War to China Unchanged: Mori </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori said Thursday Japan's basic view that its 1937-1945 war with
China was an act of aggression remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"There is no change in our basic view. I simply omitted the
part (about aggression)," said Mori, who was slammed by China on
Wednesday over his recent vague explanation about his view on
Japan's past invasion of China.
</P>
<P>
Mori told a House of Representatives Budget Committee session
Monday that views on war depend on different historic backgrounds,
and whether Japan launched an aggressive war against China in the
past should be judged by people in the process of history.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Japanese Chief
Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki also said Mori's earlier comments did
not indicate a departure from Japan's position on a 1995 statement
issued by then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, which said
Japan's past war against China was an act of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Murayama expressed "deep remorse and a heartfelt apology" for
the "tremendous damage and suffering" inflicted on "the people of
many countries, particularly on those of Asian nations" through
Japan's wartime "colonial rule and aggression."
</P>
<P>
"We will try to avoid any misunderstanding in our efforts to
build good relations between Japan and China, while learning from
the lessons of history," Aoki, the top Japanese government
spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Liu Focuses on Olympics after Doping Scare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Liu Guoliang, who has been
cleared of doping suspicions after a lengthy battle to prove his
innocence, told Xinhua that he has now concentrated on the defense
of two Olympic table tennis titles he won in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"I feel so relieved," said the 24-year-old Chinese. "You can
hardly imagine what a kind of life I led in past six months."
</P>
<P>
After a test in a Dutch laboratory suggested an "elevated value
of epitestosterone", Liu had been under great pressure. "I didn't
take anything illegal, but I didn't know how to explain or
convince others. I couldn't sleep well, often jolted awaken by bad
dreams," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) cleared Liu's
name Wednesday morning after a three-month-long investigation
showed "no evidence for exogenous origin of epitestosterone" in
Liu's samples and there was "no doping offense".
</P>
<P>
"After miserable six months, I will go back to my job -- defend
Olympic gold medals in Sydney," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Liu tested positive on August 8, 1999, the day he won the world
singles championship in Eindhoven of the Netherlands. One day
earlier, he tested negative after taking the men's doubles event
with Kong Linghui.
</P>
<P>
ITTF didn't notify Liu of his positive test until October 24,
1999, when Liu was playing in the Austrian Open.
</P>
<P>
"It was shocking," Liu recalled. " 'You are finished', I talked
to myself. I didn't know what to say, what to do. I called the
Chinese Table Tennis Association (CTTF) and they said they trusted
me."
</P>
<P>
Liu took two unannounced tests by the ITTF investigative
officials on February 2 and 7. Both tests cleared Liu, said CTTA
general secretary Yang Shu'an.
</P>
<P>
"ITTF has used the most advanced method of doping check and
they have proved Liu's innocence," said Yang. Another CTTA
official said the world ruling body of the sport had used "IRMS" --
Isotopic Ratio Measurements, to test Liu's samples.
</P>
<P>
"We've never lost trust in Guoliang," said Chinese head coach
Cai Zhenhua. "We let him play the final of the world team
championships because we believe he is clean."
</P>
<P>
China lost to Sweden 3-2 in the men's final in Kuala Lumpur in
February this year, as Liu lost to both Jan-Ove Waldner and Jorgen
Persson.
</P>
<P>
As a table tennis' all-time great, Liu is one of the two
players in history to have won a "Grand Slam" of Olympic, world
championships and World Cup singles crowns. The other is Waldner.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Latrell Sprewell beat Vince
Carter down the stretch Wednesday night, scoring 13 of New York's
final 17 points as the Knicks came back from a 14-point deficit in
the fourth quarter to beat Toronto 84-83.
</P>
<P>
Carter had a chance to take the final shot, and it looked like
he was going to put it up when he left his feet from 25 feet away
with three seconds left. But he passed to Dee Brown for an open 3-
pointer from the wing.
</P>
<P>
The shot was long, the Knicks rebounded and walked off with a 2-
0 lead in the best-of-five series. Game 3 is Sunday in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell finished with 25 points and combined with Larry
Johnson to score 21 of the Knicks' final 25. Patrick Ewing added
19 points, Allan Houston had 12 and Johnson 11.
</P>
<P>
Carter, rebounding from his ghastly 3-for-20 effort in Game 1,
and led the Raptors with 27 points, but he was unable to stop
Sprewell man-to-man on defense as New York kept running the same
play in the final few minutes.
</P>
<P>
In Portland, Oregon, another sensational performance by Scottie
Pippen pushed the Minnesota Timberwolves close to another first-
round playoff departure.
</P>
<P>
Pippen scored nine of his 21 points in the final 6 1/2 minutes,
including the clinching free throw with 7.9 seconds left Wednesday
night as the Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Timberwolves 86-
82 for a 2-0 lead in their best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
After Damon Stoudamire hit two free throws with 15.4 seconds
left for an 85-82 lead, the Timberwolves got the ball to Malik
Sealy. Pippen was all over him, and Sealy's fallaway 3-point try
was long and to the right off the glass.
</P>
<P>
After the miss, Pippen ran down the rebound, got fouled and
made one of two free throws to seal it.
</P>
<P>
Game 3 is Sunday in Minneapolis.

<HEADLINE> Rivers Becomes NBA's Coach Of The Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Doc Rivers of the Orlando's
Magic Wednesday received the Red Auerbach Trophy as the NBA's
coach of the year, becoming the first recipient who did not lead
his team to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Rivers received 60 votes from a 121-member panel to edge Phil
Jackson (53), who led the Los Angeles Lakers to the best record in
the league. Charlotte's Paul Silas (3), Utah's Jerry Sloan (2) and
Miami's Pat Riley, Phoenix's Scott Skiles and Toronto's Butch
Carter (1 each) also received votes.
</P>
<P>
Rivers began the season with no experience and no stars and got
his team within a win of the postseason. Given a huge rebuilding
job with a squad full of role players and retreads, first-year
coach Rivers guided the Magic to a 41-41 record after many
predicted his team would be lucky to win half that many games.
</P>
<P>
"I said all year that I felt like I was the luckiest coach in
the world because of the guys that I had on the team. Guys that
committed to me, to this organization. If I'm coach of the year,
then I had players of the year, and team of the year," Rivers said.
</P>
<P>
Although Rivers had no coaching experience, he did play 13
years with the Atlanta Hawks, Los Angeles Clippers, New York
Knicks and San Antonio Spurs. After retiring in 1996, he worked
for Turner Sports as a basketball analyst.
</P>
<P>
In addition to being the first to capture the award without
guiding his team to the postseason, the 38-year-old coach is the
third to be recognized with a team that posted a record of .500 or
below, and the fifth honored after his first season.
</P>
<P>
Harry Gallatin (1962-63), Johnny Kerr (1966-67), Mike Schuler (
1986-87) and Larry Bird (1997-98) were the other rookie coaches to
receive the award named in honor of Auerbach, who led the Boston
Celtics to nine NBA titles.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students Burdened by Psychological Pressures: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A latest survey on 1,444 school
students in Tianjin municipality revealed that Chinese students
face severe psychological pressure from parents, school and
society.
</P>
<P>
The survey sponsored by the Tianjin Municipal Youth Working
Committee sampled students aged between six and fourteen, their
parents, teachers and principals in ten schools.
</P>
<P>
Too much homework has been a long-standing problem plaguing
Chinese school students. Chinese education departments have
adopted various policies calling on teachers to reduce homework
for students. However many students do not feel any less
unburdened because of high expectations from parents and the
pressure of sitting for college entrance examination held once a
year. Some students have lost the confidence in their studies
because of these pressure.
</P>
<P>
Parents also pay much attention to the grades of their children,
caring little about their psychological problems and other
interests. Recent reports revealed growing numbers of stressed and
overworked students.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-nine percent of parents said that they hoped that their
children could enter a university after graduating from high
schools.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students in Beijing
between 1997 and 1999, conducted by the Institute of Psychology of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, around 32 percent of high school
students encountered psychological difficulties of one kind or the
other.

<HEADLINE> Younger Chinese Have Stronger Sense of Environment Protection (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chongqing No. 32 Middle School was one of the pioneer
schools that opened environment education classes in China.
Geography, biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, Chinese and
English classes all included topics concerning the environment
said the school principal Zhang Lianying.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that our efforts will have a great impact on families
and contribute greatly to improving the environment across the
nation," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Yongji, a sixteen year old student, used to use styrofoam
food containers for his lunch to save time and trouble. Realizing
the harm of the material for environment, he began to use a
stainless steel container and chopsticks instead.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also persuaded his mother to use washing powder free of
phosphor and urged his father to sort out the garbage before
discarding it.
</P>
<P>
The booming "green schools" throughout China has greatly
improved primary and middle school students' awareness of the
environment, said Wang Lilue, deputy director of the Chongqing
Municipal Environment Education Coordinated Committee.
</P>
<P>
A latest nationwide survey shows that primary and middle school
students have a stronger sense of environment protection than
their parents.
</P>
<P>
"We have confidence that China's environment will be improved
dramatically in the next century," said Wang.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Xu Yaping has been teaching
mathematics in a middle school in Chongqing in southwest China for
ten years. But now, she has to rewrite part of her teaching
material to include environment protection.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great challenge for me to link dull numbers and
geometrical graphics with environment protection," said Xu, "
because that's not what I've learned during my years at college."
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, the school authorities of the Chongqing No. 32
Middle School, where Xu works, asked teachers to supplement their
teaching material with environment protection in a bid to let
students to realize the importance of protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
After a long arduous effort, Xu finally worked out a subject
which combined environmental protection and mathematics. For
example, Xu would ask students to figure out with index and
function methods how many years it would take for 30,000 cubic
meters of forest to disappear if the forest was cut at an average
rate of five percent a year.
</P>
<P>
After students figured out the answer, Xu told them what
important roles forests play in containing water and fighting
against wind and sand and desertification.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shasha, a student, said that she had learnt a lot about
the importance of protecting environment from books. However, "I
could not firmly grasp the reality of the problem. Now I'm shocked
by facts and figures that I have calculated concerning China's
environment."
</P>
<P>
China had witnessed a rapid development of industrialization in
the 1970s and 80s, resulting in a worsening environment and
pollution. Of the world's ten most polluted cities, China has nine.
</P>
<P>
However, with the economic development and the improving living
standard, the environment has become a hot debated issue in China.
Both the central government and the Chinese people are paying much
attention to the problem. Teaching environmental protection has
become a integral component of the curricula in primary and middle
schools.

<HEADLINE> Environment Improved in Central Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The environment in the central part
of the Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China has been greatly
improved thanks to large-scale afforestation and desert control
effort over the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
The temperature in Lhasa, capital of Tibet, Xigaze and 18
counties in Shannan prefecture in the valleys of Yarlung Zangbo
River, Lhasa and Nyang Qu rivers rose an average of one to 1.4
degrees Centigrade, with annual rainfall increasing by between 20.
1 mm and 47.6 mm compared with previous years.
</P>
<P>
The increased rainfall was favorable to the growth of crops and
helped improve the eco-system.
</P>
<P>
The development of agriculture in Lhasa, Xigaze and the 18
counties, the major grain-producing area of Tibet, was listed as a
key state project during the country's five-year plan period for
1991-1995.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the area's forest area increased by 26,
700 hectares. Forest coverage rate increased by 0.78 percentage
points due to large-scale afforestation effort.

<HEADLINE> Australians' Wages Continue to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Australians' average weekly
earnings jumped 1.4 percent in the three months to February 1999,
further increasing the pressure for another rise in interest rates,
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Economists were expecting only a modest increase in wages after
the 1.5 percent rise in November.
</P>
<P>
During the period, average male weekly earnings rose 1.6
percent seasonally adjusted to 823.80 Australian dollars (494.28 U.
S. dollars), up 13.10 Australian dollars (7.86 U.S. dollar) in
three months.
</P>
<P>
Female earnings rose just 0.9 percent to 689.40 Australian
dollars (413.64 U.S. dollars), up 6.50 Australian dollars (3.9 U.S.
dollars) for the quarter, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
The figures were good news for the embattled Australian dollar,
which rose on news of the wages figures.
</P>
<P>
All eyes will now be on Friday's inflation figures, with
another bad result there likely to set the seal on a further rate
rise.

<HEADLINE> Nobel Laureates Support China's Entry Into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A group of well-known American
economists, including 13 Nobel prize winners and 10 former chairs
of the Council of Economic Advisors, have put out a letter urging
support for China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
.
</P>
<P>
The letter was presented at a White House briefing on Tuesday
by Gene Sperling, Director of the National Economic Council;
Martin Bailey, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors;
Lawrence Summers, Secretary of the Treasury; and Robert M. Solow,
Professor Emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
Solow is one of the 13 Nobel laureates who have joined the
White House in its stepped-up efforts to publicize the
significance of China's entry into the world trading bloc. Among
the Nobel prize winners are also Kenneth Arrow, Paul Samuelson,
Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas.
</P>
<P>
"China's entry into the WTO will help sustain the process of
market-oriented reform that began there two decades ago," the
economists said.
</P>
<P>
"These reforms, which have emphasized reliance on markets and
openness to trade and foreign investment and have helped to raise
the standard of living of the average Chinese citizen nearly five-
fold since 1979," Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
Solow said that China's entry into the WTO will give American
businesses and workers access to a large market of a billion and a
quarter people, which needs "an awful lot of stuff for a very long
time."
</P>
<P>
"On the whole it's better for us when our trading partners are
rich than when our trading partners are poor; and for China to
keep growing in economic terms is an advantage for us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Summers said that the Congressional vote on China's trading
status, which is scheduled for the week of May 22, is likely "to
appear in a prominent way in history books 25 or 50 years from now,
" and he hoped that the vote will become "a significant step
forward in American's global economic relations."
</P>
<P>
"I think we would be sacrificing a very important opportunity
to advance American national interests within China and American
national interests in what happens to China if PNTR were not to
pass this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called it "a once-in-a-generation event" to get such a large
number of economists with a broad spectrum of political views to
reach consensus on a major public policy issue like the trading
status with China.
</P>
<P>
Sperling stressed the need to de-link such issues as human
rights, labor rights and religious rights from trading with China.
These issues, he said, should not be handled "in a way that is WTO
inconsistent" or "would be conditional on a trade agreement like
China."
</P>
<P>
Sperling implied that rejecting China PNTR would lead to such a
situation "in which we will open up the largest-growing market in
the world to our competitors, but then go out of our way to deny
those benefits to ourselves."
</P>
<P>
This practice, he added, would be "the closest thing to
unilateral economic disarmament possible."
</P>
<P>
Describing the upcoming debate and vote on China PNTR as "a
tough battle," Sperling expressed his sanguine view that in the
end "the votes will come together and that we will prevail."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Online Retailer Amazon Reports Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Online retailer Amazon.com
Wednesday posted a revenue loss for the first quarter, slightly
lower than the Wall Street had expected.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-based company, a bellwether of business-to-consumer
electronic commerce, reported an operating loss of 122 million U.S.
dollars, or 35 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
Analysts polled by earnings tracker First Call had expected
Amazon to post an operating loss of 36 cents per share in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Amazon's first-quarter revenue was 574
million dollars, up by 95 percent from 294 million dollars in the
first-quarter last year, but down by 15 percent from the 676
million dollars in the fourth quarter, the first sequential
revenue decline of the company since its inception.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, had expected the sequential sales slip due
to several highly seasonal business lines such as toys and
electronics, which the company recently added to its fold.
</P>
<P>
Amazon, emerged in 1995 as an online bookseller, has
diversified well beyond books to a wide range of consumer products.
</P>
<P>
"We expect our U.S. Books, Music and DVD/Video segment to be
profitable on a pro formal operating basis for the full year 2000,
" Warren Jenson, Amazon's chief financial officer, told analysts
in a conference call Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Analysts polled by First Call expect Amazon to post a loss of 1.
22 dollars per share this year, and most don't see the company
turning a profit until 2002.
</P>
<P>
The company's losses, according to analysts, have stemmed
largely from investments and spending to boost its offerings and
to build a loyal base of customers. Amazon said it has added 3.1
million new customer accounts in the first quarter, bringing the
total up to 20 million as of March 31.

PHNOM PENH, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A Cambodian tourist ferry sank
in the Tonle Sap River near Kompong Chhnang Wednesday, killing one
tourist from China's Taiwan, tourism officials confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The tourist ferry, known as Royal No. 5, was on its way from
Siem Reap to Phnom Penh when it sank about 10 kilometers from
Kompong Chhnang town (about 100 kilometers north of the capital)
where the depth of the water is about four to five meters.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that there were 14 foreigners on the boat.
</P>
<P>
The true cause of the sinking is not yet available. It was said
that the boat was overloaded. The Royal's capacity was 50 people,
but witnesses and authorities said 65 passengers were packed
aboard.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodia Daily cited a ticket seller for Royal ferry, who
asked not to be named, as saying that the boat hit a tree stump in
the water shortly after 10 a.m. Wednesday and sank almost
immediately.
</P>
<P>
It was the second incident in a month in the tourist ferry
service to and from Siem Reap. On March 22, seven masked gunmen
hijacked and robbed a passenger boat on its way to Siem Reap, but
none was injured or killed.

PRAGUE -- The Czech koruna, the country's currency, dived on
Wednesday to its lowest point against the U.S. dollar since it

<P>
The exchange rate between the dollar and koruna was 1:39.4,
approaching once again the psychological tolerance level of 1:40.
The exchange rate between the two currencies has repeatedly
approached this point in the recent week, mainly due to the recent

<HEADLINE> ADB Urges Sri Lanka Continue Reforms to Sustain Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has urged Sri Lanka to continue structural reforms in public
administration and the financial reform to sustain higher economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report released Wednesday, the Manila-based bank
said the government must streamline state agencies and retrench or
redeploy employees in public institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth (in Sri Lanka) is
projected at five percent and six percent in 2000 and 2001
respectively," the ADB said in its Asian Development Outlook 2000.
</P>
<P>
The report said the higher growth this year will be supported
by a modest rise in industrial production on the back of an
overall recovery in world trade.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, Sri Lanka's GDP grew by 4.2 percent in
1999, down from 4.7 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The report said reforms in the public sector are necessary to
help reduce the fiscal deficit, estimated at eight percent of GDP
last year. The central bank has forecast the deficit at around 7.5
percent of GDP in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The report said the role of the domestic capital market must be
expanded to raise capital formation.
</P>
<P>
The "development finance institutions are still the major
source of long-term finance," it said.
</P>
<P>
DFCC Bank and National Development Bank, the two biggest
development banks, currently provide the majority of long-term
loans to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said a medium-term strategy for fiscal consolidation
should prioritize improved tax administration and elimination of
distortions in the system.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the ADB
have previously urged the government to reduce the number of tax
concessions granted for selected sectors as well as foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
The ADB forecast annual average inflation at 6.5 percent in
2000, compared with 4.7 percent in 1999, warning that higher world
oil prices could have an impact.
</P>
<P>
The report said poverty was widespread in the country, adding
that 21 percent of the population were "poor."
</P>
<P>
"In the short term, the government must ensure the poor gain
access to social support and continue to receive income through a
transfer scheme," the report said.

DHAKA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of computers across the
country came under attack of CIH virus on Wednesday, the New
Nation newspaper reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The virus, Known as "Chernobyl Computer Virus," is presumed to
hit every year on April 26, the day of Chernobyl disaster.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Bangladesh Computer Council told the
newspaper that the disaster this year mainly occurred on
individual personal computers, causing less damage than last year.
The number of the affected computers are around 500.
</P>
<P>
CIH works under Windows 95 and Windows 98. There is no report
of attack on Windows 2000 and Windows NT yet. Two problems CIH can
create are data loss of the hard disc and damage to flash BOIS
which prevents the computers from booting.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh computer vendors' association advised the affected
computer users to collect Tiramish software which is best for data
recovery in experts' opinion free of cost from their respective
vendors.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Beats Ecuador 3-2 in World Cup Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Brazil came from behind to edge
Ecuador 3-2 in a World Cup qualifier in Sao Paulo on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador stunned the four-times world champions by taking an
early lead with a magnificent goal by Alex Aguinaga in the 12th
minute.
</P>
<P>
Brazil turned the game around with two close range goals by
Rivaldo and one by defender Antonio Carlos.
</P>
<P>
The result left Brazil with four points from two games in the
South American qualifying group, one more than Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador, who have never beaten Brazil, never qualified for the
World Cup and lost the last meeting between the teams 5-1.
</P>
<P>
After Ecuador scored the opening goal, the fickle Sao Paulo
crowd quickly began to jeer their team until Rivaldo equalised
five minutes later with a shot on the turn from close range.
</P>
<P>
Brazil went ahead two minutes before halftime, when Antonio
Carlos, who had stayed up after a corner, scored from close range.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians then appeared to be cruising when Rivaldo netted
again in the 52nd minute.
</P>
<P>
But Ecuador refused to capitulate and 14 minutes from time when
de la Cruz scored with a dipping left foot shot into the top
corner.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov: Russia Agrees to Discuss Non-strategic ABM With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia has agreed to discuss
the threat of non-strategic anti-ballistic-missiles (ABM) with the
United States but continues to oppose any changes to the ABM
Treaty signed by Moscow and Washington in 1972, Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, speaking at the National Press Club here, told
reporters that Russia proposed "a constructive alternative for the
ABM Treaty collapse."
</P>
<P>
The United States is seeking to adjust the treaty so as to
deploy a national missile-defense (NMD) system. President Bill
Clinton is supposed to make a decision in summer whether the
system will be developed or not.
</P>
<P>
Senior U.S. officials reportedly said the U.S. may also
postpone the decision on the deployment of such a system until
November when the presidential election closes.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, who arrived here Wednesday after attending a review of
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) at the United Nations in
New York, reiterated Moscow's opposition to changing the ABM
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this treaty, although it was concluded in 1972,
still remains in force and still remains very topical, and wish it
can be and should be preserved as the basis for our relations in
the sphere of strategic stability," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that Russia would like to cooperate with the
United States on reducing the threat of short-range missiles. The
two countries set the demarcation of strategic and non-strategic
missiles in New York in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We also mean cooperation on non-strategic ABMs on the basis of
the New York agreements of 1997, joint analysis of new missile
threats, serious discussions of the global system of control over
nonproliferation of missiles and missile technologies, political
and diplomatic work with the threshold states," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov indicated that the subject will be a central issue
during the forthcoming meeting between President Vladimir Putin
and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Russian proposal did not address the concerns of the United
States, which says that the goal of the NMD is to prevent missile
attacks from "rogue" states. The U.S. NMD project, which was
attacked worldwide even by its allies in Europe, was called a "
fatal mistake" by Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Russia's approach, State Department spokesman
James Rubin told a regular briefing that the proposal is "
necessary but insufficient."
</P>
<P>
Jesse Helms, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, told the Senate earlier on Wednesday that he will block
the Clinton administration from making any deal with Russia on
arms control.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Clinton now wants to strike an ill-considered deal with
Russia to purchase Russian consent to an inadequate U.S. missile
defense," he told the floor. "This administration's time for grand
treaties is clearly at an end."

</P>
<P>
By now, only four network firms of China Telecom, China Unicom,
JiTong Communication and China Netcom are allowed to operate IP
service in the country.

including "General Technical Requirement for IP and Facsimile
Service", "Interconnection Technical Specification for IP Gateway
Equipment". It promised to select more qualified network companies
to run IP service.
</P>
<P>
IUOL, the Beijing-based network firm, has just forged a
strategic alliance with a number of large IP technical and
equipment providers. It will use the VoIP value-added service,
PoP fiber network and NAP global communication platform developed
by the iBasis to promote China's IP service.
</P>
<P>
Fan Wei, Chairman of IUOL, said that if his company is given
the license, they will concentrate on establishing a VoIP network
connecting the mainland with overseas.

<HEADLINE> Minister Stresses Resources Economization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a developing country, China is in a stage of high resources
consumption. About two thirds of the 33 key industries in China
directly involve resources exploitation.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of resources will be exacerbated in the future and
become another bottleneck in addition to the deterioration of the
eco-environment, warned Tian.
</P>
<P>
Tian, former governor of northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province, was appointed to his new post at the beginning of last
month. He just wrapped up a fact-finding tour to Shaanxi and Gansu
provinces in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
He said that his ministry is now drafting a plan to develop
land resources in western China. "Developing China's west requires
the efficient use of resources and the application of science and
technology."
</P>
<P>
The ministry will conduct an investigation of the mineral, land
and underground water resources in China's western region, and
will map out a comprehensive development plan for the utilization
of the resources on the basis of the investigation, according to
today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The search for underground water will also be stepped up in
over 20 cities including Xi'an, Lanzhou and Urumqi which have been
plagued by water shortage for years, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
He said China will return some cultivated land to forests and
grassland to improve the eco-environment in the vast western areas.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call for Eating Less Fat, Doing More Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Overweight people had better take
steps to get rid of flab so as to avoid suffering from
hypertension, diabetes and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
The warning was made by the health experts who attended an
international workshop on obesity that concluded yesterday, China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of living standard, an increasing number
of people in China eat more fatty foods, and obesity has become a
national health problem, said Kong Lingzhi of the Department for
Disease Control, a branch of the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Kong attributes obesity to eating too much fat and a lack of
exercise.
</P>
<P>
In China, 100 million people suffer from hypertension, while 26
million have diabetes. Obesity is a factor that can not be ignored,
Kong said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chunming, a nutrition professor said obesity is caused by
hereditary factors and a high intake of fat.
</P>
<P>
Chen also warned that the practice of taking diet pills without
the supervision of a doctor can be harmful.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, sponsored by the International Life Sciences
Institute Focal Point on China, attracted researchers from China,
the United States, Britain, Germany, and Australia.

<P>
The bank also said Hong Kong must work harder to enhance its
competitiveness and harness worsening pollution.
</P>
<P>
In its outlook for 2000, the ADB highlighted the planned Disney
Theme Park in Hong Kong, and said domestic fixed capital formation
will start to increase in the next two years, with more
infrastructure projects planned.
</P>
<P>
The ADB also predicted Hong Kong would experience 1 percent
deflation in 2000 but 3.1 percent inflation in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will gain from China's projected entry into the World
Trade Organization, said the ADB, but it risks losing some of its
luster as competing cities and ports in the mainland get stronger.
</P>
<P>
While pointing out Hong Kong's efforts to embrace the
information technology industry and "new economy," the ADB said it
was crucial for Hong Kong to stay attractive for highly skilled
workers from the mainland and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this target, the bank underlined the importance of
addressing Hong Kong's worsening pollution, which it said was
causing increasing concern over health.
</P>
<P>
"With the global trend towards greater demand for better
environmental standards, it is critical to incorporate
environmental issues into any long-term development strategy," the
ADB stressed.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Bank Fees Rise: Survey Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Bank fees increased
by up to 40 percent in two years as banks moved from mortgages
subsidizing savings accounts to user-pays accounts, survey
organization Cannex Australia said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Even though banks had pushed customers on to automatic teller
machines, phone banking or the Internet as low-cost alternatives
to branches, fees for these electronic services had also been
jacked up, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Cannex managing director Andrew Willink said the survey results
showing across-the-board increases between 15 and 40 per cent were
not surprising.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it surprised anyone, mainly because financial
institutions needed to shift from the benefits from the high
margins on mortgages versus the fact that on the traditional
deposit accounts they were subsidized," Willink told ABC Radio
here.
</P>
<P>
"Now it's very much a user-pays, stand-alone type of product,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said electronic transactions were cheaper than paper-based
transactions but there was still a cost incurred.
</P>
<P>
Many banks in Australia had introduced a certain number of free
electronic transactions or rebates.
</P>
<P>
"Each person is very different to how they use it and therefore
it's very hard to pinpoint whether it affects everyone in the
community," Willink said.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been a few fee decreases, mainly for deposits
and electronic pay deductions.
</P>
<P>
"But the majority of fees have increased," Willink said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Air Force to Receive 6 Hawk Jets From Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Air Force will
receive six new Hawk jet fighters from the United Kingdom in June,
according to Indonesian Military spokesman Rear Marshall Graito
Usodo.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the six British-made tactical attack aircraft will
be sent soon. This was the second batch of 40 aircraft we ordered
a couple years ago," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The six Hawks will be stationed at Supadio Air Base in
Pontianak, capital of West Kalimantan, which already has 14 Hawk-
200s.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the six Hawks were originally scheduled to
arrive in September last year but were delayed following the
crisis in East Timor. Anti-independence militias in East Timor
went on a spree of killing and destruction after East Timorese
voted overwhelmingly to throw off Indonesia rule on August 30 last
year.
</P>
<P>
Following the crisis, the European Union placed an arms embargo
on Indonesia restricting purchases to black box instruments such
as radar. The embargo was lifted in January.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous deliveries which were directly flown to
Indonesia, the six new aircraft would be shipped in containers and
assembled upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia ordered 40 Hawk-100 aircraft and Hawk-200 aircraft
worth around 120 million U.S. dollars in May 1996. Fourteen of the
aircraft have been delivered since April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in 1993, Indonesia bought 24 Hawk aircraft, the
delivery of which was completed in May 1997. The 24 Hawks are
stationed in Pekanbaru, capital of Riau province.
</P>
<P>
The Hawk-200 is a single-seat multi-role combat plane made by
British Aerospace. It is usually fitted with a Rolls-Royce Adour
Mk 871 engine which can produce a maximum speed of 1,065
kilometers per hour. It can carry up to 3,000 kilograms in rockets
and bombs on seven under-wing external points.

<HEADLINE> NZ Businesses Favor Sharing Currency with Australia: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Eighty percent of New Zealand's
businesses want to share a common currency with Australia,
Wellington's Institute of Policy Studies research has found.
</P>
<P>
Institute Director Arthur Grimes Thursday told the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio here that the study found an
overwhelming number of businesses supported a single trans-Tasman
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Grimes said a common currency would have major benefits for New
Zealand's businesses.
</P>
<P>
"It makes the cost of doing business for New Zealand firms a
lot less, and particularly for firms that are exporting or for
those ones who are importing raw materials from Australia," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said there would be longer-term advantages for Australia.
</P>
<P>
"Australia has obtained advantages from the free trade
agreement between Australia and New Zealand, partly by increasing
its trade with New Zealand, but in particular in terms of its
reputation and credibility in the wider Asia-Pacific region," he
added.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Trade Minister Jim Sutton also told the ABC radio
that he was delighted this issue is now being taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
"Until very recently it was in the political category of
unthinkable," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first survey of any element of public opinion I've
heard of that has shown significant support for monetary union,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Sutton said the concept would have to be tested over coming
years in the community.
</P>
<P>
"But I think at the very least this is a straw in the wind," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Builds Over 1,850 Km of Roads in 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar built a total of 1,858.5
kilometers (km) of roads in towns and rural areas in fiscal 1999-
2000 which ended in March, official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Colonel Thein Nyunt, Myanmar's minister of Progress of
Border Areas and National Races and Development Affairs, the
report said the roads built during the fiscal year include tarred,
stone, gravel and earth roads.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year, water supply projects were implemented in
10 towns in Kachin, Rakhine and northern Shan states and Sagaing
and Yangon divisions, bringing the total number of towns in which
such projects have been implemented up to this year to 160, the
minister said at a work coordination meeting of the ministry here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar designated the 1999-2000 fiscal year as the road and
bridge year and the water supply year.
</P>
<P>
The authorities admitted that towns in the country have made
progress to some extent but in rural areas, the rate of
development is slow.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar has built 5,871 km of
roads since 1988 and the total length of roads in the country had
been extended to 29,187 km in 1999 from 23,316 km in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Asks U.S. to Stop Attacks Against Mexican Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The government of Mexico Wednesday
asked the United States to prevent armed American ranchers from
attacking Mexican immigrants on U.S. southern soil.
</P>
<P>
Juan Rebolledo, Mexican deputy foreign secretary for North
America and European affairs, showed the request in a letter
addressed to the commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS), Doris Meisner.
</P>
<P>
Rebolledo said that so far attacks by U.S. ranchers against
Mexican immigrants in the American border state of Arizona, summed
up to 24 cases.
</P>
<P>
On two occasions, the ranchers even opened fire against
Mexicans and chased them down the highway, said the official.
</P>
<P>
"These cases are the ones that worry us the most, for these
immigrants are not passing through the properties of the ranchers,
who are waiting for them," Rebolledo said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ranchers claim they had the right to shoot at illegal
who cause damage by entering their properties, but such actions
obviously took place out of their properties, which of course are
illegal, even in the United States, Rebolledo added.
</P>
<P>
He also asked American authorities to punish those ranchers who
have attacked Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Until now it is still unknown whether the ranchers have killed
any illegal immigrant from Mexico, although the ones they capture
are delivered to local immigration authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Arizona border authorities deported some 71,000 Mexicans to
the neighboring Mexican state of Sonora just last month.
</P>
<P>
The illegal entry of Mexican immigrants into the United States
via Arizona intensified last years due to the increase in
watchfulness in California and Texas.

<HEADLINE> Czech Currency Hits Lowest Point Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Czech koruna, the country's
currency, dived on Wednesday to its lowest point against the U.S.
dollar since it became an exchangeable currency in 1995, thus
triggering concerns in the country's economic circles.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate between the dollar and koruna was 1:39.4,
approaching once again the psychological tolerance level of 1:40.
The exchange rate between the two currencies has repeatedly
approached this point in the recent week, mainly due to the recent
weakness in the euro.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the euro plummeted to a new low of 0.9376 against
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that if the koruna's softness continues,
it could hurt the healthy development of the economy, spark
further inflation and damage the confidence in its reliability,
although the current situation could prod the country's export
somewhat for the time being.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Czech authorities are closely watching
the development of the situation. If necessary, the central bank
will intervene.

<HEADLINE> Survey Reveals Demographics of Home Internet Users in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A study released Thursday
defines the average home Internet user in the United States as a
white man, 33 years old with some college experience and a
household income of almost 67,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
While U.S. census-based population figures show women outnumber
men 51 to 49 percent, men online outnumber women by a 51 to 49
percent ratio, according to the survey conducted by PC Data Online,
a service to measure e-commerce and Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, African Americans comprise 6 percent of the home
Internet population, while Caucasians make up 77 percent. The
remaining is distributed among Asian, Native American, Hispanic
and other populations.
</P>
<P>
The Net Portrait survey is a quarterly enumeration study to
update the demographics of the U.S. home Internet population.
Nearly 4,000 Internet and non-Internet households were surveyed.
The results are balanced by age, gender, race, education and
household income to produce a representative portrayal of the U.S.
Internet population.
</P>
<P>
"Women continue to exert a stronger presence on the Internet,"
according to the study, which also reinforces the fact that a huge
"digital divide" exists in the United States. Many African
Americans and other minorities have yet to embrace the Internet as
a medium of e-commerce, research and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicated that almost 58 percent of the U.S.
population owns a computer, and that 39 percent have Internet
access from their homes. In terms of households, this translates
to 58.3 percent of U.S. households that own a computer and 47.6
households that have Internet access.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government Frown on Rebel Army's Plan To Tax on Rich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres
Pastrana Wednesday voiced outrage at the rebel army's declaration
that it will impose taxes on the rich and kidnap those who do not
pay.
</P>
<P>
"Neither the people of Colombia nor I, as the president, are
able to understand FARC's announcement to collect this tax under
the threat of force, and to detain those who do not pay," said
the president.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Public Finance Juan Camilo Restrepo and the
commander of the armed forces General Fernando Tapias also made
public that they share Pastrana's position.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC), Latin America's largest surviving rebel army, announced a
"Tax Law 002", ordering all individuals, companies and
multinational firms with assets of more than 1 million U.S.
dollars to voluntarily show up in the rebel-held territory and pay
the "peace tax."
</P>
<P>
Those who refuse to pay will be kidnapped, said the rebel army.
</P>
<P>
"FARC's decision goes against peace," said Pastrana, "nobody
understands how they can sign a document committing themselves to
seek an end to hostilities, but at the same time continue with the
kidnappings."
</P>
<P>
General Tapias said the new act made him ask himself whether
the rebel organization is interested in peace or war.
</P>
<P>
"Colombia is not the kingdom of Ali Baba ruled by thieves. The
laws of the state are still in force here," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Public Finance Minister Restrepo also condemned the FARC
statement, warning that FARC might create turmoil and make
investors nervous.
</P>
<P>
FARC, a rebel army founded in the 1960s, now controls up to 40
percent of the country with its 17,000-strong fighters. Eighteen
months ago, the government withdrew security forces from the FARC-
controlled region as a goodwill act to start talks to end the
three-decade-long war.
</P>
<P>
Since then, President Pastrana has been criticized by the
military and civilian organizations for making too many concession
to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Following the FARC's tax declaration, Juan Francisco Mesa,
president of the Non-Governmental Organization "Free Country",
said that "nobody has put a limit to FARC, and that is why this
sort of things happen."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Property Sector to Recover Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's property sector is
predicted to recover to its pre-crisis level next year as sales
this year are to double from the 1999 figure, a newspaper reported
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Steadily falling bank interest rates are fueling a robust
increase in property sales this year, the Jakarta Post quoted a
leading property developer Ciputra as saying.
</P>
<P>
"With interest rate already falling as low as 12 percent, an
increasing number of people now prefer to buy houses," Ciputra
said.
</P>
<P>
The property sector collapsed in 1998, causing many firms to
default on their debt payments and forcing banks to transfer the
handling of heavily indebted developers to the Indonesian Banking
Restructuring Agency (IBRA).
</P>
<P>
Ciputra said that after two years of languishing in the
doldrums, the property market was bullish amid strengthening
consumers confidence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another property developer Kosmian Pudjiadi of the
Association of the Indonesian Real Estate Companies (REI) shared
Ciputra's forecast, saying the property market has showed a strong
recovery since early this year.
</P>
<P>
"The market expansion would be even faster if the government
could speed-up the restructuring of developers debts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Panangian Simanungkalit, a property expert predicted that full
recovery for the property market is expected only by 2004.
</P>
<P>
Housing sales, the main indicator of the property industry,
would increase to some 90,000 units this year from about 55,000
units last year, Simanungkalit said.
</P>
<P>
"The housing market peaked in 1997 when sales reached 220,000
units. But it would take another three years before the market
fully picks up to the 1997 level." he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President to Visit East European Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid plans to visit East European Countries soon, according to
Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab.
</P>
<P>
He said presidential staff and the Foreign Affairs Ministry are
now planning the president's visits to Russia, Poland and the
Czech Republic, but the exact timetable is still uncertain due to
ongoing political developments in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The main thing, however, is that the idea to visit Moscow is
cherished by President Wahid and he wants to go there in order to
meet the Russian president at the very first opportunity," the
minister was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Director of the Foreign Affairs Ministry's
Information Department Nugroho Wisnumurti did not rule out the
possibility of the trip taking place this year.
</P>
<P>
"This is more of a technical problem, which depends on planning,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Of decisive importance, Nugroho said, is the fact that Wahid is
determined to hold an Jakarta-Moscow summit and that Indonesia
regards Russia as one of the most important states in the world,
and feels it can play a significant role in promoting stability in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Nugroho said the Indonesian government feels there should be
four world powers -- Russia, the United States, China and Japan --
present in Southeast Asia to guarantee a new political balance of
forces.
</P>
<P>
The president has traveled to more than a dozen countries since
coming to office in October last year.

pass, and the Croat-born mainstay in the Austrian team scored from
sixteen meters.

<P>
URUMQI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- People in Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, which accounts for one sixth of China's
territory, are working to turn this arid land into a huge oasis in
the western part of China.
</P>
<P>
To complete this long-term gigantic program, the region will

annual rate of 2,400 hectares and the dunes move towards highway
and railway roads at a rate of 15 meters a year.
</P>
<P>
The region will build 1.13 million ha of forest, plant grass on
1.4 million ha and improve 1.52 million ha of low-yielding land to
make the rate of green plant-covered areas in Xinjiang to reach 5.
3 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The region now has 20-odd nature reserves covering a total area
of 10 million ha. It plans to build eight wildlife protection

<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 36,832 fires in China
have killed 971 people during the first quarter of this year,
according to sources with the Public Security Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The fires also injured 1,228 people and caused 310 million yuan
(about 37 million U.S. dollars) in direct economic losses, the
English-language newspaper China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Urban residential fires had the highest percentage of China's
urban fire accidents.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, 22,000 urban residential fire disasters killed 673
people in China, causing 110 million yuan in economic losses, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
About 88.8 percent of the deaths and 72.6 percent of the
injuries in urban fires were caused by residential fires.
</P>
<P>
Yet, many urban residents lack fire prevention awareness, which
is a major factor in fire accidents.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the situation, a nationwide publicity campaign on
residential fire control to increase fire prevention awareness was
launched Wednesday in Beijing and will last until early November.

</P>
<P>
The only goal came in the 37th minute when Kaiserslautern
striker Joergen Pettersson controlled a long pass before looping a
shot over Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.
</P>
<P>
Schmeichel made two good saves as Sweden had the best of the
first half but might be disappointed with his positioning for the
goal.
</P>
<P>
Denmark had one good shot from Brian Steen Nielsen in the ninth
minute and came close to equalising in injury time when Mikkel
Beck's header from a corner was cleared off the line by Olof
Mellberg.
</P>
<P>
The Swedes were without Arsenal midfielder Fredrik Ljungberg,
who suffered a rib injury in last week's UEFA Cup semifinal, and
Celtic striker Henrik Larsson, who has been out of action since he
broke a leg in October.
</P>
<P>
Denmark lacked midfielders Allan Nielsen and Udinese's Martin
Joergensen, both due to minor leg injuries.

<HEADLINE> Tibet to Invest 22 Billion Yuan in Ecological Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region has
decided to invest 22.7 billion yuan (about 2.73 billion U.S.
dollars) in protecting the ecological environment over the next
five decades.
</P>
<P>
An official of the regional government said that the largest
environment construction program consists of 160 projects which
will be conducted in three phases.
</P>
<P>
Twelve projects are planned this year, including ecological
protection and construction at the upper reaches of the Yangtze
River and the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River.
</P>
<P>
The two projects in Jomada, Conjo, and Markam counties will
cost about 8.64 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Tibet, encompassing the major portion of the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, is one source of the climate in China and the world, as
well as the site of river resources and ecological resources for
China and South Asia, and the improvement of the ecological
environment of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau will benefit the
environment of the entire world.
</P>
<P>
The ecological environment program in Tibet will focus on the
creation of grasslands, forests, the protection of wildlife
resources, the returning of farmland to grassland and forests, as
well as the control of soil erosion and the elimination of

<HEADLINE> Man United Transfer Remains on Hold  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Ruud van Nistelrooy has flown back
to Holland after a second day of tests on his injured knee.
</P>
<P>
Van Nistelrooy checked out of his Cheshire hotel and returned
home on Wednesday with Manchester United insisting that they have
not finished their assessment of his injury.
</P>
<P>
United's financial director David Gill, who announced on
Tuesday that the 18.5 million pounds deal to bring the player to
Old Trafford had been put on hold, said: "The player has returned
to Holland, but the tests are continuing."
</P>
<P>
Man United ordered the extra checks after van Nistelrooy failed
a fitness test on the knee just hours before he was due to be
unveiled at a press conference as the club's new striker.
</P>
<P>
Worries surround a medial ligament injury the Dutch hitman
suffered seven weeks ago and want to test his fitness before
finalising the deal.
</P>
<P>
Man United have said they will announce in due course if they
will press ahead with what would be a British record-breaking
transfer.
</P>
<P>
PSV spokesman Pedro Salazar Hewitt claimed it was down to
United to make the next move.
</P>
<P>
"I'd heard that he was coming back today, although I didn't
know at what time," he said. "It's now up to Manchester United to
come out with the information and say what happens next. We are
not the ones who have to say."
</P>
<P>
PSV remain confident that van Nistelrooy will prove his fitness
and that the deal will be completed.
</P>
<P>
Just to make sure, the Dutch club sent their doctor Cees Rein
van der Hoogenband to Manchester this morning.
</P>
<P>
Van der Hoogenband has been supervising van Nistelrooy's
recovery since the Dutch international damaged his medial ligament
attempting an overhead kick during a friendly match on 6 March.
</P>
<P>
PSV remain positive that the 23-year-old will be back in action
next month as planned before the end of the Dutch league.
</P>
<P>
The club have also ruled out the possibility of renegotiating
the fee because of the injury.
</P>
<P>
Salazar Hewitt said: "We're confident everything is going to be
OK because van Nistelrooy is fine. He didn't have an operation on
his knee so the injury is not very bad."
</P>
<P>
"He is recovering on schedule and he has been training for one
week already without any reaction and so we don't expect any more
problems. I don't know how long they will take, but the deal is
done and the conditions are the same as they were before the
medical as far as we're concerned. Now we're just waiting until
everything is cleared up," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Ponder "Failure" Insurance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Chelsea are considering taking out insurance worth more than 10
million pounds if they fail to qualify for the Champions League in
future seasons.
</P>
<P>
Boss Gianluca Vialli has already conceded that his team have no
realistic chance of finishing in the top three of the Premiership
this season, meaning that the UEFA Cup is the best they can now
aspire to. Even then they would still have to finish above Leeds
in fourth spot or win the FA Cup final against Aston Villa, or
take their chances in the pre-season InterToto Cup.
</P>
<P>
The club have raked in at least 12.5 million pounds from this
season's Champions League run through a qualifying round, two
group stages and a quarter-final defeat over two legs against
Barcelona as television revenues are shared out from a centralised
pool.
</P>
<P>
Although actually winning the UEFA Cup could raise up to 10
million pounds, there is not the guaranteed income from the group
stages, while revenues are largely dependent upon being given high-
profile ties as TV companies bid for the rights to games.
</P>
<P>
The premium on an insurance policy to cover the loss of
prospective Champions League income would be sizeable, possibly
more than one million pounds, but such a move is understood to be
the subject of much discussion among the European elite.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea managing director Colin Hutchinson confirmed: "It is
something we are investigating. You can also insure the other side
of the coin, if you like.
</P>
<P>
"That is, insure against being successful so that all the
bonuses and so forth are paid for you if you win trophies."
</P>
<P>
He told the Evening Standard: "Some of the premiums do not make
it viable. But it is an interesting concept and we will be
exploring it for the future."
</P>
<P>
It is of course too late for Chelsea to take out an insurance
policy this season but reports indicate that Arsenal are also
looking at the concept for possible future use.

LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- American boxer Mike Tyson's next

than a month later than originally scheduled.
</P>
<P>
No official reason was given for the May 20 postponement, but
Tyson reportedly needed more time to prepare.

The former world heavyweight champion last fought on January 29,

A site for the bout with Savarese is still to be determined,

The fight could still be held in Milan, but a switch to Glasgow

WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Doc Rivers of the Orlando
Magic, who began the season with no experience and no stars and
got his team within a win of the postseason, was named NBA Coach
of the Year on Wednesday.
</P>

Rivers received 60 votes from the 121-member media panel, seven
more than Phil Jackson of the Los Angeles Lakers, to become the
fifth rookie coach to win the award. Paul Silas of the Charlotte
Hornets was a distant third with three votes.
</P>
<P>
The first-year coach Rivers led the Magic to a 41-41 record,
battling for an Eastern Conference playoff spot until the season's
penultimate game, when they suffered a last-second 85-83 home loss
to the Milwaukee Bucks that finally knocked them out.

CAPE TOWN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin Wednesday expressed his hope that South Africa will
score new achievement in the construction of the country.
</P>
<P>
China, as a friend of South Africa, is pleased to see the
progress that South Africa has made, Jiang said during a meeting
here with Frene Ginwala, speaker of the National Assembly of South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived in Cape Town, the legislature capital of South
Africa, from Pretoria Wednesday afternoon to continue his state
visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president cited Ginwala as an old friend of China
who has made significant contributions to the advancement of
Sino-South African relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the exchanges between China's National People's
Congress and South Africa's Parliament have constituted an
important part of the bilateral relations because both of them are
playing an important role in the political life of their
respective countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that Ginwala will continue to make
efforts to consolidate the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Extending his warm welcome to Jiang, Ginwala congratulated him

<HEADLINE> Sezer Fails to Win First Round in Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Ahmet Sezer, the joint presidential
candidate supported by five parties represented in Turkish
parliament, failed on Thursday to secure 367 votes required to be
elected as president in the first round of balloting.
</P>
<P>
He won 281 votes of total 550 deputies in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to the election procedures, if no candidates win two-
thirds of the votes in the first round, the parliament will hold
the second round of voting on May 1.
</P>
<P>
But Sezer, the presiding judge of the Constitutional Court, led
far away from his strongest challenger, Parliament Speaker Yildirim
Akbulut, who came a distant second with 87 votes.
</P>
<P>
Analyst said that if Sezer maintained his momentum seen in the
first round, he could be elected as the new president in the third
round of balloting.
</P>
<P>
Sezer is the joint candidate of the three ruling parties and the
two main opposition Virtue Party and True Path Party.
</P>
<P>
His score indicated that in the secret ballot, few maverick
deputies repeated their defections seen during last month's vote on
the constitutional amendment for President Suleyman Demirel's
second term in office.
</P>
<P>
Demirel failed to garner enough votes to stay on for a second,
five-year term earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Before Thursday's voting, five party leaders expected to have
Sezer elected by the end of the first three rounds without having
to stage a fourth and final round.
</P>
<P>
In the first two rounds, a candidate needs to win a two-thirds
(367 votes) majority in the 550-seat parliament to be elected
president. If deputies fail to choose a president in the initial
two rounds, 276 votes will be sufficient in the third and fourth
rounds.
</P>
<P>
The third round will take place on May 5, and in case of
failure, two top runners in the third round will compete in the
last round.
</P>
<P>
If no conclusive result comes out in the fourth round, the
parliament will be dissolved immediatly for new general elections
in accordance with the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The parliament chooses the president over a maximum of four
rounds of vote that must end before Demirel's tenure expires on May
16.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak intends to
transfer soon to full Palestinian control the village of Abu Dis,
as an "advance" of Israel's next troop redeployment in the West
Bank, the local daily Ha'aretz Thursday quoted a senior political
source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Barak is expected to bring the proposal to his Security Cabinet
for approval next week and such a move will allay Palestinian
suspicions that Israel intends to use delaying tactics in the talks
so as to avoid transferring significant territory to the
Palestinians, the source added. (Israel-Palestinian-Redeployment)

JERUSALEM -- The target date for concluding a framework

<P>
The newspaper quoted political sources as saying that two months
of work will be needed to complete the agreement and prepare for a
trilateral summit in Washington at which U.S. President Bill
Clinton will host Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
A similar signal was sent by United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who said in Washington on Wednesday that in the

<HEADLINE> PNA Rejects Postponement of Talks on Final Status Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) rejects any postponement of talks on the final status issues,
said a senior Palestinian official on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Voice of Palestine radio, Mahmoud Abbas
(also known as Abu Mazen), secretary general of the Executive
Committee of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), said a
lasting peace must address all final status issues.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came three days before Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators are to hold a new round of talks on the last phase
redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank and on the final
status issues, including the status of Jerusalem, water sharing,
refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, with the presence of U.S. mediators, are due to
meet Sunday in Israeli southern port city of Eilat in an effort to
draft a framework agreement on the final status by May and
implement the Israeli redeployment in June under the previously set
timetable by the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed last September.
</P>
<P>
However, some Israeli political sources have said that it would
be impossible to solve all final status issues in the short-run
even after the framework agreement is reached by May.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak might suggest postponing the
discussions on the two most thorniest issues of Jerusalem and
refugees for years in spite of Palestinian opposition.
</P>
<P>
The final stage Israeli pullout from West Bank territories is
not related to the final status talks, Abu Mazen argued, adding
that it should be addressed by the interim talks that coincide with
the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords signed in 1993, Israel should withdraw
its troops from the Gaza Strip and all West Bank territories except
Jerusalem, the Jewish settlements and the military sites before
kicking off the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
The PNA now controls 43 percent of the West Bank territories
fully or partially as part of the implementation of the interim
accords.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility that the Palestinian side would agree to
declare statehood over 50 percent of the West Bank territories, Abu
Mazen said the PNA refused categorically the idea, denying that any
side had ever suggested it to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian statehood concerns the Palestinian leadership
which has the right to make any decision," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a plenary session held in Gaza last February, the Palestine
National Council said that an independent Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital would be declared this year.
</P>
<P>
PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat also reiterated on many occassions
that the year 2000 would be the year of Palestinian independence
willy- nilly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abu Mazen hailed, on behalf of the PNA, the planned
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon by July in line with the U.N.
Security Council resolutions, pointing out that the Palestinians
presence in Lebanon was transient as the refugee issue was on the
agenda of the Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Some 360,000 Palestinians live in refugee camps in Lebanon as
a result of Arab-Israelis wars since Israel was founded in 1948.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government on April 17 officially informed the U.N.
of its decision to pull out from south Lebanon by July under the U.
N. Security Council Resolution 425 without any preconditions.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Pullout From Lebanon to Cost 250 Million Dollars: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled Israeli troops
withdrawal from south Lebanon this July will cost at least one
billion shekels (250 million U.S. dollars), a senior defense
official estimated Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Amos Yaron, director general of the Defense Ministry, told
Israel Radio that this evaluation is based on the redeployment plan
currently prepared by the ministry, although the final date of the
pullback has not been decided yet.
</P>
<P>
The major spending, according to Yaron, includes building army
outposts and observation bunkers along the 1923 international
border between Israel and Lebanon, and reinforcing the security
facilities of the Israeli northern settlements.
</P>
<P>
However, this budget figure did not cover compensations to
nearly 3,000 members of the South Lebanon Army (SLA), Israel's
major military ally in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israeli defense establishment had planned to relocate nearly 1,
500 SLA militiamen and their families to Arab villages in Israel to
ensure their safety after Israeli withdrawal from the so-called
security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, the Arab communities' leaders had expressed their
opposition to such ideas as these militiamen are regarded by the
Lebanese government as traitors and had been sentenced in absentia
to death.
</P>
<P>
The buffer zone was set up by Israel in 1985 with a self-claimed
aim of protecting its north from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
However, the unremitting armed resistance by Lebanese guerrillas in
the past decades forced Israel to find an exit way from the zone.
</P>
<P>
On March 5, the Israeli cabinet adopted a proposal by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak to redeploy Israeli army to the international
border by July, ending the 18-year-long occupation finally.
</P>
<P>
Israel's inner-circle security cabinet is convening on Thursday
to discuss the exact timetable of the withdrawal, and the way to
carry out the redeployment unilaterally without a security
arrangement with Lebanon or Syria, the major foreign power broker
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks had been in stalemate since
January after two rounds of talks in the United States failed to
make progress.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Israel had stated that it will resort to United
Nations' mandate and implement the withdrawal under the U.N.
Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426.
</P>
<P>
The two resolutions, passed in 1978, call for an immediate and
unconditional Israeli pullout from all Lebanese territories and a
return of full sovereignty to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Middle East Special Envoy Terje Larsen is currently
visiting Israel to discuss with Israeli officials on the
withdrawal. He will also visit Lebanon and Syria for more
consultations in a "fact-finding tour."
</P>
<P>
Yaron did not elaborate on who will pay for the pullback, but
sources in Israeli Foreign Ministry said that Israel is asking the
United States for financial support to implementing the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at several hundred million dollars," Israel's
ambassador to Washington David Ivry reportedly commented on the
estimated total cost of the pullout.
</P>
<P>
"For now there has not been any Israeli request for U.S.
assistance. I expect at some stage it will be discussed but I do
not want to specify when," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Businessmen To Meet With Cuban Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.S. businessmen will
meet with Cuban officials for the fourth year in a row in the
Mexican Caribbean resort of Cancun and in this capital, a Havana
radio station said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The source, which quoted the Cristobal SRL firm, organizer for
the first time of the meeting, said that this fourth meeting will
start on June 7 in Cancun, and will end three days later in Havana,
to analyze future investments in the island.
</P>
<P>
The company, with headquarters in Italy, assumed the
organization of the meeting after the U.S. government barred the
Alamar Associates firm, with offices in Washington, from
organizing the trip to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleaded to take the U.S. businessmen to Havana to
observe and hear by themselves the true business environment of
the island," said Nikki Cecchi, Cristobal SRL chairman.
</P>
<P>
Cecchi said in a communique issued in Havana that "the
interaction between U.S. businessmen, Cuban officials, and those
of us who already work in the island, must be beneficial for all
the parts."
</P>
<P>
Neither the trip to Havana nor the meeting violate the strict
regulations of the U.S. blockade against Cuba, since all the
expenses will be paid by the Desoft, S.A. firm, an enterprise with
business in this capital.
</P>
<P>
"No other forum permits businessmen to have a unique
opportunity to learn first-hand the Cuban economic reality," said
Kirby Jones, Alamar Associates chairman, who continues as
president of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly (
parliament), criticized Washington for adopting coercive measures
to prevent investments in the island.
</P>
<P>
The United States intensified the blockade three years ago by
passing the Helms-Burton law that penalized the firms and
executive officers of third countries that would invest or trade
with the island.

<HEADLINE> Riot at Athens' Avlona Juvenile Prison Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A riot at the Avlona juvenile
prison near the Greek capital of Athens ended Thursday, with five
people being injured and 350 million drachmas (about 980,392 U.S.
dollars) in damages to the complex.
</P>
<P>
The five-hour riot broke out late Wednesday after about 30-50
inmates, mostly Albanians and Romanians, managed to reach the
prison's neutral zone and took a warden hostage, Greece's Justice
Minister Michalis Stathopoulos said late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 inmates were involved in the rioting, during which an
inmate was stabbed in the throat and was reported in serious
condition at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
The Athens prosecutor's office is now investigating the cause
of the riot.
</P>
<P>
There have been a number of prison riots in Greece since 1995,
and most of the riots broke out due to prisoners' dissatisfaction
over their living conditions in prison.

<P>
In a brief order, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
accepted instead the government's offer of regular reports from a
psychiatrist and a social worker.
</P>
<P>
The court also continued its order barring Elian from any site
in this country that has diplomatic immunity in order to keep the
boy from the custody of Cuban diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, asked the court on
Tuesday for a series of orders giving them access to Elian.
</P>
<P>
The Miami family, which has kept Elian since the boy was
rescued in November last year until the federal agents transferred
the boy to his father last week, asked their attorneys and their
doctors be given regular and reasonable access to the boy until
the court rules on an asylum appeal for Elian.
</P>
<P>
The court said in its order that the government has offered to
supply the court with biweekly reports from a psychiatrist and
from a social worker who will be hired to monitor his care.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduling a hearing next
month on the appeal filed by the Miami relatives on behalf of the

<HEADLINE> Investors to Have Equal Fiscal Regime in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government will
soon abrogate an old emergency ordinance on granting incentives to
major investors, so that the investors will have an equal fiscal
regime, government spokesperson Gabriela Vranceanu-Firea announced
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesperson, the mentioned emergency
ordinance will be abrogated by the government at one of its next
sessions. The Mugur Isarescu Cabinet's members took the decision
to create an equal fiscal regime for all investors, regardless the
sum invested or the field of activity, she added.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the incentives for the investors which created
red tape and corruption will no longer exist. Economic policies
will exist only, Vranceanu-Firea stressed.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Isarescu explained to the members of his cabinet
that they had to choose between clear and stable stipulations and
arbitrary regime in the field of investments.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson also said that after the abrogation of the
mentioned emergency ordinance, the government would approve a
general regime for investments which stipulated the exemption of
customs duties for the import of machinery and equipment for
production and not for sale.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Wireless Issues Largest IPO In U.S. History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 27 (Xinhua) -- AT&AMP;T issued a tracking stock for
its wireless phone business Thursday on the New York Stock
Exchange in the largest initial public offering in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
The stock closed at 31.31 U.S. dollars a share, a moderate rise
from the initial price of 29.50 U.S. dollars per share for IPO. AT&AMP;
T announced Wednesday night it was selling 360 million shares for
a total of 10.26 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The winning IPO will give AT&AMP;T more money to build networks and
make acquisition in the competitive wireless market.
</P>
<P>
Wireless telecommunications has been one of the hottest areas
on the stock market since November 1998. Spring PCS Group saw its
stocks rise more than eight times in price between then and last
month but its stocks fell 21 percent from its peak as the tech
market plunged in the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
The wireless tracking stock is structured much differently than
an earlier AT&AMP;T spinoff, gear maker Lucent Technologies Inc. AT&AMP;T
can still package wireless phone service with discounted long-
distance rates and superfast Internet access.
</P>
<P>
Lucent, with its own board of directors, went public in 1996 at
6.75 dollars a share. Its stock hit a high of nearly 85 dollars a
share late last year and now trades around 62 dollars per share.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Leading Stocks Post Sharp Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Europe's leading stock markets all
posted sharp falls Thursday amid fears of higher global interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 lost 77.2 points to close a volatile session
at 6,179.30 after peaking in morning trade at 6,306. Technology
and financial shares bore the brunt of the selling pressure
despite the modest rise on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
Internet service provider Freeserve led the declines with a
loss of 9 percent. Logica, the computer-services firm, fell 6
percent, while chip designer ARM Holdings dropped 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Financial shares suffered on the gloomy interest-rate outlook,
sending Lloyds TSB, Britain's largest consumer bank, down 5.1
percent. Bank of Scotland, the biggest loser Wednesday after
disappointing earnings, fell another 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The telecom firms that had buoyed the market in morning trade
also lost ground. Thus fell 6.25 percent and Cable&AMP;Wireless closed
down 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax in Frankfurt closed down 166 points, or 2.26
percent, at 7,221.74, again off its afternoon low of 7,156.
Deutsche Telekom also suffered the worst decline as it closed down
more than 6 percent.

The CAC 40 in Paris, with its heavier weighting of media and
telecom shares, fell 143 points to close at 6,248.86.

<HEADLINE> Orphans Head Home to China After Successful Facial Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Three Chinese orphans left the
United States Thursday for China after successfully undergoing
facial surgery by American doctors.
</P>
<P>
The children, along with their caregivers, departed from
Washington's Reagan National Airport at noon. Their air transport
was provided free by Northwest Airlines through its "Friend of
China Program."
</P>
<P>
These children were among the five orphans who arrived on April
8 to receive craniofacial operations at the University of Virginia
(UVA) Health System, which is known for its evaluation and
treatment of all craniofacial problems, including cleft lip and
palate deformities.
</P>
<P>
The Grace Children's Foundation, based in New York, arranged
for the children to receive surgeries in America.
</P>
<P>
Three of the five orphans, ages nine months to two years, whose
deformities were corrected by the surgery have recovered well
enough to travel home, said the foundation's executive director
Nancy Robertson.
</P>
<P>
The fourth child, three-year-old Dang Xiaona, had the most
serious condition, a massive blood vessel tumor in her lip and jaw
which impede her ability to eat. She remains at the University of
Virginia Health System until physicians have finished a medical
evaluation to ensure a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
The fifth child, Qi Gui, three, also will remain for
developmental evaluation to enhance his overall health.
</P>
<P>
The surgeries on both of these children were deemed successful.
</P>
<P>
"We are thrilled that these operations have been tremendously
successful," said Nancy Robertson. "These beautiful children now
have a chance to meet their challenges on a more even playing
field with children."
</P>
<P>
"Our gratitude goes out to UVA, for this wonderful work, and to
Northwest Airlines for helping us transport the children for the
medical care they so desperately needed," Mrs. Robertson added.
</P>
<P>
"Northwest Airlines is proud to have played a role in helping
these wonderful children receive the medical treatment they so
urgently needed to live healthy and normal lives," said David
Mishkin, Northwest's vice president for international and
regulatory affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Although these children may not remember what has happened to
them because of the age, the Chinese people will remember American
people's friendship forever," said Qin Xiaomei, wife of the
Chinese ambassador to the United States, who attended the send-off
ceremony at the airport.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Tourism Sector in Recovery: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tourism sector has shown
signs of recovery which is expected to continue well beyond this
year, said Kenyan Minister of Tourism, Trade and Industry Nicholas
Biwott here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Donor funding will play a pivotal role in achieving the total
recovery of the industry, he said when meeting with David Villers,
deputy secretary- general of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
According to Biwott, over the past four years, the country's
tourism has undergone a decline mainly due to the deteriorated
infrastructure, particularly roads, posts and telecommunications
services and isolated incidents of insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Other factors attributed to the decline in the industry
included the lack of support programs from the International
Monetary Fund, reduced donor support and the fiscal deficit that
led to high domestic interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his government is committed to turning around
the tourism sector performance by taking a series of measures
including the creation of the Kenya Tourist Board to undertake
destination marketing with new technology such as the internet.
</P>
<P>
The government is also in the process of operationalizing
tourism agreements between Kenya and the member states of the
Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his government has granted value-added tax and
duty exemption on fixtures and fitting as well as other
construction materials imported for the purpose of rehabilitation
of hotels and other tourism facilities.
</P>
<P>
Biwott told the guest that his ministry is implementing the
National Tourism Master Plan focusing on the diversification of
both source markets and product range.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned that the European Union has set up an
endowment fund to be utilized by the Kenya Tourist Board in
designation marketing, thereby re-establishing Kenya's image as a
tourist haven.
</P>
<P>
The minister envisaged that as his government attaches
importance to the tourism sector, Kenya will enjoy the growth rate
level of 1994 when the country hosted over one million tourists
with foreign exchange earnings of approximate 400 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The tourism sector is recovering gradually and this favorable
trend will continue into the future, he said optimistically.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
 has urged the people of his country to develop agriculture,
saying that the most important message to the people now is that
of modernization of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Uganda must seriously take up the fight against
poverty in homesteads using the prevailing tranquil environment
and democratic governance," he was quoted as saying by a press
release from the President' s Office which was available on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting with a joint delegation from
the Kigulu South in Iganga district and Bukholi in Bugiri district
at his home in Rwakitura, Mbarara district.
</P>
<P>
The president said while entrepreneurs in urban areas can
overcome poverty by joining commerce-related activities and real
estate, the people in the rural areas can equally overcome poverty
by using modern methods to grow crops, raise livestock and breed
fish.
</P>
<P>
He advised the people in Busoga region to guard against further
 fragmentation of their land.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was headed by Vice President Specioza Wandira
Kazibwe, who is also Member of Parliament (MP) for Kigulu South,

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 55 bodies have been
exhumed from new mass graves belonging to the Movement for the
Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, police spokesman John
Kimera told Xinhua Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Among the bodies were eight boys, ten girls, 22 ladies and 15
men, Kimera said, adding that the bodies were exhumed from three
graves at a house in Mawanga zone, Kampala district.
</P>
<P>
Investigation revealed that the house, which had been taken
charge of by the police several days ago, was once rented by
Dominic Kararibaabo, one of the cult's leaders.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Blue Chips Fall But Tech Stocks Rise on Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stock ended mixed
Thursday with the Dow Jones industrial average falling on rising
wage pressures and strong economic growth. But the technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index rose.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index closed down 57.40 at 10,888.10, extending its
loss of 179.32 points Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Nasdaq index
rose 143.49 at 3,774.03 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 3.
93 at 1,464.92.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip stocks fell after the Labor Department reported
that the U.S. Employment Cost Index rose 1.4 percent in the first
quarter, the biggest advance in 10 years. Investors feared that
the rising wage pressures could prompt the Federal Reserve Board
to raise interest rates in an effort to ward off inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates five times since last June
and analysts expected the board to raise the rates again on May 16
when its Public Market Committee meets on the monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
A separate report on U.S. economic growth increased worries
about higher rates. The Commerce Department said the U.S. economy
grew at a 5.4 percent annual rate in the first three month.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate was still faster than the rate of 3.5 percent
to 4 percent the Federal Reserve regards as pace that can be
sustained without triggering inflation although it was less than 6
percent analysts have expected.
</P>
<P>
But these economic reports did not frighten investors away the
tech sector. The Nasdaq index rose sharply on strong corporate
earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
MCI WorldCom rose after announcing it beat wall Street's
expectations for its first quarter earnings. The company led the
Nasdaq's advance.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 3.86 at 650.45. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 5.66 at 902.09 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 10.34 at 494.58.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,618 down, 1,317 up and 502
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.1 billion shares from 979.71 million
in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Amato Outlines Government Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Italy's new Premier Giuliano Amato
said Thursday that tackling unemployment and boosting investment
were his top economic priorities, in a speech before the Lower
House of Parliament in which he presented his political program.
</P>
<P>
Amato, who was sworn-in Wednesday by President Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi, also stressed that he intended to follow the fiscal
policies of the previous center-left government, headed by Massimo
D'Alema, with "care and prudence", keeping Italy firmly within the
limits set by the euro-zone's Stability Pact.
</P>
<P>
He said that both businesses and families were benefiting from
the fiscal reforms introduced by the center-left and that "if
Italy posts greater tax revenue today with a lower rate of taxes,
that is because there is less evasion thanks to a more efficient
fiscal system."
</P>
<P>
Italian news agency Ansa reported that Amato, who served as
Treasury Minister in the last D'Alema government, also underscored
that the consolidation of Italy's public finances had largely been
completed.
</P>
<P>
He said that, besides the key planks of creating more jobs and
investment, he was aiming for a more flexible economic system, and
would "lift the hand-brake" on the economy.
</P>
<P>
"The government must aim to remove the brakes which render the
economy less powerful and less stable than it should be," Amato
continued.
</P>
<P>
He added that his administration would seek to reduce the
length of time and the costs involved in setting up new firms;
would reform corporate and bankruptcy laws and would encourage the
use of private pension funds, "which are still not taking off."
</P>
<P>
He said that, in general, his government, the 58th in Italy
since the end of the war, would focus on "streamlined legislation
and plenty of action," devoting itself to priority areas,
especially reforms, given the limited amount of time available
before the next general elections, due in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
Amato said that he hoped that there would be a "re-formation of
the majority," which would make it "strong and convincing in its
political values."
</P>
<P>
In other comments, he said that Italy "deserved" to become a
member of the United Nations Security Council under a reformed
system.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Amato and his cabinet will have to undergo a
confidence vote in the Lower House, in which he will need a
minimum of 316 votes if all members of Parliament are present.
</P>
<P>
Amato was named Premier-designate on Friday, in the wake of the
resignation two days previously of D'Alema after eighteen months
at the helm of the center-left.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema quit his job after his coalition suffered a humiliating
defeat in regional elections on April 16, emerging with seven
regions to the center-right's eight and polling about 45 percent
of the vote against the opposition's 51 percent.

<HEADLINE> Albright: U.S. Intends to Seek Arms Control Accords with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference with Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov, Albright said the American people supported
the dual quest for further cutbacks in U.S. and Russian nuclear
arsenals and a way to mount a defense against intercontinental
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
"As far as what was said yesterday from the Hill, I believe
that the American people support a policy that seeks to both
further reduce nuclear dangers left over from the Cold War, and to
address new threats," Albright told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Jesse Helms of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
said on Wednesday he will block the Clinton administration from
reaching any arms control agreement with Russia.block any new
Clinton administration arms control pacts.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov came to the United States to prepare for a summit meeting
in Moscow in early June between President Clinton and Russian
President Vladimir Putin. The two presidents will talk about
whether to modify the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) to
allow the U.S. to deploy a national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Ivanov reiterated Russia's opposition to the
modification of ABM treaty, but proposing the two sides cooperate
on short-range missile defenses allowed under the treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, responding to the proposal, Albright said Thursday the
United States was faced now with a new potential threat,
intercontinental ballistic missiles, and had to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
"We have spoken before and we did again during this meeting,
about cooperating on theater missile defense. And we think that
it can supplement, but it is not sufficient for dealing with the
problems that we have. And so I think we will continue to talk
about it," Albright said.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Unveils High-Speed Global Communications Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 27 (Xinhua) -- In commercial air travel
today, passengers can only read a book or watch one of several
movies, but Boeing said Thursday that they can soon do many other
things when the airplane gets home- and office-like connectivity.
</P>
<P>
Under Boeing's plans to develop a global communications network
and other services that the company said would "revolutionize the
way people travel," passengers will be able to access the Internet,
e-mail, television, news and information.
</P>
<P>
Called Connexion by Boeing, the system will provide air
travelers with high-speed data communication services via a space-
based network, the company said.
</P>
<P>
With the system, airline passengers will be able to choose from
a multitude of personalized communication services, including
Internet and corporate intranet access, e-commerce, live
television and entertainment, transmission and receipt of data,
shopping, travel and destination information, all in real time.
Airline operators also will benefit from in-flight access to
aircraft and crew data.
</P>
<P>
To provide digital broadband capability, which provides
increased bandwidth for two-way interactive applications, Boeing
said that it will use advanced antenna technology and existing
satellites, while extending to a mix of new and existing
satellites as the service matures.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the system follows the pending acquisition
of Hughes Space &AMP; Communications and signals the move by Boeing
into commercial, space-based communications markets, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
Intended as a global service, the system will first be
available to commercial airline customers operating in North
America and later expanded to other regions. System installations
are expected to begin in late 2001.
</P>
<P>
Boeing said its immediate task is to make these services
available to the airlines and the three million airline passengers
who board some 42,300 flights on Boeing-built planes daily.
