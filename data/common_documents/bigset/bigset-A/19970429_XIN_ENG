<HEADLINE> German Diary of Nanjing Massacre to Appear in Autumn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The eight-volume diary of a
German, John Rabe, detailing Japanese atrocities in the massacre
in Nanjing in 1937, will be published in autumn this year.
</P>
<P>
A lengthy article, entitled "A Merchant Saves 250,000 People,"
was published by the Berlin-based Der Tagesspiegel on Sunday. It
said that Rabe, "a great friend of China," and as chief
representative of the German engineering giant Siemens at that
time, decided to stay in Nanjing to set up a security zone
together with some American friends, when the Japanese army
entered the city.
</P>
<P>
He housed some 250,000 impoverished Chinese who were unable to
flee from home, and helped them escape the Japanese massacre, the
article reported.
</P>
<P>
Rabe witnessed what the Japanese did when they entered Nanjing
and kept a detailed record of the Japanese atrocities against
unarmed Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In his 2,400-page diary, Rabe devoted more than 800 pages to
describing the horrors committed by Japanese soldiers during their
massacre of an estimated 300,000 Chinese people in the city in
1937.
</P>
<P>
"Any one who had callouses on his hands, blisters on his feet
or was short-haired, would be killed as a Chinese soldier by the
Japanese," Rabe wrote in his diary.
</P>
<P>
"Under such a pretext, the Japanese soldiers machine-gunned,
and blasted with grenades, thousands and thousands of Chinese to
death. For those who survived, the Japanese would pour gasoline
on them and burn them to death alive.
</P>
<P>
"Only one or two people survived eventually, and crawled to the
hospital and told others what had happened;
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese soldiers drove the Chinese to the riverside, or
to the banks of over 3,000 ponds, and committed the atrocity of
unparalleled savagery. The more than 3,000 ponds were all full of
corpses.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese raped Chinese women, and those who were not
obedient were killed ruthlessly. Neither could girls aged seven
or eight nor old ladies over 70 years in age escape the brutality
once they fell in the hands of the Japanese;
</P>
<P>
"Many Chinese women were killed after being raped. We found
broken bits of beer bottles and bamboo spikes in the corpses of
some of the dead women."
</P>
<P>
In a report after he returned to Berlin in 1938, Rabe said that
they (he and his friends) "spent the days of December 1937
crawling to and fro on the corpses of the Chinese. We still
couldn't finish burying all the corpses till February 1 the next
year (1938)."
</P>
<P>
By the time Rabe returned to Berlin on February 22, 1938, more
than 30,000 Chinese corpses were still lying in the open, unburied
in Xiaguan, Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
The Der Tagesspiegel newspaper also published photos of the
massacre, and photos of Rabe and his family in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese version of Rabe's diary will be published by the
Nanjing People's Printing House in October this year, on the eve
of the 60 anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
Rabe's diaries and photographs were made public by his
grand-daughter, Ursula Reinhardt, in December last year, on the
59th anniversary of the siege of Nanjing.

<HEADLINE> US New Home Sales Down by 2.5 Percent in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The sales of new homes in the
U.S. declined by 2.5 percent in March but remained strong as the
sales in February was the strongest in eleven years.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Commerce Department reported today that new homes sold at
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 813,000 last month, down from
a rate of 834,000 in February which was the highest since April
1986.
</P>
<P>
The sales in the first three months of this year mark the first
time since 1978 that sales of new homes in the country have topped
the 800,000 level three times in a row.
</P>
<P>
The changes left the annual sales pace for the first quarter 8
percent higher than the fourth quarter. Strong sales reduced the
inventory of unsold homes at the end of March to 297,000, the
lowest in nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
The small decline in new home sales in March was led by a 16.1
percent drop in the Northeast. Sales also fell by 10.5 percent in
the South. But they rose 17.7 percent in the West and 2.5 percent
in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged between 7.84 percent
and 7.97 percent in March and have topped 8 percent during April.
Analysts believe that the rising mortgage rates will eventually
curb home sales a bit later this year.

<HEADLINE> Personal Computer Market Speeds Up in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Growth in the personal computer
market accelerated worldwide in the first quarter this year,
according to preliminary data released today by International Data
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Unit shipments worldwide rose 16 percent over the first quarter
of 1996, compared to only 13 percent year-over-year growth in Q4
1996. The U.S. recorded a 20 percent increase, the fastest of any
major region, and the best quarterly domestic growth rate since
the end of 1995. But Dataquest, another major research group, said
the U.S. PC market grew 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the growth to the introduction of MMX
technology of Intel and a wide-range price cut of PCs.
</P>
<P>
Compaq once again led the market, both in the U.S. and
worldwide. Dell Computer edged out IBM to come in at third in the
U.S. market, Dell's highest position ever. It also claimed third
place in the worldwide rankings, behind Compaq and IBM.
</P>
<P>
The other major regions of the world were not quite as robust
as the United States. PC shipments in Western Europe rose 13
percent, better than in recent quarters, as corporate buying
picked up somewhat despite the weak economic conditions in major
countries. Economic uncertainty weighed upon sales in major Asian
markets as well, holding shipment growth in Japan to 14 percent
and in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region to 13 percent,
"unusually low for that fast-growing part of the world," the
company said.
</P>
<P>
Packard Bell NEC, number two in the U.S. and fourth worldwide,
showed signs of improvement from recent periods, which have been
plagued by manufacturing difficulties and falling sales. The
company's 799 U.S. dollar PC, introduced in January became Packard
Bell's best-selling model. The NEC brand of notebooks and premium
desktops also did well.
</P>
<P>
Making its maiden appearance in the worldwide top five is
Toshiba of Japan, which jumped 60 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Banco Santanter, Spain's largest
financial institution, today opened a representative office in
this, largest economic center of China.
</P>
<P>
The new office is the Spanish bank's second in China, with the
other in the Chinese capital of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Emilio Botin, chairman of the bank group, said that the China
market is full of opportunities and potential, noting that his
bank will focus its Asian business in China.
</P>
<P>
The chairman revealed that his bank is talking with the
People's Bank of China, the central bank, for an early opening of
a China branch and wants to deal in business in the local currency.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish bank has invested more than 200 million US dollars
in infrastructure development in China.
</P>
<P>
The bank today also signed a letter of intent with a Shanghai
gas liquidation company, under which it will provide financial
consultance for the local firm's two projects, valued at 2.26
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Official record shows that Shanghai currently has 154 overseas
financial institutions, including 47 branches and
sub-branches. Most of them have begun to reap profits.
</P>
<P>
China's financial opening-up has been accelerating in recent
years. Late last year and early this year the central bank
approved two batches of eight overseas banks to deal in the local
currency, the Renminbi yuan, on a trial basis in the Shanghai's
Pudong's New Area, an area separated from downtown Shanghai by the
Huangpu River.

<HEADLINE> China Wants ESCAP to Narrow Development Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The major objective of the
cooperation within the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific (ESCAP) should be to narrow the gap in development
between the developed and the developing members, a Chinese
delegate said here today.
</P>
<P>
Great gaps among ESCAP members in the economic development
level are the most salient problem in the region and cooperation
within ESCAP should be targeted at the problem, said Chinese
Assistant Foreign Minister Yang Wenchang.
</P>
<P>
The funding for major ESCAP cooperation projects should have
priorities, said the head of the Chinese delegation at the opening
of the ministerial segment of ESCAP's 53rd session.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that cooperation in science and technology, poverty
eradication, environment protection, human resource development
and infrastructure construction should be areas of priority.
</P>
<P>
Yang also said that the cooperation within ESCAP needs
institutional and funds guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Every key project should have its own special committee to
supervise its planning and implementation and examine the result,
yang said.
</P>
<P>
All ESCAP members should make their own contributions in
accordance with their abilities, he said, but calling on developed
members to shoulder more responsibilities in financial assistance,
technology transfer and opening of their markets.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegate proposed that ESCAP start to consider the
drafting of agenda 21 (ESCAP) to chart the direction of the
development and cooperation for the region in the new century.
</P>
<P>
As one of the founding members of ESCAP, Yang said, China has
all along attached importance to cooperation with other ESCAP
members and supported ESCAP's operations.
</P>
<P>
ESCAP has rendered useful help to China's economic development
and its reform and opening up, he said. China will, as it used to,
maintain and develop friendly relations and cooperation with
ESCAP.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people stand ready to make joint
efforts with other countries in the region to bring a prosperous
and developed Asia-Pacific region with long-standing peace and
stability into the 21st century.

LUANDA, APRIL 28 (Xinhua) -- Angola's food security
situation is serious, said Agriculture Minister Carlos
Fernandes here today.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the Angolan people are living under the
poverty line, the minister said at a press conference on the
symposium of agriculture restoration and development to be held
here on May 6-8.
</P>
<P>
If Angola wants to realize the goal for its restoration and
reconstruction, the country's agriculture must develop as rapidly
as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the Angolan government has no
enough money for the development of agriculture. "Such a
situation must be changed by encouraging privote investment," he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, participants of the symposium
will discuss ways for the agricultural growth, and formulate
policies and strategies for this purpose. enditem

Settlements which opened today.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. should play a significant role in the field, he
noted, urging the international community to carry out its
commitment and create favorable conditions for the developing
countries to improve their people's living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the Istanbul Habitat Two Conference, the Chinese
government decided to speed up the housing construction for the
ordinary Chinese people, seeing it as part of the national
development strategy up to 2010, said Li.
</P>
<P>
China has been prepared to build 11 billion square meters of
new housing in the next 15 years, he announced.
</P>
<P>
China has also intensified its efforts to transform the
existing housing system to a market-oriented system, raised the
proportion of commercialized housing and spread Central
Provident Fund for housing so as to reach the goal, he said.
</P>
<P>
China holds "the policy that equal attention should be paid to
both saving and developing resources" when developing
settlements, he concluded at the U.N. meeting on human
settlements, which will end on May 7. enditem

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Praised for Helping S. African Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's High
Commissioner to Lesotho Japhet Ndlovu today praised Lesotho for
its assistance to S. African freedom fighters during the
apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
A report by the South African Press Association from Maseru,
the capital of Lesotho, said that the mountain kingdom offered
political asylum to hundreds of members of South African
liberation movements during the period.
</P>
<P>
Many Lasotho people "were witnesses to the historical
developments that took place during the struggle for the
dismantling of apartheid", said Ndlovu at a function in Maseru to
mark South Africa's third National Freedom Day on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On the bilateral relations between the two countries, Ndlovu
said the two governments had tackled important issues together,
citing the study permits for Lasotho students in South Africa
and the cross border shooting.
</P>
<P>
The border problems had been brought under control through
district liaison committees which tackled a wide range of
problems affecting communities on both sides of the border, added
Ndlovu. enditem

<HEADLINE> British Government to Send Troops to Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The British government is to send
some 200 British troops to Zaire as an additional precautious
measure in case of evacuating British and Commonwealth nationals
from the African nation.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the British Ministry of Defense was quoted by
the Reuters news agency as saying this afternoon: "There is no
need as yet to evacuate British nationals. We are taking
additional precautions putting troops closer to hand in case they
should be needed."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the British troops, which would leave
over the next few days, would fly to Libreville in Gabon and 38
British Royal Marines were already in Brazzaville in the Congo
ready to evacuate British nationals from the Zairean capital
Kinshasa.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Agriculture Minister
Denis Norman announced his resignation here today from both the
government and active politics with effect from April 30.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that his decision was not influenced by any
member of the government and did not indicate any disagreement
with government policies.
</P>
<P>
"After careful consideration, I feel the time has now arrived
for me to retire from active politics and in this regard, I
discussed the subject with his excellency, the president, at a
meeting held on April 9, 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This afforded me the opportunity to thank the president for
the confidence he has shown in me during the years since
independence in 1980," Norman said.
</P>
<P>
Norman, 66, white, has served in the government for 15 years
since the southern African country declared independence 17 years
ago. He has been a minister for 12 years, mainly in the
Agriculture Ministry and once in the Transport Ministry.
</P>
<P>
There are rumors that he was losing popularity among white
commercial farmers especially after introducing an aggregate 10
percent levy for tobacco growers and merchants in 1996.

<HEADLINE> UK Lags Behind Competitor Countries in Attracting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Investment performance in Britain
is "disappointing" compared with recovery from recession in the
early 1980s and in comparison with competitor countries, said a
survey released today by the Confederation of British Industry
(CBI).
</P>
<P>
The CBI has found that since the election in early 1992
"investment trends have been disappointing, with the recovery in
investment falling well short of that in the early Eighties and
with some other countries".
</P>
<P>
The confederation studied fixed capital spending since 1992 and
compared it with the trend during the economic recovery 11 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
It found that economy-wide investment in the last quarter of
1996 was only about 5 percent higher than five years before,
whereas total fixed investment had grown by as much as 26 percent
at the same stage of the 1980s recovery.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said this "comparatively weak recovery" in investment
is in part due to the public sector since capital spending by the
Government has fallen by a third over the duration of the
recovery.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a report over the weekend showed that the UK
has been overtaken by France as the favorite center for new
investment into the European Union by foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The report from the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research (NIESR) said that while Britain still has more inward
investment than any other EU state, France attracted more in the
five years to 1995, drawing in 19 Billion US dollars of investment
against Britain's 17.2 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
It argued that while the UK's flexible labor markets remain
attractive to foreign firms, Britain is losing out in the race to
win more capital and research and development-intensive new
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The findings by the NIESR call into serious question the
Government claims that Britain is the most popular location for
inward investors because it has avoided EU social laws and created
a flexible labor market.
</P>
<P>
However, authors of the report Ray Barrell and Nigel Pain
suggest that one of the reasons why France has ousted Britain is
because it is perceived to be more committed to European
integration.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong return to the Pacific
Rugby Championship this year and hope to replac Canada as the
title holders.
</P>
<P>
But Hong Kong had first to overcome tournament underdogs Japan
in the opening match at Aberdeen Stadium here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two teams also played each other in the opening fixture of
the inaugural championship last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite outscoring Japan by four tries to three, Hong Kong went
down 34-27 in a thrilling encounter in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong want to improve on their performance from last year
when the team won two out of their six outings on a home-and-away
basis against Canada, Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
All the four teams are expected to field their full strength
sides.
</P>
<P>
The curtain raiser to this Saturday's championship features the
Hong Kong Dragons against the Asian Barbarians made up of players
from China, Chinese Taipei, Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Dragons will also play Chinese Taipei before the May 24
encounter between Hong Kong and defending champions Canada.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Rugby Football Union (HKRFU) Secretary Peter Else
said, "This year's Pacific Rim Championship promises to be even
better than the inaugural tournament.
</P>
<P>
"All the teams are capable of beating one another. Everyone
realizes they are in with a chance and this will surely provide
some very exciting rugby," he said.
</P>
<P>
The championship will close on June 29, when hosts Japan plays
Hong Kong in the 10th and final match.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijani, Armenian Presidents Hold Talks in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijani President Gaidar
Aliyev and Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan this afternoon
held a 45-minute-long talk in Istanbul, Turkey, on the dispute of
the Norgorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of the two countries, both Turkey's neighbors,
failed to make any statement to the press.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents arrived in Istanbul today for a three-day
business conference of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC).
</P>
<P>
As "mediator" of the dispute over the status of
Norgorno-Karabakh between Azerbaijan and Armenia, Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel said before their meeting that Turkey
would make efforts to mediate between the two countries in a bid
to establish peace in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said: "It is easy to spoil peace, but it is difficult
to secure peace again."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president was present at the meeting between Aliyev
and Petrosyan in the beginning, but left five minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is not only following the peace in the Caucasus, but
also the peace in the Middle East and Balkans, said Demirel.
</P>
<P>
On April 19, an armed conflict in the border area between
Azerbaijan and Armenia broke out again since the cease-fire was
secured between the two countries in 1994. More than 50
people were killed or wounded in the conflict which was the
largest one since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Armenia have made no progress in their talks
as there are differences over the status of the future of
Norgorno-Karabakh and the conditions for the deployment of
peace-keeping troops of the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in the region since the two
countries ceased conflicts in 1994.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa and his Kenyan counterpart Daniel arap Moi arrived
at the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha today, ready for
tomorrow's second summit of the three-member East Africa
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here said that Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni is expected in Arusha tomorrow morning to attend the
summit of the EAC set up in March last year.
</P>
<P>
Moi, also the current summit chairman, toured the EAC
Secretariat offices in Arusha later today.
</P>
<P>
He was briefed on various issues on regional cooperation by
the secretariat top executive and other officials.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Improves Telephone Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) is conducting a program
worth 90.91 million U.S. Dollars in a bid to better the national
telephone network and thus help the country get more investment.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Investment Center today said the PTC's capital
budget, submitted to the parliament recently, showed that the
bulk of the investment would be incurred on the ongoing
digitalization program and on upgrading the existing network.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the funds to finance the projects would be raised
from the PTC's own resources as well as donors," said the center.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank warned last year that the country's
telecommunications network could be a deterrent to investment.
</P>
<P>
The PTC has more than 100,000 potential subscribers awaiting a
telephone line. enditem

<HEADLINE> Coffee Prices Expected to Be Higher in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's average coffee price
for this marketing season is expected to be firmer and higher
than last year's 2,640 U.S. Dollars per ton following reduced
production in a number of coffee-producing countries.
</P>
<P>
Coffee Producers Association Chairman Philip Gifford said here
today some 30 percent of 12,000 tons of coffee in the southern
African country has already been committed in forward sales.
</P>
<P>
"The indications are that the market will be firmer and the
prices will be higher because of the problems in Kenya, the
unrest in Burundi and Rwanda, the social problems in Colombia and
the climate conditions in Brazil," Gifford said.
</P>
<P>
The difficulties facing these countries have lead to reduced
production, giving Zimbabwean producers an edge in the
international coffee market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe exports its coffee to European, America and Asia.

<HEADLINE> 237 Registered for Presidential Race in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Interior Ministry
announced here tonight that a total of 237 persons were
registered as applicants for the 7th presidential elections
scheduled for May 23.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that the Guardian
Council, a supreme body above the Parliament, is to scrutinize
the qualifications of the applicants in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no names of the specific applicants.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the number of the applicants this
year is 185 percent higher than that of the previous
presidential elections four years ago.
</P>
<P>
It shows that more people are interested in the presidential
race since supreme leader Ali Khamenei and current President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani will stay away from the race.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Constitution bars Rafsanjani from running for the
third term of the presidency. So he has to step down from the
office in August.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri,
former minister of culture and Islamic guidance Mohammad
Khatami, former minister of information Mohammad Mohammadi
Reyshahri and deputy head of the judiciary Seyed Reza Zavarei
are among the applicants.
</P>
<P>
The candidates have 12 days to run for the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the 7th presidential election campaign has been
already in full swing across Iran since there are only 24 days
left to the elections.
</P>
<P>
Experts hold that more serious election activities are
expected in the coming days when the Guardian Council is to
issue its ruling on the nomination papers.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the 54-year-old parliament speaker is the
front-runner who has a big chance of winning the presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
However, some political analysts said that the mild and open
personality of Mohammad Khatami is attracting more and more
support from the public, especially the educated people.
</P>
<P>
There will be a fierce battle between the two clergymen.
</P>
<P>
The next president will hold office in August.

<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China beat Sweden 3-1
to sail into the men's team semi-finals of the World Table Tennis
Championships here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kong Linghui, the world top-ranked player, beat Peter Karlsson
21-14, 21-17 to win the fourth game. Karlsson had lost to Kong in
the last World Championships in Tianjin, China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese veteran Wang Tao had put China 2-1 up as he beat Jorgen
Persson in the third game of the best-of-five match.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Wang, who snatched a crucial point from Persson
in the last world championship final, nipped his rival 22-20,
21-15.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 12-13 in the second set, Persson strained his groin
muscle in a forehand attack and had to receive on-court medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Liu Guoliang won the opening game against
Karlsson 21-17, 22-20 and Sweden won the second rubber as Jan-Ove
Waldner downed Kong in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, who had won all four encounters with Kong, nipped the
world No. one 21-15, 27-25.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, which finished second to Belgium in its group, lost its
seeding and was drawn into the first quarter topped by China.
</P>
<P>
China and Sweden had met in six world championship finals with
each winning three.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team leader Li Furong owed the victory to strong
mentality of the Chinese trio and the lineup mistake made by
Swedish head coach Ulf Carlsson.
</P>
<P>
"The one we are afraid of is Waldner, not Karlsson or Persson,"
Li said. "But Carlsson made a big mistake by putting Waldner in
the second and fifth game. He never considered the Swedes could
lose 1-3 and Waldner might not have a chance to play the last
game."
</P>
<P>
Carlsson begged to disagree, insisting that he made a perfect
lineup.
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing wrong with the lineup, China just played
better today," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied with the performance of my players, but unhappy
with the result," the Swedish coach added.
</P>
<P>
Waldner said he held no grudge against Carlsson who put him as
a No. 2 player in the match.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play too well the day before yesterday. If I was the
head coach, I could have made such decision," said Waldner, who
lost two team games in the group matches against Belarus and
Belgium.

ADDIS ABABA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Salim A Salim, Secretary

that ''Africa should not depend on the outside world for survival
but should assume leadership on its own affairs.''

foreign affairs of the South African parliament.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the OAU agenda has now significantly shifted from
political affairs to socio-economic matters, through the establish-
ment of the African economic community.
</P>
<P>
Salim also elaborated on the issue of human rights and
democratization in Africa as being of major concern to the OAU.
</P>
<P>
On the Zaire crisis, he said the situation in Zaire was most
worrying.

<HEADLINE> Israel Accused of Rounding Up Egyptians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptians accused Israel of
arresting Egyptian workers to pressure Egypt into releasing Azzam
Azzam, who is being held on charges of spying for the Israeli
Mossad, the Middle East Times reported in its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
The weekly quoted media reports as saying that Israel was
arresting large numbers of Egyptians on charges that they were
working in Israel without permits.
</P>
<P>
The economic daily Al Alam Al Youm said in a recent report that
Israel had begun a "wide-ranging campaign to detain Egyptians and
put them into the notorious Ayaluat prison, which is known for its
poor conditions."
</P>
<P>
The independent Egyptian daily further claimed that Israeli
Minister of Infrastructure and former general in the 1967 war
Ariel Sharon called for the detention.
</P>
<P>
On April 20, the opposition daily Al Ahrar supported the
charges, saying that Egyptians were detained on Sharon's orders.
</P>
<P>
"The campaign has been promoted by Sharon's call to the Israeli
Knesset to pressure Egypt to release Israelis held in Egypt on
charges of spying, forgery and drug trafficking," it said.
</P>
<P>
Rumors that Israel is seeking a deal with Egypt have abounded
since Israeli TV reported last December that Israel, which has
denied that Azzam has any links with Mossad, was ready to exchange
him for Egyptians held in its prisons.
</P>
<P>
According to the weekly Al Musawar newspaper, 20
spying-for-profit networks for Israel have been dismantled since
the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in March 1979.
</P>
<P>
There are altogether five Egyptians and Israelis who are
involved in two recent spy cases in Egypt. If convicted, they
might face the harshest penalty, life imprisonment.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary
General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), today called
on the warring parties in Zaire to hold immediate talks seeking a
lasting and peaceful solution to the crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
This will pave "the way to a peaceful transition leading to
general elections and new political dispensation in Zaire," he
said in a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
He urged the parties concerned to take full advantage of the
on-going efforts by African leaders and by the UN/OAU special
representative for the Great Lakes region aimed at facilitating a
meeting between Zariean President Mobutu Sese Seko and Zairean
rebel leader Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern over the deteriorating situation on
refugees and displaced people in eastern Zaire, saying that "I am
particularly disturbed by the most recent reports regarding
killings of Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire."
</P>
<P>
Thousands of refugees particularly women and children are in
critical condition and need immediate access to humanitarian
assistance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim urged the parties concerned to cooperate with U.N.
agencies and other humanitarian institutions in providing
assistance to the refugees and facilitating their safe
repatriation. enditem

UNITED NATIONS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday called upon member states to ratify the
Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)if they have not yet done so.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Urges Separation from Air Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The British Airways today urged
French authorities to separate it from Air Algeria in the
Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport of Paris, as they do in other
French airports.
</P>
<P>
The British Airways closed its reception counter today during
the time when Air Algeria, which has its reception counter next to
that of British Airways and share the same baggage conveyor belt
with it, was serving its passengers.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a problem concerning Air Algeria, but a problem
concerning the level of security established by each government
for a given company," said George Cooper, general director for
Europe of British Airways.
</P>
<P>
The British air company has also filed a suit against French
authorities for failing to provide enough security. A verdict
will be given by a Paris court on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Asked why Britain does not separate Air Algeria from other air
companies in London airports, Cooper said that the British
government assigns a different "level of security" to Air
Algeria than the French government, which regards the Algerian air
company as a high risk one.
</P>
<P>
Air Algeria, the only air company serving direct flight between
Algiers and Paris, resumed its flight between the two capitals
last Friday after a two-year suspension.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan welcomed on Monday recent measures taken by the Zairean
rebel leader Laurent Kabila to solve the humanitarian crisis in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is encouraged that Laurent Kabila
traveled to Kisangani over the weekend to take personal charge of
the grave humanitarian situation involving Rwandan refugees in
eastern Zaire," said a statement released by the U.N. Spokesman's
Office.
</P>
<P>
"He is also pleased that Mr. Kabila pledged to cooperate with
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other
humanitarian agencies to resolve the problem," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
These measures were taken soon after Mr. Kabila gave a 60-day
deadline for the United Nations to repatriate all Rwandan
refugees, which the United Nations described as "unrealistic"
because the whereabouts of the refugees are not clear, not to
mention repatriation.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the international humanitarian agencies
would need the support of Mr. Kabila, and that of his alliance,
to locate and gain access to the refugees, gather them to points
where they can receive aid and be secure, and eventually
repatriate them to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General and the entire international community
are counting on that support for a successful relief operation
and will continue to monitor the situation closely," the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Money Market to Reach Top Notch: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- An expected increase in the
capital traded in the Egyptian money market will make it the
biggest market in the region, Egypt's top banking official
predicted today.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Abdel Aziz, board chairman of the Egyptian National
Bank, said the Israeli stock exchange now ranks first with a
market capital of 21 billion U.S. dollars, followed by the Saudi
market with 18 billion dollars and the Egyptian one with 12
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said several favorable developments in the Egyptian money
market have contributed to its solidity and fortification both
domestically and internationally.
</P>
<P>
These include computerized systems on capital and share
trading as well as regular and daily data-circulation, said Aziz
who is also head of the Egyptian Banks Federation (EBF).
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian money market is also being linked to the largest
telecommunications networks the world over, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Egypt has signed cooperation
agreements with Bahrain and Jordan for the exchange of the
registration of their joint-stock companies and facilitating
dealings between the citizens of these countries.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the banking system's role in attracting foreign
capital, the volume of trading on the Egyptian Stock Exchange
(ESE) has largely increased, contributing to the marked progress
in implementing the privatization program, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreigners' demand on the bills, bonds and
securities graded in the ESE is on the rise and their
contribution to the total market value of traded securities
reached 31 percent, Aziz added.

<HEADLINE> Major Urges Northern Irelanders Not to Vote for IRA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- In his last-ditch efforts to win
the upcoming election in May 1, Prime Minister John Major went to
Northern Ireland today for campaigning and called on local voters
to vote against Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who votes Sinn Fein in this election is condoning the
violence," local media quoted Major as saying. "We have seen, I
hope, that people will cast their votes for the genuinely
democratic parties in Northern Ireland and I look forward to them
to doing that on Thursday this week."
</P>
<P>
He has lagged far behind the opposition Labor party in recent
opinion polls and seems to be toppled by Labor leader Tony Blair
on Thursday by a landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
IRA guerrillas, who have been fighting against the British rule
of Northern Ireland for nearly three decades, have caused chaos
and huge economic losses in British mainland in recent weeks with
bombs and bomb threats.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Former French Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur said today that France should adopt a more
liberal socio-economic policy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Le Figaro due to be published on
Tuesday, Balladur said that a more liberal social and economic
policy means less public spending, less taxes, more contracts,
more social dialogue, more liberty and more flexibility.
</P>
<P>
"I am the supporter of an economy of liberty... It was when
resorting to more liberty that I succeeded in relaunching the
economic machine and began to reduce unemployment," he said in
reference to his mandate as prime minister in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Balladur, who is now parliamentary deputy of Paris for the
ruling Gaullist Rally for the Republic party, said that although
France now faces many problems, it is "on the good track."
</P>
<P>
He said that France now faces two long-term tasks: reduce its
public deficit to 2 percent of its gross domestic product and cut
taxes.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government "go further" in its plan to
cut 5,000 public jobs each year.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Russia Reach Big Natural Gas Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Russia today signed a
deal worth 13.5 billion U.S. dollars in Istanbul, the largest city
of Turkey, on supply of Russian natural gas in the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by Turkey's Energy Minister Recai Kutan
and Rem Vyakhirev, president of Gazprom, the giant Russian
natural gas producer and exporter. Kutan and Vyakhirev were in
Istanbul to attend a three-day business conference of the Black
Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC).
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, the two men told reporters that the
new natural gas deal would help guarantee Turkey's energy
security in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The natural gas will be sent to Turkey through an
existing pipeline running from Russia via Ukraine, Moldova,
Romania and Bulgaria, said Kutan.
</P>
<P>
He said that additional compressors, pumping stations and loop
pipes would be installed on the pipelines at a cost of 87 million
dollars, adding "Turkey's natural gas demand is increasing beyond
expectations."
</P>
<P>
Turkey's natural gas demand will increase more than threefold
to 27 billion cubic meters by the year of 2000 and more
than sevenfold to 60 billion cubic meters by 2010, local
economists said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Turkey consumed 6 billion cubic meters of natural gas
imported from Russia and 2 billion cubic meters of Liquefied
Natural Gas (LNG) from Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Turkey intends to buy LNG from Egypt and Nigeria and
plans to purchase 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas a
year from Iran through a new pipeline from Tabriz, Iran, to
Ankara, despite strong U.S. objections.

<HEADLINE> US Computer Giant Introduces First Home PC Theater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Compaq Computer Corporation,
the computer giant in the United States, introduced today its
first home personal computer theater that combines a fully
featured computer with a large-screen television.
</P>
<P>
The new device is put into the market at a time when the
nation's transition to digital television is about to appear next
year.
</P>
<P>
The PC theaters are considered large-screen entertainment
centers that double as computers, allowing consumers to watch
television programs or prerecorded movies, cruise the internet,
play computer games or send and receive E-mail.
</P>
<P>
With this product, the computer industry believes that it can
push its way into the television market because digital television
will be computer, in essence. The new PC theater was designed to
look like a television first and computer second.
</P>
<P>
Compaq says that the new product is primarily intended to prime
the market for the true digital television. The company felt
strongly that this was the direction it needed to go.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Plans Not to Use Euro in Public Services Until 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- German government today said that
public service sector in the country would not use the single
European currency, the Euro, until the year 2002 due to cost
reasons.
</P>
<P>
"Initial considerations... are for a uniform changeover of all
public administrative bodies from January 1, 2002," said the German
Finance Ministry in an interim report approved by the Bonn
government.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is due to introduce the Euro from January 1,
1999. At the first stage, however, the Euro would only be used for
accounting purposes during a three-year transition period from
1999 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
From January 1, 2002, the Euro banknotes and coins would be
issued and current national currencies, such as the German mark,
would cease to be legal tender at the latest from June 30, 2002.
</P>
<P>
German government said it could not introduce the Euro for
accounting purposes in public services, such as taxation, social
welfare payment and customs services, until 2002 due to the high
costs of managing two currency systems at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Germany, EU members such as Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg
and the Netherlands are considering to introduce the Euro in
public administration from 1999. France, like Germany, plans to
wait until 2002.
</P>
<P>
Decision on which EU states will make the first wave to join
the Euro in 1999 will be made next April based on full economic
data from 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Food shortage caused by
drought hitting Tanzania pushed up the rate of inflation to 17
percent in March from 13.8 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa announced
that about four million Tanzanians are facing food shortage and
need some 138,765 tons of cereals to sustain them for the next
five months.
</P>
<P>
He listed food deficit regions as Arusha, Coast, Dodoma,
Kilimanjaro, Lindi, Mara, Mwanza, Shinyanga, Singida, Tabora and
Tanga.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) told the
official Daily News here today that bad roads in many parts of
the country affected transportation of food to those areas
suffering from food shortage.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in March road transport industry was
significantly affected by the government's directive for buses to
fix speed limiters amd many bus owners had failed to meet the
February 28 deadline.
</P>
<P>
The official, however, said that he believed that the problems
were temporary and the inflationary trends would soon be
reversed.
</P>
<P>
"We may even attain the 10 percent target by the end of next
June," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has continued to maintain a strict
fiscal policy and control spending. "All is well, things are not

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A long-delayed international
conference to assist the Bosnian reconstruction will be held in
May 25, the Sarajevo daily "Oslobodjenje" reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The date was confirmed by Nedeljko Despotovic, a senior
official of the Bosnian Federation which, he said, had been
formally notified by the organizers.
</P>
<P>
The so-called donors conference, during which more than 1.4
billion dollars are expected to be pledged, had been postponed
several times because the Bosnian parties failed to fulfill
conditions set by the Office of High Representative, which is in
charge of the Dayton accords implementation.
</P>
<P>
The conference was conditioned on the passage of an economic
package which include bills on central bank, currency, customs,
payment of debt, tariff and foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Although most items of the package are still unsettled, West
European countries and the United States, who are the major
donors, seem to be resigned fearful that further delaying the
conference would not result in real progress in the peace process.

very important for the MFN to go forward.... It is a strategic
imperative for this relationship to go forward and the trade
relationship is very important in that regard."
</P>
<P>
Asked about China's entry into the World Trade Organization,
Qian Qichen told reporters that "questions that are remaining
would be resolved" as talks on the issue are "positive ones."
</P>
<P>
With regard to the allegations that China has funneled money to
influence U.S. politics, Qian Qichen categorically dismissed them
as nonsensical.
</P>
<P>
"It is very usual for people to seek political contribution and
money politics in the United States. But that has nothing to do
with China," he said.

<HEADLINE> US Asks Europeans to Curb Trade With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is asking European nations to extend their
brief suspension of trade with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The request was made by Albright in a message over the weekend
to the European Union foreign ministers, who are due to meet
Tuesday in Luxembourg and will reportedly resume their "critical
dialogue" with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff was sent to Europe last
week to ask the Europeans to join the U.S. trade embargo against
Iran.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a news briefing
today that the U.S. hopes to cooperate with the Europeans in
dealing the relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
On April 10, a German court ruled that Iranian leaders ordered
the September 17, 1992 killings of four Iranian dissidents at a
Berlin restaurant. Iran denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
The EU nations withdrew their envoys from Tehran and suspended
their policy of trading with Iran on April 10 after the ruling
of the German court.
</P>
<P>
The EU is expected to decide to end the suspension of trading
with Iran. The U.S. hopes the EU will follow and join the embargo
permanently against Iran but the EU opposes the measure, seeking a
policy of "critical dialogue."
</P>
<P>
Burns said, "We are realistic. We don't think the European
Union is going to adopt our policy."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese Communist Party
official extended greetings to all Chinese workers and workers in
the rest of the world here today, on the eve of International
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
and of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, extended the
greetings in a meeting today in the Great Hall of the People with
representatives of the country's Ten Excellent Workers and Labor Day
medalists.
</P>
<P>
Heroic collectives and role models of the working class have
been emerging in large numbers over the past 10-odd years. Those
cited this time are outstanding examples of them. "That you have
made glorious achievements at ordinary posts indicates vividly
that the working class is worthy of the title of our leading
class, and the major force in the reform and opening-up drive," Hu
noted, adding that the Party's guiding principle of wholeheartedly
relying on the working class has proven to be correct.
</P>
<P>
"We will unswervingly adhere to that principle in the future and
bring the workers' great historical role into full play, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on all Chinese workers to make greater efforts to
welcome the return of Hong Kong to the motherland and the
convocation of the 15th National Party Congress
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC
Central Committee and chairman of the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions, made a lengthy speech at the meeting. He called on
all workers to learn more about the socialist market economy and
have confidence in the reform of state-owned enterprises, and help
laid-off workers find new job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Hu Jintao also met with a delegation of
Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions and May Day tour members from
trade unions of Hong Kong and Macao.

<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders for Durable Goods Down 3 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories for
durable goods plunged by 3 percent in March, the biggest drop in
seven months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders for durable goods, items
expected to last for more than three years, totaled a seasonally
adjusted 171.5 billion dollars in March, down from 176.8 billion
in February.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest decline since orders fell by 3.6 percent in
last August and also the first drop since December.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. government also revised the increase of
orders in February down to 0.8 percent, weaker than initially
estimated 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that demands shrank in all major categories
in March. Orders for transportation equipment dropped 4.3 percent
after falling 7.3 percent in February. Orders for both aircraft
and motor vehicles had decreased.
</P>
<P>
Excluding transportation sector, orders were also down by 2.6
percent, the steepest decline since a 3 percent decrease in June
1991.
</P>
<P>
Bookings for electronic and other electrical equipment fell 5.9
percent, resulting mostly from fewer orders for electronic
components and communications equipment. This category had posted
jumps of 7.7 percent in February and 17.8 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Orders for industrial machinery and equipment were down by 1.2
percent and for primary metals, off 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders, which had suggested growing
demand recently, fell by 3.5 percent, the first decline since last
August. Shipments rose 0.7 percent, the third straight advance.
</P>
<P>
The orders for durable goods are considered a key gauge of U.S.
manufacturing strength.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Current Account Deficit Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account
deficit rose sharply in the first quarter of the year, hitting
7.94 billion U.S. dollars, a report of the Bank of Korea said
today.
</P>
<P>
The figure, which was 71.1 percent higher than the same period
last year, accounted for half of the amount of 14 to 16 billion
dollars that the government budgeted for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
However, the current account situation is likely to improve
because the nation's exports are expected to rebound rapidly from
a long setback, now there has been a recovery of the prices of its
main export items, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the price recovery, the current account deficit
in March, which was 2.27 billion dollars, was significantly
reduced from January's 3.16 billion dollars and February's 2.5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit also showed a downward trend in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
It dropped to 1.4 billion dollars in March from the 1.83
billion dollars in February and 2.34 billion dollars in January.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance measures the flow of goods and
services, and investment income and other monetary transfers of a
country.

<HEADLINE> WMO: 1996 Becomes Eighth Warmest Year Since 1860 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- 1996 has become the eighth warmest
year on record since 1860, according to the annual statement
issued today by the Geneva-based World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) on the status of the global climate.
</P>
<P>
Although 1996 was one of the coldest years in recent decades in
some parts of the world, the global mean surface temperature was
0.22 degree centigrade above the 1961-1990 average compared to the
record anomaly of 0.38 degree centigrade in 1995. 1996 was not as
warm as 1995, but 1996 was the eighteenth consecutive year with
positive global temperature anomalies.
</P>
<P>
The most predominant feature of 1996 was the extent and
magnitude of heavy rains that affected many parts of the world,
notably in southern Europe and parts of northern Africa and the
Middle East which were deluged with record rainfalls in early
1996. In contrast to the very dry conditions that characterized
most of the previous decade, the above-normal rainfall brought
welcome relief to those in the Iberian Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
1996 was also the second consecutive year with above-normal
hurricane activity with a near-record two-year total. The
outstanding exception to these precipitation events was the severe
drought experienced over much of northern Mexico and south-western
United States during the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The ozone hole over the Antarctic was just as prominent as it
has been in recent years with significant ozone depletion over the
Northern Hemisphere especially in Europe, the Arctic and
Northeastern Atlantic Oceans during the January-March period.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since 1985, the snow cover over the Northern
Hemisphere was above the median, totaling 25.4 million square
kilometers. It ranked as the fifth snowiest in 24 years of the
satellite record, particularly during the spring months from March
to May and during the autumn months from September to November.
</P>
<P>
China suffered from the worst flooding in 50 years, resulting
in more than 1000 deaths and property damage affecting at least 20
million people in the country. Northern and Central South America
had above-normal rainfall, inundating parts of Argentina, Brazil,
Colombia and Paraguay. Europe experienced record-making dryness,
from the United Kingdom across central Europe to Russia, with
Belgium seeing the driest year since 1833, and the third driest
year for England and Wales since 1766.

MOSCOW, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman today hailed the visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin
to his country as a "complete success."
</P>
<P>
Gennady Tarasov told a press conference here that the visit
confirmed an equal and confidential partnership between Russia and

</P>
<P>
The partnership is in accordance with the interests of both
sides, and is becoming an increasingly important and independent
factor in the international arena, he said.
</P>
<P>
He spoke of the Chinese-Russian Joint Statement on the
Multipolarization of the World and the Establishment of a New
International Order, signed during Jiang's visit.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov said it "reflects our two countries' common vision of
setting up a multi-polar world, and the role of Russian-Chinese
partnership in this process."
</P>
<P>
Tarasov described as a "unique document on military and
political issues" the Agreement on Mutual Reduction of Military
Forces in Border Areas between China and the four countries,
Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the five nations of the Asia-Pacific region
have solved a series of sensative problems through peaceful
negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the visit from April 22 to April 26 which resulted
in the two documents. During his stay, Jiang also spoke to the

MANCHESTER, England, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China blanked the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea to win the Corbillon Cup for
the 12th time at the women's team final of the World Table Tennis
Championships here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
World No. 4 Yang Ying put China on the winning track as she
beat Wil Bok Sun in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Yang, the highest-ranked penholder in the
world, used a variety of high-toss serves and strong follow-up
attacks to beat unranked Wil 22-20, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
Deng Yaping, the most successful female player of the modern
era, sent China 2-0 ahead as she used her superior power to carve
out a 21-15, 21-14 victory over Kim Hyon Hui, a losing
semi-finalist at the Atlanta Olympic Games last summer.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Deng, who has added four Olympic gold medals to
her world record haul of 15 world championship and World Cup
titles, overwhelmed the 17-year-old rival Kim with ferocious
forehand attacks and backhand flicks.
</P>
<P>
Li Ju, ranked fifth, snatched the third game against Tu Jong
Sil, winning 21-8, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Li, who beat Tu for the first time at the
Global Youth Championships in February, showed no mercy in the
game. Her variation of spin and speed proved too much for Tu, who
hit a forehand long to concede the match point.
</P>
<P>
DPR Korea, which formed a joint team with South Korea to defeat
China in the 1991 championship final, didn't compete in the
previous two Worlds.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Troops in Hong Kong to Wear New Uniforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The troops of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) to be stationed in Hong Kong will start
wearing a new generation of uniforms as of May 1, the PLA's
General Logistics Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The troops to be stationed in Hong Kong will march into Hong
Kong on July 1 in the new military uniforms, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The current uniforms of the PLA, known as Style-87, were first
used in 1988 but are now regarded as unsuitable, it said.
</P>
<P>
China began designing a new generation of uniforms for use into
the 21st century in early 1993, and the new uniforms to be used by
the troops in Hong Kong were made on the basis of that generation.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the current uniforms, the new ones are
significantly improved in structure, material, color, adornments
and match-up, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
The main hue of the new uniforms will be brown-green for the
army, white and dark blue for the navy, and sky blue for the air
force.

<HEADLINE> EU Ambassadors to Return to Iran Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) countries
will send their ambassadors back to Iran soon in a move seen as
indicating they are not prepared to damage lucrative ties with the
country.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of EU foreign ministers today also decided to keep
its "critical dialogue" with Iran under suspension, and freeze
official bilateral ministerial visits.
</P>
<P>
An EU diplomat in Tehran was quoted as saying earlier that the
first wave of ambassadors could return before the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU urged Iran to respect international law and
refrain from "terrorist acts." It urged Iran to abide by its
commitments to non-proliferation of mass destruction weapons and
the protection of human rights.
</P>
<P>
It also asked Iran to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention,
which bans the use and production of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the EU and Iran were strained when all EU
countries, except Greece, recalled their ambassadors to Iran
earlier this month after a German court, on April 10, ruled that
Tehran's leadership organized the murder of four Kurdish
dissidents in Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Iran, denying any involvement in the murders, expelled four
German diplomats and has since taken a tough stance toward EU
criticism.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Increases Cooperation with Dalian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A Singaporean economic group,
which arrived here Monday night has shown interest in cooperation
with this coastal city in north China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The group, composed of 36 representatives from the Chan
Brother Group, Lin Teck Lee Group of Companies and some other
enterprises, held talks this morning with their local counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Loh Wing Siew, managing director of the Singapore Keppel

position in China."
</P>
<P>
Loh, new to the city, has begun to collect information and
decided to make further contacts with some enterprises here,
hoping for similar cooperation to that his company has already
enjoyed in Suzhou, Shanghai, Guangdong and Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
Trade and economic cooperation between Singapore and Dalian are
doing well. Lee Kuan Yew, senior minister of Singapore, has
visited the city twice, and this has helped greatly promote the
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has opened 143 projects in Dalian, with 780 million
US dollars in investment, of which the co-funded Dayaowan
Container Dock Co., Ltd, now under construction, accounts for 480

<HEADLINE> Bomb Threats Forces Closure of London Motorways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Just 48 hours before the British
elections on May 1, bomb threats forced the closure of large
stretches of four major motorways into London, blocking the way of
thousands of commuters.
</P>
<P>
Police said they received coded telephone threats at 6:50
a.m. today, the typical IRA warning, and had to close parts of the
M-1 motorway leading into London from northern England, and the
M-25 ring road around the capital which links to the Channel ports
as well as Heathrow and Gatwick airports.
</P>
<P>
Parts of the M-20 and the M-26 were also shut, bringing the
total affected motorway to more than 50 miles (80 km).
</P>
<P>
Heathrow airport's terminal for European flights had to be
closed for 22 minutes after a coded phone alert. Two terminals at
Gatwick, the other London airport, were also evacuated after
threatening calls.
</P>
<P>
Facing strong opposition from the Irish Republican Army against
British rule in Northern Ireland, Prime Minister John Major vowed
the government would not be moved by the terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the British people are going to be moved by
this. They have made their judgement of the IRA. You can't cower
the British people like this," he told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, fighting against British rule of Northern Ireland for
more than two decades, has staged a string of bomb attacks and
hoaxes on roads, railways and airports during the election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of IRA, is bidding to land three
seats in the British parliament in Thursday's election.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, while touring Northern Ireland for the campaign,
Major urged local voters not to vote for Sinn Fein. Voting for
Sinn Fein was a vote for violence, he said.

<HEADLINE> France Hails Enforcement of Chemical Weapons Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- France today hailed the enforcement
of the Chemical Weapons Convention designed to ban the
development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons
in the world.
</P>
<P>
"This convention is the first treaty of disarmament of
universal vocation, outlawing an entire category of weapons of
mass destruction, and effectively verifiable by a device of
multilateral control," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman
Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He said the text was "a new positive signal given to the cause
of disarmament and (nuclear) non-proliferation." It followed the
indefinite extension in May 1995 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, and the approval of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in
the United Nations General Assembly in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said France would continue to uphold the ban on
production of fissile materials for nuclear arms, of biological
weapons, and of anti-personnel land mines.
</P>
<P>
France also called on all countries to sign the convention,
which calls for the destruction of all chemical weapons of mass
destruction in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The convention was finalized in Paris in January 1993 after 10
years of negotiations, and formally entered into force today.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 165 states have signed the treaty and 87 countries
ratified it in time for the April 29 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Among the five permanent Security Council members, Britain,
China, France and the United States have ratified the treaty,
leaving Russia the only one yet to do so.
</P>
<P>
China ratified the convention last December and submitted the
instruments of ratification to the United Nations Friday to become
one of the signatory states to the convention.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Government Called to End Dialog With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian parliament today
issued a strongly-worded statement calling on its government to
end dialog with the European Union (EU) member countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest response by the Iranian parliament to the
EU action taken after the Berlin court verdict which implicated
Iranian leaders behind the assassination of four Kurdish
opposition leaders in Mykonos restaurant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The April 10 Berlin court verdict sparked a fierce diplomatic
battle between Iran and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The statement asked the EU countries to arrest and hand over
Iran's anti-government activists in European countries.
</P>
<P>
It accused the EU of supporting Iran's anti-government group
called the People's Mujahedeen Organization of Iran (PMOI) which
is based inside the Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it added, the readiness of the EU to condemn
terrorism and cooperate jointly to fight terrorism without any
exception should be taken as the criteria for the relations
between Iran and the EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian parliament then charged European countries of
exporting weapons of mass destruction to the sensitive region of
the Middle East and the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
It termed such export as "violation of international
regulations and conventions" and as "an agent of instability in
the region."
</P>
<P>
The parliament said that the export of weapons of mass
destruction by some of the European countries during the
Iran-Iraq war (1980-88) caused damages amounting to billions of
dollars as well as the loss of thousands of Iranian lives.
</P>
<P>
The parliament said the Iran-EU dialog lacks constructiveness
and good intentions. "Therefore, we call on the government of the
Islamic Republic of Iran to end such dialog until the conditions
are realized," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Germany had recalled their ambassadors and expelled
four diplomats from each side after the verdict. All EU member
countries, except Greece, have recalled their ambassadors in a
protest against the involvement of Iranian leaders in the
Mykonos case.
</P>
<P>
All foreign ministers of EU member countries are going to
meet and iron out a joint and unified policy toward Iran at the
ministerial meeting Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on Diaoyu Islands Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China has always held that the
Diaoyu Islands issue would be settled through negotiation on the
basis of respecting facts when the time is ripe, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Cui Tiankai said here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that the Diaoyu islands and adjacent
islands have been an integral part of China's territories since
ancient times and that China's stand on this issue is clear-cut
and consistent.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the statement at a routine press conference,
when asked to comment on the report that a Japanese leader openly
claimed that the Diaoyu Islands are Japan's territories, and that
it is not necessary for Japan to hold consultations with any other
countries on the issue and the report that a member of Japan's
Diet and a reporter from Japan's Sankei Shimbun recently stepped
onto the Islands.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are disputes on this issue between the two
countries due to their different points of views and that this is
a undeniable fact.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed a Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary
expressed the view that the landing on the islands goes against
the policies of the Japanese government," he noted, "We demand
that the Japanese government take measures to prevent the repeat
of any infringement upon China's sovereignty and damage to
Sino-Japanese relations."

<HEADLINE> HK External Trade Value on Increase in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's total
exports in March 1997 increased 9.1 percent over a year earlier to
105.5 billion HK dollars (13.61 billion U.S. dollars), according
to the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
Within total exports, the value of re-exports increased 10.2
percent to 90.7 billion HK dollars (11.7 billion U.S. dollars)
while the value of domestic exports increased 2.9 percent to 14.8
billion HK dollars (1.9 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of imports increased 6.0 percent in March this year
over a year earlier to 128.1 billion HK dollars (16.5 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the department said that in March the value of
Hong Kong's re-exports showed a notable increase over a year
earlier while domestic exports rose modestly. The value of
imports continued to rise on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1997, the value of total exports
increased 2.2 percent over the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
Among this, the value of re-export rose 3.7 percent while that
of domestic exports decreased 6.1 percent. The value of imports
showed an increase of 4.3 percent for the same period.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, as the value of total exports in
the first three months of 1997 was smaller than that of total
imports, a visible trade deficit of 48.2 billion HK dollars (6.22
billion U.S. dollars) was recorded. This was larger than the
deficit of 39.8 billion HK dollars (5.14 billion U.S. dollars)
recorded in the first quarter of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Veteran Wang Leads China to 3-1 Victory over S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese table tennis
veteran Wang Tao, who delayed his retirement to check tenacious
South Koreans in the world championships, proved his value by
snatching two clutch points from the longtime rivals at the team
semi-finals here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Wang, who has excellent record against South
Koreans, wrapped up China's 3-1 victory by nipping Kim Taek Soo
21-12, 16-21, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
It was a sweet revenge for China, which has lost to South Korea
three times since the 1995 Worlds where it edged out South Korea
3-2 en route to winning the championship.
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic champion Liu Guoliang won the opening game for
China as he beat Kim 21-14, 22-20 in a clash of the world best
penholders.
</P>
<P>
The first set loss jolted Kim out of lethargy as he held Liu to
19-19 in the second set with strong topspin forehands. But a
wayward backhand return and a strong smash by Liu denied him a
chance to even the score.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese fast-attacker held a poor record against Kim, who
beat Liu twice last year, in a world all-star event and the Asian
championships.
</P>
<P>
Wang, competing in his fourth championships, grabbed the second
game as he nipped 72nd-ranked Ou Sang Eun 21-12, 21-7.

<P>
China, which eliminated world runner-up Sweden in the quarter-

semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Cai, who declined to predict the final result, said instead
that China has more good players than Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
"We have cleared the biggest threats on China's road to its
12th world team championship -- Sweden and South Korea," the
Chinese coach said.
</P>
<P>
Cai warned his players not to relax their vigilance in the
final. "Germany has top European player Jorg Rosskopf and France
has 1993 world champion Jean-Philippe Gatien, you should be on a
high alert," he told his proteges who were celebrating their
victory over South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Abolish Use of ODS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is ready to implement
the international program on the abolishment of the use of ozone
depleting substances (ODS) by the end of this year, an official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
To that end, a number of domestic industries are ready for the
mass production of non-ODS refrigerating appliances, Sutamihardja,
an official from the Environment Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Pursuant to the Montreal Protocol which regulates the
abolishment of the use of ODS such as chloro fluoro carbon (CFC)
and its derivatives, developing countries including Indonesia
should stop import and use of CFC by the end of this year, said
the official.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, old appliances which are still using CFC in
Indonesia are allowed to continue to use that refrigerant until
the stock is exhausted, he added.
</P>
<P>
At present about 90 percent of the new appliances are using
non-ODS and the rest are special appliances whose CFC refrigerant
can not be replaced in a short time.

<HEADLINE> Full Foreign Ownership of Condominium Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet today decided to
allow foreign investors to own 100 percent of a condominium
project in Thailand, making a stride toward the opening of the
country's property market.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet today approved a draft bill on the matter
proposed by the Interior Ministry at its regular meeting, ending
long-standing speculations among investors.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, foreigners will be allowed to buy
condominiums by withdrawing money from their accounts or
transferring from overseas baht accounts of other persons.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government's move is aimed at stimulating the sluggish
property market in the country, which plays an important role in
the country's economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently follows a law on condominiums enacted in
1979 and amended in 1981, which allows foreigners to own a
condominium up to 40 percent.

<P>
PARIS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The French government today
denounced the ultimatum of Zairian rebel leader Laurent-Desire
Kabila demanding that the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR) repatriate tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutu
refugees within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
"We share the view expressed by our American partners and by
the Secretary General of the United Nations (Kofi Annan), who
refused to have a limit imposed on the UNHCR to carry out the
operations of repatriation," Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques
Rummelhardt said.
</P>
<P>
He said France would finance a U.N. inquiry into the reported
massacre of Hutu refugees by the Zairian rebels. This was
expected to be launched within weeks and would produce a report to
go to the United Nations General Assembly by June 30.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said on Sunday that the UNHCR should repatriate 30,000
to 60,000 Hutu refugees from the rebel-controlled area in eastern
Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Debt Payments Grow in EU Governments' Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Government debt payments by
European Union (EU) member countries have made up a growing share
in their spending in the past decade, Eurostat, the EU's
statistical office, said in a report today.
</P>
<P>
Interest payments' share in the governments' current and
capital spending rose from seven percent in 1986 to a record 11
percent in 1995. This "limited the room for maneuver in
government expenditure," the report said after analyzing figures
from 10 of the EU's 15 members.
</P>
<P>
Belgium and Italy spend a fifth of their public expenditure on
debt payments, while a number of other members spend a tenth.
</P>
<P>
Italy recorded the largest increase in 1995, going from 21.5
percent of its spending in 1994 to 23.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The debt payments' average portion in the governments' Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) grew from three percent in 1980 to 5.4
percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Total interest payments by the EU's 15 members in 1996 stood at
362 billion ECUs (413 billion U.S. dollars), for which Germany and
Italy accounted for 47 percent.

<HEADLINE> Manila Stocks Suffer Biggest Plunge in 2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange
index fell by 128.87 points today to close at 2,708.44 points,
suffering the sharpest plunge in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
The 4.5 percentage decline was the biggest drop since the
bourse fell 5.7 percent on January 13, 1995 after the Mexican
currency crisis in late 1994.
</P>
<P>
It was also the lowest close since January 11, 1996 when the
index ended at 2664.73 points.
</P>
<P>
Turnover totaled 7.356 billion shares today, with a value of
3.632 billion pesos (about 139.69 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It has been the ninth time that the Stock Exchange index, a
basket of 30 companies, crashed in the month. On April 3-9, it
slumped by a total of 200 points in seven consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
On April 22, it fell again by 84.53 points, or 2.9 percent to
close at 2,860.45 points, the biggest drop in five months.
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, today's plunge was due to the withdrawal
of foreign funds amid the panic selling in the market and fears
that the Philippine peso will further depreciate against U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The selling was caused by speculations that the property sector
in the country will collapse like that in Thailand, analysts said,
adding the stock prices of property developers and banks suffered
heavy losses.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier on Soil, Water Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun called
for more funds to support the country's fight against expanding
soil erosion, when attending the Sixth National Conference on Soil
and Water Conservation here today.
</P>
<P>
China should make concrete efforts to stop soil erosion,
otherwise there will be no sustainable economic and social
development for the Chinese people, he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that it is a long-term task for China to fight
against soil erosion, although some achievements have been made in
this field.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the conference, the total of eroded
land that China has tackled in a comprehensive way has reached
about 700,000 sq km over the past four decades, and the country's
total investment in this area reached seven billion yuan in the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
But China's overall situation of soil and water conservation
nationwide has continued to worsen, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese legislators have worked out laws on water and soil
conservation in order to improve the Chinese people's awareness of
the importance of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that governments at all levels should help farmers
in the poverty-stricken areas to get rid of poverty, and keep a
close eye on environmental protection at the same time.
</P>
<P>
"More work should be done to bring soil erosion in the
country's seven major river valleys under control, and Chinese
cities should also take precautions against increasing soil
erosion," he warned.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese vice-premier urged governments at all
levels to take more measures to tighten up their supervision of
soil and water conservation, and implement the country's laws on
soil and water conservation in a serious way.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Pakistani Presidents Hold Talks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
held talks with President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that mutual understanding, sympathy, trust and
support have become the outstanding features of Sino-Pakistani
ties. The bilateral friendship between the two countries has
withstood the test of time and been a model for relations between
countries with different social systems, he said.
</P>
<P>
Leghari arrived here this morning for a two-day working visit
at the invitation of President Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said it is a set policy of the Chinese government to
continue consolidating and developing the traditional
good-neighborly and mutually-beneficial friendship with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to join our efforts with those of the Pakistan
people to carry the comprehensive cooperative partnership between
China and Pakistan into the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing a heartfelt welcome to Leghari, Jiang said that he
still had fresh memories of his pleasant talks with President
Leghari during his visit to Pakistan at the latter's invitation
last year. He said Leghari has been an old friend of the Chinese
people since he visited China as president of Pakistan in
1994. Leghari's current China trip will further deepen the
bilateral friendly cooperative relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Leghari cited Jiang's visit to Pakistan last year as an event
of great significance in the bilateral relations, and said that
the two countries will see their friendship continue to grow in
coming generations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China and Pakistan are close friends and neighbors
whose two peoples share a long tradition of friendship, Jiang said
the bilateral relations have been growing soundly and smoothly
since the two countries forged diplomatic ties several decades
ago. Cooperation in the fields of politics, science, technology
and culture have kept growing and coordination in international
affairs has been close and consistent, he added.
</P>
<P>
President Leghari said the further strengthening of bilateral
ties is of strategic significance for both countries, and that
Pakistan will always remember that China has offered valuable
assistance to it in the past. Pakistan will, as always, continue
to devote every effort to supporting China's correct stand on the
issues of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet and human rights, he said.

relations of cooperation have been strengthened, with the fields
expanded, forms diversified and results fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that he hoped the relevant departments of
the two sides would increase their exchanges and explore new ways
to further bilateral cooperation in the economic and trade field.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the two sides join hands in more small and
medium-sized projects which yield quick profits, and conduct
multi-form cooperation in fields of economy, technology, trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president expressed the belief that through joint
efforts by the two governments and relevant corporations,
China-Pakistan economic and trade cooperation would see steady
advancement.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said the bilateral economic and trade cooperation has
scored effective progress and there is still huge potential.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is willing to explore new ways and forms to expand
cooperation with China, he added.

<HEADLINE> Official: Iran Not Militarily Dependent on Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian foreign policy authorities
said today that the European Union's potential ban on arm
sales to Iran will not affect Tehran a bit because Iran is
not dependent on European countries for the procurement of its
arms.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Vaezi, Deputy Foreign Minister for Euro-American Affairs,
made the statement while he attended the opening ceremony of
the ECO ministerial meeting which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
As to the reports that EU member states will also decide to
stop issuance of visas to officials below the ministerial level in
their special meeting in Luxembourg today, the Iranian deputy
foreign minister commented that the decision would cause trouble
to the EU member states rather than Iran.
</P>
<P>
"This is no way to punish Iran since the consequences would be
debilitating for both sides and may be more troublesome to Europe
than Iran," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Parliament today issued a eight-point statement,
urging the Iranian government to stop dialog with EU countries
and the EU to arrest and hand over Iran's anti-government
activists in Europe.
</P>
<P>
As to the EU's ministerial meeting in Luxembourg today,
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said on Sunday that
Iran has no expectation from European Union countries and they
can do whatever they like.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran wants to have good relations with
European countries "but what is more important for us is the
observance of our principles in the foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
The relations between Iran and EU countries took a turn of
worse when Berlin court accused the Iranian leadership of ordering
the murder of four Kurdish leaders in Germany in 1992. All EU
members, except Greece, recalled their ambassadors in Tehran in
protest against the involvement of Iranian leaders in the case.

MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Investigators have found that
Muslim rebels were responsible for the killing of 10 students and
a teacher in the southern Philippines last month, a senior
military official said today.
</P>
<P>
The source, who requested anonymity, said the investigators
found the artillery causing the massacre was most likely fired
from a main camp of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), a
major rebel group in the southern Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The military and the rebels blamed each other for being
responsible for the killing in Buldon, Maguindanao province, where
they have had sporadic clashes since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The investigators informed the military of their findings
before releasing it to the public, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He said investigators visited the explosion site and found that
the tragedy was caused not by a 105mm howitzer as reported
earlier, but by a smaller type which could be an 81mm or 60mm.
</P>
<P>
However, investigators learned that the military was stationed
9 to 10 kilometers away from the site and that the maximum range
of an 81mm or 61mm mortar was only 3.5 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The investigators believed that the MILF rebels may have
mishandled their own mortars which killed the 11 civilians, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The massacre has produced a negative impact on the country's
peace process. In their third round of low-level talks last week,
the two sides did not make any substantial progress except
agreeing to observe a local truce they have already signed.

<P>
JAKARTA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Four employers of a road
surveying company who escaped an armed attack by the Free Papua
Movement (OPM) were found safe by a local military task force,
reports reaching here today from Irian Jaya said.
</P>
<P>
Armed OPM members opened fire at a team of six surveyors and 10
porters in Akiba village in the central mountainous region of
Irian Jaya Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two surveyors were killed on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said eight workers went missing after they fled
into the forest during the attack.
</P>
<P>
Another report said the district military command and police
have launched a manhunt for the OPM members.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the OPM took at least 42 people as hostages,
including Indonesian scientists and workers as well as seven
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
Four Indonesian hostages were killed during a rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
The OPM, known as a security disturbance group, has been
fighting for a separate state in the area since the early 1960s,
before Irian Jaya was integrated into Indonesia.

<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korean veteran
Yoo Nam Kyu pulled one point back as China led 2-1 in the men's
team semi-finals of the World Table Tennis Championships here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Yoo outplayed world top player and defending
singles champion Kong Linghui 21-18, 10-21, 21-18 in the third
game.
</P>
<P>
Chinese veteran Wang Tao, who delayed his retirement for a
possible meeting with South Koreans in the world championships,
nipped Ou Sang Eun in straight sets in the second game.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Wang, who holds excellent record against South
Koreans, beat the 72nd-ranked Ou 21-12, 21-7 to put China 2-0
ahead.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Ou, who has beaten Wang once early this year,
looked nervous throughout the game and failed to release his
powerful forehands.
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic champion Liu Guoliang had put China one up as he
beat Kim Taek Soo in the opening game.
</P>
<P>
World No. 3 Liu downed Kim 21-14, 22-20 in a clash of the world
top penholders.
</P>
<P>
The first set loss jolted Kim out of lethargy and he held Liu
to 19-19 in the second set, but a wayward backhand return and a
strong smash by Liu denied him a chance to even the score.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese fast-attacker held a poor record against Kim, who beat
Liu twice last year, in a world all-star event and the Asian
championships.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has beaten China three times since the last world
championships where it finished third, trailing China and Sweden.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) today condemned the abduction of about 50 children from a
Zaire hospital in Lwiro, about 30 kilometers north of Bukavu near
the Rwandan border.
</P>
<P>
According to UNICEF and UNHCR reports on April 26, about 20
armed men, allegedly rebels from the AFDL (the Alliance of
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire), forcibly
took the Rwandan refugee children, who were under treatment, away
from the hospital in a truck.
</P>
<P>
A number of adults, believed to be parents or guardians of the
children, were also abducted, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The children have not been seen since and their whereabouts is
unknown.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF said it was seriously concerned about the fate of
the children because most were in very poor condition and their
chances of survival without hospital treatment were slim.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees also condemned the
abduction and demanded quick return of the children and adults.

MANCHESTER, England, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese table tennis
veteran Wang Tao, who delayed his retirement to check South
Koreans in the world championships, proved his value by snatching
two points from the longtime rivals at the men's team semi-finals
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Wang, who has excellent record against South
Koreans, wrapped up China's 3-1 victory by nipping Kim Taek Soo
21-12, 16-21, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
It was a sweet revenge for China, who has lost to South Korea
three times since the 1995 Worlds where it edged out South Korea
3-2 en route to winning the championship.
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic champion Liu Guoliang had put China one up as he
beat Kim in the opening game.

<P>
World No. 3 Liu downed No. 5 Kim 21-14, 22-20 in a clash of the

The first set loss jolted Kim out of lethargy and he held Liu
to 19-19 in the second set with strong topspin forehands, but a

The Chinese fast-attacker held a poor record against Kim, who

<HEADLINE> S'pore Gov't Commits $2 Billion on IT in Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government will
commit two billion Singapore dollars (about 1.4 billion U.S.
dollars) from 1997 to 2002 to implement a national plan to use
information technology (IT) in education.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore's Masterplan for IT in Education, unveiled by
Minister for Education Teo Chee Hean here Monday, but embargoed
until today, lays out a comprehensive strategy for creating an
IT-based teaching and learning environment in every school.
</P>
<P>
"It will be one of our key strategies for equipping our young
with the skills that are critical for the future -- creative
thinking, the ability to learn independently and continuously, and
effective communication," the minister said at the launch of the
Masterplan for IT in Education.
</P>
<P>
The goals of the plan are to enhance linkages between the
school and the world around it, so as to expand and enrich the
learning environment; to encourage creative thinking and life-long
learning; to encourage innovative processes in education and, to
promote administrative and management excellence in the education
system, Teo said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will commit two billion Singapore
dollars from this year to 2002 to implement this plan, which
includes funds for computers, full networking of the schools,
physical renovations, software and courseware, and teacher
training.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, another 600 million Singapore dollars, or about
416.67 million U.S. dollars at current exchange rate, a year will
be provided to maintain and replace hardware, develop new
software, and for the continuous training of teachers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The target of the plan to be achieved by the year 2002 is for
students to have hands-on use of computers for 30 percent of their
curriculum time, the education minister said, adding that this
would mean providing one computer for every two students.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for Concerted Arab Water Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today urged Arab countries to coordinate their efforts in
preserving and developing water resources.
</P>
<P>
"As the Arab demand for limited water is ever increasing, it
is incumbent to find an orchestrated Arab plan to help develop
water resources," the president said in a message addressed to
the ongoing Conference of Arab Ministers of Water and
Agriculture, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is keen on participating in all forms of unified Arab
actions whose aims are to benefit the supreme interests of our
Arab nation and the welfare of the international community, he
said in the message, read out on his behalf by Youssef Wali,
deputy premier and minister of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said Arab countries should step up joint Arab
investment ventures in river development and further research and
studies on means of rationalizing the use of water.
</P>
<P>
They should also abide by agreements on the use of waters by
countries that share the same river basins and take all necessary
measures that protect and preserve water resources, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference of Arab ministers of water and
agriculture is jointly organized by the Arab Organization for
Agricultural Development and the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture
and Land Reclamation.
</P>
<P>
The conference is attended by Arab League Assistant Secretary
General Abdel Rahman al-Sihbani, Chairman of the Arab
Organization for Agricultural Development Yehia Bakour, Arab
ministers of agriculture and representatives from Arab and
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a recent study has showed that the scarity of water
and the indifference to the issue has blocked the agricultural
development in the Arab world that lies in the desert belt over
the equatorial zone.
</P>
<P>
The study, the work of the General Secretariat of the Union of
Arab Chamber, cautioned against the negative impact of the
limited water resources on future plans for self-sufficiency in
cereals.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of water in the Arab world is used in
agriculture and the rate goes even higher in countries like
Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has predicted that the per capita quota of
fresh water in the Mideast and North Africa per year will
nosedive from 3,300 to 650 cubic meters over the period from 1960
to 2025.
</P>
<P>
By then, the Arab states will have to settle with two thirds
of the amount used by Asian or seven times less than the
international average.

BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan, as one of China's
provinces, is not qualified to join the World Health Organization
(WHO), Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Cui Tiankai said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a report that a Latin American nation is to
prepare to propose that Taiwan join the WHO, Cui said that since
the United Nations and its special organs are inter-governmental
international organizations, only sovereign states can apply for
entry.
</P>
<P>
Cui noted that the raising of Taiwan's representation in the
WHO under any pretext and in any form, is an open attempt to
create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" in the WHO, and
constitutes a severe infringement upon China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity and a wanton interference in its internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people will never tolerate it," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The WHO's position on this issue is clear and consistent," he
noted, "We appreciate this and believe that a large number of
countries in the WHO can hold justice and safeguard the purposes
and principles of both the UN Charter and the WHO's by-laws.

<HEADLINE> Rice Harvest in Vietnam Pushes Down Prices: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Vietnamese official has
said that the rice harvest in Vietnam this year has a big negative
effect on prices of rice.
</P>
<P>
The bumper harvest of the winter-spring rice in Mekong delta
provinces in southern Vietnam is not only negatively affecting
farmers' lives but threatening the stability and sustainable
development of agricultural production and future national food
security, said Nguyen Cong Tan, agriculture and rural development
minister.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that 4.5 million tons of paddy rice are
stockpiled in the Mekong river delta provinces.
</P>
<P>
The harvest in the south resulted in a 2.8 percent fall in food
prices between March and April, according to official statistics.
The harvest season in the north is coming.
</P>
<P>
The government has urged state-owned food companies to buy
paddy rice at the government's recommended price from farmers'
stock in the Mekong river delta provinces.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Macao police's unprecedented move
Monday targeting heads of organized crimes have won local praises
although they failed to seize the targets.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers gave big coverage to the police action which
started at six o'clock Monday and lasted seven hours. About 100
policemen raided 15 household units where gangland heads were
believed to live, taking away documents, two cars and a large
amount of contraband cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
"Although the target suspects were missed and crime cases
remain uncracked, the actions show the determination of the police
 departments in fighting crimes," said a commentary in today's
Macao Daily News.
</P>
<P>
It said that the actions demonstrate the police are launching
an active attack on triads, which is "a positive sign."
</P>
<P>
The action is the second within a week by local police
departments to deter a wave of crimes that have claimed 10 deaths
and a dozen injuries since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
"The two consecutive actions demonstrate the earnest
determination of security authorities in cracking down on
organized crimes," the Va Kio Newspaper said in a commentary
today. "It is in line with the demand of the public."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Police Action Coordination Center said
late Monday that the center will make further investigation into
the seized documents and cars, and promised to step up efforts to
ensure safety and public order.

<HEADLINE> China Maintains Steady Growth in Machine-Building Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China kept steady and appropriate
growth in the machine-building industry which generated 111.29
billion yuan of output value in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
This represents a rise of 9.3 percent over the same period of
last year, according to the Ministry of Machine-Building Industry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also disclosed that the machine-building
industrial sector sold 104.81 million worth of commodities
manufactured from January to March, a rise of 7.6 percent over the
same period of 1996, and the ratio of production to marketing
stood at 94.2 percent in the first quarter of the year, 2.5
percentage points higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
The sector delivered 6.43 billion yuan worth of commodities for
exports, an increase of 8.3 percent over last year, said official
sources.
</P>
<P>
An official with the ministry warned that the sector has not
shown marked improvement in economic benefits and much still waits
to be done.
</P>
<P>
Out of the ten major businesses, only automobile, meters and
instruments, and petrochemical, businesses are making profits, the
rest are money losers.
</P>
<P>
The reasons behind the slow improvement of economic efficiency
were explained as the continuous implementation of the
comparatively tight money policy, a continued control over
investment in fixed assets, and the state's continued control over
the issues of money.
</P>
<P>
The official pledged that the Ministry of Machine-Building
Industry will continue to intensify reform and will strive to
bring the sector to healthy development in the upcoming three to
five years.

U.S. military base in Okinawa passed by Japan's Diet (parliament)
on April 17.
</P>

instability" in a bid to create a pretext for its expansion, the
paper said.

The Minju Joson newspaper said that Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto reaffirmed the "importance" of the
Japanese-U.S. Security System during his visit to the United
States in April.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Protest Against Turkish Cypriots' Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government will
make representations to the U.N. over the attitude of the Turkish
Cypriot northern side regarding a scheduled visit by Greek
Cypriots to perform pilgrimage at the Turkish-controlled part of
the island.
</P>
<P>
The visit was planned to have taken place Sunday, the Easter,
for Greek Cypriots to visit the Monastery of Apostolos Andreas,
but was canceled by the government Saturday following Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash's insistence on censoring the list
of visitors.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots also asked to limit the proposed number
of Greek Cypriot visitors from 800 to 600 and rejected the
entry to journalists.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Spokesman in Cyprus Waldemar Rokoszewski has expressed
regret for the outcome and hoped there will be more willingness
in the future.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Foreign Minister Yiannakis Cassoulides said today that
representations will be made to U.N. officials in the island state
and to the U.N. headquarters in New York as well.
</P>
<P>
On April 19, some 450 Turkish Cypriots crossed to the
government-controlled southern areas and prayed at the Hala
Sultan Tekke, one of the holiest Muslim places of worship in the
world, near the southeastern coastal town of Larnaca.
</P>
<P>
The Move was regarded as a good-will gesture taken by the
Greek Cypriot side following a U.N.-led six-week proximity talks
between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, which were aimed at
paving the way for face-to-face negotiations between leaders of
the two communities by the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an Athens-backed
coup.

<HEADLINE> Drug Trafficking, Fraud on Rise in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Drug trafficking and commercial
fraud are on the increase in Kenya during recent years since the
liberalization of economy, local newspaper the Daily Nation
reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said customs officers at the Jomo Kenyatta International
Airport in Nairobi and the Mombasa Port seized more than 20 tons
of drugs between October 1995 and August 1996.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Revenue Authority Commissioner General Yusuf Nzibo was
quoted as saying here on Tuesday that drug trafficking was
featured with greater sophistication since the advent of
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
In July 1996, customs officers at the airport seized 2.9 kms
of heroin which was stuffed in large buttons sewn on ladies'
clothes.
</P>
<P>
He told an ongoing drugs control seminar attended by
representatives of 15 countries in Nairobi that commercial fraud
just as drug trafficking has also been on the increase during the
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official noted that travel documents such as
passports were made with sophisticated machines imported into the
country.
</P>
<P>
Nzibo called for a regional approach to help combat the two
evils which, he said, would wreck the local economies and
potential human resources.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Supply Still Low in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambia spent more than 126
billion Kwacha (about one billion U.S. Dollars) from January 1996
to March this year on importing crude oil, but fuel supply is
still low, adversely affecting the country's mining industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the real sector data report from the Financial
Ministry, most of the money went to Saudi Arabia that supplied 61
percent of the oil.
</P>
<P>
The total amount spent on crude oil represents nearly nine
percent of the current national budget.
</P>
<P>
The mining industry was and is still the most affected as the
short supply of high fuel adversely affected copper production in
the past two months.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, said the supply of petroleum products is
expected to be improved by the end of June after the maintenance
work is carried out in the refinery in the north of Zambia and
the ongoing rehabilitation of the Tazama Pipeline is finished.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has evacuated from Zaire's
capital Kinshasa its ambassador, Ian Sikazwe.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Zambia Daily Mail today quoted Foreign
Minister Lawrence Shimba as saying on Monday that the action was
taken because of the volatile situation in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that his country will not interfere in the
internal affairs of Zaire and was compelled to recall all its
diplomats until the situation improves.
</P>
<P>
He said the consulate of Zambia in Lubumbashi, the second
largest city of Zaire, has been non-operational following the
return of the consular-general and his staff with their families.
</P>
<P>
"We have recalled our ambassador from Kinshasa just as we had
recalled our consular-general from Lubumbashi because we do not
want to take sides in the ongoing conflict there," said Shimba.
</P>
<P>
The anti-government forces led by Laurent Kabila are advancing
on Kinshasa following the seizure of Lubumbashi earlier this
month.

<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese veteran Wang
Tao, who delayed his retirement for possible meeting with South
Koreans in the world championships, nipped Ou Sang Eun in straight
sets at the men's team semi-finals here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Wang, who holds an excellent record against
South Koreans, beat the 72nd-ranked Ou 21-12, 21-7 to put China
2-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Ou, who has beaten Wang Tao once early this
year, looked nervous throughout the game and failed to release his
powerful forehands.
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic champion Liu Guoliang put China one up as he
beat South Korean Kim Taek Soo in the opening game.
</P>
<P>
Liu downed Kim 21-14, 22-20 in the clash of the world top
penholders.
</P>
<P>
The first set loss jolted Kim out of lethargy and he held Liu
to 19-19 in the second set, but a wayward backhand return and a
strong smash by Liu denied him a chance to even the score.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese fast-attacker held a poor record against Kim, who
beat Liu twice last year, in a world all-star event and the Asian
championships.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has beaten defending world champion China three
times since the 1995 Worlds.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Muslim Rebels Deny Hand in Hotel Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine Muslim rebel group
today denied being involved in a hotel fire which killed 27 people
in the southern city of Cotabato on April 26.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) deputy
chief for political affairs, also denied the group has a hand in
the kidnapping of an airline executive in Cotabato the same day,
the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports earlier quoted Interior and Local
Government Secretary Robert Barbers as saying the MILF has a hand
in the latest two tragic incidents.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the hotel burning which also injured 11
others, was part of a MILF campaign to sabotage the state of the
region address by Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region
in Muslim Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The address was originally set on April 28 but was postponed by
Misuari as an expression of sympathy to the fire victims, among
whom were members of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) who
were at the hotel to attend the address.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar said certain groups are only trying to promote animosity
between the MILF and the MNLF as both are engaged in the peace
process in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MILF leader also disclaimed responsibility in the
kidnapping of Fernando Mandanas, branch manager of the Philippine
Airlines in Cotabato city.
</P>
<P>
The abduction took place Saturday evening while the police were
preoccupied with the aftermath of the hotel fire.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses claimed Mandanas was abducted by seven armed men who
identified themselves as policemen.
</P>
<P>
"I want to put this on record. Officially, the MILF is not
involved and has no knowledge of the kidnapping (of Mandanas) and
all other kidnappings," Jaafar said.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar charged, "Maybe before an incident takes place, the
authorities already have a prepared list of who should be blamed."

<HEADLINE> Mad Cow Disease Might Infect Dogs, Study Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Brain sections from a dog have
been sent to Britain by Norwegian pathologists to confirm that it
is the first example of canine spongiform disease, akin to BSE or
the mad cow disease, The Daily Telegraph reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old labrador suffered from nervous symptoms like
the lack of muscle co-ordination and seizures. A post mortem
examination shows that its brain has a spongiform appearance, said
Jon Teige, a pathologist at the Norwegian College of Veterinary
Medicine in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
"To our surprise, we saw these lesions in the brain similar to
those observed in scrapie in sheep and mad cow disease," said
Teige. If confirmed, it would mark the first example of the
disease in a dog, he added.
</P>
<P>
Samples have been sent to the Institute of Animal Health's
neuropathogenesis unit in Edinburgh for a second
opinion. "Although there are some features of the pathology in
common with spongiform encephalopathies, a number of other
conditions have similar aspects," said Chris Bostock of the
institute.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed, it is also important to determine if it is
the spontaneous form of BSE or if the dog had been infected
in its diet and had a transmissible disease.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of Norway's dog and cat food is imported,
mainly from Britain. Parts of bovine material, which could contain
BSE, were removed from the animal food chain in 1990.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Steel Manufacturer A Shining Example for State-Owned Enterprises (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Baoshan Steel and Iron (Group)
Co. (Baosteel), China's most productive manufacturer of steel
products, became the leading money-maker in the metallurgical
industry, setting a sterling example for China's state-owned
enterprises to follow.
</P>
<P>
Located in the suburbs of Shanghai, the group with a state
investment of 30 billion yuan now has an annual producing capacity
of 6.5 million tons of steel, 6.71 million tons of iron, and
500,000 tons of seamless steel tubes.
</P>
<P>
Through the large-scale importation of advanced technology and
strict control of employment, the 1,300-strong group has raised
its productivity to 655 tons of steel per capita annually, which
is much higher than the industry's average.
</P>
<P>
Li Ming, chairman of Baosteel, attributed such rapid
development to the group's courageous reform of its enterprise
system.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises,
the group has no "welfare facilities" such as hospital and schools
for employees' families. All its auxiliary businesses, including
the equipment maintenance, are separated from the mother company.
</P>
<P>
And the group relocates about 2,000 workers to its subsidiaries
every year, in order to make room for technological renovation.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the group, which is now the top steel maker with
the smallest number of workers in China, developed quickly while
some of the country's major steel factories fell into heavy debts.
</P>
<P>
According to the chairman, Baosteel generated sales revenues of
27.22 billion yuan, and turned over 4.97 billion yuan in profits
and taxes in 1996, when the domestic market was severely affected
by foreign steel products and the benefits of the whole industry
generally shrank. Meanwhile, the group's foreign currency earnings
stood at 465 million US dollars, maintaining a leading position in
the industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
Industrial analysts said that the fast growth of Baosteel was
also driven by the technological advantage formed by 19 years of
heavy input since the group was founded.
</P>
<P>
So far, Baosteel has developed 195 new products and 569 items
of technical breakthroughs, which achieved direct economic
benefits totalling 14.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Baosteel's economic miracle is highlighted by its advanced
operation system which combined both the experience of foreign
steel giants and the particular situation of China.
</P>
<P>
In the group, the administrative functions are concentrated in
the top managing board, with each operation procedure looked after
by a special functional organ. This operation system successfully
avoided such chaos prevalent in other state-owned enterprises
where the power is decentralized and any important decision is
hard to make in a short time.
</P>
<P>
To acquire more competitivity in overseas markets, Baosteel
announced an ambitious expansion project to increase steel
manufacturing capacity by 4.29 million tons annually, and iron by
3.25 million tons. The combined producing capacity of the group
will reach 11 million tons of steel by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Haihang, research fellow of Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said that the new round of growth, which followed the
national economy's soft landing last year, will offer a "very
favorable external conditions" to those Chinese enterprises taking
the lead in structural reform and readjusting the product mix.
</P>
<P>
The prosperity of such enterprises as Baosteel augurs a bright
future as the country's painstaking reform in the state-owned
sectors enters a crucial phase, said Chen Qingtai, vice-minister
of the State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
The experience achieved by Baosteel and other profitable
companies can be used as a good reference for thousands of
state-owned enterprises running at a loss in the country, Chen
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China will hold its fifth Arts
Festival this October in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province in
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The biennial event is the biggest showcase of China's artistic
achievements. It aims to promote folk culture and improve the
national spirit, local officials commented.
</P>
<P>
"Sichuan is the hometown of Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect
of China's reform and opening up drive. It will be of special
significance for the festival to be held there," said Xu Shiqun,
deputy governor of Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Deng passed away in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The festival will also be an event to mark the return of Hong
Kong to the motherland as well as the convening of the Party's
15th Congress later this year.
</P>
<P>
Pan Zhenzhou, deputy minister of culture, said that the themes
of this year's festival will be "patriotism, unity, and
prosperity".
</P>
<P>
Mass gatherings, dance and song performances at city squares
will be held, and artists from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan will
be invited to give performances, Pan said.
</P>
<P>
The Sichuan government hopes that the festival will help
improve the province's image and attract more attention and
capital.

<HEADLINE> Northeast Chinese City Involved In American Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Haicheng City, in Liaoning
Province has spent 200,000 U.S. dollars on a piece of farmland in
New York State as part of China's comprehensive reform drive.
</P>
<P>
Local sources say that the city has sent representatives to the
newly-established "Haicheng Village" in Jamestown, New York, and
that they are busy preparing operations there. It will also be a
way to help products from Haicheng to enter the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
Haicheng, which has been rated high in economic development, is
only one of several Chinese cities involved in such ventures.
</P>
<P>
Last August, when local officials made an inspection tour of
New York State, they found that Jamestown, which is near the
Canadian border and very close to Niagara Falls, had the advantage
of preferential policies for foreign nationals and low land costs.
</P>
<P>
After studying and discussing the situation, they made the
decision to buy the 86.67-hectare parcel of land from a private
business. The move was welcomed by Jamestown and resulted in the
establishment of cooperative ties between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Jamestown has also decided to put six
million U.S. dollars annually into support for construction work
at "Haicheng Village" and to provide a certain amount in loans.
</P>
<P>
The two cities have also signed a five-year contract for a
training program under which each city will send 30 students to
the other city for special training.
</P>
<P>
Jamestown has already started eight investment ventures in
Haicheng City, one of which, a joint venture in rubber production,
has begun operation.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia and Japan today agreed
to promote their defense relationship, and which, they considered,
should be part of the two countries' bilateral association.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference, Australian Prime Minister
John Howard and visiting Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
were careful to avoid suggestions that defense ties should be
placed on the same level as those of the two countries with the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who arrived here Monday on a two-day visit, said
both countries should promote further cooperation on security
issues through senior level political and military consultations.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed on an annual prime ministerial summit
and announced a visit to Japan by Australian Defense Minister Ian
McLachlan later this year.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese leader confirmed that his country would support
Australia's bid for involvement in the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM)
forum. "Concerning Australia's participation in ASEM, I expressed
Japan's continued support for the new membership of Australia,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also told the news conference that he and John Howard
had agreed to further promote cooperation between Australian and
Japan in the World Trade Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
He confirmed the two nations would make efforts to realize the
accession of China to the WHO.

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official Meets Japanese Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) today called for joint efforts to
push forward the Sino-Japanese friendship into the new century.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the best commemoration for the upcoming 25th
anniversary of the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic
relations." said Hu Jintao, member the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, at a meeting with a delegation of the Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan led by Yamazaki Taku, chairman of
the party's Political Affairs Investigation Committee.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, said: "the present Sino-Japanese friendship, forged
through efforts of generations, should be treasured by all of us."
</P>
<P>
"Historical experience, positive or negative, has proved that
the friendship between China and Japan benefits the two peoples as
well as the cause of peace and progress of humanity." he noted,
adding that "past experience, if not forgotten, would be a guide
for the future."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that both Chinese and Japanese statesmen should
bear in mind historical lessons and seek common understanding to
enhance the good-neighborly relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Appreciating the LDP's positive attitude towards China and its
relations with the CPC, Hu said that the CPC is ready to increase
exchanges and cooperation with the LDP on the basis of
independence, full equality, mutual respect, and mutual
non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Hu added that the CPC hopes to work with the LDP for
establishing and developing a long-term, sound and stable
Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>

political and economic situations.

developing its ties with the CPC and hopes to further strengthen
these ties.

"Our current visit to China on the eve of the 25th anniversary
aims to help promote bilateral friendly relations through
exchanges and cooperation between the two parties." he noted.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Workers Called on to Keep up Republic's Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Acting Prime Minister Lee Hsien
Loong called on Singapore workers and their families today to work
together to keep up the Singapore success story.
</P>
<P>
In his May Day message, Lee noted that while Singapore had a
credible economic performance last year, it also highlighted the
country's vulnerability. As a small and open economy, Singapore
could do well only when external demand is healthy, he said.
</P>
<P>
When global demand slowed and business cycles were down,
Singapore would be affected more quickly and severely than others,
he noted, adding that Singapore relied on free trade and
investments but this also means keener competition.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that although the government wanted Singaporeans
to earn good wages, to justify the premium, workers must have
better technical skills and be more productive than workers
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the acting prime minister noted that trade
unions were pushing hard for more worker training and that
training programs were being well subscribed.
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 466,000 workers received Skills Development
Fund training, up from 356,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Lee urged workers to do more training as, he said, the payoff
to workers for the investment of time and effort in continuous
self-improvement is higher incomes and better job security.

<HEADLINE> S'pore to Cooperate with Myanmar in Fishery Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A Singaporean agro-business
mission led by Director of Primary Production Department of the
Ministry of National Development George Tay has had discussions
with Myanmar Minister for Livestock and Fisheries U Aung Thaung on
cooperation in the sector of fishery.
</P>
<P>
The discussion, which was held here Monday, included processing
of Myanmar's marine resources, establishment of cold storages, ice
factories and fish powder factories, raising of poultry, mutual
cooperation and exchange of techniques for development of meat and
fisheries sector, according to today's official paper The New
Light of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar exploited about 590,000 tons of marine products
annually in the past few years out of the maximum sustainable
yield which is estimated at about 1.05 million tons per year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies investing in Myanmar's fishery sector have
reportedly come from Thailand, China, Japan and Bangladesh, which
have formed joint ventures with the country's state-run fishery
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign investment in livestock breeding and fisheries
sector had reached 269.54 million U.S. dollars in 17 permitted
projects by the end of March this year, according to the latest

<HEADLINE> Nyerere Urges International Support to EAC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere has urged the international community to fund the
East African Co-operation (EAC) to facilitate its development
plans, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere made the call in Arusha, northern Tanzania on Sunday
during the opening of the German-East Africa Dialogue, saying
that the group needs financial support.
</P>
<P>
"When external finance is required, I hope it will be advanced
generously especially for infrastructure which helps the
profitability of other investments," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Unless it exists, it may be impossible to attract private
foreign investment in any sector. Yet infrastructure will not
itself be financially profitable if the original capital costs
are so heavy that potential users can not afford to use it," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He told the participants in the dialogue from Kenya, Uganda,
Tanzania and Germany that East Africans are eager to forge strong
unity.
</P>
<P>
"We in East Africa are asking the international community,
with special reference to Europe, to help us in our modest
initial plans to integrate our economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere stressed the need for the regional grouping to be
given technical assistance or experienced advisers to hasten
progress.
</P>
<P>
He said though East Africa is certainly much better off than
it was in 1967 when the first East African Community established,
regarding highly educated and technically trained personnel, the
region still needs assistance in that field.
</P>
<P>
The three-day dialogue was organized by the Friedrich Ebert
Stiftung in collaboration with the German Science and Research
Foundation.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright agreed to further develop the Sino-U.S relationship in
their talks held here today.
</P>
<P>
Albright's successful visit to China in February made a good
beginning for this year's continuing development of the bilateral
relations, a Chinese spokesman quoted Qian as saying at a press
conference after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Qian hoped that his visit to Washington would keep and
strengthen the momentum of high-level dialogue between the two
countries, so that the relationship could be further developed.
</P>
<P>
Qian left for Washington from Moscow Saturday after the end of
his trip accompanying Chinese President Jiang Zemin's state visit
to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who visited Beijing early this year during her maiden
foreign trip as the first woman U.S. state secretary, said that
developing the relationship between Washington and Beijing is a
priority on the U.S. government's agenda.
</P>
<P>
Albright hoped the two countries would enlarge the volume of
trade. Qian said that China is willing to open its market wider to
U.S. high-tech products like aircraft and communication equipment.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that he hoped that the United States would remove the
trade barriers it has erected and make efforts to promote economic
and trade cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary said that she will happily attend the
ceremony marking the return of Hong Kong to China on July 1, said
the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Sends 400 Soldiers to Iraq's Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish army dispatched some
400 soldiers to assist a projected Peace Monitoring Force (PMF)
consisting of Iraqi Turkmens and Assyrians on the cease-fire
line in northern Iraq, local newspaper Daily News reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted senior Turkish military officials, who
declined to be named, as saying that the Turkish soldiers
travelled to the region last week in armored vehicles, and
military stations consisting of small armed units would be set up
along the cease-fire line to collect information about the
situation in the area.
</P>
<P>
Turkey decided to increase the strength of the force from 200
to 400 because the cease-fire line is very long and a force of 200
is not enough. "But the Turkmens and Assyrians are to work for the
PMF, not Turkish soldiers," Daily News quoted a foreign ministry
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The first PMF group of 50 Turkmens, which was deployed in
northern Iraq last week, has begun its mission in the region in a
bid to supervise the truce between the two Iraqi-Kurdish rivals,
the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK), according to the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the deployment of all the 180 Turkmens
and 20 Assyrians was expected to be completed within the
following weeks.
</P>
<P>
The KDP and PUK agreed to the establishment of the PMF last
February in the third round of the peace talks held in Ankara
jointly sponsored by the United States, Britain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Last January, representatives from Turkey, the U.S. and
Britain met with three Iraqi delegations, the KDP, the PUK and
the Turkmen Front, to review progress in implementing the
principles agreed on October 31 and November 15 last year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, supporting Iraq's Turkmen minority because of ethnic
and cultural bonds, wants the Kurds to have a say in the
administration of the area.
</P>
<P>
The KDP, backed by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, fought
against the Iranian-backed PUK in late August last year, during
which the U.S. launched air strikes against Iraqi military
targets.
</P>
<P>
The northern part of Iraq has been occupied by the two Kurdish
groups since the Gulf War in 1991, but it split into rival zones
after the KDP and the PUK began fighting each other in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Earth Experiences Constant Changes in Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese glaciologists discovered
after three years research that the earth has witnessed constant
climate changes, big and small, through different periods of
history.
</P>
<P>
Yao Tandong, a researcher at the Lanzhou-based Institute of
Glaciology and Cryopedology attached to the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, said the discovery made by him and his colleagues was
based on researches of records of glaciers at the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau.
</P>
<P>
He said, according to their analysis, since 1570, the climate
of earth experienced several marked changes.
</P>
<P>
He added that the 17th and 19th centuries were relatively cold
periods with less rainfalls while the 18th and 20th century were
relatively warm periods with more rainfalls.
</P>
<P>
They believed that the changes are far more complicated than
the transition of the four seasons in a year.
</P>
<P>
Yao said each cold or warm period contains shorter cold or warm
periods. For instance, the 16th century was a warm period,
however, by the end of that century, the temperature on earth
dropped gradually and reached the cold peak by the mid-17th
century.
</P>
<P>
He added that the temperature picked up rapidly at the
beginning of the 18th century, dropped sharply at the beginning of
the 19th century and resumed to the normal level at the beginning
of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Yao said the changes in the climate could also be proved by the
records of the amount of precipitation. During the warm 18th
century, the average annual precipitation amount reached above 210
mm, while the colder 19th century witnessed an annual precipitation
amount averaging 180 mm.
</P>
<P>
So far, scientists have not found the cause of the constant
great changes in the earth climate. They guess that the changes in
the earth climate is closely related to the angles of the
Sun's radiation and with sun spots.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Investment Bank has
agreed to provide some 60 million U.S. Dollars to support the
development of small and medium enterprises in Kenya, according
to a Daily Nation report today.
</P>
<P>
The loan is the third line of credit under the Global Private
Enterprises (GPE) program run by the European bank.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the loan is given to enterprises which have
invested in the agro-industrial, manufacturing, horticultural,
floriculture, fishing, fish-processing, mining, quarrying and
tourism sectors.
</P>
<P>
The investments to be financed may relate to new projects,
modernization, restructuring, expansion and diversification of
existing activities, it added.
</P>
<P>
The loan has brought the GPE facility in the east African
country to l30 million Dollars since 1992, which has already
benefited many enterprises such as horticultural projects in
Nairobi, Nakuru, Eldoret and agro-industry projects in Athi
River.
</P>
<P>
Between 1995 and 1996, about 70 enterprises were financed by
the GPE facility and more than half of the facility went to
ventures which are primarily foreign exchange earners.
</P>
<P>
The various investments by the facility are estimated to
create employment for about 4,000 people in the country where
there are about 35 percent unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Security Situation in N. Uganda Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Security situation in northern
Uganda improved as rebel were defeated in the region, Uganda
President Yoweri Museveni told the parliament yesterday.
</P>
<P>
According to "the New Vision" today, the president reaffirmed
that he will not talk to Joseph Kony, leader fo the Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The remnants of Kony's group have broken into small groups
that are being picked one by one or surrendering in droves," he
said.
</P>
<P>
LRA is a rebel group acting in northern Uganda and has bases
in southern Sudan. It suffered a series of defeat both in its
fightings against the government troops in northern Uganda and
Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's government troops on Monday displayed 80 LRA rebels
and 114 Sudanese soldiers captured earlier this month. Michael
Ongom, one of the captured LRA rebel, said they had tried to set
up a base within the territory of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Apart from LRA, there were another two main rebel groups in
Uganda: the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) acting in northwestern
Uganda and having bases in southern Sudan, and the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) acting in western Uganda and having bases
in east Zaire.
</P>
<P>
WNBF lost its main forces last month in its fightings against
SPLA in southern Sudan and against the government troops in
northwestern Uganda. Joseph Awara, a WNBF commander who
surrendered last month with 60 rebels, said he was treated well
since he reported to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Major Tom Butime, Ugandan Minister of Internal Affairs, urged
ADF rebels to surrender, saying that the rebels have no chance to
stay in war-torn Zaire.
</P>
<P>
According to captives released last week, ADF was divided into
two small warring groups in the wake of several defeats in its
battle against Zairean rebels led by Laurent Kabila. ADF lost 30
soldiers in a fighting on Monday against the government troops in
Uganda's western Kasese district.

<HEADLINE> Emblem and Mascot Chosen for 1999 World Philatelic Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Great Wall and a "Jade Hare"
have been chosen as emblem and mascot for the World Philatelic
Exhibition, which will be held in China in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The stamps' perforations are used for the battlements of the
Great Wall and the date appears in the shape of clouds above the
wall.
</P>
<P>
Designers say that the three "9s" are rose-colored on a green
background, like flower buds, indicating that the friendship of
Chinese people will be communicated to the rest of the world by
the stamps.
</P>
<P>
Because 1999 is the year of the hare, the Jade Hare, a
character from Chinese fairy tales that lives in the moon, was
chosen as the mascot. Shang Dynasty (16-11th Century BC) bronzes
and Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) hare-shaped jades were models for
the design.
</P>
<P>
The emblem and the mascot were designed by Yan Yunfu and Liu
Jude, professors with the Central Institute of Arts and
Crafts. They were chosen from 1,932 design entries from all over
China. The youngest designer was eight years old and the oldest 79.
</P>
<P>
The World Philatelic Exhibition will be held in the China
International Exhibition Center from August 21 to 30, 1999, and
will show 3,500 sets of stamps in two categories: for competition
and for display.
</P>
<P>
The organizers have planned an international forum on stamp
collection and activities to promote stamp collection among young
people.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will have a special hall for sale of stamps and
a post office that will use a special postmark.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Heart Transplantee Survives Record 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese man who received a
heart transplant has set a record in China for organ transplants
by surviving five years.
</P>
<P>
"Although heart transplants are no longer a difficult operation
overseas and many transplant recipients have lived for more than
10 years, the five-year record is still meaningful in China where
organ transplants are still behind the times," according to a
report in "People's Daily" overseas edition.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yumin was diagnosed as suffering from acute heart disease
and doctors at the No.2 Hospital of Harbin Medical University did
a heart transplant operation on April 26, 1992.
</P>
<P>
They then had to get him through near-fatal post-operative
complications, such as hemorrhaging, a rejection of the organ by
his body, and infection.
</P>
<P>
For the past four years he has had regular physical check-ups
and a steady diet of drugs to help his new heart function normally.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who is now 40, runs a grocery store with his wife in
northeast China's Harbin City. He even got a daughter three years
ago when his wife gave birth to a baby girl.
</P>
<P>
The hospital performed two more heart transplant operations:
one on a 34-year-old middle school teacher in February of 1994,
and the other on a 49-year-old worker in November of 1995. These
operations were also successful and both persons have been able to
work again, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Chinese doctors have also been successful in performing kidney,
liver, and lung transplant. Surgeons at Beijing's Anzhen Hospital
performed a successful lung transplant 26 months ago. It was said
that this marks another breakthrough in organ transplants in
China.

<HEADLINE> South China To Use Japanese Solar Technology For Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region will use Japanese solar energy technology for
residential buildings in Nanning, its capital.
</P>
<P>
The Guangxi Academy of Sciences' Institute of Applied Physics
signed an agreement with Japan's Om Taiyo Association in March on
solar energy housing in Japanese and Chinese styles for the city.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has longer periods of sunlight than in northern parts
of China.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese expert explains that solar batteries on the roof of
a house collect solar energy providing heating through pipes in
winter. In summer, the same pipes remove hot air from the house
and the hot water can be used for bathing.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese solar energy houses use 33 percent less energy
than other forms of air conditioning and are good for
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
He Jiang, deputy director of the institute, said that the city
plans to use the technology for medium-height buildings, the most
popular buildings in the city.

<HEADLINE> Israel Eases Closure on West Bank, Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army today eased
a total closure imposed on the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
allowing a limited number of Palestinians to enter Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report, from this morning, more
than 5,000 married Palestinian traders and hotel workers who are
over 30 are being permitted entry into the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Palestinian medical personnel, teachers,
journalists, and employees of the Israeli Civil Administration,
international organizations and religious institutions may also
travel to Jerusalem from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israel imposed the total closure on the West Bank
and Gaza Strip immediately after a suicide bombing attack in a
downtown coffee shop in Tel Aviv, which left three Israeli women
dead and more than 50 others injured.
</P>
<P>
The closure has barred tens of thousands of Palestinians from
returning to their jobs inside Israel, and from traveling
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Later, the Israeli army eased the closure, allowing Gaza
Strip residents in the West Bank to return to the strip, as well
as West Bank inhabitants in the Gaza Strip to travel home.
</P>
<P>
The army was also letting 20,000 Palestinian workers enter
Israel, but the permit then was only to be issued to
married men over the age of 45.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, another 22 Palestinian ambulances were allowed to
enter Israel on an emergency basis, bringing to 36 the number
of ambulances permitted to go into Israel from the Palestinian
autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
However, before the week-long Jewish Passover holiday which
started last Monday, the Israeli army once again tightened the
closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, barring Palestinians from
entering the country.

<HEADLINE> International Monitors to Meet on Israeli, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A five-nation committee
monitoring the cease-fire in south Lebanon is to hold a meeting
later today to discuss two complaints respectively filed by
Israel and Lebanon against each other.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the
United States will start the meeting at the headquarters of the
U.N. peacekeeping force in the south Lebanese border town of
Naqoura at 11:00 a.m. (08:00 GMT) today.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon filed a complaint to the cease-fire monitoring
committee after a school bus packed with children was hit by
Israeli fire at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The bus was hit with six 12.7 mm bullets fired from a position
manned by Israeli troops and their allied South Lebanon Army
(SLA) militia on the Kawkaba hilltop in the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone," Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Thank god, none of the students was hurt," bus driver Kamel
Madi, "I did my best to escape the fire."
</P>
<P>
"This is a blatant violation of the April 26 cease-fire
understanding because Israeli fire targeted a civilian target, a
school bus carrying students," sources in the Lebanese Foreign
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The same sources added that the Lebanese delegates to the
committee will present the panel with evidence proving Israel's
responsibility for the incident.
</P>
<P>
Under the truce agreement, which ended Israel's 17-day
offensive against Lebanon last year, Israeli troops and Lebanese
guerrillas are barred from targeting civilians or launching
attacks from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Michel Gaussot, the French chairman of the committee,
said the complaint will be made when the panel meets today to
discuss an Israeli protest earlier over an attack on an army
base inside northern Israel Friday by the fundamentalist
Lebanese guerrilla of Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
General Amiram Levine, chief of Israel's northern military
command, described the shelling, which injured two soldiers, as
"a deliberate violation of the cease-fire reached last year
since this accord prohibits attacks on Israeli territory."
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Israel accused Hezbollah of firing
across the border since the end of Israel's Grapes of Wrath
Operation against the Shiite pro-Iranian Party of God in April
1996.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the SLA-run Voice of the South
radio reported an Israeli threat to launch a new blitz against
Lebanon aimed at destroying Hezbollah and replacing the
cease-fire with another truce which is "more favorable" to the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
A Hezbollah source played down the threat, saying it was an
attempt to beef up morale among the Israeli troops and the SLA
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
"The threat is meant to be like vitamins to the Israeli
soldiers because their morale has decreased sharply following
Hezbollah's successful operations against them," the source
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the source added that
Hezbollah "vows to destroy what is left of the SLA" and "will
not be stopped by Israeli threats which have proved to be
ineffective."

LUSAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Foreign Minister Lawrence
Shimba said his country is "more than ready to host talks between
the two factions from Zaire", local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
But he added on Monday that his government has "not yet made
any kind of contact" with either rebel leader Laurent Kabila or
president Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Shimba made the remarks when commenting on media reports that
Kabila had proposed Zambia as one of the two possible venues,
together with South Africa, for talks between himself and
President Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
Asked if a formal approach by either Kabila or Mobutu had been
made to the Zambian government, Shimba replied that no such
approach had been made yet.
</P>
<P>
"As a government, I think we have had enough experience with
such things. We did it with Angola. I think we can also do it for
Zaire," said the Zambian foreign minister.

<HEADLINE> Number of Urban Poor in China Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Recent statistics from the State
Statistics Bureau show that China's population of poor people in
urban areas dropped to 11.76 million in 1996, a decline of 660,000
from 1995.
</P>
<P>
This came about because of projects to help the poor through
reemployment or establishing minimum living standards for urban
residents.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 84 percent of the urban poor came from job changes or
unemployment resulting from economic restructuring. About 40
percent of these came from state-owned or collective firms,
especially in the coal, machinery, and textile sectors, which were
hard hit by reform measures.

<P>
Eighty-five percent of the poor also lived in economically
backward parts of the country in central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
The bureau says that the lives of these people are
deteriorating. In 1996, their per capita incomes dropped 12
percent to 1,321 yuan, equivalent to 30 percent of per capita
income for urban residents.
</P>
<P>
China set a poverty line for urban residents at a per capita
income of around 1,700 yuan. To help keep these people above the
poverty line, the country needs 4.2 billion yuan in relief funds
this year.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has also suggested poverty alleviation measures in
urban areas, that include increased investment in the central and
western parts of the country, adjusting income distribution, and
developing a social security system.

<P>

<HEADLINE> IMF Endorses Gradual Current Account Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The decision-making Interim
Committee of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today issued a
communique, supporting orderly liberalization of member countries'
current account.
</P>
<P>
The communique, issued at the conclusion of the Interim
Committee's 48th meeting, stressed that an open and liberal system
of capital movements was beneficial to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The committee considered the IMF uniquely placed to promote the
orderly liberalization of capital movements and to play a central
role in this effort.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it agreed that the IMF's Articles should be amended
to make the promotion of current account liberalization a specific
purpose of the fund and to give it appropriate jurisdiction over
capital movements.
</P>
<P>
It said that the scope of such jurisdiction would need to be
carefully defined and sufficient flexibility should be allowed
through transitional provisions and approval policies.
</P>
<P>
The committee welcomed the generally favorable prospects for
the expansion of world output and trade, the communique noted.
</P>
<P>
Improved discipline in fiscal and monetary policies in many
countries has contributed to subdued or declining inflation and
relatively low long-term interest rates, it said.
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed that exchange rates should reflect
economic fundamentals and that the reemergence of large external
imbalances should be avoided. Excess volatility and significant
deviations from fundamentals are undesirable, it added.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the favorable situation and prospects, some
challenges remain, the communique noted. Among the advanced
economies, countries where growth has been relatively strong face
the challenge of sustaining the expansion while preventing a
possible upturn in inflation.
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed that the increasing globalization of
markets is an important force driving world growth and providing
opportunities to all countries. While globalization, it said, as
with other structural change, many adversely affect some segments
of society in the short run, the declining share of manufacturing
employment in advanced economies is primarily the consequence of
technical change rather than globalization.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed its backing for the action by the IMF
Executive Board to implement the fund's participation in the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative through the
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) operations. The
ESAF is a concessional lending for developing countries which
undertake structural adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The committee is scheduled to meet again in Hong Kong on
September 21, this year.

NANJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province,
which is on the lower reaches of China's largest river, the
Yangtze, is making preparations for possibly big flooding this
year.
</P>

(14.1 million US dollars) this year reinforcing river banks,
building a water diversion project and water works on the Wangyu
River, anti-flood projects, and 500 km of embankments along the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Another eight million yuan has been allocated for
flood-prevention materials, and the province has earmarked nine
million yuan for program-controlled phones in 39 flood-forecasting
agencies.

<HEADLINE> Export Trade Booms In Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Statistics from Guangxi
Department of Foreign Trade and Economy Co-operation has shown
that the region's import and export volumes reached 460 million US
dollars for the first quarter of 1997, 4.7 percent higher over the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The 370 million US dollars of exports and 90 million US dollars
of imports were 2 percent and 18 percent higher over the same
period of 1996, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Exports kept falling during the January-October period of 1996,
so the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional Government took measures
to end this situation earlier this year. Governments at all levels
are speeding up the tax refund process to reduce enterprises'
burdens.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 has seen an increase of eleven enterprises
gaining export rights. The border export trade in the first
quarter increased by 21.5 percent over the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
With the lowering of loan rates, the rate of Renminbi has kept
steady while the prices keep falling. These have contributed
to lowering export costs and expanding export.

WELLINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto will arrive here late tonight to start a one-day
visit to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
NZ officials expect the visit to reinforce the growing
partnership between the two countries in all spheres and the
personal relationship between Hashimoto and his NZ counterpart Jim
Bolger.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are scheduled to hold a meeting tomorrow
morning and have a bush walk in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
However, a statement released from the Foreign Ministry this
evening said the scheduled meetings Hashimoto to have with Deputy
Prime Minister Winston Peters and the Opposition leader Helen
Clark have been canceled.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation was "due to the fact that Prime Minister
Hashimoto's itinerary in Wellington had to be modified to be as
light as possible, as a result of fatigue from his long journey,
and the Peruvian hostage incident immediately prior to his
departure from Japan," according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Japan and New Zealand are good with no major
problems in any field. Japan is New Zealand's second largest
trading partner after Australia and an important source of

JAKARTA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Democratic Party's
(PDI's) first day of election campaign in Surabaya, the second
largest city in Indonesia, ended in disarray Monday as about 5,000
loyalists of ousted PDI chief Magawati Soeharnoputri stormed the
arena, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
Several people sustained injuries from punches and flying rocks
during the scuffle which occurred at 2:00 p.m. in the city.
However, no arrests were made in the brawl which security
authorities quickly brought under control, police said.
</P>
<P>
PDI's current chairman Seorjadi unseated Megawati in a
government-backed rebel congress last year. The government has
barred Megawati from running in the election.
</P>
<P>
Many pro-Seorjadi activists crossed over and joined the
Megawati camp Monday, shouting "long live Megawati," the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Activists of the two camps rejoiced until about 300 security
officers equipped with riot gear and armored vehicles arrived to
disperse the party.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, campaigns by the United Development Party (PPP) and
the ruling Golkar proceeded without incident.
</P>

The three political parties in Indonesia began their election
campaigns in different areas throughout the country on April 27

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Ready to Join AFTA: Philippine Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Undersecretary for
Foreign Affairs Rodolfo Severino said that he supported the ASEAN
Secretariat's recommendation that Myanmar is ready to integrate
into the ASEAN economy.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed the opening of the Myanmar economy to ASEAN
trade, investment and tourism would lead to political improvements
in that country, the local press today quoted him as saying on
Monday in Phuket, South Thailand, where foreign ministers of
Thailand and the Philippines are meeting today for joint
commission talks.
</P>
<P>
He said Myanmar, as a member of the World Trade Organization,
has had its trade laws in place and is ready to accede to ASEAN
Free Trade Area (AFTA) agreements.
</P>
<P>
Participation in AFTA schemes is the key criterion for ASEAN
membership.
</P>
<P>
On the question of expanding ASEAN's membership, Philippine
Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said his country was "very
flexible" and that his country would have to evaluate reports from
senior officials before putting forward its stand at the scheduled
informal Kuala Lumpur gathering of ASEAN foreign ministers on May
31.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN leaders decided at an informal Jakarta summit last
December to admit Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar into ASEAN
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Severino added that ASEAN is now concerned more about Cambodia
and not Myanmar, as Cambodia's domestic affairs could affect its
commitment to meet ASEAN requirements.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Phnom Penh is yet to pass legislation
related to ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) schemes and that its
national assembly could not convene following the grenade attack
on March 30, which killed 16 people, and the row between the
Cambodian co-prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
If any of the three countries' entry into ASEAN is to be
delayed, the other two will have to wait, according to the
principle ASEAN has agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has tentatively planned to admit the three countries this
year, to mark the regional group's the 30th anniversary and to
realize ASEAN founders' aspiration to include all 10 countries in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) now has
seven members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Late last week, the US government banned new investment by
Americans in Myanmar and requested ASEAN not to accept Myanmar
into the grouping.

<HEADLINE> Small Parties in Nepal Plan to Form United Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Small political parties in
Nepal are planning to form a united front to counter what they
alleged a conspiracy against them by two major parties.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Left Democratic Front is to include the 18 small
parties which have been launching a series of protests against an
earlier decision by the Election Commission (EC) not to allow them
to use their own symbols in the forthcoming local elections, said
sources here today.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the parties, most of them holding no seats in
parliament, at a meeting here Monday alleged that the commission's
decision was a conspiracy of the two largest parties to undermine
smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized to study the possibility of the small
parties coming together as a front to run against major parties in
next month's local elections, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's two largest parties, ruling partner the Communist Party
of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) and main opposition
the Nepali Congress (NC), currently control most parliamentary
seats and local authorities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The small parties have also called a nation-wide general strike
Wednesday in protest against the Election Commission's decision.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Kill 2 Workers in Indonesia's Irian Jaya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A separatist rebel group, the
Free Papua Movement (OPM), in Indonesia's Irian Jaya province,
killed two road surveyors, the official Antara news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
A group of armed men believed to be OPM members attacked a camp
of a road construction company in Akiba village on Sunday and shot
dead two road surveyors there, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Eight other workers escaped to the nearby forest and their
whereabouts remained unknown, it added.
</P>
<P>
A military team was sent to the site of the incident on Monday,
head of the district's military command Lt. Col. Harry Risdianto
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In January 1996, the group took 26 people hostage, including
seven Europeans. All were released or escaped in May last year
during a rescue operation in which two Indonesian hostages were
killed.
</P>
<P>
The group also kidnapped 16 workers of a logging company in
central Irian Jaya last August. Two hostages were killed and the
rest were released or escaped later.
</P>
<P>
The OPM, known as a security disturbance group, has been
fighting for a separate state in the area since the early 1960s.

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Indian customs officials seized
a massive consignment of smuggled gold -- 170 biscuits weighting
20 kg and worth 10 million rupees (about 286,000 US dollars) -- at
the international airport here on Monday, The Times of India
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Two passengers, identified as Raja Sheikh Khalil Ahmed and

</P>
<P>
The passengers caught on Monday were carrying the gold in a

the x-ray machines.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth major seizure of gold at the Indira Gandhi

<HEADLINE> Nepali Government Justifies Decision on Rhino Gifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government said
today that its decision to send two rhinos as gifts to Britain did
not violate the international convention against trade in
endangered wildlife species.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Forest in a press release said that the
transfer of two female baby rhinos to the London Zoo was approved
by wildlife protecting authorities in Nepal and the United Kingdom
as part of an international conservation program for the species.
</P>
<P>
The Secretariat of the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) in Switzerland
also authorized the transfer, it added.
</P>
<P>
The two unicorn rhino calves were shipped out of Nepal Monday
by a flight of German airline Lufthansa for London amid strong
opposition from local environmental activists.
</P>
<P>
The Lufthansa flight was coincidentally the last passenger
flight of the German Airline from Kathmandu as it ends its
passenger operation in Nepal from May, 1997 due to financial
reasons.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, the government decided in 1995 to
provide the two rhinos to the London Zoo as gifts for the purpose
of scientific research after nearly three years' pursuit from the
British side.
</P>
<P>
Nepal at present has some 500 rhinos in the Chitwan National
Wildlife Park, the species' only habitat in the country, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Local environmentalists had called on the government to scrap
the rhino gift plan, arguing that the CITES prohibits any form of
trade of the rhino and the country lacks a transparent policy on
such a case.
</P>
<P>
They alleged that a semi-governmental conservation agency took
400,000 US dollars from the British Zoological Society for the
deal.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria-Romania Optical Telecommunications Cable Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria will soon link its northern
border city of Ruse with the city of Giurgiu in Romania through an
optical telecommunications cable.
</P>
<P>
The optical cable, with a capacity of 350,000 speech paths, has
been laid and will soon be put into operation. It is part of a
planned optical cable network between Sofia and Bucharest, the
capitals of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The operation of the optical cable would not only help
guarantee high quality telecommunications between Bulgaria and
Romania, but also offer services for countries in western and
central Europe as well as the Near East.
</P>
<P>
Over the recent two years, Bulgaria has laid a total length of
211 kilometers of optical cables and built 11 program-controlled
switchboards.
</P>
<P>
An optical cable network has connected Bulgaria with
Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece and Romania.
</P>
<P>
But experts complained that the development of Bulgaria's
telecommunication industry is still far from keeping up with the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics showed that there are 37 telephones for every
100 people in the country with a population of 8.5 million. Of the
country's 2,445 switchboards, only 11 are program controlled.

<HEADLINE> Arson Evidences Found in Philippine Hotel Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Investigators have discovered
material evidences that could link the cause of a Philippine hotel
fire, which killed 27 people in the southern city of Cotabato, to
arson, the Philippine News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Investigation team sent to Cotabato by the government from
Manila to look into the Imperial Hotel fire on April 26 recently
found two gasoline containers in rooms 305 and 319 of the burned
establishment, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Room 305, earlier reserved as prayer room for Autonomous Region
in Muslim Mindanao Governor Nur Misuari's guests who were at the
hotel to witness his state-of-the-region address originally
scheduled for April 28, was the place pointed to as where the fire
started.
</P>
<P>
Misuari later postponed his state address.
</P>
<P>
Virgilio Tobias, regional director of the country's Bureau of
Fire Protection, was quoted by the agency as saying that the
gasoline containers were already brought to Manila for laboratory
tests.
</P>
<P>
No official result has been declared yet by Tobias on their
investigation but he could not rule out the possibility of arson
following the discovery of the containers.
</P>
<P>
He said that a special task force to investigate the tragedy
was expected to come up with an official report on the case by May
2.
</P>
<P>
The task force is composed of the provincial fire marshal of
North Cotabato, the city fire marshal inspector and members from
the Bureau of Fire Protection in Manila.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Raise Prices of Fertilizer, Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
expected to announce an upward adjustment of the sensitive
fertilizer prices before the forthcoming budget for 1997-98 year
beginning from the first day of July, according to official
sources.
</P>
<P>
A similar decision to raise gasoline prices might follow. In
fact the new budget would require upward price adjustments for
some more utility items such as water, gas and electricity, said
the sources.
</P>
<P>
But finance ministry officials said the authorities would not
do anything in a haste.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka has been under pressure for a long time to make
adjustments in the prices of these items for budget balance and
also to comply with international donors' requests.
</P>
<P>
The donors' community is pressing the government to increase
the urea price, which is heavily subsidized and quiet lower than
the market price of neighboring India.
</P>
<P>
To provide cheap fertilizer to farmers, the Bangladeshi
government is now selling urea at 3725 Taka (about 93 U.S.
dollars) per ton as against the cost of production at 5011 Taka
(about 125 dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the government's fertilizer subsidy this
year would be as high as 4.83 billion Taka (about 120 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Increasing fertilizer prices is a sensitive issue. The
government's priority lies in reaching urea to farmers at a
cheaper price," said a high-ranking official from the Finance
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"But experience showed that it was not the farmers but the
marketing agents and smugglers who were taking the bigger chunk of
this advantage. Therefore, a reasonable increase in prices will
not significantly affect the farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the acreage under cultivation and food production over
these years remained almost steady, the demand for urea doubled
from 1.22 million tons in 1992 to 2.3 million tons in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Greece Backs Albania's Interim Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government would give
its full support to Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino and his
all-party interim government, visiting Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said today.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with Fino, who was appointed as prime minister in
mid-March, Tsohatzopoulos said that Albania and Greece should help
each other not only because the two countries are neighbors and
enjoy traditional friendship but also because they share the
responsibility for safeguarding the stability of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Fino agreed and also spoke highly of the development of the
good-neighborly relationship between the two countries, said a
statement issued by the prime minister's office later today.
</P>
<P>
Fino said preparing for the scheduled June parliamentary
elections was the priority of his government, which, transitional
in nature, would come to the end of its mandate by that time.
</P>
<P>
He added that the presence of a 6,000-member multinational
protection force in Albania would guarantee the elections to be
held in a peaceful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of shaky investment schemes, into which thousands
of Albanians put their life savings, sparked widespread unrest in
the Balkan country in January and protests mushroomed across the
country. They quickly erupted into armed conflict across the
country in March.
</P>
<P>
Protesters demanded repayment of their money and the opposition
Socialist Party called for the resignation of President Sali
Berisha.
</P>
<P>
Fino, an economist from the Socialist Party, was invited by the
president to form a new government on March 12. This government
adopted effective measures to placate the unrest, and order is
being restored in the country.
</P>
<P>
On March 25, the United Nations Security Council passed a
resolution authorizing the dispatch of a 6,000-member, Italian-led
multinational force for three months to protect relief operations
in Albania.

<HEADLINE> Warriors Fire Adelman as Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Golden State Warriors
fired coach Rick Adelman and his assistants on Monday, according
to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Adelman had a 66-98 record in two seasons with the Warriors,
who was a 30-52 record this season and failed to make the National
Basketball Association playoffs for the third straight year.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word on the fate of general manager Dave
Twardzik, who also has taken much of the blame for poor drafts and
disappointing performances by the Warriors the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
Warriors owner Chris Cohan said the contracts of assistant
coaches John Wetzel, George Irvine and Rod Higgins will not be
renewed.
</P>
<P>
Adelman, who took the Trail Blazers to the NBA finals twice
while coaching six seasons in Portland, has a career record of
357-252. His .586 winning percentage is 12th on the NBA career
list.
</P>
<P>
Adelman is the third NBA coach fired since the end of the
season, joining Dick Motta of Denver and Johnny Davis of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
There were six firings during the regular season: Bernie
Bickerstaff in Denver, Jim Lynam in Washington, Brian Winters in
Vancouver, Garry St. Jean in Sacramento, Brian Hill in Orlando and
Bob Hill in San Antonio.

<HEADLINE> No Civil War in Albania, Says European Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- European Parliament Vice President
Guido Podeska said here today that there is no civil war in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
Podeska, who was visiting albania at the head of an European
Parliamentary delegation designed to find out the real situation
in Albania, has met with leaders of the Albanian government and
various political parties and visited chaotic cities of Vlora
and Shkoder.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people have reportedly been killed in Albania,
which has been engulfed by chaos sparked last December by the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes in which thousands of
Albanians lost their money.
</P>
<P>
Much of southern Albania is now still under the control of
armed protesters who insisted President Sali Berisha resign over
the fraudulent investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
An Italian-led multinational force approved by the United
Nations is carrying out humanitarian relief operations in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Podeska said at a press conference before leaving the Balkan
nation that the situation in southern Albanian city of Vlora is
comparatively quiet while the northern city of Shkoder appeared
seriously chaotic due to ruffians' activities.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino told the European
delegation that nothing of the sort as described by some foreign
press media has occurred in Albania. There is no civil war, ethnic
war or south-north war in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fino said that "the citizens' committees" established in
southern Albania were actually committees set up by honest
intellectuals under conditions in which police authorities were
paralyzed and many police left their jobs.
</P>
<P>
The committees, which cannot be lumped together with armed
criminals, will die out of themselves when local authorities are
restored, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister promised that his government will crack down
on armed bandits.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Leaders Criticize U.S. Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Some Latin American leaders
today slammed the United States for introducing unilateral trade
and drug policy towards Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
The leaders made the remarks at a two-day meeting held at the
Carter Center in Altanta. The meeting, sponsored by former
U.S. President Jimmy Carter, was aimed at mapping out a
"hemispheric agenda" for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the U.S. of foot-dragging in world trade, the leaders
complained that little progress has been made since December 1994
when leaders from 34 countries in the west hemisphere met in Miami
and pledged to create a free trade zone by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Bolivian President Gonzlo Sanchez said that the expansion of
free trade between the U.S. and other countries were opposed by
some Republicans in the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.'s controversial "certification" on other countries'
anti-drug efforts was also criticized at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report, the U.S. State Department "certifies" and
"decertifies" 32 countries on their anti-drug efforts. The U.S.
will impose sanctions on, or cut off aid to, the "decertified"
nations.
</P>
<P>
"Certification...does not make for partnership, it does not
make for friendship... it is obvious that the process does more
harm than good, " said Jamaican Prime Minister P.J. Patterson.
</P>
<P>
Cesar Gaviria, the secretary general of the Organization of
American States (OAS), said that the certification is unilateral
and should be avoided in future.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
Inter-American Affairs Jeffrey Davidow told a forum that the
annual U.S. assessment of other countries in fighting drugs has
become an "unnecessarily traumatic ritual."
</P>
<P>
"I agree it has become...unnecessarily traumatic yearly
ritual," he admitted.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh's Stock Market Hit by Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), the
main bourse of Bangladesh, witnessed a continuous bearish trend in
recent weeks after the investor's confidence was heavily hit by
this country's biggest-ever stock scandal.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the benchmark DSE All Share Price Index nose-dived
by 5.42 percent to 969.70 points, a few points down from the level
which the present government inherited 10 months ago. The index
further slid down to 899.38 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Awami (people's) League led by Sheikh Hasina
assumed power last June, the key index rode a bull run amidst
alleged manipulation until it reached a dizzying height of 3648.74
on November 5 of last year.
</P>
<P>
The bubble burst finally and investors, mostly new without any
experience, saw share prices falling everyday, making them lose
all their savings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the
watchdog of this country's capital market, submitted a probe
report on the unusual ups and downs of the stock prices, which
dragged the benchmark index to a mercurial journey down.
</P>
<P>
In that report, eight well-known listed companies and seven
broker firms were charged with manipulating share prices through
fraudulent means during the bull run last year.
</P>
<P>
On April 2, the government filed the cases and the court issued
arrest warrants against the major business leaders and stock
brokers involved in the market manipulation. However, all those
accused were later granted anticipatory bail.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt the market would be panicky since the scandal
indicated that the DSE has a long way to go to turn into a
well-regulated and mature stock market," said a market observer.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the recent panic also intensified following a report
statement by central bank Governor Lutfar Rahman Sarker that the
country's banking system was on the verge of collapse, said a
senior broker of the DSE.
</P>
<P>
Sarker estimated the amount of outstanding bank loans at 130
billion Taka (about 3 billion U.S. dollars) and said the nation's
banks would not be able to survive with the huge debt burden.
</P>
<P>
The warning also rattled the stock market as most investors and
brokers heavily depended on bank loans, the broker added.

<HEADLINE> China Establishes First Base of Space Seed Breeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The China Aerospace
Corporation has established the first space seed base in Bazhou
City in Hebei Province, a major grain producer, to put crop seeds
on a retrievable satellite to study the influences of space.
</P>
<P>
The space seed breeding technology, developed in the 1990s in
China, Russia and the US, studies the effects of gravity and
vacuums on chemical bonds, free radicals, and DNA chromosomal
structures.
</P>
<P>
Tests in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and other
places have shown that rice and wheat output can be increased
eight to 10 percent and vegetable output by 50 to 120 percent
using these techniques.
</P>
<P>
One expert says that planting 1.5 kilograms of space treated
green pepper seeds on one hectare of land will yield 6,750
kilograms of quality seeds.
</P>
<P>
The Bazhou base will bring wheat, sunflower, and grass seeds
from Canada and maize seeds from Hungary for space breeding.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tourist Industry Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's tourist industry has
recovered this year following a lean year last year when a drop of
25 percent in arrivals was recorded.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from tourism plunged to 175 million US dollars in 1996
from 225 million US dollars the previous year following several
bomb attacks in Colombo by Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, tourist arrivals in the first quarter of this year
rose by 17 percent over the same period in 1996 to 101,760.
Arrivals in March alone rose by 29 percent to 34,098 from 26,442
in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The recovery is attributed to the improved security situation
in the country and the promotional work by both the government and
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Tourist Board sources expects tourist arrivals to be about
400,000 this year, which was the figure for 1995.
</P>
<P>
Average hotel occupancy during the current season was around 50
percent with some hotels being almost full, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan hotel stocks have risen already by 12.1 percent this
month as a result of political stability, lower corporate
borrowing rates and expectations of better first quarter results,
the sources added.

BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China is to launch a massive
training program in a bid to combat viral hepatitis, one of
China's most serious public health problems.
</P>
<P>
The activities will include lectures for patients to increase
knowledge on hepatitis prevention and treatment, according to
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Training programs will also be organized for doctors to improve
their skills in diagnosing and treating viral hepatitis cases, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Academic Promotion in Viral Hepatitis and Liver Diseases
(ChinaHep), an independent professional association that is
composed of 44 leading hepatitis physicians from across the
country, has developed educational programs in the light of
Chinese conditions.
</P>
<P>
ChinaHep statistics showed that each year, between 500,000 and
one million people throughout the country are newly diagnosed with
chronic hepatitis, with 20 to 30 percent developing fatal
illnesses like cancer of the liver.
</P>
<P>
And there is no common understanding of the diagnosis and
treatment of hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
Some doctors can not make an accurate diagnose of the type of
viral hepatitis, and can not prescribe effective medicines.
</P>
<P>
Many patients know little about the disease and may be easily
cheated by exaggerated advertisements for medicines and therapies
which are often expensive and of little or no effect, the
newspaper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's President Farooq
Leghari believes that economic cooperation between Pakistan and
China is to be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
"There is a scope for increasing the volume of trade between
our two countries," Leghari told the Chinese media here last night
before his departure on a two-day working visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said that during his stay in Beijing he will hold talks
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin on bilateral relations,
regional and international issues, particularly on matters of
deepening economic cooperation between Pakistan and China.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and China enjoy "very deep and brotherly relations,"
the president said, adding that "we are neighbors, and the best
friends in the world, the relations between our two countries are
ideal."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and China, as the two brotherly countries, share "a
commonality on almost all international issues," Leghari said. The
two countries "support each other very strongly at all
international fora," he added.
</P>
<P>
There is "very good government-to-government relationship"
between Pakistan and China, and the two countries also enjoy "very
good cooperation in the defense field," said Leghari.
</P>
<P>
"We want to do now is to increase the level and volume of our
trade and economic cooperation," the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said the frequent high-level contacts between Pakistan
and China will certainly promote the development of the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The president said that China is a country which has made rapid
economic progress. Pakistan, too, also has the great potential to
grow in economic terms.
</P>
<P>
There are broad prospects for the two countries to further
strengthen their economic and trade cooperation, Leghari said.
</P>
<P>
Leghari is visiting China for the second time as the president.
He first visited China in November 1994.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Labour Marts Help Laid-off Get New Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will set up more
re-employment centers this year to find laid-off workers new jobs
and create a labour market, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing based newspaper quotes Ye Mingzhong, deputy
director of the Shanghai Municipal Labour Bureau as saying that
Shanghai will establish centers in more sectors: light industry,
machinery and electronics, chemical, metallurgy and building
materials, and instrument-manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Ye estimated that 250,000 laid-off workers will use the centres
this year. The centers help laid-off workers enroll in job
training programmes and seek new jobs for them.
</P>
<P>
About 600,000 to 750,000 people will have to be allocated new
jobs during the 1996-2000 period. The increasing number of
laid-off workers is caused by the industrial restructuring and
economic development across China.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 230,000 workers came to the re-employment centers
for help, including 115,000 from the textile industry. The textile
sector encountered unprecedented difficulties as Shanghai moves
into a market economy.
</P>
<P>
The re-employment service center for the textile industry has
set up various training programmes for laid-off workers. Last
year, the center helped 58,000 unemployed workers find new
jobs, The paper says.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smuggling Exhibition Draws Public Attention in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition on the crack down
on smuggling by China's Customs officials has been well received
by citizens in Shanghai, the leading manufacturing center in
China.
</P>
<P>
As China's largest port, Shanghai is coveted by many
smugglers. Leaders of Shanghai have stressed on many occasions
that "Shanghai will never become a smuggling conduit",
and have taken measures to combat against smuggling activities.
</P>
<P>
Huang Ju, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party, and 300 other leaders attended the
opening ceremony of the exhibition and vowed that they will fight
against such illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
The third anti-smuggling exhibition sponsored by China's
General Administration of Customs has drawn close attention from
Chinese top leaders such as President Jiang Zemin, who has given
important instructions to publicize anti-smuggling operations.
</P>
<P>
With the development of China's economy and opening wider to
the outside world, the struggle against smuggling has become more
difficult. In the past ten years, China's customs officials have
solved 94,000 smuggling cases, and confiscated 20,000 smuggled
cars and 30,000 kilograms of drugs..
</P>
<P>
The exhibition has selected 400 objects in order to show the
seriousness and complexity of the anti-smuggling effort. Some of
Shanghai Customs' achievements have also been exhibited.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, April 28 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
SUCRE, BOLIVIA -- The Andean Community and the Southern Common
Market (Mercosur) declared on April 23 its "firm political will"
to create an extensive free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The commitment was contained in a joint statement signed by
the presidents of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, all
members of the Andean Pact and the president of Paraguay as the
pro tempore president of the Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
The Andean Community hopes that the final draft of the free
trade agreement will be ready this year. The Mercosur includes
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
OTTAWA -- Canada is looking for a pact with the Mercosur before
the completion of a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA),
Prime Minister Jean Chretien told Brazilian Presient Fernando
Henrique Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
Canada is showing an unusual interest in reaching an agreement
because "the Canadian economy fits in very well" with that
subregional bloc, pointed out the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said that an agreement between the Mercosur and
Canada would be a step towards the establishment of a FTAA by
the year 2005. Chretien and Cardoso met on April 22.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- The building of the first high-voltage power
line that will carry electric power from Argentina to Chile across
the Andean Cordillera was awarded to the Chilgener Company.
</P>
<P>
The power line will transport energy from a combined-cycle
thermal plant that Chilgener will build in Salta, a province in
Argentina to Antofagasta, a region in Chile, where it will supply
electricity mainly to mining companies.
</P>
<P>
The power line between the Salta plant and the border will
require an investment of 50 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardos and Argentine President Carlos Menem signed an agreement
for military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will link the armed forces of both countries but
"is not a military alliance", declared Menem in a meeting.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso and Menem met recently in Rio de Janeiro to talk
about trade disputes and to sign other agreements in
transportation and energy matters. (to be continued)

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (51-52) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (51-52) in
a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: What are qualifications for public servants in the
government of the Hong Kong SAR?
</P>
<P>
Answer: It is important to keep the existing civil service to
maintain the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. The existing
civil service basically suits Hong Kong's economic
development. Keeping this system basically unchanged will
contribute to the Hong Kong SAR's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, public servants in all government
departments of the Hong Kong SAR must be permanent residents of
the region; foreign nationals among the SAR's permanent residents
may also serve as public servants in government departments
(except for certain high positions); and all public servants
serving in the Hong Kong government before the establishment of
the Hong Kong SAR may remain employed and retain their seniority
with pay, allowances, benefits and conditions of service no less
favourable than before.
</P>
<P>
Non-permanent residents of the Hong Kong SAR, such as people in
the mainland, are not eligible to serve as public servants in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Question: Will people's deputies to the National People's
Congress form Hong Kong automatically become public servants of
the Hong Kong SAR?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The answer is no. This is because NPC deputies and
public servants are different in nature.
</P>
<P>
Deputies are representatives of Hong Kong people in different
walks of life, and being a deputy is not a profession, whereas
being a public servant is. An NPC deputy can become a public
servant only when he or she is employed by the government in the
capacity of an ordinary Hong Kong citizen.

<HEADLINE> Race Won't Be for title of Fastest Man, Says Bailey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Donovan Bailey says his
150-meter race against Michael Johnson on June 1 in Toronto will
not be a battle for the title of "world's fastest man".
</P>
<P>
The world recored holder and Olympic champion in the 100 meters
was quoted as saying in Austin, Ttexas, the race will be about
Canada vs. the United States, flamboyance against intensity and a
short sprinter taking on a long sprinter.
</P>
<P>
Johnson is the world record holder in the 200 meters and
Olympic champion in the 200 and 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
"The fastest man runs on a straightaway," Bailey was quoted by
a report reaching here as saying, alluding to the fact the
150-meter race against Johnson will include 75 meters of curve and
75 meters of straightaway.
</P>
<P>
"Michael and I are the two biggest stars in track and field
worldwide," Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
Bailey also said the race is more about marketing a sport that
he says is suffering an identity crisis. Each will get 500,000
U.S. dollars for showing up in Toronto, and the winner will take
home 1 million U.S. dollars.

<P>
BONN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
today said that the European Union (EU) should have more
"capability to act" in foreign and security affairs.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting in Hamburg with Hans van Mierlo, Dutch foreign
minister who now holds the rotating presidency of the Council of
the EU, Kinkel said the EU need to make common foreign and
security policies visible to the outside world. Otherwise, the
credibility of the EU would be threatened, he added.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the necessity to reform the current EU practice of
consensus decision-making, Kinkel said, "We need a transition to
majority voting." Consensus need to be retained only in the area
of defense, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Kinkel also reiterated his call for a
step-by-step integration of the Western European Union into the EU
structure.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Strengthens Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar ended mostly
higher today as traders held the belief that the Group of Seven's
weekend summit communique indicated its reluctance to halt the
currency's ascent.
</P>
<P>
Financial officials from Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan and the United States met in Washington Sunday,
sending a signal that they would not act aggressively to stop the
dollar, which has risen more than 12 percent against the mark and
nearly 10 percent against the yen this year.
</P>
<P>
The dollar briefly hit a 38-month high of 1.7386 marks in early
Asian dealings before settling in New York at 1.7330 marks, up
from 1.7270 Friday. The dollar ended at 126.98 yen, up from
126.25. The pound cost 1.6247 U.S. dollars, up from 1.6231 U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Redressal of Anomalous UN Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China stressed today that
the key to the enlargement of the Security Council rested with the
redressal of its long-standing anomalous composition in terms of
geographical representation and representation between developed
and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the basic position on the reform at a meeting of
the Working Group on the reform of the Security Council, Chinese
Ambassador Wang Xuexian said that China supported reasonable and
appropriate expansion of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"The key to the enlargement of the Security Council lies in
redressing the long-standing anomaly in geographical
representation and in representation between developed and
developing countries in the composition of the Security Council.
No reform plan should aggravate such anomaly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though the working group had intensive discussions on the
reform for more than three years, there still existed serious and
profound differences among countries on many major questions, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
As the question affected the interest of all countries, full
and patient discussions were necessary so as to reach consensus or
at least be close to consensus, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only way to ensure that a reformed Security
Council represents to the greatest extent the will of the general
membership and better fulfills the important responsibilities
entrusted to it by the Charter," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the final reform plan of the Security Council needed to be
carefully cultivated by the entire membership, "we are not in
favor of setting a time frame for reform or forcing a vote on it,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Haste makes waste. It may not only adversely affect the work
of the Security Council and the United Nations, but also sharpen
the contradictions among member states and cast a shadow on
regional or even world peace and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
The UN Charter, as the political and legal basis of the United
Nations, had stood the test of history. It was the guarantee for
the smooth development of the United Nations. Amendment of the
Charter was a major and sensitive political issue on which
opinions should be widely solicited and prudent discussions
conducted, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> China Ousts Sweden in Table Tennis Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Kong Linghui put
China in suspense as he lost and won in China's 3-1 victory over
Sweden in the men's team quarter-finals at the World Table Tennis
Championships here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
World top-ranked Kong, who lost the second game to Jan-Ove
Waldner 15-21, 25-27, beat Peter Karlsson 21-14, 21-17 in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Liu Guoliang won the opening game against
Karlsson 21-17, 22-20 and Sweden pulled even as world No. 2
Waldner improved his record against Kong to 5-0.
</P>
<P>
Chinese veteran Wang Tao put China 2-1 up as he beat Jorgen
Persson in the third rubber.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Wang, who snatched a crucial point from Persson
in the last world championship final, nipped his rival 22-20,
21-15.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 12-13 in the second set, Persson strained his groin
muscle in a forehand attack and had to receive on-court medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, which finished second to Belgium in its group, lost its
seeding and was thus drawn into the first quarter topped by China.
</P>
<P>
China and Sweden had met in six world championship finals with
each winning three.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team leader Li Furong owed the victory to strong
mentality of the Chinese trio and a lineup mistake made by Swedish
head coach Ulf Carlsson.
</P>
<P>
"We are wary of Waldner, not Karlsson or Persson," Li
said. "But Carlsson made a big mistake by putting Waldner in the
second and fifth game. He never considered the Swedes could lose
1-3 before Waldner returned to save them."
</P>
<P>
Carlsson begged to disagree, insisting that he made a perfect
lineup.
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing wrong with the lineup, China just played
better today," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied with the performance of my players, but unhappy
with the result," the Swedish coach added.
</P>
<P>
Waldner said he held no grudge against Carlsson who put him as
a No. 2 player in the match.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play too well the day before yesterday. If I was the
head coach, I could have made such decision," said Waldner, who
lost two team games in the group matches against Belarus and
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
China will have a tough game as it takes on South Korea on
Tuesday, which entered the semi-finals by outlasting Japan 3-2.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has beaten China twice, at the Asian championships
in December last year and the Qatar Open in February.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France will fight for a final berth on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Germany beat Greece 3-1 and France knocked out Belgium 3-2 in
the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
In the women's semi-finals on Monday, China downed Germany 3-0
and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea routed South Korea
in straight games.
