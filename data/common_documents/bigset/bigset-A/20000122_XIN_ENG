<HEADLINE> Auditors Urged to be Clean, Efficient: Chinese Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has
urged the country's auditors to focus their attention on priority
work, remain uncorrupted and improve their efficiency.
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech made in response to a report on national
auditing, the premier said Chinese auditors should concentrate on
major issues and economic cases involving misuse of funds.
</P>
<P>
He also called for tougher regulations on auditing and tougher
discipline for auditors who violate regulations, adding all the
expenses for auditing work should be covered by the state coffer.
</P>
<P>
Some special measures should be taken to train the country's
auditors so that their expertise will be up to the world's
advanced levels, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that those who do not meet qualification requirements
will not be chosen as auditors.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a good job should be done in auditing leading
officials to determine if their work is clean.
</P>
<P>
State councilor Wang Zhongyu called on the auditors at a
national auditing conference to correctly understand the essence
of premier Zhu's speech and place emphasis on exposing major cases
of national significance.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Jordan to Promote Trade, Economic Cooperation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq was keen on expanding
economic and trade cooperation with Jordan, said Iraqi Trade
Minister Mohammad Mehdi Salah on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq signed a total of 842 million U.S. dollars worth of
contracts with Jordan under the past six phases of the oil-for-food
program, said Salah at the opening session of the Iraqi-Jordanian
Joint Committee for Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program, now in its seventh phase, Iraq
is allowed to sell limited amount of oil in every six months to buy
humanitarian supplies for its people who are hardest-hit by the U.
N. sanctions imposed on the country since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Also since then, Jordan has become the main transit route of
Iraq to the outside world and Iraq is the sole source of oil for
Jordan at a lower-than-market price.
</P>
<P>
For his part, visiting Jordanian Minister of Trade, Industry and
Supply Mohammed Halayka said his country is eager to enhance trade
and economic cooperation with Iraq, expressing hope that the
meeting will help push forward such cooperation, the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Halayka arrived here Friday evening together with Energy and
Mineral Resources Minister Wael Sabri.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides agreed on forming technical
committees to continue the talks and preparing minutes to be signed
at the conclusion of those talks.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by Iraq, government-to-government
trade volume with Jordan reached 200 million dollars last year, and
trade transactions between businessmen of the two countries stood
at 150 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Work Accidents in Italy Claim 100 Death Per Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The 967,000 on-the-job accidents
reported in Italy last year claimed the lives of 1,208 workers,
more than 100 per month or 4.6 per work day, the Italian national
institute which handles compulsory insurance coverage for workers,
Inail, reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Citing complete figures for the first 11 months of 1999, Inail
said the number of accidents reported rose 2.2 percent over 1998
and, in the various categories, the number of dead in agricultural
accidents climbed from 118 to 143 and those in construction moved
up from 210 to 217.
</P>
<P>
On the other two high-fatality categories, deaths in accidents
in the manufacturing industries declined from 257 in 1998 to 216
and those in services and the electrical sector dipped from 249 to
247.
</P>
<P>
Inail said the institute is singling out agriculture for an
advertising campaign to be aired in the spring by the public
television broadcaster and aimed at heightening safety on the farm.

<HEADLINE> Greek-Turkish Detente Should be Encouraged: Cyprus FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides said on Saturday that the detente in Greek-Turkish
relations should be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides made the remark at a seminar of the ruling right-wing
Democratic Rally party on the "Cyprus problem and the accession
course in the new millennium."
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have been long-standing foes over Aegean
territorial disputes, which almost triggered war in 1996 and the
future of the divided Cyprus, in which the two countries take sides
along ethnic line.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriots-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey troops
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Turkey insists that the breakaway state proclaimed by Turkish
Cypriots in northern Cyprus be recognized internationally before
the stalled peace talks on the island is resumed.
</P>
<P>
Greek-Turkish relations slumped to a low in February last
year when Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, forced from his
Syrian base by Turkish pressure, was found to be taking refuge
in the Greek embassy in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
But the recent visit to Turkey by Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou indicated a ice breaking in relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said the Cypriot government did not expect a change
in Turkey's policies and rhetoric on the Cyprus issue following the
visit.
</P>
<P>
But he echoed Papandreou by saying that the
new momentum created after last month's European Union (EU)
Helsinki summit and improved Greco-Turkish relations would be
affected if there is no change in Turkey's policies on the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkey formally became candidate for EU membership partially
thanks to the objection drop of Greece to Turkey's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
The EU now becomes more involved in seeking a solution to the
Cyprus issue by conducting political dialog with Turkey, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's policy on the Cyprus issue is incompatible with the
country's efforts for EU membership, said the minister.

said Salah at the opening session of the Iraqi-Jordanian Joint
Committee for Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program, now in its seventh phase, Iraq
is allowed to sell limited amount of oil in every six months to buy
humanitarian supplies for its people who are hardest-hit by the U.
N. sanctions imposed on the country since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Also since then, Jordan has become the main transit route of
Iraq to the outside world and Iraq is the sole source of oil for
Jordan at a lower-than-market price.
</P>
<P>
For his part, visiting Jordanian Minister of Trade, Industry and
Supply Mohammed Asfur said his country is eager to enhance trade
and economic cooperation with Iraq, expressing hope that the
meeting will help push forward such cooperation, the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Asfur arrived here Friday evening together with Energy and
Mineral Resources Minister Suleiman Abu Alim.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides agreed on forming technical
committees to continue the talks and preparing minutes to be signed
at the conclusion of those talks.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by Iraq, government-to-government
trade volume with Jordan reached 200 million dollars last year, and
trade transactions between businessmen of the two countries stood
at 150 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> UAE, Sudanese Leaders Review Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar Hassan
al-Bashir Saturday wound up a one-day visit to the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) after reviewing with UAE leaders bilateral ties and
ways to enhance them.
</P>
<P>
During his separate talks with UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin
Sultan Al-Nahyan and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Khalifa Bin
Zayed Al-Nahyan, Bashir also briefed them on the latest development
in his country, namely his dismissal of the parliament and the
imposition of a three-month state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
The move was aimed at sidelining parliament Speaker Hassan al-
Turabi, considered for long as the real power holder in the
country, who attempted to weaken the president by amending the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, the UAE leaders, who had earlier expressed
their support for Bashir, reiterated their "utmost support and
commitment for the stability of Sudan and its people," the official
WAM news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Besides ways of promoting the fraternal relations, the two
presidents also discussed a number of Arab and regional issues,
including the efforts being made to create a conducive atmosphere
to mend fences and unite the Arab front, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Zayed repeated his call on Arab countries to set aside their
differences and work together for Arab solidarity and cooperate for
the interests of their peoples.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the best way to overcome division and disarray
among Arab countries is to convene regular meetings of Arab
leaders, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
Bashir arrived here Saturday morning with a delegation which
includes Foreign Minister Mustafa Ismail, Minister of Finance
Abdullah Ahmed and other officials.
</P>
<P>
Since he dissolved the parliament, Bashir had visited Egypt,
Libya, Bahrain and Yemen to seek support from Arab leaders.

<HEADLINE> Tikhomirov Appointed as Russian Interior Troops Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Colonel-General
Vyacheslav Tikhomirov was appointed as commander of Russian
interior troops and deputy interior minister by acting President
Vladimir Putin on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tikhomirov's latest position was commander of the Urals
Military District.
</P>
<P>
He replaces in the post Colonel-General Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov,
who will take up another job, and "there are no claims to him(
Ovchinnikov)," Putin's press secretary Alexei Gromov said.
</P>
<P>
Gromov said Tikhomirov is an experienced military leader, who"
was long in the personnel reserve for future promotion in service"
and "well knows the sphere of activity and specifics of interior
troops."
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five-year-old Tikhomirov graduated from two military
academies: the Tashkent Military College in 1967 and Frunze
Military Academy in 1978, as well as the Military Academy of the
Russian General Staff in 1988.
</P>
<P>
He was chief of staff and first deputy commander of the 14th
Amy in Moldavia's Dniester region in 1992-1995.
</P>
<P>
Tikhomirov served as deputy commander of the North Caucasus
Military District in 1995 and commander of joint federal forces in
Chechnya in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He worked as commander of the Urals Military District in
January this year.
</P>
<P>
He is married and has two sons.
</P>
<P>
Tikhomirov's transfer from the Defense Ministry to the Interior
Ministry "should help improve the coordination between interior
troops and the Defense Ministry," said Gromov.

<HEADLINE> Second Winter Storm Hits Maritime Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The storm blizzard raised the water of the Atlantic Sea up to 2
meters high Friday at a force of over 100 kilometers an hour to
rush to Tignish Shore of western Prince Edward Island.
</P>
<P>
About 20 families in a nearby community were evacuated, while
eight other communities along the north shore were on alert as
storm was sending ocean waves more than 300 meters inland Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city Charlottetown, Nova Scotia Premier John
Hamm and New Brunswick Premier Bernard Lord were stranded when
afternoon flights out of the city were canceled, according to
local media.
</P>
<P>
The storm turned downtown areas into ghost towns also in Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick, shutting universities and government
offices in Halifax, Moncton, Saint John and Fredericton.
</P>
<P>
"Aside from buses and snowplows, there is virtually no traffic
in downtown Halifax," a city official said.
</P>
<P>
Up to 50 to 70 centimeters of snowfall is being reported in
parts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, where an average
precipitation in the snowbelt area near Moncton has reached 40
centimeters.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Shirley McAlary of Saint John, New Brunswick, said that
this month's snowfall has been the city's highest in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of vehicles have been involved in minor accidents with a
pile-up collision of 10 cars reported outside Saint John. There
have been no casualties.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecast is warning of surges of 2.2 meters Saturday
off the shore of Prince Edward Island. In Nova Scotia, another
wintry slap is predicted with a freezing spray, which will bring
temperature down to minus 15 degrees Celsius to minus 20.
</P>
<P>
A complex low pressure system is attributed to the hitting
blizzard, which followed Monday's Arctic storm.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak in Damascus for Talks on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
on Saturday held talks with his visiting Egyptian counterpart Hosni
Mubarak on ways of pushing the Middle East peace process forward
amid the complicated situation in the peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Information Muhammad Yousuf el-Sharif, who
accompanied Mubarak on the visit, said that the two leaders
discussed the current situation on the Arab arena and the need for
Arabs to take a collective action in dealing with the peacemaking
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that Mubarak's visit comes within the framework of
continued and sustained coordination between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Egypt became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
the Jewish state in 1979. And since then Egypt has been a key
mediator in peace negotiations between Israel, on the one hand, and
the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon, on the other.
</P>
<P>
Syria resumed its peace talks with Israel last December after a
nearly four-year suspension. But the third round of talks to have
started Wednesday in the U.S. have been postponed indefinitely due
to differences over which issues should be tackled first.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants to negotiate a full return of the Israeli-occupied
Golan Hights first while Israel prefers security arrangements and
normalization of bilateral ties precedes the Golan issue in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Golan, Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast
war and annexed it in 1981, is the core of the Syrian-Israeli
talks.

<HEADLINE> HK Official: Students Benefit From Mother Tongue Teaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- An official today defended
the Medium of Instruction policy of the Hong Kong Special
Administration Region (HKSAR), saying there are serious
misconceptions about it.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of using Chinese as the medium of
instruction (CMI) policy is to allow students to learn efficiently
in a language that they are most familiar with, and it is not
designed to enhance students' ability in Chinese, said Raymond
Young, deputy secretary for education and manpower of HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Some people are of the view that the HKSAR government's
actively promoting the use of Chinese as a medium of instruction
would mean less importance being attached to the teaching of the
English language.
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely untrue when we look at the substantial
additional resources that have been allocated to upgrading the
English language teaching and learning in Hong Kong during the
past two years," Young said.
</P>
<P>
New measures include introducing the Native English Teachers
scheme and establishing language benchmarks for all English
teachers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Young noted that many people believed that using English as
medium of instruction (EMI) always led to high English standards,
while CMI would lead to a decline in English standards.
</P>
<P>
"We agree that given the right conditions, such as teacher
capability and a genuine English-speaking environment, EMI is in
fact beneficial to the learning of the English language," he said.
</P>
<P>
But in most of the so-called 'EMI' schools in Hong Kong,
teachers were teaching with limited, and often incorrect, English.
Many of them did not even bother to use English at all, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The students, on their part, failed to understand what was
being taught, and eventually lost their interest in their studies.
As a result, not only did they suffer in terms of subject content,
they also failed to learn good English," Young said.
</P>
<P>
The Support Center for Teachers using Chinese as the Medium of
Instruction of the University of Hong Kong and the Joint Working
Group conducted two surveys respectively last year and both
surveys confirmed the positive impact of CMI teaching on students
learning, Young said.
</P>
<P>
"The use of CMI teaching could enhance students' self-learning
ability and confidence, stimulate a higher order thinking, re-
kindle students' interest and motivation in learning, improve
student-teacher relationship and activate students' participation,
" Young said.
</P>
<P>
Young also denied the reports that the government would allow
English medium secondary schools to operate classes taught in
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the proposal of applying the medium of
instruction policy to all schools across the board, Young said: "
Whilst promoting the use of the mother-tongue, we should not
disregard the fact that some schools do have the right conditions
for EMI, and EMI has not affected the effectiveness of teaching
and learning."
</P>
<P>
"If the purpose of the medium of instruction policy is to
ensure effective learning, we saw no justification to require all
EMI schools to switch to CMI schools. The community as a whole is
for retaining those schools which are effective with EMI, then we
should work together to make the system work," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Judiciary Rejects Reformist's Appeals Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative judiciary
announced on Saturday that it has turned down an appeal request of
the prominent reformist Abdollah Nouri who was jailed for
publishing articles against the Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor General Ayatollah Morteza Moqtadaei and the assistant
judges at the Supreme Court have rejected Nouri's appeal request
because the verdicts issued by the Special Cleric Court (SCC) are
not open to appeal, Moqtadaei's office said in a state
ment.
</P>
<P>
Since the legal status of the SCC is separate from that of the
public courts and the revolutionary courts, the SCC's verdicts
cannot be re-examined, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Moqtadaei underlined the legal foundation of the SCC has already
been passed by the legislative body and it will function unless the
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei decides to stop it.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, a close ally of Iranian moderate President Mohammad
Khatami, was sentenced on November 27 to five years imprisonment on
charges ranging from publishing anti-religious materials and
sacrilegious articles to insulting the late Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
His defense lawyer Mohsen Rahami last month handed over the
appeal against the verdict.
</P>
<P>
Iranian moderate factions believed that Nouri's conviction was a
step by the conservatives, who dominate most of the country's state
organs, to deprive him of running in the forthcoming
Majlis elections slated for February 18.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, former interior minister and a top vote-winner in the
first local council polling in last February, stepped down in
September from his post as the chairman of Tehran City Council with
the hope to be elected the Majlis (parliament) speaker.
</P>
<P>
Despite of being jailed, Nouri registered to run in the
sensitive parliamentary polling, which is believed to create a new
balance of power in the country. But the conservative-dominated
supervisory boards have dequalified condidacy.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Rules out Diplomatic Ties with Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Despite the presence of an
Iranian diplomatic delegation in Kabul, Iran on Saturday ruled out
the possibility of recognizing and establishing diplomatic ties
with the Afghan ruling Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Tehran regards the Afghan Islamic government headed by ousted
President Burhanuddin Rabbani as the sole legal government of
Afghanistan, said Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza
Asefi.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has controlled most of Afghanistan since ousting
Rabbani in 1996 and fightings are going on between Taliban and the
Rabbani-led United Front.
</P>
<P>
Ties between two neighbors hit the bottom in August 1998 when
nine Iranian nationals in Afghanistan, including eight diplomats
and one journalist, were killed by Taliban fighters in the northern
city of Mazare Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic of Iran, based on its national interests
and security, is following up talks with the Taliban as an Afghan
group on such topics as checking smuggling of narcotic drugs,
Afghan refugees and border security, the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IANA) quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran is serious in its talks with Taliban on
the issue of identifying and punishing agents behind the 1998
killing of Iranian diplomats and journalist in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A six-member Iranian delegation arrived in Kabul on Thursday to
hold talks with Taliban officials on trade, the first visit by an
Iranian delegation since September 1996 when Taliban ousted
Rabbani's government.
</P>
<P>
Tehran claimed that the visit to the Taliban-controlled areas
was aimed at inspecting Iranian diplomatic missions in the Afghan
capital and other cities.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties improved only after Iran opened its eastern
borders last November to allow the flow of food into Afghanistan
following the U.N. sanctions on the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservative daily Tehran Times on Wednesday quoted an
official from the Foreign Ministry as saying that Iran has its
terms and conditions for establishing ties with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"First, there should be a broad-based government in Kabul with
the participation of all ethnic and religious communities," the
official told the daily, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Asefi dismissed the report by saying that the issue of
establishing relations with the Taliban group is not included in
the agenda of the Iranian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Taliban has repeatedly announced its readiness
to talk with Iran to remove any "misunderstandings" for normal ties
with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Motawakil sent a letter
last month to Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, saying that
Taliban wants cordial ties with Iran on the basis of mutual
respect, non-interference in each other's internal affairs and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Taliban Information Minister Qudratullah Jamal on Tuesday
repeated Taliban's readiness to establish diplomatic ties with
Iran. "The Iranians can reopen their embassy in Kabul according to
diplomatic principles," he said.

SANTIAGO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian Vice President
Gustavo Novoa declared him president Saturday after a three-man
junta overthrew President Jamil Mahuad in a coup.
</P>
<P>
Deposed Mahuad has reportedly asked for political asylum in
Chile. The three-member junta, composed of a top military chief,
an Indian leader and a former judge announced the formation of an
interim government on Friday in revolt against Mahuad and his
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The junta took power late Friday after two weeks of mass
protests against the government's economic reform policies and
demanded Mahuad step down in the face of worsening economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad decided to adopt the U.S. dollar as the official
currency two weeks ago in a bid to salvage the economy. The move,
however, incurred violent protests, particularly by indigenous
people, who feared the dollarization plan would worsen their
economic woes.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Questioned in Sri Lanka for Rebel Hunt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's security forces on
Saturday questioned thousands of people just north of the capital
in their continuing search for Tamil rebels, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,000 people were detained for questioning in public
buildings and police stations in Kolonnawa, a suburb of Colombo
and in the nearby Gampaha district, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Those detainees were photographed and video filmed before being
freed, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
A large number of police and army were brought from neighboring
areas to take part in the operation which began in the early hours
of Saturday morning after enforcing a 10-hour curfew, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the curfew and search operation is to apprehend
Tamil rebels who may be hiding in the area to carry out attacks on
Colombo, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago there was a similar curfew in Colombo, during
which hundreds of ethnic Tamils were detained.
</P>
<P>
Security has been tightened around Colombo following a series
of suicide bomb attacks in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The attacks have been blamed on Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam rebels who are fighting for independence for minority Tamils
in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month one suicide bomb attack killed at least 13
people close to the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
Last month, more than 20 people were killed and President
Chandrika Kumaratunga was injured in an suicide bomb attack at an
election rally in central Colombo.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Refutes Indian Claims on LoC Firing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Saturday refuted
India's claims that 16 Pakistani soldiers had been killed in an
Indian counter-attack across the Line of Control (LoC) which
divides the two neighbors in the disputed area of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government earlier said Pakistani troops entered
Indian territory and tried to attack a post named Nidiala and
Indian troops killed six of the attackers and then, in a
retaliating action, destroyed a Pakistani post and killed 10 more.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press briefing here, Tariq Altaf, spokesman of
Pakistan's Foreign Office, said it is the Indian troops which
launched the attack first and they were inflicted with heavy
casualties.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Indian forces crossed the LoC in the
Iftikhararab sub-sector in the Chumb area on the Pakistani side
and with the force of a company launched the attack on a small and
long existing Pakistani post between the two channels of the Tawi
river at 03:25 a.m. (22:25 GMT Friday).
</P>
<P>
The Nidiala post is "many, many kilometers" away from the
Pakistani post, according to Pakistan's military spokesman Rashid
Qureshi, who was also present at the briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Indian troops used motor and other automatic weapons in the
fighting which had been intense in the morning and then abated
into sporadic firing, Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Pakistan troops fought in self-defense and repelled
the Indian attack, inflicting casualties on them.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government claimed to have lost two soldiers. "We
don't know exactly how many casualties they suffered, but no doubt
their death toll was many many more," commented Qureshi.
</P>
<P>
The two spokesmen said that two Pakistani soldiers were killed
in the fighting and five were missing.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has been the most serious conflict between the two
long-standing rivals since the Kashmiri Mujahideen (holy warriors)
evacuated from the Indian-held Kashmir in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Altaf said Pakistan will lodge a protest with the government of
India over "the flagrant aggression" and will also bring the
matter to the notice of the United Nations Military Observers
Group in Indian and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan will "continue to exercise restraint," but the
army will exercise "their right of self-defense with their well-
known sense of commitment and determination."
</P>
<P>
"We call upon India to exhibit responsibility and refrain from
aggressive action which could result in grave consequences," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the world community to "restrain India from
escalating tension in the region."

<HEADLINE> S. African Syndicate Sells Bail Warrants to Help Prisoners Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A criminal syndicate is
selling bail warrants issued by corrupt officials, resulting in
the escape of violent criminals, South African Correctional
Services spokesman Rudi Potgieter told reporters here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said Correctional Services were investigating reported cases
in which these warrants were sold to prisoners denied bail in
court for as little as 50 rand (8.3 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said criminals were returning from court and presenting
these warrants to prison officials who, after the bail was paid,
released them.
</P>
<P>
The police anti-corruption unit is currently investigating at
least two such cases.
</P>
<P>
Potgieter said prison warders could not be the only officials
involved in the scam.
</P>
<P>
He said the warrants, which have all the correct stamps and
authorization, pointed to the involvement of police and justice
officials.
</P>
<P>
Potgieter said that the first case of serious criminals getting
out using falsely issued documents had been in July last year and
that the anti- corruption unit had subsequently been
investigating.
</P>
<P>
Justice department spokesman Paul Setsetse said the department
would investigate claims. If employees were suspected of
involvement, they would be suspended immediately.

<HEADLINE> Final Ruling on Pinochet Further Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua)-- The final ruling on former
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet's release is to be further delayed
after British Home Secretary Jack Straw asked for more help in
making the decision.
</P>
<P>
Straw has written to Pinochet's lawyers and solicitors
representing Amnesty International and the Spanish government to
ask for more information, a Home Office spokeswoman said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
She said Straw wanted them to "clarify certain points in their
representations". The lawyers have been asked to provide any
further comments by 1700 GMT on Monday. But Straw had not
explained exactly what extra information he required.
</P>
<P>
"He will then make a decision as soon as possible thereafter.
But obviously he will need time to reflect on any further
information provided," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Straw has said earlier last week that he was "minded" to
release Pinochet after doctors found he was not well enough to
stand trial on charges of murder and torture.
</P>
<P>
But Straw insisted that the medical report on the health of
Pinochet should not be published
</P>
<P>
This fresh delay on Saturday is the latest in a series of
controversies that have emerged since Straw revealed that Pinochet
was unlikely to face extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the chairman of the British Medical
Association's medical ethics committee criticized Straw for
keeping the 84-year-old general's medical results secret.
</P>
<P>
A Chilean air force plane is currently waiting on a runway in
Bermuda, waiting for the call to fetch Pinochet from Britain if he
is released.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who headed Chile's military government between 1973
and 1990, is facing more than 50 lawsuits but could be entitled to
immunity as a lifelong senator.

<HEADLINE> China's Most Populous Ethnic Group Sheds Poverty (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The poverty-relief programs launched by the central and local
governments include construction of major projects in the poverty-
hit areas and improvement of infrastructure there, allocating
special funds to support development in economically-backward
areas, and encouraging economically-developed regions to aid
designated poor areas in central and western China.
</P>
<P>
In Guangxi alone, well over four billion yuan has been used in
the past five years to build highways, water conservancy
facilities and housing, to erect telephone lines in the region's
poverty-hit areas, or to help local farmers raise cattle and sheep
and grow cash crops.
</P>
<P>
World Bank loans have also been directed to the poverty-relief
program in Guangxi since 1995. Thanks to the program, 750,000 poor
people of the region now have sufficient food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, local residents living in areas with harsh natural
conditions in Guangxi have been encouraged to migrate to areas
with better conditions. Some 200,000 local poor people who
participated in the program have become better off.
</P>
<P>
In areas where water resources are scarce, more than 120,000
household water tanks, water storage ponds and water diversion
projects have been constructed, and the difficulty of obtaining
water for drinking or for irrigation in Guangxi's poverty-hit
areas has been solved.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the autonomous region has also invested a huge
sum in building roads connecting to 2,200 poor villages, and
erecting power and telecommunications transmission lines to link
the remote mountainous villages to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
China plans to pull 10 million people out of poverty this year.

<HEADLINE> China's Most Populous Ethnic Group Sheds Poverty (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Li Zhaozhuo, chairman of
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional Government, today announced
China's most populous ethnic group, the Zhuang minority, has
shaken off poverty.
</P>
<P>
Li made the announcement while delivering a government work
report at the on-going annual regional people's congress in this
capital of the southwest China region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has long concentrated on poverty relief
work and has launched numerous programs throughout the country to
help the impoverished out of their circumstances and start to lead
a prosperous life. The official poverty datum is 550 yuan (about
66.5 U.S. dollars) per annum.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the average per-capita income for Guangxi farmers is
about 1,800 yuan. The Chinese government has vowed to eradicate
poverty by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Zhuang ethnic group is an aboriginal people in areas south
of the Five Ridges covering Guangdong Province and Guangxi, but
now mainly living in Guangxi's Nanning, Bose, Hechi and Liuzhou
regions. The minority has a total population of 15 million,
equivalent to the population of the Netherlands. Some 10 million
of them were living in poverty 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
China's painstaking poverty-relief campaign has not only
improved the lives of the Zhuang people, it has also helped the
ethnic group catch up with the economically-developed coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yuansheng, of Zhuang ethnic background, is a vegetable
grower from Tianyang County, a major off-season vegetable
production base in Guangxi. Every year, more than 50,000 hectares
of vegetables are grown here, with an annual output of 1.3 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
"It is amazing that we can know vegetable prices in other major
Chinese cities without being in those places, and with the
information, we can make more money by growing the most needed
vegetables at the market," said Huang, pointing to a huge
electronic pricing display board erected in a local farmers'
market. Per-capita income of farmers in Huang's village amounted
to 2,800 yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Like Huang and his fellow Zhuang people, extremely poor
residents of other ethnic groups in Guangxi have also benefited
from the country's numerous poverty relief programs.

<HEADLINE> China Accelerates IDD Elimination With Salt Iodization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China's efforts to eliminate
iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), a major health threat of the
Chinese, have been accelerated by salt iodization.
</P>
<P>
Most of Chinese salt makers so far are able to produce and
package iodized salt, the most convenient and effective measure to
prevent IDD, according to sources of the salt industry.
</P>
<P>
Annual production capacity of iodized salt has reached 8.06
million tons, and the quality has been noticeably improved since a
national project to boost salt iodization was launched in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The industry is using advanced packaging technology to prevent
iodine added to the salt from volatilizing, and is labeling the
iodized salt for consumers' convenience.
</P>
<P>
IDD can cause mental disabilities and result in miscarriages,
pre-mature births and a lowering of intelligence in infants. IDD-
related problems have been reported throughout the country, and
over 80 percent of the nation's 10 million cases of mental
disability are a result of IDD, according to the Ministry of
Health (MOH).
</P>
<P>
China plans to eliminate IDD this year in order to respond the
World Health Organization's call for global elimination of IDD.
Ninety-five percent of the salt used by the Chinese residents
should be iodized.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 90 percent of Chinese citizens have access to
iodized salt, and the incidence rate of goiter, a common disease
cause by IDD, dropped to 10.86 percent in 1998 from 24.43 percent
in 1995, MOH statistics show.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Has No Immediate Plan to Visit Germany: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran said Saturday that President
Mohammad Khatami has no immediate plan to visit Germany, even
though the hurdle for his visit has been removed following the
release of German businessman Helmut Hofer.
</P>
<P>
"A visit to Germany is not on President Khatami's agenda at
present," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Reza Asefi
told the Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was released on Thursday after an Iranian court acquitted
him of having connection with foreigners, but ordered him to pay 20
million rials (about 6,660 U.S. dollars at the official rate, 2,380
dollars at the market rate) for "resistance to arrest" by security
guards.
</P>
<P>
The German businessman was arrested in September 1997 for an
affair with an Iranian Muslim woman and was sentenced to death in
January 1998. Iranian laws prohibit affairs between a non-Muslim
man and a Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian court in October acquitted him of adultery for
insufficient proof after the Iranian Supreme Court ordered a
retrial, as Hofer claimed that he had converted to Islam before
having an affair with the woman.
</P>
<P>
But he was jailed again in October on charges of having
connections with foreigners and insulting an Iranian prison guard.
</P>
<P>
Hofer's release, which came a day after a Berlin court gave a
light sentence to an Iranian convicted of spying on Iranian
opposition groups in Germany, was widely seen as a prelude for a
visit to Germany by President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Hofer's release, German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fisher said on Friday that the major stumbling block to better
Germany-Iran relations had been overcome and the way has now been
cleared for Khatami's visit to Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman also expressed delight over Hofer's
release and "the removal of some problems in the relations between
Iran and Germany," but he stressed that Hofer's release took place
after going through all the judicial procedures of the case and the
Iranian judiciary acted with full independence in the case.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Hofer's case has been a hurdle for a
warm-up between Iran and Germany, though both sides voiced
readiness to improve relations.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the largest trading partner of Iran, but their
relations have been strained since April 1997 after a Berlin court
accused Iranian leaders of sponsoring terrorist assassinations
against Iranian dissidents in Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is studying the
possibility of having an act to monitor the activities of
cybercafes in the country.
</P>
<P>
This is to prevent cybercafes from promoting unhealthy
activities like online gambling in their premises, Deputy Energy,
Communications and Multimedia Minister Tan Chai Ho said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We are studying whether to require all cybercafe operators to
register with the ministry so that we can at least know their
actual number," he told reporters after a function here.
</P>
<P>
"And after that we will look into the possibility of having an
act to control the operations of cybercafes.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement while commenting on newspaper reports
that police had identified 21 Internet cafes promoting electronic
gambling in the Klang Valley (Kuala Lumpur and its surrounding
areas).
</P>
<P>
Current laws requires cybercafe operators to obtain a license
from the local authorities but not the ministry, he said.
</P>
<P>
He meanwhile said the ministry had proposed to Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to lower charges for low-income earners to
promote use of the Internet among a wider cross-section of the
society.
</P>
<P>
The target group comprised low-wage earners in the rural areas
and those living in low-cost flats, he said, adding the ministry
was still waiting for feedback from ISPs on the proposal.

<P>
MAPUTO,January 22 (xinhua) -- Mozambique's main opposition
party, Renamo (Mozambican National Resistance), has decided to
transfer its headquarters from Maputo, capital of Mozambique, to
the central port city of Beira.
</P>
<P>
According to Mozambique News Agency report on Saturday, Rahil
Khan, a Renamo member of parliament, said that the change of
address had to do with "popular pressure" applied by the people of
six central and northern Mozambican provinces, where Renamo took
the majority of the vote in the December general elections,
although President Joaquim Chissano and his ruling Frelimo
(Mozambique Liberation Front) Party won a nationwide victory.
</P>
<P>
Renamo boycotted Chissano's inauguration on January 16 and
threatened to install a separate government in central and north
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique News Agency said transferring the Renamo
headquarters to Beira is clearly in line with a strategy to divide
the country.
</P>
<P>
It would also violate Mozambique's law requiring, as a
condition for legal registration, that the headquarters of all
political parties be in Maputo.

<HEADLINE> Raiqen Living Buddha Enters Traditional Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The seventh reincarnation of the
Raiqen living Buddha arrived at the Raiqen Monastery, situated in
Lhunzhub County, after traveling from the capital of the Tibet
Autonomous Region in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the two-year-old boy had seen the Raiqen
Monastery, the traditional seat of activity of the previous Raiqen
Living Buddhas, after he was officially recognized as the Seventh
Raiqen living Buddha on January 16.
</P>
<P>
The child's ordination took place in front of a statue of
Sakyamuni, known as the founder of Buddhism, inside the Johkang
Temple in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony to mark the arrival of the Seventh Raiqen Living
Buddha at the Raiqen Monastery was held on Friday in accordance
with religious rituals.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, the young living Buddha, seated facing the
crowd, performed the ritual of extending blessings to all the
lamas lined up to pass before him, who presented hadas -- silk
scarves used as a greeting gift among China's ethnic Mongolian and
Tibetan people -- and other gifts.
</P>
<P>
The formal enthronement of the little living Buddha at the
monastery will be held in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Raiqen living Buddha holds one of the highest-ranking
positions in Tibetan Buddhism. The tradition of patriotism and the
spirit to preserve the unity of the Chinese nation have long been
advocated by Raiqen living Buddhas.

<HEADLINE> mee0122 hke -- Iranian Judiciary Denies Report on Tehran Mayor's Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian judicial officials on
Saturday denied a press report on the release of former Tehran
Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, a prominent reformist jailed on
graft charges.
</P>
<P>
An informed source at the organization in charge of prison
affairs told the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) that Karbaschi
was in fact currently on prison leave.
</P>
<P>
The public relations office of Tehran province's judicial
department also denied that the former mayor has been released,
IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Fath (Conquer) reported in its Saturday issue that
Karbaschi was released Friday after serving 260 days of his prison
term.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention in what way Karbaschi, a
strong supporter of reformist President Mohammad Khatami and former
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, was freed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Karbaschi refused to ask for an
amnesty from the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the
occasion of the Eid-e Fitr on January 8, which marked the end of
the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was publicly tried on charges of graft in July 1998
and received five years in prison, a 20-year ban from holding
government posts, 60 lashes of whip and a fine of 1 billion rials
(about 160,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A Tehran appeals court later reduced his prison term to two
years and the ban to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, secretary general of the pro-reformist Party of
Constructive Executives of Iran (PCEI), was appointed the capital's
mayor by Rafsanjani in 1989 when the government started
reconstruction programs after an eight-year war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, he was accused of pocketing public fund and offering
financial support to Khatami during his 1997 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
Local dailies said that Rafsanjani, currently chairman of the
powerful arbitrate and advisory State Expediency Council, made
efforts to get Karbaschi released before the sensitive
parliamentary elections slated for February 18.
</P>
<P>
The PCEI, which was formed with Rafsanjani's assistance, has
announced to support his candidacy to run for the elections, which
will create a new power balance in the country between the
conservatives and reformists.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Three main opposition
parties in Tanzania have agreed to pick a presidential candidate
in October general elections as a strategy to oust the ruling
Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) from power.
</P>
<P>
Chairmen of the United Democratic Party (UDP), Chama Cha
Demokrasia na Maendeleo (CHADEMA) and Civic United Front (CUF)
announced the decision Friday at a joint news conference here.
</P>
<P>
John Cheyo of the UDP, Bob Makani of CHADEMA and Ibrahim
Lipumba of CUF said that the door was open for other parties to
join in a bid to strengthen the opposition.
</P>
<P>
They noted that each party would first nominate its own
presidential candidate, and the parties would later pick the best
one to run for president on behalf of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
They elaborated that the final selection would be done in line
with the nominees' experience in leadership and acceptability to
the public.
</P>
<P>
So far UDP has named John Cheyo as their presidential candidate
while CUF, the main opposition party in Zanzibar, and CHADEMA were
planning to announce their candidates soon.
</P>
<P>
The National Electoral Commission announced recently that the
second general elections would be held on October 29.
</P>
<P>
According to a timetable, the registration of voters will be
conducted between August 1 and 21 while nomination of contestants
will be made on August 13, and election campaigns between August
14 and October 28.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time in the country's post-independence
history for presidential, parliamentary and civic elections to be
held simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin William Mkapa, who is also Chairman of the
CCM, won the 1995 elections and is expected to run for his second
five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has been ruled under a single political party, the
CCM, from 1965 until 1992 when the multiparty system was
introduced.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Fashion Week
for Fall/Winter 2000 had attracted a total of 16,635 visitors, a
mild increase of 2 percent compared to the total attendance last
year, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With a wide array of upbeat designs on exhibits from 20
countries and regions, the four-day event, which ended Thursday,
had attracted 6,598 overseas buyers, said the TDC, organizer of
the fashion show.
</P>
<P>
Buying missions from the Chinese mainland, including those from
Wuhan, Dalian, Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen,
represented a full spectrum of the industry ranging from retailers,
big department stores to wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
Asian fashion stores of repute were also on the list, with
buyers from Club 21, Isola Group, Strait Approach, Glamourette and
the Metro stores from Singapore, and Seibu from Japan, the TDC
said.

financial crisis," said Christopher Cheng, chairman of the Trade
Development Council Garment Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, we are better positioned now than before," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Ministers in Iraq to Enhance Oil Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Minister of Trade,
Industry and Supply Mohammed Halayka and Minister of Energy Wael
Sabri arrived here Friday evening on a visit, the Iraqi News Agency
(INA) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two officials told the INA upon arrival that their visit
aims at enhancing trade and oil cooperation and renewing an oil
agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed an oil agreement last January under
which Baghdad agreed to supply Amman in 1999 4.8 million tons of
crude oil, of which half are free of charge and the rest at
preferential prices.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is separate from Iraqi oil exports under the U.N.-
authorized oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell limited
amount of oil for purchasing humanitarian supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq secured since 1991 all Jordan's needs for crude oil and its
derivatives after Jordan got approval from the United Nations which
allows it to continue trade exchange with Iraq in spite of the U.N.
trade embargo imposed on Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, the two countries failed to renew the oil agreement for
the year 2000 due to price differences during Iraqi Oil Minister
Amir Muhammad Rashid's visit to Amman last month.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah al-Khatib's visit to
Baghdad late last month again failed to resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Halayka described the trade relations between Iraq and Jordan as
good, despite the continuation of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammad Mehdi Salah, who received the
visiting Jordanian ministers, said that Jordan is a full partner to
Iraq in the fields of trade and economic cooperation, and that the
two sides will discuss means of expanding trade and oil cooperation
between them.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by Iraq, trade volume between Iraq
and Jordan amounted to 350 million U.S. dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Shares Japan's Concern Over Strong Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Senior financial officials from
the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations agreed
Saturday on the need for balanced global growth and voiced
concerns about the adverse effects of the yen's strength.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers and central bankers from the G-7 welcomed at
their one-day gathering in Tokyo the improving global economic
outlook in the wake of recent economic upturns in Japan and Europe.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the one-day meeting said the G-7
officials welcomed "improved prospects for non-inflationary growth
in the major industrialized economies and the world economy as a
whole."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, they called for continued policies
to maintain the improvement in the economic situation, saying that
"the challenge remains to secure a more balanced pattern of growth
among our economies that is important to sustaining the expansion.
"
</P>
<P>
Japan told its G-7 partners at the Tokyo meeting that it will
continue fiscal stimulus measures and keep interest rates
virtually at zero until recovery is entrenched.
</P>
<P>
Other G-7 members, however, urged Japan to promote structural
reforms in a bid to attain sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"Japan's economy has shown some encouraging signs of recovery,
although a sustained recovery remains to be established," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
On the strong yen, the G-7 officials said in the statement, "We
welcomed the reaffirmation by the Japanese monetary authorities of
their intention to conduct policies appropriately in view of their
concern, which we share, about the potential impact of yen
appreciation on the Japanese economy and the world economy."
</P>
<P>
Japan, believing that the stability of the currency is
indispensable for a sought-after economic recovery, had
strenuously sought the inclusion of concerns on the yen's strength.
</P>

The G-7 groups Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan
and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Reform Former Tehran Mayor Released From Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Former Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi, a reformist who has been jailed for 260 days on graft
charges, was released from prison on Friday, local daily Fath
(conquer) reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention in what way Karbaschi, a
strong supporter of President Mohammad Khatami and former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, was freed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Karbaschi refused to ask for an
amnesty from the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the
occasion of the Eid-e Fitr on January 8, which marked the end of
the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was publicly tried on charges of graft in July 1998
and received five years in prison, a 20-year ban from holding
government posts, 60 lashes of whip and a fine of one billion rials
(about 160,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A Tehran appeals court later reduced his prison sentence from
five years to two years and the period of being banned from taking
public office from 20 years to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, secretary general of the pro-reformist Party of
Constructive Executives of Iran (PCEI), was appointed the capital's
mayor by Rafsanjani in 1989 when the Iranian government started
post-war reconstruction programs.
</P>
<P>
During the 10 years of his mayoralty, the city changed its face
with new highways, parks and high-rise apartment blocks. However,
he was accused of pocketing public fund and offering financial
support to President Khatami during the 1997 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
Local dailies said that Rafsanjani, currently chairman of the
powerful arbitrate and advisory State Expediency Council, made
certain efforts to release Karbaschi from prison before the
sensitive parliamentary elections slated for February 18.
</P>
<P>
The PCEI, which was formed with Rafsanjani's assistance, has
announced to support his candidacy to run for the elections, which
will create a new power balance in the country between the
conservatives and reformists.

<HEADLINE> Greece Supports Integrity of Turkey: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou, ending a historic four-day visit to Turkey on Friday,
said his country is opposed to secession in principle and stressed
that Athens does not want a divided Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister said that while his country wants the Kurds
in Turkey to be treated better, it is strongly against the division
of Turkey and the setting up of a Kurdish state, Turkish Daily News
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has long been under criticism for its treatment of the
Kurdish people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Separatist Kurds led by the Kurdish Workers' Party has been
fighting for an independent Kurdish state in the southeast of
Turkey, which has claimed 37,000 lives in more than a decade,
mostly Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said that if secession was accepted, this would
create chaos in the Balkans where there are so many minorities. "
Every minority group would push for autonomy and independence, it
would end up in chaos and discord," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He declared,"We are never in favor of terrorism, never in favor
of the Kurdish Workers' Party, and never talk about secession."
</P>
<P>
Ankara had long accused Athens of sheltering and aiding Kurdish
separatists fighting against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said his visit to Turkey, the first official visit by
a Greek foreign minister since 1962, was a "breakthrough in
relations" between the two Aegean neighbors but added that there
was still no breakthrough in the disputes such as the issues of
Cyprus and Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Turkey sent troops to Cyprus in 1974 to suppress a short-lived
coup seeking union with Athens. It supports a breakaway Turkish
Cypriot state in northern Cyprus, which has not been recognized by
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have also been locked in territorial disputes
in the Aegean, which have led the two neighboring countries to the
brink of war three times in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Their relations, however, have improved steadily since both
sides rushed aid to each other following devastating earthquakes
last year in the two countries and Greece lifted its objection to
Turkey's European Union candidacy at the EU Helsinki summit last
December.
</P>
<P>
Greece has also agreed to possible international arbitration of
some territorial disputes if the two sides fail to solve them by
the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister said he felt that the continuation of current
peace process and the confidence-building measures would help
settle these disputes.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the two sides signed four cooperation
agreements concerning tourism, investment, environment and
combatting crime as moves to build confidence between them.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Turkey's EU membership bid, Papandreou said that
Greece would be capable of helping Turkey with its accession. "Our
problems at that time were similar to those of Turkey today. As the
nearest country to Turkey, we can allow it to benefit from our
experience."
</P>
<P>
Papandreou had paid an unofficial visit to Turkey last October.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Wildcard Tempered in Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MELBOURNE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese wildcard Yi Jingqian
lost a third-round match at the Australian Open but won the
confidence to rank higher in the world.
</P>
<P>
Yi's dream run at the prestigious tournament was brought to an
end by American Jennifer Capriati, bowing out 6-4, 6-4 at
Melbourne Park on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old, who beat Capriati in the 1996 French Open, did
not conceal her disappointment.
</P>
<P>
"I feel quite sorry. I hate myself for losing the deserved
points,"said Yi.
</P>
<P>
"My ground strokes were not bad at all, but my service failed
to be dangerous for the windy conditions, and I lost my touch at
the crucial stages of the match." she added.
</P>
<P>
Yi did not dwell on the loss, stressing that she had learned a
lot from the loss and the star-studded Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot from the match against Capriati. She set a
good example in her ability to win key points and convert chances
to scoring," Yi said.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile I had enhanced my confidence by playing world tennis
elite. I am upbeat to win higher ranking and will be more self-
confident when I meet excellent players.
</P>
<P>
"Comparatively speaking, my serve is weaker and slower, and I
need to be better in handling key points. But in other respects I
am as good as them," said Yi, who currently rate 141st in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Yi has reached her career high by making the third round of the
tournament where she fell at the first hurdle in the previous
three attempts.
</P>
<P>
After the Aussie Open, she will go to the United States for
three international tournaments in as many weeks.
</P>
<P>
"My aim this year is just to win ranking points as possible as
I could to make preparation for the Olympic Games," Yi said.
</P>
<P>
Her commitment to tennis has won thumbs-up from her personal
coach Jeff King.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Yi is somebody who possess natural ability and
strong determination," said the American who began to coach Yi in
the summer of 1999 at the invitation of the Chinese Tennis
Association.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Chinese tennis players possess a great work ethic
and fierce determination. Those attributes coupled with the
flexibility to play on all court surfaces, as well as a wide array
of shot selection, will further more player in the future," King
added.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Vice President Receives Charlton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's Vice-President,
Professor John Atta Mills, on Friday received England soccer
legend, Sir Bobby Charlton, in Accra and tasked him to develop the
sport in Sub-Saharan Africa, citing player transfer as one major
headache that needed to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
"You should be able to help us streamline the rules to give
proper care and protection to those players going out there. We
must make sure that they have a good contract and are treated well,
" Vice President Mills told Charlton who is in Ghana as head of
England 2006 World Cup Committee, to solicit for Africa's four
votes.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Mills conceded that the agents who work out these player
transfers have also not been doing their homework well.
</P>
<P>
"It is their responsibility to ensure that the agreements are
sealed on perfect conditions."
</P>
<P>
He expressed gratitude to the veteran player for also showing
interest in Ghanaian soccer and assured him that his efforts will
make the sport grow from strength to strength.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Mills, an ardent sports fan, expressed the
determination of Ghanaians to come out tops in the African Cup
tournament being co-hosted by Ghana and Nigeria from January 22 to
February 13.
</P>
<P>
"Ghana is determined to win. We have done our best to rally
behind the team, and it is now left to the players," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sir Bobby Charlton said he was happy that Ghana is a co-host of
the tournament and expressed his desire to be in the Nigerian
commercial capital, Lagos for the finals, if Ghana gets there.
Charlton said he agrees with Prof Mills that African players on
transfer must be respected.
</P>
<P>
He presented a Manchester United jersey to Vice President Mills,
a keen supporter of the English team.
</P>
<P>
Later in an interview, Charlton restated England's bid to host
the 2006 World Cup saying, the country has all, if not more, what
it takes to do it.

<P>
England, Brazil, South Africa, and Morocco are the other
bidders to host the 2006 tournament.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Come out with Age Limit for Player Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- World soccer chief Joseph Sepp
Blatter said in Accra on Friday that his outfit would soon come
out with an age limit to control young African players from being
transferred abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said the world soccer ruling body FIFA would also ensure
that local clubs benefit from the onward transfer of such players.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA president, who was addressing a press conference, said
the fight against player exodus is a worldwide problem but Africa
's case is peculiar because in most cases the first clubs of the
players do not benefit much, especially when they become world
class stars.
</P>
<P>
He called for player-education particularly at the grassroots
level and also to make the local leagues very attractive by
seeking for sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
"By doing so, value is added to the players and this will also
make the local leagues very interesting, he said."
</P>
<P>
Blatter also touched on a variety of subjects, including
professional refereeing which, he stressed, is very important for
the beauty of the game.
</P>
<P>
He said in order not to destroy the human face of the game and
thus "kill" its passion, the issue of good refereeing needs to be
tackled by all.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said most African countries, have perceived that
referees were against them winning the World Cup, adding "the
rumor is quite sad but I would ensure that there is fairness in
officiating."
</P>
<P>
Blatter promised African countries, which would be
participating in the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea, of a
better environment to brighten their chances of winning the cup.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of rotation, he said Europe, America and Asia have
all had their chances to host the World Cup and that it is now
time for Africa's turn.
</P>
<P>
He said he would continue to drum up the need for the World Cup
to be rotated at FIFA next Executive Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Blatter also reiterated the need to harmonize the world soccer
calendar for fewer matches to be played and to improve the quality
of the game.
</P>
<P>
He said he would contact the CAF president, Issa Hayatou, so
that in the near future the first five best teams in the Cup of
Nations would automatically qualify for the World Cup.

<HEADLINE> International Arbitration Law Adopted in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Grand National Assembly
(parliament) approved a bill Friday night over the implementation
of international arbitration aimed to boost inflow of international
funds to finance the country's large construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The new law, pending endorsement of President Suleyman Demirel
before going into effect, will also apply retroactively to
previously sealed privatization contracts, reported Turkish Daily
News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies interested in investing or providing financing
for Turkish power projects have long appealed to the Turkish
authorities to adopt a constitutional amendment to allow
international arbitration in settling economic and trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish parliament agreed last August to make amendments to
the constitution regarding international arbitration. An
implementation law was passed late 1999 which allows international
arbitration for all contracts signed after the law was enacted.
</P>
<P>
As the new law will be retroactive, ongoing power projects,
particularly those based on the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model,
will also face international arbitration in case of disputes.
</P>
<P>
The move was widely welcomed by Turkish business circles and
foreign diplomatic bodies in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Uzeyir Garih, chairman of the Turkish business conglomerate
Alarko Holding, expressed satisfaction with the new
legislation.  "International arbitration is effective around
the world," he told the English language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has been late in clearing international arbitration,"
said Zafer Caglayan, chairman of the Ankara Chamber of Industry.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investors seek a secure environment when making an
investment decision. And international arbitration is the key to
that secure environment and will also build appetite in them toward
Turkey's sell-off schemes," he added.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the bill of arbitration law, a United States Embassy
official told the paper, "We applaud these initiatives. It is a
very important step that will help open the door to an inflow of
capital investments."

<HEADLINE> Sudan Frees More Ugandan Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government has
freed six more Ugandan children from rebel captivity as a further
move to implement the Nairobi peace accord signed by the two
countries in December last year.
</P>
<P>
The exercise of collecting the captives from rebels of the
Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) spearheaded by Joseph Kony is still
going on. Those already rescued from captivity would be
repatriated in a couple of days, Saturday's New Vision daily
quoted State Minister for Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi as
saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
By Friday evening, a total of 22 Ugandans had been freed and
more were coming, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandans were handed over by Khartoum government to the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the International Red
Cross.
</P>
<P>
ON Wednesday, Sudan handed over the first batch of 16 captives
 including four children who had been held by LRA rebels based in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
international humanitarian agencies estimated that over 5,000
children aged between five and 18 are missing as a result of
rebel incursions into northern Uganda. They were abducted by LRA
rebels to either reinforce the rebel forces or to be forced into
concubines.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the freed Ugandans would be resettled in
Gulu where UNICEF and World Vision International are managing
rehabilitation centers.
</P>
<P>
Under the Nairobi accord signed in last December, both
countries should stop backing each other's rebels to push for
normalization of bilateral relations. Uganda freed the last batch
of 72 Sudanese prisoners of war early this month.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Khartoum and Kampala were severed in April
1995, with both sides accusing each other of backing rebel
activities on their respective soil.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian President Calls for Support for Cote d'Ivoire New Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's President Jerry Rawlings
has appealed to the international community to support Cote
d'Ivoire, where the military government that ousted President
Henri Konan Bedie in December is trying to set a time-table on
the restoration of democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
The Pan African News Agency (PANA) quoted him as saying in
Accra that it could "get worse if the international community does
not lend its mind, heart and ear of understanding about events in
Cote d'Ivoire".
</P>
<P>
Rawlings made the appeal after a visit to Accra Thursday by the
 new Ivorian leader, Gen. Robert Guei.
</P>
<P>
The visit was to enable Gen. Guei to explain what he termed "
the recent painful events in Cote d' Ivoire" and to express
gratitude to Ghana for its understanding. Rawlings stressed the
need to assist the new government to stabilize and to work toward
an effective and efficient electoral process demanded by all.
</P>
<P>
Guei appealed to the international community to be more patient
while his administration put certain measures in place before
handing power back to civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Ivorian New leader declined to say when he would hand over
to an elected government, saying the situation now demanded time
for diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
He added that there was the need to review the constitution to
remove clauses that inhibited some Ivorians from participating in
national affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said a move to civilian authority was not a problem, adding
that "we will strive to do that as soon as possible by giving a
time-frame for the transition."

Of late, LRA and ADF rebels launched a wave of rampaging

a warning similar to that in a document issued following the last
such meeting. Many Japanese currency market participants said the
yen will rise sharply from the current level of around 105 to the
dollar and could break 100 if the G-7 statement does not clearly

<HEADLINE> Russia Tests New Fighter-Bomber in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military is
conducting in Chechnya combat trials of a new fighter plane, which
has no analogues in the world, reported the Itar-Tass news agency
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The new plane is the multipurpose SU-27 IB, which has two
modifications -- SU-34 and SU-32 FM, and no other country in the
world has a plane of this class, the Itar-Tass quoted the staff of
the Russian Combined Forces in the North Caucasus as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plane was designed on the basis of the SU-27 plane. It is
fitted with new AL-41 engines with the changeable traction vector,
new arms and on-board avionics. The cockpit for the crew of the
plane is a titanium capsule, which is capable of protecting the
pilots against enemy fire on small and very small altitudes.
</P>
<P>
The military believes that the SU-27 IB planes may be used most
effectively in the highland part of Chechnya. The air force is
playing the key role there, because artillery and tanks are not
very effective for hitting hidden targets.

<HEADLINE> Snow Again in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Four expressways and national
highways in the Chinese capital were closed to traffic today,
because of snowfall last night.
</P>
<P>
They are the expressways connecting Beijing to Tanggu of
Tianjin and to the Great Wall at Badaling, as well as the 108 and
109 national highways, according to the Beijing Municipal Highway
Transport Administration. The expressways to the Capital
International Airport and Shijiazhuang, capital of neighboring
Hebei Province, are still open to traffic.
</P>
<P>
Capital International Airport is well prepared for last night's
snowfall and different kinds of equipment were used today to clear
away the snow.
</P>
<P>
The snow has driven up the number of road accidents. After the
snowfall, many policemen were sent to patrol on the road and
handle road accidents in time. On major roads, salted water was
sprayed to help melt the snow.
</P>
<P>
It is forecast that it will blow fresh breeze in Beijing
tomorrow and the day after it and the temperature will keep
dropping.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological specialists said that frequent snows in Beijing
this winter are closely related to the climatic phenomenon of "La
Nina," which is in contrast with the climatic phenomenon "El Nino,
" and causes a descent in temperatures.
</P>
<P>
They said the snow is conducive to preserving moisture for
winter crops like wheat, but it is of little importance in
alleviating drought in Beijing, said the specialists.

Twenty-two aircraft, including helicopters of the Philippine
Air Force, and nine vessels from the Philippine Navy will be
involved in the war games, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Americans will bring in 18 planes and helicopters,
including the sophisticated Apache helicopter gunships and one
long-range Orion reconnaissance plane, and two transport ships,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Reyes sad the objective of the maneuver is to improve the

American forces.
</P>
<P>
Exercise Balikatan was suspended in 1995 because of the absence
of a Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Senate approved the VFA last May, paving the way
for the resumption of the joint air-land-sea exercise.
</P>
<P>
But many Filipinos staged demonstrations against the approval
of the VFA and the resumption of the Philippine-U.S. joint war
games.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Banks Freeze Abacha Accounts Worth 645 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Swiss banks have frozen accounts
worth 645 million U.S. dollars belonging to the late Nigerian
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha and his associates.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Federal Office of Police Affairs announced the freeze on
Friday in Bern, Swiss capital.
</P>
<P>
The amount cited by the office was 94 million dollars more than
the figure disclosed a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The office said it is awaiting reports from banks that may
identify more accounts belonging to Abacha associates outside his
immediate family.
</P>
<P>
The office also announced that it had approved a Nigerian
government request for judicial assistance in its investigation
of allegations that Abacha, who died in June 1998, systematically
plundered the Nigerian Central Bank and hid the money in overseas
bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
Swiss authorities first ordered the freeze of Abacha's accounts
last October following a provisional request from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Investigating judge Georges Zecchin said last month that around
120 accounts containing 551 million dollars had been frozen at
banks in Geneva and Zurich.
</P>
<P>
A government lawyer said earlier this week that Nigeria is also
 preparing legal moves to investigate Abacha's possible assets in
Luxembourg, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Abacha's five-year rule ended suddenly in June 1998 after the
former dictator died of an apparent heart attack.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Calls for Assistance in AIDS Fighting in Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Top Kenyan education official
has requested the international community to assist it in raising
11 million shillings (about 160,000 U.S.dollars) to implement the
HIV/AIDS awareness courses in schools in the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times newspaper Saturday quoted the Education
Minister Stephen Musyoka as saying that the money would be used to

In early December 1999, Kenya launched a national anti-AIDS
strategy which included compulsory education of AIDS risks in all
Kenyan schools starting from the year 2000.

<P>
Musyoka said that the syllabus about AIDS courses has been sent
to all primary schools, secondary schools and colleges.
</P>

Around 20 percent of Kenyan youngsters aged between 14 to 17
are HIV- positive, according to a recent report by the ministry.

NAIROBI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A middle-aged man masquerading
as a Nairobi bomb blast victim in a bid to solicit money has been
arrested by police in Kenya's indian ocean port Mombasa.

reading that he was a 1998 blast victim," Police said.
</P>
<P>
The police officers confronted the man and after the bandages
were untied he was found to be as fit as fiddle, according to
police.

The racket of the man was first disclosed in local media last
June, but he was at large until the arrest.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Denies Blocking Arrest of Key Suspects in Zanzibar Treason Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian government has
denied the Zanzibar Attorney General's accusation that it blocks
the arrest of key elements in a treason trial, local newspapers
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Home Affairs Ali Ameir Mohamed said on Friday that
the Judiciary has full autonomy to conduct the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came just days after the Zanzibar chief prosecutor,
Ali Mohamed Omar, claimed that the government blocked the arrest
of the Civic United Front (CUF) Secretary General, Seif Shariff
Hamad, and Vice-Chairman, Shaaban Mloo, two prime suspects in the
treason trial.
</P>
<P>
The minister denied that politics was being played behind the
scene of the treason trial, challenging Omar to announce the names
of government leaders allegedly involved in the trial.
</P>
<P>
Earlier 71-year-old Omar said that his office would not
prosecute the case until the government granted permission for the
arrest of the pair and eight other suspects.
</P>
<P>
He said his office would ask the High Court to adjourn future
hearings of the trial indefinitely until the police arrested the
two CUF leaders over their alleged plot to overthrow of the
Zanzibar government.
</P>
<P>
The second hearing of the case is expected next Thursday after
its first hearing Wednesday saw fierce clashes between police and
rioters. At least 29 people including 14 policemen were injured
and some 40 others were arrested during the clash.
</P>
<P>
All the 18 CUF members, who have been under detention for more
than two years, pleaded not guilty to the treason charges.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zanzibar Revolutionary Government has also
denied delaying proceedings of the trial.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar State House spokesman Hafidhi Ali told a news
conference Friday that the Zanzibar government had neither
received any request for the arrest of the two CUF leaders nor
blocked the police from arresting them.

<HEADLINE> Coup Leader Forms Interim Government in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's former military chief
and coup leader Carlos Mendoza announced the formation of an
interim government on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Besides Mendoza himself, the new government also includes two
civilian members, who are Antonio Vargas, leader of an Indian
federation that organized Friday's protests, and Carlos Solorzano,
a former Supreme Court judge.
</P>
<P>
Regarding corruption elimination and poverty reduction as the
major targets of the new government, Mendoza also announced three
decisions which were to oust President Jamil Mahuad, to hold a new
election and not to punish those who participated in the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad, who was elected as president in July, 1998, has been
arrested and detained at a military base in Quito, the capital of
the country, and the interim government will decide his fate, said
an official from the new government.
</P>
<P>
Groups of Ecuadorian Indians and of other ethnic and social
background on Friday took the National Congress building, with the
support of a group of young armed forces members, to protest
against the government's economic policies and to demand the
dissolution of the three branches of state power.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Reigning champion Yevgney
Kafelnikov continued his march toward a second Australian Open
title at the Melbourne Park Saturday with a straight-sets third-
round victory.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov beat Austrian Stefan Koubek 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Koubek rarely troubled the second-seeded Russian, who made a
slow start to the championship.
</P>
<P>
But in his past two matches, Kafelnikov has indicated his
preparation has been well-timed.
</P>
<P>
He is also being assisted by some gaping holes in his half of
the draw.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov would not meet a highly-ranked player until at least
the semi-finals where, on current form, his opponent may well be
Australia's Lleyton Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
The only other seeds left in Kafelnikov's half of the draw are
Germany's Nicolas Kiefer (4) and Magnus Norman (12) of Sweden.

control."
</P>

On the situation in South Asia, Zhu said that China sincerely
hopes Pakistan and India would practically implement the United

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Faces Diesel Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The shortage of diesel hit
critical levels in Harare and other parts of Zimbabwe, forcing
motorists to queue for long hours at the few service stations
still selling the fuel.
</P>
<P>
There has been no diesel at many of the service stations in
Harare and surrounding areas for almost a week.
</P>
<P>
At some garages, police were reportedly controlling motorists
scrambling for diesel, which has been in short supply for nearly
a month.
</P>
<P>
The Herald newspaper on Saturday quoted spokesman for the oil
industry Tom Walter said in Harare on Friday that the current fuel
crisis has been precipitated by unsustainable low-level pump
prices over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
This has also been coupled with the current high-level interest
rates, high inflation and low foreign currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe's foreign exchange inflows were at minimal
levels and export earnings were not meeting import commitments,
resulting in a foreign currency deficit.
</P>
<P>
He said that diesel imports have been delayed, making the
supply situation extremely critical and petrol stocks would reach
critical levels shortly in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The next few weeks are going to be difficult for everyone," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov Wins Australian Open Third Rounder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Yevgeny
Kafelnikov beat Austrian Stefan Koubek 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in the third
round of the Australian Open in Melbourne on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, seeded second, put up a convincing display of
aggression and precision to overcome Koubek, a 23-year-old left-
hander whose best results have been on clay.
</P>
<P>
The Russian cruised through the first two sets in 52 minutes
and then grabbed an important break of serve in the opening game
of the final set.
</P>
<P>
Koubek, playing in only his fifth Grand Slam tournament, double-
faulted to give Kafelnikov two break points and then clubbed a
backhand long to surrender the serve.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Russian sealed a comfortable win in 82 minutes,
with the retractable roof over Melbourne Park's center court
closed after rain stopped play on outside courts.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov is hoping to become the eighth man in the Open era
of tennis to win back-to-back Australian titles. The last to do so
was American Jim Courier in 1992-93.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Prevent Rivers From Losing  Navigability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Procurement of Dredging
Equipment Project has been approved by the Executive Committee of
the National Economic Council in order to prevent most rivers from
losing navigability, newspapers here reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey, nearly 24,000 kilometers of
riverways have been blocked by silt in Bangladesh. River experts
noted that all the rivers in the country may lose navigability in
less than two decades if there was no improvement in the existing
dredging system.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the land water transport sector said that lack of
skilled manpower and dredgers, negligence of the authorities
concerned and financial difficulties had created the crisis in the
country's dredging system.
</P>
<P>
This situation will result in an adverse impact on the
agriculture, fishery, water transportation and environment sectors
of the country, said experts.
</P>
<P>
The committee proposed to seek funds required for the
implementation of the projects relating to river training, river
management and navigability maintenance, to increase the number of
dredgers through procurement of new ones, and to set up a training
institute to create adequate skilled manpower for proper operation
and maintenance of the dredgers.

<HEADLINE> Japan Calls for Support to Stabilize Yen in G-7 Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan called for support from
other countries in the Group of Seven (G-7) to support its bid to
curb the yen's recent strength in the one-day G-7 meeting held in
Tokyo Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Japan believed the stability of the currency is indispensable
for a sought-after economic recovery. Therefore, Japan wanted to
include another warning against the dangers of an excessively high
yen in a G-7 communique expected to be released after the meeting,
a warning similar to that in a document issued following the last
such meeting.
</P>
<P>
Many Japanese currency market participants said the yen will
rise sharply from the current level of around 105 to the dollar
and could break 100 if the G-7 statement does not clearly express
concern about the high-flying yen.
</P>
<P>
At the gathering, the first of its kind in Japan, the financial
leaders of G-7 are expected to agree the global economic situation
has improved, G-7 officials said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has led the world economy with its
exuberant growth in the past eight years, is expected to renew its
call on Japan and Europe to continue to stimulate their economies
to bring about more balanced growth globally.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, in talks with
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Friday, said Japan ought
to continue its aggressive fiscal and monetary policies to help
support the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Sky-high U.S. stock prices and the impact on the global economy
from their possible plunge, as well as the weakening euro, will
also be discussed at the G-7 gathering.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 groups Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan
and the United States.

<P>
YANGON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's Ministry of
Information Friday presented seven motion picture golden statuette
awards for 1998 to the country's artists, the New Light of Myanmar
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The seven awards include best film, best film-director, best
actor and actress, best supporting actress, best cameraman and
best script.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Information Minister Major-General Kyi Aung told the
presentation ceremony that 15 movies were released in 1998, up
from 11 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the development of the film industry in 1998
was not significant compared with 1995 and 1996 when 30 and 25
movies were released respectively.
</P>
<P>
He called for efforts to produce classical movies with a view
to uplifting Myanmar films to meet the international standard.
</P>
<P>
He warned people against being engaged in production business
without license and distributing video features abroad on their
own, saying punishment will be meted out to them in accordance
with the country's related laws promulgated since 1996.
</P>
<P>
There are now a total of 11,112 licensed video parlors in
Myanmar, he said, adding that 39 of the 630 Myanmar video features
produced in 1998 were banned and a total of 81 foreign films were
screened that year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar formed the Motion Picture Promotion and Scrutiny Board
in 1952 and set up the Motion Picture Association in 1989 and a
motion picture museum in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Officer Leaves for U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of
General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), left
here this morning for the United States to attend the third
defensive consultations between defense departments of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first official contact between high-ranking
officers of the two countries since the U.S.-led NATO's bombing of
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade last May, marking the restoration
of high-level exchanges between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, both sides are expected to exchange views on
relations between the two countries and the two armed forces as
well as other issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state of China and the U.S. decided to establish a
regular consultation mechanism in 1997, when Chinese President
Jiang Zemin visited the U.S. The two defense authorities held two
consultations in 1997 and 1998, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The third Sino-U.S. defense consultation was supposed to be
held in the second half of 1999. The Chinese government, however,
decided to postpone the high-level military exchanges between the
two countries, because of the embassy bombing on May 8, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. relations have improved since President Jiang and U.S.
President Bill Clinton had a successful meeting in Auckland, New
Zealand, last September. The negotiations on China's entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO) ended in success, and the two
countries reached an agreement on the compensation of the
casualties and property losses during the embassy bombing.

<HEADLINE> S'pore to Subsidize On-the-job Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government is
prepared to subsidize on-the-job training to the tune of 90
million Singapore dollars (54 million U.S. dollars) in the next
five years, the local Business Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The daily said Finance Minister Richard Hu made the
announcement Friday night at the awards dinner for Singapore's top
1,000 companies and top 500 small and medium-sized enterprises (
SME) in terms of turnover.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the new plan aims to train half a million workers
through structured on-the-job training programs by 2005, as part
of the government's push for a better skilled workforce.
</P>
<P>
The training subsidy will be released from the Skills
Development Fund (SDF), and works out to 180 Singapore dollars (
108 U.S. dollars) per worker for the half-million targeted,
according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The government will work with companies in each industry to
develop blueprints for industry-wide on-the-job training, paying
up to 90 percent of this bill, Hu was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new plan is part of the Manpower 21 plan and will be
implemented as part of the National Skills Recognition System,
under which workers get certification when they acquire skill-sets.
</P>
<P>
On-the-job training was first launched as a national initiative
in 1993, with a target of training 100,000 workers by the year
2000. By the end of last year, some 330,000 workers had gone
through the programs, according to the newspaper.

percent of the population have been victims of a crime, either a
robbery, kidnapping, attempted homicide or other forms of violence.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics from law enforcement institutions, the
researchers said that most of these victims were women, while 48
percent were aged between 35 and 40.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that only 20 to 30 percent of the cases
were registered with the authorities, as most of the victims
feared retaliation and distrusted law enforcement organs because
of widespread corruption.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo's Banned Ethnic Albanian Armed Group Reorganized, Changes Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The illegal Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA), an armed group of extremist ethnic Albanians, was
formally reorganized into the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) at the
United Nations' mission building in Kosovo on Friday, Tanjug news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony presided over by U.N. top administrator in Kosovo
Bernard Kouchner and German General Klaus Reinhardt, commander of
the international peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR), 44 former
KLA commanders were sworn in as new KPC commanders.
</P>
<P>
The KLA's former political leader Hashim Thaci said at the
ceremony that the mission of the KPC, which consists of 5,000
former KLA soldiers, is to protect Kosovo's territory and serve as
"the backbone of the future Albanian troops in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244, the illegal
KLA should have been disbanded before September 19, 1999. But on
September 20, KFOR announced that the KLA would be reorganized
into the KPC.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures released by Yugoslavia, 350,000
non-Albanian residents have been driven out of Kosovo, 793
civilians killed, 50,000 civilian houses and over 80 churches
destroyed by terrorists since KFOR entered Kosovo on June 12 ,1999.

<HEADLINE> OAS Urged to Hold Extraordinary Session on Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The governments of
Colombia, the United States, Mexico and Chile made an urgent
request on Friday that the Organization of American States (OAS)
hold an extraordinary meeting immediately on the ongoing political
crisis in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto
announced the appeal in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, saying that
due to the serious situation in the neighboring country, it is
urgent to call a meeting of the OAS Permanent Council.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, thousands of Indian demonstrators protesting
economic policies introduced recently by Ecuadorian President
Jamil Mahuad took control of the parliament building with the help
of an army unit of about 50 men.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Ecuador's armed forces General Carlos Mendoza
afterwards asked Mahuad to resign in order to avert a "social
uprising," but was refused by Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech, Mahuad accused the military of
attempting a coup, saying: "If this is a military coup which wants
to take power by force, gentlemen, take power by force. I will
fulfill my duties until the last moment."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, President Mahuad announced dollarization of
Ecuador's economy in a bid to pull the country out of a deep
economic crisis, which met strong opposition at home.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad took office in August 1998.

CARACAS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government on
Friday appealed for financial assistance from the international
community to help rebuild the areas devastated by floods in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
The government said that it has not enough resources to rebuild

some 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Valero said that Venezuelan
officials will meet with representatives of the European Union,
the United Nations and multilateral financial organizations in
Madrid on February 21 to seek foreign financing to the devastated
zones.
</P>
<P>
Based on preliminary estimates, the reconstruction needs about

<HEADLINE> Italian Mafiosos Receive life Imprisonment for Bomb Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A court in Italy's central city of
Florence added life imprisonment to the jail terms of top Mafia
bosses Salvatore Riina and Giuseppe Graviano after finding them
guilty of a wave of bomb attacks in 1993 in a supplementary trial
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The verdict essentially identified Riina as the mastermind, and
Graviano the organizer of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attacks in Florence, Rome and Milan left 10 dead and
95 injured with damage of millions of U.S. dollars to priceless
historic monuments, Italian news agency ANSA reported.
</P>
<P>
One bomb exploded in an alleyway behind the Uffizi gallery in
Florence, and another gutted an ancient church by the Forum in
Rome.
</P>
<P>
The main trial, which ended on June 6, 1998, handed down 14
life-sentences and a number of shorter jail terms against the bomb
attackers.
</P>
<P>
The recipients of the 14 life sentences from the main trial
included Bernardo Provenzano and Matteo Messina Denaro, two of the
top Mafia bosses long and still being sought by the police.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Exports Grow Sharply in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Mexico exported goods worth
135 billion U.S. dollars last year, up 18 billion dollars, or 15.5
percent, compared with 1998, newspaper reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting General Director of the Foreign Trade Bank (Banacomext)
Enrique Vilatela Riba, the reports said that Mexico has now become
the world's eighth largest exporter.
</P>
<P>
According to Banco de Mexico (central bank) estimates,
manufactured goods made up 90 percent of all exports in 1999 with
oil sales around 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Vilatela said that exports account for almost a third of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) while the export-oriented
manufacturing industry employs 40 percent of the nation's labor
force.
</P>
<P>
Despite outstanding momentum, Vilatela said, trade growth is
expected to slightly taper off in 2000 as Mexico's export-driven
growth is fundamentally volatile and still over-dependent on North
American markets.
</P>
<P>
As the second largest trading partner of the United States,
Mexico is sensitive to any change in its northern neighbor's
economy.
</P>
<P>
However, Vilatela noted that the recently signed trade deal
between Mexico and the European Union should help the country to
diversify its markets.
</P>
<P>
Mexico kicked off its export boom after joining the North
American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada in
1994.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sports Council to Maintain Training Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) Chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar would maintain the
structural organization of officials until 2002, KONI vice
chairman Arie Sudewo said.
</P>
<P>
"Wismoyo insists on having the same organization until the 2002
Asian Games in Pusan, South Korea. However, he wants to see
national athletes' achievements in the 2001 SEA (Southeast Asian)
Games," Arie was quoted by the Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arie was appointed the country's Olympic training director
early this week, while Wismoyo leads the training project. Both
are responsible for training programs for the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney in September and the 2001 SEA Games in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
KONI will start its centralized training program on February 1.
</P>
<P>
Wismoyo will be responsible for the national contingent's
achievements in both events to the government and people.
</P>
<P>
Arie said KONI would not set up a special team to seek
financial support.
</P>
<P>
"KONI will be in charge of raising funds for training
preparations," he said, adding that the council would continue
asking for a 4.9 billion rupiah (671,000 U.S. dollars) budget from
the government.
</P>
<P>
KONI estimated that it would need a total of 6.9 billion rupiah
for preparations. It received 2 billion rupiah in donations from
the Gelora Senayan Management Board.
</P>
<P>
KONI aims to better its athletes' achievements in the Olympics
and reclaim the overall champion title in the 2001 SEA Games. In
the 1999 SEA Games in Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia finished third
after Thailand and Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants Kashmir Solution Acceptable to All  Parties: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- United States Assistant
Secretary of State for South Asia Karl Inderfurth Friday urged
India and Pakistan to find a solution to the Kashmir dispute,
which would be acceptable to them as well as to the people of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press briefing here at the end of his two-day
visit to Pakistan, Inderfurth expressed his deep concern over the
current tension between the two nuclear-capable neighbors.
</P>
<P>
During the talks with Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervez
Musharraf and other officials, "we expressed our deep concern
about the current tension in South Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to urge both Pakistan and India to exercise
maximum restraint, to enter into negotiations" and find a "
solution which is acceptable to both parties and in respect of
Kashmir, we believe to the Kashmiri people."
</P>
<P>
He noted that U.S. President Bill Clinton had said he would "
play an active role in starting such negotiations between the two
parties."
</P>
<P>
The United States can always "be helpful" if there are proper
conditions and "both parties agree that we should play a role",
said Inderfurth.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on the recent hijacking of an Indian
airliner, he said: "Of course that was discussed. It is a matter
of great concern to all."
</P>
<P>
He said the next step was to find the hijackers and to bring
them to justice.
</P>
<P>
"We received assurances from the government of Pakistan they
have every intention to undertake such a mission if they come
across the hijackers they would be brought to justice."
</P>
<P>
On his talks with the Pakistani leadership and senior officials,
Inderfurth said each of the meetings was "very useful exchange to
better understand not only our concerns" but "the steps that have
been envisioned to address these concerns."
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the press briefing, Inderfurth underlined
the key issues which he took up during his talks with the
Pakistani leadership and senior officials.
</P>
<P>
One of the issues is "the need for cooperation to reduce the
threat of terrorism which stems from this region and directly
threatens the United States and Pakistan as well as the region and
the world."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy also stressed the need for "a comprehensive
roadmap with milestones for the return to democratic civilian rule
as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
He also urged Pakistan and India to keep regional stability,
prevent an arms race in South Asia, and restore "a productive
dialogue" between them.
</P>
<P>
Inderfurth was the first senior U.S. official to visit Pakistan
since the military takeover in October last year.

LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Irish Foreign Minister David
Andrews said on Friday that he planned to step down from his post
next week.
</P>

statement issued in Dublin, the Irish capital.
</P>
<P>
Andrews, 66, said he would resign as foreign minister on
Wednesday but serve out his term as member of parliament until the
general election.
</P>
<P>
"I know that a new era has opened for all Irish people. It is
now for younger people, of all traditions, to seize the
opportunity and to move it on," Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said he would not be contesting the next general

Ireland's international profile, particularly in signing the
country up to NATO's Partnership for Peace program, driving

campaign for a temporary seat on the United Nations Security
Council.

<HEADLINE> Coventry Signs Zuniga and Zevallos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Coventry have again looked
abroad to strengthen their squad by signing Peruvian
internationals Israel Zuniga and Walter Zevallos from Melgar in a
combined 1.5 million pounds deal on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The pair have signed just 24 hours after the Sky Blues
completed the permanent move to Highfield Road of Belgium Under-21
striker Cedric Roussel for 1.2 million pounds from Ghent.
</P>
<P>
Zuniga, the current holder of the South American Golden Boot,
and Zevallos will link up with Coventry next month.
</P>
<P>
It is 23-year-old Zuniga who has been creating all the
headlines in Peru with 32 goals in 26 games in his first full
season with Melgar.
</P>
<P>
He has already won eight full caps for his country and was also
a target for leading clubs in Italy and South America.
</P>
<P>
Zuniga will need to obtain a work permit to play in England but
the same obstacle will not confront wing-back Zevallos, who has a
Spanish passport and will be able to go straight into action at
Highfield Road.
</P>
<P>
Zevallos has also been creating a big impression in South
America and has been capped by Peru.

<HEADLINE> Arsenal to Keep Overmars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has dismissed speculation
linking Marc Overmars with a amove to Spanish club Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that the Catalan giants are among a number of
clubs seeking to sign the Dutchman.
</P>
<P>
"The situation concerning Marc Overmars is simple. He is under
a four-and-a-half-year contract," Wenger told soccer magazine
France Football.
</P>
<P>
"People announcing they are going to sign him elsewhere are not
serious and do not respect Arsenal because nobody has approached
us- even though it was announced he was signing for Barcelona."
</P>
<P>
Overmars has not played for Arsenal since 3 January because of
an ankle injury, and is one of a number of first team players
absent from Monday's Premiership showdown with Manchester United
at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
Wenger also revealed that Arsenal's Dutch striker Dennis
Bergkamp might not play again before March because of a calf
injury.
</P>
<P>
"The sad thing for Dennis, is that it's not a serious injury
but it has been around for so long that even when he will recover
he will need four of five matches to adjust," he said.

<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United will start
talks with Teddy Sheringham and Denis Irwin within the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The pair's current deals expire in the summer and United want
to keep them both, despite their ages.
</P>
<P>
Irwin remains the club's first choice left back at 34, although
33-year-old Sheringham has been linked with moves to Fulham and
West Ham.
</P>
<P>
"The position at the moment is I'm still under contract with
Manchester United," said Sheringham.
</P>
<P>
"I've been told the club are going to offer me a new contract
and that's as far as it goes. Everything else is just speculation.
"
</P>
<P>
Negotiations were put on hold during the World Club
Championship in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"Talks should begin shortly and certainly within the next two
weeks I would say," said chairman Martin Edwards.

<HEADLINE> FA Cup Withdrawal will Never Happen Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- No team will be allowed to sit
out the FA Cup in the future, the Football Association's new chief
executive Adam Crozier said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement follows Manchester United's withdrawal from
this year's competition to compete in the World Club Championship
in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"We have always approached this season as being a one-off,"
said Crozier.
</P>
<P>
"We've been supportive right the way through and we understand
the reasons why these decisions were taken," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cup holders Man United reacted to the news by reaffirming their
pledge to enter next season's competition.
</P>
<P>
The club and the FA were widely criticised for the decision not
to enter the third round draw - but United have consistently
stressed that it was not their decision alone and that the main
reason they withdrew was to help England's 2006 World Cup bid.

<HEADLINE> Crowds Mob Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- American boxer Mike Tyson was
mobbed by huge crowds during a "walkabout" in Brixton, south
London, amid chaotic scenes which forced police to take him into
their station for his own safety on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people surged towards the heavyweight boxer,
jeering at a massed phalanx of police officers and chanting: "We
want Tyson."
</P>
<P>
Eventually he retreated into Brixton police station and
addressed the crowd of about 2,000 people using a megaphone.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the statement by the local Lambeth Council that he
was not welcome because of his rape conviction, Tyson told the
crowds: "They say they don't want me here, right? These council
men can't tell me nothin' I don't know about my brothers".
</P>
<P>
He was then whisked away from the back of the station in a
police van.
</P>
<P>
Former world champion boxer Lloyd Honeyghan, who helped to
arrange the visit to Brixton, explained to the BBC: "We had to go
inside because too many people were here to show him their love."
</P>
<P>
He said: "Mike is planning to come back. He loves England and
he loves Brixton."
</P>
<P>
Tyson's visit to the largely black community has been
surrounded by controversy.
</P>
<P>
Lambeth Council said the boxer, who is following in the
footsteps of Muhammad Ali and Nelson Mandela by visiting Brixton,
was not an inspirational figure or a role model.
</P>
<P>
But fight promoter, Frank Warren, who accompanied Tyson on his
brief and chaotic visit to Brixton, said: "The people love him and
this is what we are seeing. I don't think it's dangerous, it is
just a bit of over-excitement."
</P>
<P>
Shadow Home Office minister David Lidington has demanded to
know how much the operation to police Tyson's visit to Brixton had
cost and said the bill should be picked up by the boxer and his
promoters.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The scenes in Brixton this afternoon are bound to
raise concern among Londoners who want to see the police out
fighting crime, not policing publicity stunts.
</P>
<P>
"When crime is rising in London and more and more officers are
being lost, I find it hard to believe the Met can afford to use
its valuable resources in this way," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ilgauskas to Have Foot Surgery, Out of Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Cleveland Cavaliers center
Zydrunas Ilgauskas will have surgery on his broken left foot and
is out for the season for the second straight year, the team
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Ilgauskas, 24, has not played since being diagnosed with a
fractured navicular bone on February 17, 1999. The injury forced
him to miss the final 45 games of last season and has not fully
healed despite extended rest and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
The procedure will be performed Wednesday at doctors who will
support the bone with screws and possibly a bone graft. It is
similar to the operation Ilgauskas had on his right foot in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ilgauskas participated in training camp in October but had
recurring pain and was placed on the injured list. Following eight
weeks of rest, Ilgauskas returned to limited practice on January 1.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Rookie Game Most Valuable Player, Ilgauskas was
thought to be close to returning until he felt pain in the foot
after Tuesday's workout. He was examined on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A native of Lithuania, Ilgauskas has played just five games
since signing a six-year, $71 million contract extension last
January. This is the third time in his career he is lost for the
season. A 1996 first-rount pick of the Cavalier, Ilgauskas missed
the 1996-97 campaign due to a similar injury in his right foot.
</P>
<P>
Ilgauskas averaged 13.9 points and 8.8 rebounds in his rookie
season of 1997-98, his only injury-free campaign. He averaged 15.2
points and 8.8 rebounds before last season's setback.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM's Visit Highlighted in Istanbul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Greek Foreign Minister
George Papandreou and his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem will be
bestowed "2000 Year Statesman Award" as a reward for their
contribution to improving Turkish-Greek ties.
</P>
<P>
At a working lunch Saturday given by the Turkish-Greek Business
Council in Turkish largest city of Istanbul in honor of the Greek
minister, New York-based East-West Institute Chairman John Edwin
announced the awarding ceremony will be held in New York on May 2,
reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou arrived in Ankara Thursday night on a three-day
landmark visit, during which he has held talks with Turkish
President suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit.
Papandreou and Cem signed four agreements.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have long been in disputes over Aegean
territorial waters and Cyprus issue. Ties between the two neighbors
hit a low in last February after leader of Turkish outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party Abdullah Ocalan was found to be taking refuge in
Greek Embassy in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou is the highest-ranking Greek official to visit Turkey
in nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Cem and Papandreou poured praise on each other after the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
"I thank Mr. Papandreou for his contributions to improvement of
Turkish-Greek relations, and for his kindness and courage. He did
many things for his country and my country. I believe that Mr.
Papandreou's visit has further improved the relations and the
relations will be better in the future," said Cem.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said in turn that the good relations which started in
1999 were brought to 2000. "The Turkish-Greek friendship started
and improved, and became a good start for the millennium. There are
many more things we have to do. This is a beginning. I thank my
friend Ismail(Cem) for his contributions. This was not easy. I
congratulate him for his courage," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Minister Warns Impacts of Economic Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Economic globalization has
to some extent hurt the developing economies, warned Saudi Minister
of Commerce Osama Ibrahim Faqih on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Faqih sounded the alarm in his opening speech at the Jeddah
international economic forum titled "The Impact of Globalization
and Economic Challenges to the Middle East in the 21st Century,"
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
He said that globalization is a dynamic force that brings about
both chances and risks whose impacts on states and societies are
not equally felt.
</P>
<P>
The negative impacts of globalization rendered extreme damage on
new industries in many developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries were also affected, under the globalization
concepts, by a cut of their share in international trade due to the
sharp fluctuation of prices of their raw materials, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi official called for establishing a fair world economic
system, while stressing that future challenges of comprehensive
development also require clear vision and objectives as well as the
consciousness of defending self-abilities.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 Saudi, Gulf and world prominent figures, including
former U.S. President George Bush and former British Prime Minister
John Major, are attending the two-day Jeddah forum.

<HEADLINE> Assad, Mubarak Meet on Mideast Peace Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
on Saturday held talks with his visiting Egyptian counterpart Hosni
Mubarak on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the closed-door meeting, Assad briefed Mubarak on the
latest developments in the peace talks on the Syrian-Israeli track,
said informed sources.
</P>
<P>
Syrian and Israeli negotiators have conducted two rounds of
peace talks in the U.S. last December and in early January after a
45-month break while the third round scheduled for Wednesday in the
U.S. have been postponed indefinitely due to differences over the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
During Saturday's summit meeting, Mubarak reiterated his
country's support for Syria's demand for Israel's full pullback
from the occupied Golan Heights to the June 4, 1967 border lines on
the eve of the Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Golan Heights in the 1967 Mideast war and
annexed it in 1981. The fate of Golan is at the core of the Syrian-
Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day Mubarak was quoted as saying on his way to
Damascus that Egypt was keen on ensuring the success of the Syrian-
Israeli peace talks on the basis that Syria should restore all its
rights including Israel's pullout from Golan.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was also in contact with all relevant parties and could
play a major role in the peace process, said Mubarak. He expressed
belief that his meeting with Assad would bring him closer to the
content of the latest Syrian-Israeli peace talks and Syria's
attitude towards future talks.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Assad-Mubarak meeting was viewed by local analysts as
a proof on the strategic ties between Damascus and Cairo which
showed that the reported coldness in bilateral ties did not exist.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will leave for Amman Sunday to hold talks with King
Abdullah in an effort to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab states that signed a
peace treaty with Israel and the two countries are playing
important role in coordinating Arab stance and facilitating the
Mideast peace drive.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Jordan Reach Agreement Over Oil Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Jordan have reached
compromise over the price of crude oil and derivatives Iraq
supplies to Jordan and renewed their oil agreement on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, inked by Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammed
Rasheed and visiting Jordanian Energy and Mineral Resources
Minister Wael Sabri, Iraq will supply Jordan with 4.8 tons of crude
oil and by-products this year at a maximum price of 19 U.S. dollars
per barrel in return for Jordanian food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The two oil ministers held talks last month in Amman, but failed
to reach agreement over a pricing formula.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, in the light of a sharp increase in international oil
prices since March, insisted on raising the price per barrel to 19
dollars from 13.50 dollars last year while Jordan submitted a
compromise ceiling of 15.60 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The international benchmark Brent crude reached a nine-year high
of 27.11 dollars a barrel on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 Gulf War, sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwaitin
1990 and in which Amman sided with Baghdad, Iraq has exported about
80,000 barrels of oil per day to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's oil purchases from Iraq are exempted from U.N.sanctions
which ban Baghdad from freely exporting its oil as punishment for
its invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Indian Ocean Rim Countries to Cement Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation within the
framework of the nascent Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional
Cooperation (IORARC) would contribute to regional development and
the world at large, said an Omani official.
</P>
<P>
While opening a two-day extraordinary ministerial meeting of the
IORARC in Muscat, Omani Foreign Minister Yousef Bin Abudullah said
that the unique diversified natural resources and minerals enjoyed
by member states would enable the association to become one of the
most important bodies of the world in trade and investment spheres.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation
Leonardo Santos Simao, chairman of the meeting, called on member
states to exert more efforts to facilitate and liberalize trade and
to encourage investment and to find better ways for developing the
mechanism of the regional group.
</P>
<P>
Other ministers attending the meeting all expressed their
countries' commitment to the objectives and principles of the
association, saying that they were ready to contribute to
cooperation, security and peace in the Indian Ocean rim region and
enhance economic ties among member states.
</P>
<P>
After one day of discussions, participants reached consensus on
several issues, including placing the organization's headquarters
in Mauritius, the rules, regulations and procedures governing the
regional body, and its criteria for membership, said the Omani
minister.
</P>
<P>
He told the official Oman News Agency that they also agreed on
the joining of China and Britain as dialog partners of the
association, noting that Pakistan's application to join the
organization would be reviewed during the next meeting due to be
held in 2001.
</P>
<P>
France's application to enjoy the position of a dialog partner
will also be discussed during the next meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the association was planning to implement several
projects which were under study including the development of ports
and navigation and the transfer of technology among members.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's meeting was attended by foreign ministers of the 19
members, with Egypt and Japan present as dialog partners.
</P>
<P>
The organization was founded in 1995 with Oman, India,
Australia, Kenya, South Africa and Singapore as its launchers. It
groups, besides the above-mentioned countries, Iran, Sri Lanka,
Indonesia, Tanzania, Yemen, Madagascar, Malaysia, Bangladesh,
Mozambique, the United Arab Emirates, Seychelles, Thailand and
Mauritius.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Scandal over Kosovo Aid Mission Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A scandal over Italy's government-
run humanitarian aid mission for Kosovo took on fresh dimensions
Saturday, as prosecutors said they were investigating activities
at a refugee camp in Sicily and questions were raised about the
handling of aid intended for the victims of the 1997 earthquakes
in Italian central region of Umbria.
</P>
<P>
The scandal erupted two days ago, with the arrest of four
employees of the so-called Rainbow Mission on charges of
embezzlement, fraud and other crimes in connection with the
management of the Vlore refugee camp in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Saturday afternoon that an investigation was
also underway into the running of the Comiso refugee center in
southern Sicily. Prosecutors from the nearby city of Ragusa said
that they began their inquiry in September and were focusing on
the handling of Rainbow Mission funds intended for the Comiso camp,
where almost 6,000 Kosovo refugees were given temporary shelter,
and the alleged existence of a prostitution ring. They said that
the Mayor of Comiso, Giuseppe Digiacomo, was under investigation
because 350 million lire (about 182,000 U.S. dollars) of Rainbow
Mission money was allegedly spent on improving and extending the
water supply system to the camp, although the work was supposed to
cost only 93 million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prosecutors in Bari conducting the Vlore camp
inquiry, said that, besides the four suspects already arrested, a
total of five others were under investigation, including a police
officer and an alleged Albanian organized crime boss by the name
of Rhami Isufi.
</P>
<P>
Among those arrested were Massimo Simonelli, the field director
of the Italian aid mission in Albania who has worked for 18 years
in the Civil Defense Department of the Interior Ministry, which
was responsible for managing the Rainbow Mission, and Luciano
Tenaglia, the manager of the Vlore camp.
</P>
<P>
But due to the fact that Simonelli and a few of the others
arrested were also involved in the Civil Defense Department's
relief work in Umbria after the area was devastated by two big
earthquakes on September 26, 1997, prosecutors looked set to
investigate the management of these funds too.

<HEADLINE> (Updates) Ecuadorian Congress Appoints New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadorian Congress appointed
Saturday Gustavo Noboa as constitutional president for a mandate
that ends in January of 2003, after the deposition of President
Jamil Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
Ninety out of 99 legislators voted for the motion in which
Noboa, formerly vice-president, was appointed president.
</P>
<P>
The legislators approved the motion filed by Social Christian
Deputy Jaime Nebot, who considered Mahuad's exit of the presidency
as an abandonment and had Noboa take up the charge.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ousted President Jamil Mahuad asked in a statement
broacasted to the nation through television support for the new
government of Gustavo Noboa.
</P>
<P>
"God bless the new president of Ecuadorians and may the
political and entrepreneurial sectors will give the new president
all the support they denied me," he said.
</P>
<P>
 Just hours after claiming power, Ecuador's military chief
dissolved a three-man junta Saturday and allowed the vice
president to restore civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
Indian protesters, joined by junior military officers, stormed
key government buildings demanding the ouster of President Jamil
Mahuad on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad fled the presidential palace into hiding Friday. There
was no immediate word on the fate of the immensely unpopular
Mahuad. He has taken refuge at a military base, an Ecuadorian
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Carlos Mendoza had dissolved the junta early Saturday,
just hours after he and its other leaders announced its formation
from the balcony of the palace to a cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
Mendoza said Saturday that the quick decision to elevate Vice
President Noboa to the presidency was made after discussions with
U.S. officials, who warned that Ecuador could lose its foreign aid
and investment if it did not restore power to the elected
government.

<HEADLINE> IRA Has 9 Days to Begin Disarmament: Trimble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Pro-British
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said on Saturday the Irish
Republican Army had only nine days to start scrapping its arms or
the plug would be pulled on the new power-sharing government in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, who is first minister in the government, drew a line
in the sand over guerrilla disarmament, said he expected Britain
to re-impose direct rule over the province by the end of January
if the IRA failed to disarm, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said putting the new power-sharing executive on
temporary hold was "a price worth paying". He said he remained
hopeful republicans would make a move by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
"If things don't work out as we had hoped and it proves
impossible to sustain the administration in its present form, then
the only immediate course is direct rule," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The only way of carrying on the political process is some form
of review in the circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Trimble is under enormous pressure from a backlash among
Protestants against reforms of Northern Ireland's police force
announced this month by Britain's Labour government.
</P>
<P>
"We should not lose heart in this process," he said. "Society
should not see it as the end of the road or the collapse of the
agreement, it is better to work through the difficulties."
</P>
<P>
Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of the IRA's political ally Sinn
Fein, said unionists were seeking to renegotiate the agreement and
that was completely unacceptable to republicans.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling on both governments to make it clear that there
will be no renegotiation and that David Trimble and his party
should disabuse themselves of that possibility," he said during a
meeting of his party's executive in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament or "decommissioning" was part of the April 1998
Belfast Agreement setting up the new executive, but no weapons
have yet been surrendered or destroyed by the Irish Republican
Army, the main guerrilla force opposed to British rule.

<HEADLINE> IAEA Starts Inspection in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- An International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) team on Saturday launched its first inspection of
Iraqi nuclear sites in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
"We will start out first round this morning," said Ahmad
Abuzahra, the Egyptian head of the team, as he and five other
monitors left their Baghdad hotel.
</P>
<P>
The team arrived here Friday. It is the first visit to Iraq by
monitors from the Vienna-based organization since all U.N. weapons
inspectors withdrew from the country in December 1998 shortly
before the U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq targets.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to perform routine physical inventory checking for
nuclear material," said Abuzahra on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The defunct U.N. Special Commission, which has been taken over
by a new inspection regime of the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission (MOVIC), was responsible for disarming Iraq
of its biological, chemical weapons and long-range missiles while
IAEA seeks the elimination of Iraq's nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The eradication of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction is the key
element for the lifting of the U.N. sanctions imposed on Baghdad
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a new resolution on December
17, opening the way for the return of the weapons inspectors. And
the council is scrambling to find a head for the MOVIC.

<HEADLINE> Chileans Protest Pinochet's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The demonstrators demanded Britain to revert its decision and
to extradite Pinochet to Spain, where a judge will try him for
crimes against humanity committed during the 1973-1990 military
regime in Chile.
</P>
<P>
Viviana Diaz, president of the association of relatives of
Detained-Disappeared, asked British Home Secretary Jack Straw "to
think of the thousands of relatives of the victims of the military
dictatorship and not grant Pinochet a reprieve for humanity
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Straw said on January 11 that he denied the extradition of
Pinochet, who would not resists a trial because of his
deteriorated health, which makes possible the impending return of
the former military ruler and lifetime senator to Chile.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet has been detained in London since October 16, 1998, at
the request of Spanish judge Baltasar Garzn.
</P>
<P>
Diaz said before the demonstrators that Pinochet, 84 years old,
"is not as sick as they say."

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy's Grandmothers Meet U.S. Attorney General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During a meeting here, Mariela Quintana, the boy's paternal
grandmother, and maternal grandmother Raquel Rodriguez, gave Reno
a letter expressing the wish that Elian be returned to "the
normality of life with his father, brother family, friends at
schools, his toys, dog and parrot."
</P>
<P>
The grandmothers arrived in New York from Cuba on Friday and
said they came to ask for an early end to the tragedy and let the
boy return to Cuba as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
After the 45-minute meeting, Reno said in a written statement
the grandmothers "made a very compassionate and heartfelt plea"
but that the matter now is in federal court.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain that the law recognizes the unique relationship
between parent and child and that family reunification has long
been a cornerstone" of U.S immigration law as well as Immigration
and Naturalization Service practice, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The INS has ordered the boy returned to Cuba. Reno has agreed,
saying the boy belongs with his father in Cuba where he was reared.
The grandmothers sought the meeting with Reno and Doris Meissner,
the INS commissioner, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
In their letter to Reno, the grandmothers' letter said Elian's
stay in the United States "adds to the tragedy of the family over
the loss" of the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
"We ask that you return Elian to his immediate family and not to
his distant family where there had not been a previous
relationship. This is the reason for being here, and we thank you
for this interview," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
While the matter goes through the courts, lawmakers in Congress
plan an attempt this week to declare Elian a U.S. citizen. If such
legislation becomes law, the boy no longer would be an immigrant
under INS jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Dan Burton, an anti-Cuba Congressman who cosponsored the
notorious Helms-Burton Act against Cuba, said he will subpoenaed
Elian to decide whether the boy should be returned or not.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 from sear near Florida after
his mother and stepfather were killed when their boat capsized in
an effort to come to the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
The INS early this month ruled that the boy belongs to his
father and should be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, the boy's relatives in Florida insisted the boy should
stay in the United States. Anti-Cuban politicians in the United
States tried to use the boy to attack Cuba, saying the boy will
face both physical and mental harm if returned to Cuba because of
the Caribbean islands' social system.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration believes that the boy should be
returned to Cuba and politics should be avoided in handling the
process.
</P>
<P>
In Miami, Elian's great-uncle Delfin Gonzalez said the family
has no plans to allow Elian to go to New York to meet his
grandmothers, but said they were welcome to come to Miami.
