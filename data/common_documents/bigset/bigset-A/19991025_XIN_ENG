<HEADLINE> Iraq Refutes U.S. Allegations of Not Caring for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Sunday refuted the
U.S. allegations that the Iraqi government is not taking necessary
measures to fight drought in the country and does not care for the
nutritional aspect of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Agricultural Undersecretary Basi Kamil told reporters
that his ministry made plans to import sprinkler irrigation
systems, well draining systems and water pumps to fight drought
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the U.S. and British representatives at
the U.N. Sanctions Committee only approved contracts for the
purchases of pipes but suspended contracts for buying pumps.
</P>
<P>
Kamil said that his ministry had planned to rehabilitate
poultry breeding fields abandoned due to embargo to supply
protein to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
And again, this project was impeded by the Sanctions Committee
through delaying contracts for the purchases of soy beans and
protein concentrates for feeding chickens, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that these contracted materials were put on hold
by the U.S. representative at the Sanctions Committee under the
pretext that those items are of dual-usage.
</P>
<P>
Rafid Abdul-Kareem, general-director of the Planning Department
in Agriculture Ministry, told reporters that the ministry signed
contracts with companies of Algeria, Egypt, Spain and Saudi
Arabia to supply Iraq with 1,500 sprinkler irrigation systems.
</P>
<P>
However, only one contract for the purchase of 200
irrigation systems was approved by the Sanctions Committee despite
the availability of the funds, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kareen said that the Agriculture Ministry and the Irrigation
Ministry have taken all the necessary measures to fight the
drought such as well draining and lessening the waste of water in
the irrigated areas.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq has signed 140 agriculture-related contracts
under the current sixth phase of the oil-for-food program which
expires next month, but only 38 contracts has been approved by the
Sanctions Committee so far.
</P>
<P>
He added that these contracts are to import animal health and
veterinary appliances, poultry breeding equipment, agricultural
machinery and crops and seeds-protecting products.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to sell limited
amount of oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys in the
Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its contracts.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has also argued that the oil-for-food deal has failed
to alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Backs Egyptian-Libyan Peace Plan on Sudan: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Sunday that Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi
supports an Egyptian-Libyan joint initiative aimed at helping
reach national reconciliation in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks after meeting with Moi, who stopped
over at Cairo International Airport on route to Belgium,
Luxembourg and Germany, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Moi views the Egyptian-Libyan peace plan as complementary to
other efforts and not in contradiction with the initiative of the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed in early August a five-point peace
plan calling for permanent cease-fire in Sudan and a preparatory
meeting for a peace conference to be attended by all related
parties to seek national reconciliation in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the Muslim opposition parties have
accepted the proposal. But the Sudan's People's Liberation Army
(SPLA) has rejected the idea, saying that it favors the role
played by IGAD, an Eastern African organization, in mediating a
solution to its war with the government.
</P>
<P>
The political parties and SPLA have united in the form of an
umbrella group, the National Democratic Alliance. The parties want
to share power with the Sudanese government while SPLA has been
fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy for the mostly Christian
south.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the meeting also dealt with the situation in
Somalia, which has been in division since 1991, and the Great
Lakes region, and the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"The relations between Egypt and Kenya are good and active,
particularly in the domain of trade exchanges," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Egypt's accession to the Common Market of Eastern
and Southern Africa in 1998 added new dimensions to the bilateral
relations and helped promote the trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is also a member of the 22-nation economic bloc.

<HEADLINE> Legislative, Presidential Elections Start in Tunisia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, October 24 (Xinhua) - - Some 3.5 million Tunisian voters
went on Sunday to the 15,340 ballot boxes in 25 constituencies
nationwide to participate in the legislative and presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
This is the first multi-party elections in Tunisia since its
independence.
</P>
<P>
Three candidates are vying for presidency, namely incumbent
President Zine El-Abidine Bin-Ali who is also leader of the ruling
Democratic Constitutional Grouping Party, Secretary General of the
Democratic Unionist Party Abdul-Rahman Talili, and Secretary
General of the People's Unity Mohammed Belhaj.
</P>
<P>
The total number of parliamentary candidates is 950, including
50 women who are competing for the 182-seat House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the transparency of the election process, Bin-Ali
ordered in September the formation of an independent national
committee to supervise the process for the first time in Tunisia's
history.
</P>
<P>
He also invited some foreign observers to supervise the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The ballot boxes were scheduled to close at 6.00 p.m. and the
initial results will be announced at 10.00 p.m. and the final
results will be announced on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Bin-Ali is to secure the majority of votes and win a new
presidential term due to his domestic and foreign policies
generally hailed by the majority of Tunisians, diplomatic sources
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
Bin-Ali was elected president of Tunisia in 1989 and made
remarkable achievements in the economic and social fields in the
recent years.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Economically Promising: Italian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has great economic
potentials and is regarded as one of the most important countries
economically in the southern Mediterranean areas, the visiting
Italian minister of foreign trade said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Egyptian Prime
Minister Atef Obeid, Piero Fassino voiced Italy's admiration and
appreciation for the accomplishments Egypt has achieved in
economic reform and investment sector.
</P>
<P>
The private sector of both countries will play a key role in
promoting Egyptian exports to Italy and enhance the trade volume,
said Fassino, who arrived in Cairo on Friday, leading a 70-member
business delegation.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Egypt and Italy reached about 2.5
billion U.S. dollars in 1998, with Egyptian exports amounting to 1
billion dollars. Italy absorbs an annual 11.1 percent of Egypt's
total exports, making it the biggest importer of Egyptian products
among the 15 European Union members.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed on a program aimed at increasing
Italian investments in Egypt and setting up joint ventures,
Egyptian Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef Boutros
Ghali, who was present at the meeting, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Italy has so far invested 1.3 billion Egyptian pounds (380
million dollars) in 83 joint ventures in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Another program for transferring advanced technology to Egypt
and ways of financing Egyptian small and medium industries by
Italy have also been discussed, Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have agreed to coordinate stances at the
multilateral talks on the liberalization of trade in the world,
which is to be held during the third ministerial meeting of the
World Trade Organization in Seattle, the United States, next
month, he added.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Official Suggests Delay of Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's general
elections scheduled for next year may be delayed to enable the
country to fully prepare itself, South African Press Association
(SAPA) Sunday quoted a Commonwealth official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moses Anafu, director of Political Affairs at the Commonwealth
Secretariat in London, told SAPA in Maseru at the weekend that it
was desirable for Lesotho "not to sacrifice efficiency and
thoroughness for a rushed and speedy holding of elections."
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old Ghanaian diplomat had just completed a two-week
long tough behind-the-scenes negotiation in Maseru, whereby he
brokered an important deal among Lesotho's political leaders to
iron out disagreements on the holding of elections.
</P>
<P>
Anafu said he had negotiated with the Business Committee of the
Interim Political Authority, the government at the highest level,
including Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili, who gave him full
support.
</P>
<P>
Political leaders involved in the process of preparations for
fresh elections have agreed on the desirability of a thorough
preparation process so that the results at the end of the day
would be credible and reflect the will of the Lesotho people who
should be assured that the elections are free of irregularities,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Secretariat has suggested to provide a team of
experts to work with Lesotho's political leaders to get the
country fully prepared for the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
The work would involve an enormous task of registration, voter
education and restructuring of the Independent Electoral
Commission and its staff, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said it was hoped a formal agreement would be
signed early in November to include recommendations for a new
date.
</P>
<P>
This agreement would be signed by Commonwealth Secretary
General Emeka Anyaoku and Southern African Development Community
Chairman Joachim Chissano as guarantors, as well as by Lesotho's
political leaders, he said.

<HEADLINE> Somalia Launches Polio Vaccination Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A large vaccination program
to eradicate the deadly polio disease in Somalia by the year 2000
was simultaneously launched in Bay, Bakol and Gedo regions of the
war-torn country on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The vaccination campaign has begun in all five districts of
Bakol region with mass participation, Deputy Governor of the
region Mohamed Fanah told Xinhua on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 55,000 children under five in the region will
be vaccinated during the three-day vaccination campaign.
</P>
<P>
In the neighboring regions of Gedo and Bay, hundreds of
thousands of children under five also began to receive
vaccination.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 percent of the population in these regions are
believed to be children under five and are supposed to benefit
from the campaign before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the vaccination campaign, which was supposed to cover
the whole area of southern Somalia, has not been extended to
Mogadishu, Middle and Lower Shabelle regions yet, although more
than 28 percent of the country's population reside in these
regions.
</P>
<P>
There has been no official explanation for this, but a local
aid worker said it is probably because that it needs more plans
before a concrete step is taken towards the capital and the two
Shabelle regions.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400,000 children under five were vaccinated in Mogadishu
alone last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen Sunday reiterated Washington's military commitment to
Jordan during a four-hour stopover in Amman.
</P>
<P>
In Amman, Cohen held talks with King Abdullah Bin Hussein,
Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh and
other senior officials on bilateral ties and the Middle East
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Oman, Cohen told reporters that he had
reiterated assistance from the U.S. to Jordan, which Washington
took as an ally in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Washington has provided tens of millions of dollars worth of
tanks, armored vehicles, anti-tank rockets, night vision equipment
and other sophisticated weapons to meet the defense demand of the
kingdom since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It also pledged a 300-million-dollar military and economic
assistance package to Jordan for the year 1999 to award Amman for
its role in promoting the peace process between Israel and its
Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is on a nine-nation Middle East tour which had taken him
to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates
and Kuwait. Israel is the last leg of his current tour.
</P>
<P>
Top on his agenda are issues concerning Iraq, Iran and the
U.S. military presence in the region, U.S. officials said.

<HEADLINE> Federal Troops Block Chechen-Ingush Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops continued
their blockade Sunday of the border between the breakaway republic
of Chechnya and neighboring Ingushetia while launching more aerial
and artillery attacks on rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the
KGB, said the move was taken to reinforce the zone of security on
the border to prevent rebels from entering neighboring regions to
stage terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Before the enhanced border control, the FSB said, only one of
the six roads that run across the border was under federal control
as to the flow to motor vehicles and refugees, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It said Chechen fuel and lubricants had earlier been
transported to and sold in Ingushetia and that proceeds were used
by illegal armed units.
</P>
<P>
The FSB also said some terrorists were trying to get into
neighboring regions, disguising as refugees.
</P>
<P>
"Significantly, the bands' chiefs (Shamil) Basayev and Khattab
assign them for concrete tasks to carry out sabotage and terrorist
actions in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other territories of
Russia," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, it has been established that due to the lack of
control by local authorities in Ingushetia, incoming humanitarian
aid is partially stolen, and actually gets into the hands of
bandits in Chechnya," the FSB said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ingush President Ruslan Aushev said he wants to
appeal to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to ease the blockade to
allow the movement of Chechen refugees.
</P>
<P>
"These roads were the main corridor for refugees. Now these
people, most of them women, old people and children, have no way
to leave Chechnya," he said.
</P>
<P>
"War should be waged against bandits and terrorists, not
against refugees," Aushev said.
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees in Ingushetia has swelled to 169,700,
and the tiny republic is "suffocating under such a tide of
refugees," he said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Ready to Help Peace Process: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook said Sunday his country is ready to help
the Middle East peace process to ensure that a comprehensive
peace would be achieved in the region.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with his Israeli counterpart David Levy, Cook
said Britain welcomes the "positive concrete steps" Israel has
taken to revive the peace process and offers help in future
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"I came here for peace. I came here in order to see how Britain
can best be a partner for peace. The road ahead may be difficult,
but Britain wants to travel with Israel down the road," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook's visit to Israel is his second in a year and a half. In
his last visit in March 1998, he triggered a fierce row with the
then hard-line Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu by
visiting Har Homa, a controversial site near East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
His current visit came at a time when the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process has been brought back on the track. The two sides
have signed an interim peace deal and launched the permanent peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
This environment has apparently helped mend fence between
Israel and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak visited London a few days
after he took office in July, and Levy called his relations with
Cook "excellent with consolidated cooperation and strengthening
Israeli-British ties."
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that Britain's ability to help the peace
process lies on its close ties with Damascus.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Cook called for the achievement of a
comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process must be comprehensive, and embrace the
Syrian, Lebanese tracks as well as the Palestinian track," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Exchanging a considerable amount of messages of peace since
Barak took office, Israel and Syria is still at odds over how
their stalled talks should be restarted.
</P>
<P>
Later Sunday, Cook will hold talks with Barak and Israeli
President Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
He will travel to the Palestinian self-rule areas for talks
with Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat on
Monday.

KUWAIT CITY, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Qatar and Venezuela, two
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), promised on Sunday their continuous compliance with the
OPEC agreement on cutting oil production to shore up prices.

<P>
ROME, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Julius Bitok beat
countryman Mark Saina to win the water-logged Venice Marathon,
while Italy's Sonia Maccioni captured the women's race in an event-
record time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The runners slogged through large puddles up to their ankles in
canal-laced Venice, where tides and wind often push water from the
Adriatic onto sidewalks and piazzas _ a phenomenon known as "acqua
alta" (high water), reports said.
</P>
<P>
Bitok finished in 2 hours, 10 minutes, 34 seconds. Saina
clocked 2:10:44, with Roberto Barbi of Italy third in 2:11:23.
</P>
<P>
Maccioni's winning time was 2:28:54, more than a minute ahead
of runner-up Gadissa Pedato of Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Khannouchi Wins Chicago Marathon with Record Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Khalid Khannouchi of Morocco
set a world record and took the Chicago Marathon title in 2:05:42
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Khannouchi beat the previous wolrd mark set by Brazilian
Ronaldo da Costa by 23 seconds.
</P>
<P>
As he crossed the finish line, Khannouchi burst into tears and
was wrapped in a bear hug by his wife, Sandra, his coach and agent.
Khannouchi, a Moroccan who is trying to become an American citizen,
gets 165,000 U.S. dollars for his victory, including a 100,000 U.
S. dollar bonus for the world record, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Khannouchi, who also won Chicago in 1997,
trailed Kenyan Moses Tanui by 33 seconds at the 33.7-km mark on a
course that drew many of the world's top runners because of its
relative ease. But he gradually cut the margin, beating Tanui by
34 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Little-known David Morris, originally from Eagle River, Alaska,
who now lives and trains in Japan, finished fourth and set an
American record of 2:09:32. His previous best was 2:15:25 at
Pittsburgh last year.
</P>
<P>
In the women's race, defending champion Joyce Chepchumba of
Kenya edged countrywoman Margaret Okayo for the victory in 2:26:00.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UK-France Beef War Escalates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- France's refusal to honor a
European Union order to lift a ban on British beef exports has led
to a growing anger against France in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The row over the French ban escalated further Sunday as UK
Agriculture Minister Nick Brown said he would "tighten" food
labeling rules in the wake of revelations that some French
livestock have been fed sewage.
</P>
<P>
"It is a pretty horrible and disgusting thing to pad out the
animal feed with human excrement and animal excrement," he told
the BBC's "Breakfast with Frost" program.
</P>
<P>
In supermarkets across Britain, the hard sell is emblazoned
above the shelves: Buy British. British produce is best.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that it is a patriotic cry that panders
to a popular feeling among shoppers, who have been infuriated by
France's refusal to lift its ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
The thinking behind the supermarkets' campaign is straight
forward: they have stopped stocking some French produce and
proclaim in support of Britain's ailing farming industry.
</P>
<P>
This weekend, for example, traders in Scarborough are erecting
"Non Francais Produce" signs. In the Gloucestershire village of
Nettleton Bottom, licensees Dave Morgan and Catherine Stevens have
scrapped the annual French Week.
</P>
<P>
The move also underscore the growing grass-roots anger at the
consumer level in Britain provoked by France's continued defiance
of the EU's ruling on August 1 ending a three-and-half-year export
ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
Nick Brown, who has warned French Farm Minister Jean Glavany of
"the growing strength of feeling in this country," denied
reporters he was isolated within the government for championing a
boycott on French foods.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair is said to give his "full
support." It was also reported that Blair has exchanged blunt words
on the issue with his French counterpart, Lionel Jospin, and has
threatened to take the case to the European Court at the Hague if
France doesn't back down.
</P>
<P>
"The crucial meeting is taking place on the 28th of this
month," Brown said. "I'm confident that after that meeting, the
European Union scientists will have to say that the French have
nothing new."
</P>
<P>
If France did not lift the ban on British beef, the European
Commission would take Paris to court, the British agriculture
minister said.

<HEADLINE> Colombians Huge Joint Peace March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Millions of
Colombians Sunday joined the peace march named as "No More
Violence, War and Kidnappings."
</P>
<P>
Estimations made by the local radio networks showed that at
least 13 million people went out in the streets to express their
rejection of violence and demand the cease of hostilities by the
actors of the conflict and the separation of the civil society
from the war.
</P>
<P>
The march for peace also demands the end of kidnappings and the
barring of minors from being part of the combat forces.
</P>
<P>
First Lady Nohora Puyana de Pastrana was pleased by the
response of the citizens to the call to march, who did it despite
the rain that started in the first hours of the morning in Santafe
de Bogota.
</P>
<P>
The march was made simultaneously practically in all the cities
of the country, and even in rural zones, where the peasants
demanded stop to the forced dislodgements caused by the violence,
one of the phenomena that affects them most.
</P>
<P>
Colombians abroad also marched for peace. Approximately 30
cities in the world saw dozens of such marches, eager to achieve
peace in their country.
</P>
<P>
Colombian people have already been fed up with the decades-long
armed conflict, which has left some 400,000 dead. Authorities say
that 200 kidnappings, 500 assassinations and five rebel
occupations are registered every month.
</P>
<P>
There are other rebel groups in the country besides the FARC,
including the National Liberation Army (ELN) and the Pepole's
Liberation Army (EPL).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's right-wing para-military group has
already killed many alleged sympathizers of the rebel forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 24 million
Argentine voters Sunday morning started for the electoral
stations all over the country to elect the 47th president of the
republic.
</P>
<P>
The voting is going on with complete normality in the country
of 36.1 million citizens, although in some places there were
delays in the opening of some tables.
</P>
<P>
Foreign correspondents who toured some of the electoral sites
in this capital saw people standing orderly in queues in front of
the voting tables to exercise their right to vote.
</P>
<P>
Some voters dropped their ballots to express their sovereign
will in the Domingo Faustino Sarmiento College, located in the
center of the federal capital
</P>
<P>
A man over 60 told Xinhua, "I like voting because it is my duty
and obligation, and it contributes to the democracy the country is
living in."
</P>
<P>
An aged lady who works in the administration of horizontal
buildings also expressed her enthusiasm, saying that "we expect
with this voting a more complete democracy, a more honest
government, and a better life."
</P>
<P>
Fernando de la Rua, the opposition center-left Alliance's
presidential candidate and Buenos Aires City mayor, arrived at the

<HEADLINE> African Development Forum Opens in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The African Development
Forum (ADF) ' 99, under the theme of "the Challenge to Africa of
Globalization and the Information Age", opened here Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Among the high profile participants attending the opening
session of the forum are First Deputy Secretary General of the
United Nations Lousise Frenchettee, Secretary General of the
Organization of African Unity Salim Ahmed Salim and Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.
</P>
<P>
More than 35 African ministers and 600 experts from both within
and outside Africa and international organizations are also here
participating in the four-day forum organized by the United
Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the forum at the ECA Conference Hall, Meles said
that Africa, which is making efforts to reduce the level of
poverty in the continent by half by the year 2015, must try from a
desperately weakened position to overcome the various challenges
it faces in the globalizing world.
</P>
<P>
Meles attached importance to the globalization, saying Africa
has become part of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that being part of the global economy
does not necessarily mean that one has become a productive part of
the process and in a position to draw benefits from it.
</P>
<P>
Africa should find ways and means of creating the necessary
conditions for itself to share the benefits of the global economy
in an equitable and fair manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister emphasized that the domestic private sector
could play an important part in promoting regional economic growth
and sustained development.
</P>
<P>
The role of the state is also very important, he said, noting
that political will and the rule of law cannot be made available
and fostered without the critical role of the state.
</P>
<P>
Meles expressed the belief that Africa is bound to remain
linked to the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Western developed countries, Meles said inputs
made towards Africa's development are not matters of philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
"Africa's growth and development is not only in the interest of
Africa but also, as I have said earlier, in the interest of all
those who presently exercise monopoly over the benefits of
globalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
OAU Chief Salim said that as the new millennium is coming,
Africa should make concerted efforts to avert the marginalization
of the continent and its role in world politics.
</P>
<P>
Confessing the sad reality that at present, the size of
Africa's involvement in global trade is only two percent, Salim
said "poverty brings about instability and insecurity, which in
turn breed under-development."
</P>
<P>
On priorities in the next century, Salim called on African
countries to continue their efforts to make political and economic
reforms and to link democratization and good governance with
assuring sustainable economic development.
</P>
<P>
"Africa has resolved to address the scourge of conflicts and to
 establish lasting peace, security and stability, and to purse the
path of democratic governance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the same regard, Africa aspires to promote sustainable
development and to ensure that the people are the focus of all
endeavors," Salim added.
</P>
<P>
The ECA-sponsored forum is due to start from Monday with
different panels, research presentations as well as exhibitions,
according to agenda of the international seminar.

The apology, made by the Russian embassy in Vilnius, was in
response to a note of protest lodged earlier Sunday by the
Lithuanian Foreign Ministry over a Russian military helicopter's
incursion into its air space.
</P>
<P>
The Russian embassy cited "a partial loss of orientation" in
space as the cause for the "non-intentional crossing of the border
by the helicopter and its short-term stay on Lithuanian
territory," Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The embassy, quoting competent Russian authorities, said the
Ka-27 rescue helicopter, of Russia's Baltic Fleet, was heading for
Krasnoznamensk, a town in the Kaliningrad region near the
Lithuanian-Russian border, to deliver emergency medical aid to a
serviceman caught in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
The Russian chopper veered into Lithuanian air space over the
Sakiai region, landed at a secondary school stadium in the town of
Jurbarkas and then flew back to the Kaliningrad region. It was not
clear when the incident took place.

<HEADLINE> HK, S'pore Have Much to Gain From Cooperation: Lee Kuan Yew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean Senior Minister
Lee Kuan Yew said here Monday that Singapore and Hong Kong have a
unique opportunity to work together and help spur the development
of the regional capital market.
</P>
<P>
As two business hubs in Asia, Singapore and Hong Kong compete
with each other for a number of business and financial services,
and both can grow and profit together, said Lee when delivering a
keynote speech at the 4th anniversary dinner of the Hong Kong
Policy Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
"The market is big enough for both economies to thrive," he
said. "Technology-led changes in the financial services sector
open up opportunities for cooperation and synergy between us."
</P>
<P>
Lee pointed out that the global capital markets have been
undergoing structural changes in response to the forces of
technology, and new competitors, many non-traditional like
electronic communication networks and software providers, are
challenging the franchise of exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"We are responding to these changes. Both Singapore and Hong
Kong are working to demutualize and integrate their stock and
derivatives exchanges," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
"This will make the exchanges more commercially oriented,
giving greater value to their investors by offering a wider and
more interesting range of products, besides increasing liquidity,
and creating efficient and convenient cross-border trading
capability through alliance with other exchanges," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Lee Kuan Yew noted that there is ample room for collaboration
in communications and information technology, adding that
Singapore and Hong Kong can strengthen institutional links by
cultivating the on-going exchanges between officials.
</P>
<P>
He said both Singapore and Hong Kong are rated at the top of
world competitive tables and both score high marks for honest and
efficient government that uphold the rule of law, and are
committed to free market.
</P>
<P>
"Both have much to gain from sharing information and experience
as we cooperate and compete against the world in a globalized
economy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Israel Enjoy Warm Bilateral Ties: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said Monday when inaugurating a "Israeli Prefabricated
Village" in quake-hit Sakarya province that Turkey and Israel are
enjoying warm relations.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that "our warm relations with Israel in recent
years have caused concern for some countries. They considered
these relations as a threat against their security. But they have
understood that the aim of the relations between Turkey and Israel
is not war, but peace. I believe the peace between us will bring
peace to the whole region."
</P>
<P>
The warm military relations between Turkey and Israel have
angered Arab countries in the Middle East, the semi-official
Anatolia news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel soon sent a 385-person search-rescue and medical team to
Turkey after the 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit western Turkey on
August 17, killing at least 17,000 people, injuring over 40,000
others and leaving over 500,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said "from the first moment after the earthquake on
August 17, we found Israel in all her power by our side. I want to
express my gratitude to all of the Jewish people for their
support."
</P>
<P>
"Israel immediately sent 500 prefabricated huts to Turkey, An
Israeli company sent humanitarian aid including 1,000 tons of
fresh food and clothings on vessel," added Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Israel also set up a clinic and school in the Israeli village
in Sakarya and the field hospital set up by Israel in quake-hit
Adapazari has served 1,100 patients till early September, Ecevit
said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak arrived in Sakarya Monday
morning for the inauguration of the Israeli village. He said that
the Israeli government, like many other states, had decided to
assist Turkey to heal the wounds of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the historical friendship between Turkish and
Israeli people, Barak said that "today with mixed feelings of
satisfaction and tremendous sorrow, we mark the transfer of this
village to the Turkish people and their government."
</P>
<P>
Israeli government has allocated 4.5 million U.S. dollars for
the prefabricated village project and Israeli nationals and Jewish
 organizations in the U.S. have donated nearly 1 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Always a Firm Supporter of China: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua)-- Ukraine is and will always be a
firm supporter of China, Ukrainian Ambassador to China Ihor A.
Lytvyn said today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during an interview with Xinhua at the
Ukrainian Embassy here on the occasion of the 55th anniversary of
Ukraine's liberation from fascist forces during the Second World
War, which falls on October 28.
</P>
<P>
China is among the first countries to officially recognize
Ukraine's independence and to offer support, noted the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Since then, bilateral cooperation has been developing rapidly
on the basis of mutual respect and benefit, according to the
ambassador. Frequent exchanges of visits by State leaders and high-
level officials in the last seven years serve as solid proof, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated Ukraine's firm stance in support of China on
such issues as Taiwan, Tibet and human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact that we don't have a common border, China is
the fourth largest trade partner of Ukraine, and my task here is
to make further efforts for development in trade links," he said,
citing that trade volume between the two partners amounted to 860
million U.S. dollars in 1998, and that the figure rose 47 percent
in the first six months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
What the two partners need most in economic cooperation, he
said, is to improve the investment climate, create more joint
ventures, and step up joint production.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Readjust Telecommunication Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official from
the Ministry of Information said today that China will further
readjust telecommunication fees in the next few years to gradually
bring the prices to a reasonable level.
</P>
<P>
"Prices of some business items will be raised while some others
will be decreased in the next few years, but the frequency of the
readjustment will be higher than before," said Zhang Xiaotie, Vice
Director of the Department of Financial Adjustment and Clearance.
</P>
<P>
The ministry today released a series of price readjustment
items, decreasing the prices for Internet access and the rent of
electric lines, easing the restriction on renting of digital lines
over two Megahertz and standardizing the price for installment and
relocation of telephones.
</P>
<P>
According to the new fees, the access fee for Internet will be
set at four yuan per minute, and the telephone charges for
Internet use will be cut by half.
</P>
<P>
For those customers using special lines, the access fee will be
cut by 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that the price readjustment aims to spur the use of
telecommunication services and promote the rapid development of
the sector. It's the second time the country has cut
telecommunication fees this year. The first readjustment was in
March.
</P>
<P>
The new readjustment scheme also reduced the rental rates of
analogue electric lines, the digital data lines and digital
electric lines by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that some of these readjustment items went into
effect on October 1, while some others will begin on November 1
and December 1.
</P>
<P>
He added that the development of new technology in the past
years has greatly changed the cost of telecommunication business,
so the price changes are inevitable.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senator Lauds Resumption of Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Senator Gregorio
Honasan lauded Monday the resumption of peace talks between the
government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), hoping it
will bring lasting peace in Mindanao in the southern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Honasan, chairman of the Senate Committee on Peace, Unification
and Reconciliation, made the comment as the government's peace
panel began a round of talks with MILF group led by its chieftain
Hashim Salamat.
</P>
<P>
Honasan expressed the hope that the renewed efforts to seek
peace will bring significant results by instituting social,
political and economic reforms in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the necessity for the congress to work out a
stable comprehensive national peace policy that would guide the
government's negotiations with the rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rodolfo Biazon, chairman of the Senate Committee on
Defense and Security, said the peace talks should start from the
lowest level of issues, escalating step by step to the highest
mechanism for reforms.
</P>
<P>
Biazon said the government and the MILF representatives will
state their respective positions, the MILF going for an
independent Islamic state and the government insisting on
constitutional processes and territorial integrity of the country.
</P>
<P>
"But these two irreconcilable positions are expected to be just
negotiating positions, which would eventually be deferred to more,
achievable agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of formal talks came after nearly three years of
arduous low-level negotiations by the two parties which were
further delayed by sporadic clashes between their respective
forces.
</P>
<P>
Monday's activity focused entirely on opening ceremonies of the
formal talks and sensitive issues will be discussed later by the
peace brokers in an agreed venue and date.

<HEADLINE> 4 Lebanese Freed by Pro-Israeli Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Four Lebanese were released
Monday by the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) from its Khiam
jail in south Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The four people, who were released for humanitarian reasons,
were sentenced to terms from months to two years on charges of
what the SLA called collaborating with the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is spearheading a guerrilla war
to oust Israeli occupation troops and their allied SLA out of
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
After the release, the four people would return home in the
Israel-occupied border zone, the radio quoted security sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 Lebanese were being detained in the Khiam jail without
trial.

<HEADLINE> '99 Winter Infrastructure Financing Seminar to Open In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The '99 Winter Infrastructure
Project-Financing Seminar will be held in the national capital
from November 30 to December 3.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is jointly sponsored by the Information Center of
the Ministry of Construction, and China office of the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).
</P>
<P>
Zhao Lurong, an official with the organizing committee, said
that China's infrastructure sectors have great untapped potential
since the country adopted a pro-active financial policy in 1998.
</P>
<P>
She said that China issued a total of 131 billion yuan (16
billion U.S. dollars) of treasury bonds in 1998, and 100 billion
yuan of bank loans to support construction of infrastructure
projects.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China's investment in infrastructure in the first
half of this year increased by 19.8 percent over the same period
last year, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with the Ministry of Finance, China
plans to issue 60 billion yuan of treasury bonds this year, and
China's total investment in infrastructure will rise to 300
billion yuan, taking bank loans into account.
</P>
<P>
Market observers said that the Bidding Law, to take effect in
January 2000, stipulates that all major infrastructure projects
take public bids for construction, and this will generates more
business opportunities for investors from home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Leaves no Room for Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Government Spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou Monday said the latest statements by Turkish
Premier Blent Ecevit have left no room for hope toward a Cyprus
settlement.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Washington Post and Newsweek, Ecevit
said it should be acknowledged that there are two autonomous
entities in Cyprus, echoing the Turkish Cypriots' demand before
negotiations become possible.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the international community has been trying to
bring the two sides to the negotiation table for reunification
through a bicommunal settlement. But no tangible progress has
been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The seven most industrialized nations plus Russia (G-8), in
their June summit in Cologne, Germany, asked the U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan to invite leaders of the two communities to
unconditional negotiations in the fall of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said the basis of negotiations for a settlement
already exists and the Turkish side should not be given the
opportunity to move away from it.
</P>
<P>
He called on Ecevit to clarify whether or not he backs
U.N. resolutions stipulating that it is the two communities
on the island that participate in negotiations for a settlement.

<HEADLINE> Sino-British Lifelong Learning Festival Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua)-- The first Sino-British Lifelong
Learning Festival opened Sunday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The event is organized by the Cultural and Education Section
of the British Embassy in China, supported by the Chinese Ministry
of Education and coordinated by the Chinese Education Association
for International Exchange (CEAIE).
</P>
<P>
The one-week festival will focus on such areas as enlightenment
learning, professional education and Internet education, all of
which aim to show the latest developments in lifelong learning in
China and Britain.
</P>
<P>
A series of professional seminars will be on the schedule.
Experts from China and Britain will discuss a wide range of topics,
including the problems involved in creating learning opportunities,
short cuts for studying, and the renovation of distance learning.
</P>
<P>
Li Shunxing, the general secretary of CEAIE, said that since
lifelong learning is a new concept in China, this Sino-British
festival is of great importance.
</P>
<P>
China's illiteracy rate stands at 15 percent for people 15
years or older, and 84 percent of the school-age youths in China
have entered primary or middle school, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He added that with the 21st century approaching, lifelong
learning is the top concern of education reform.
</P>
<P>
Martin Davidson, Li's British counterpart, said that lifelong
learning is accomplished not only at the workplace but in daily
life as well, and its purpose is to elevate the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
The organizers from both sides said they hope that the two
countries could find fields of common interest and further
exchanges and cooperation in lifelong learning.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Hosts Regional Conference on E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Regional Round Table on
Electronic Commerce and Development for Asia and Pacific Countries
opened Monday in Colombo to exchange experiences and establish a
platform for mutual cooperation within the region.
</P>
<P>
"This conference will be a valuable forum which will forge our
countries' E-commerce future from the initial stages it is in now
into a fully-fledged E-commerce community," said Sri Lankan
Minister of Internal and International Commerce and Food Kingsley
Wickramaratne.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, the minister said, "Internet
commerce in Asia will explode from roughly 500 million U.S.
dollars' annual revenue today to 30 billion dollars by the year
2001."
</P>
<P>
Despite the barriers and structural impediments prevalent in
many countries to exploit the positive advantages, the potentials
of E-commerce are far too great to be ignored, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Those who would close their mind to the cyber revolution will
run the risk of being marginalized and will fail to secure for
them a place on the 'Globalization Express'," said Wickramaratne.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, organized by the Sri Lankan Ministry
of Internal and International Commerce and Food and the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), brings together over
200 information technology personnel from key government,
intergovernment and private sector institutions from 35 Asia
Pacific countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Bruno Lanvin, head of E-commerce section of UNCTAD, told the
opening ceremony that the conference, the third of a series of
four regional round table meetings, will promote the Asia Pacific
to be the forefront players of the E-commerce in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting is a building block of the future
international cooperation as E-commerce has been on the agenda of
the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization which will
take place at the end of November in Seattle, the United States.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Stresses Policy on Building Socialism with Chinese Characteristics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
in a written interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro on the
eve of his visit to France, stressed China's adherence to the
course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that building socialism with Chinese characteristics
is suited to China's national conditions and serves the
fundamental rights of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
It is the only correct way to make China rich and powerful and
bring about well-being to its people, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the past 20 years since China carried out the reform and
opening-up policy, Jiang said that the late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping successfully initiated the course of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, and the country has enjoyed rapid
progress in its productive forces, comprehensive national strength
and the people's living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the disintegration of some socialist countries in the
1990s, Jiang predicted the final success of the socialist system,
although it will undergo many complications and failures during
its course of development.
</P>
<P>
The current world should be a world permitting peaceful co-
existence and mutual competition of different social systems,
including the socialist system, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people have learnt from their practice that only
socialism could save China and only socialism could develop China.
This is a historic truth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China's current economic situation, Jiang noted
that China, overcoming the difficulties caused by last year's
floods and the Asian financial crisis, had kept the economic
growth rate at 7.8 percent in 1998, and 7.6 percent in the first
half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Meets Chinese Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein Monday spoke highly of the relations with the Chinese
people and military.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah made the remarks in meeting with visiting Chinese
Defense Minister Chi Haotian who is on a four-day official and
friendly visit to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the three visits he had paid to China before coming
to the throne in February, the king said he had personally seen
the progress achieved in various fields in China and he saw these
changes with heartfelt respects.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan is a firm supporter of China and he will visit
China and meet Chinese leaders in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming visit will promote mutual understanding and help
further consolidate and develop relations between the two
countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Chi said he was glad to see, under the leadership
of King Abdullah, Jordan continuing to play an important role in
international and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chi also expressed satisfaction over the current relations
between the two countries, and said he hoped the ties will be
further consolidated and developed based on the five principles of
peaceful coexistence.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, Chi said that China stands
for a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the region, and
will work persistently toward that goal together with the world
community.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the king on China's domestic situation, Chi said that
Macau will soon return to the motherland, marking an important
step in the unification process of China.
</P>
<P>
He said China will stick to the "peaceful unification, one
country, two systems" principle on the Taiwan issue, and the "two
states" theory of Li Denghui from Taiwan is aimed at separating
Taiwan from the motherland and can not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Taiwan issue will not drag on permanently,
and Taiwan will eventually return to the arms of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Heading a 17-member delegation, Chi arrived in Amman on Friday,
the third leg of his four-nation Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
Chi had visit Syria and Israel and will travel on to Turkey
later Monday.

HONG KONG, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A combination of utilizing
electronic commerce and facilitating services to China's mainland
will lead to a "paradigm shift" in Hong Kong's economy, creating
opportunities for years to come, a senior trade official said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a forum of Overseas Hong Kong Business Associations
from around the Pacific Rim, Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC) Victor K. Fung said that Hong Kong's
role as an intermediary in trade and services would increase.
</P>
<P>
"Whether in connection with providing services or in
anticipation of China's further opening up, now is clearly the
time for Hong Kong to begin working more integrally as part of the
larger hinterland on the mainland, " Fung said.
</P>
<P>
He said that while the specifics of the paradigm shift for
services were not yet clear, it would, however, require a
rationalization in the way Hong Kong delivers services to the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
"It would mean working more closely with clients on site in the
mainland while remaining inextricably connected to the critical
mass of talent and information based in the global hub that is
Hong Kong," the TDC Chairman said, adding that it would also
require leveraging on advances in information technology.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is already taking important steps to capture new
opportunities created by technology and China's greater global
integration," Fung said, citing that "TDC is building a trade
portal web-site to develop Hong Kong as a trading hub in
cyberspace."
</P>
<P>
More than 60 leaders of overseas Hong Kong business
associations based in Australia, Canada, the United States, New
Zealand, and Japan are here for the forum, which comprises an
update on Hong Kong's economic development and discussion of
future areas for economic co-operation.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Issue, An European Issue: Italian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- President of the Italian
Chamber of Deputies (parliament) Luciano Violante said here Monday
that the Cyprus issue is a Mediterranean and European issue.
</P>
<P>
Violante, heading an Italian parliament delegation, arrived
here Sunday for an official visit at the invitation of his
Cypriot counterpart Spyros Kyprianou.
</P>
<P>
Violante said the Cyprus issue is not only an issue between
Greece and Turkey as many Europeans believe, adding he will
propose the Cyprus issue be discussed at the next meeting of the
Presidents of Mediterranean Parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Violante said the Cyprus issue is a Mediterranean issue becasue
the island is in the heart of the Mediterranean and a European
issue because Cyprus has the right to join the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Violante called on Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
and met Kyprianou as well as Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said Violante's visit proves "the Italian Chamber's
great interest in Cyprus, its future and peace and security in the
Mediterranean."
</P>
<P>
He said the two parliaments have embarked on a dialogue on the
Cyprus issue, Cyprus' EU accession, initiatives that the Italian
parliament could undertake and issues of concern to the region.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Star Barkley to Retire at End of Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Charles Barkley finally put
his money where his mouth is.
</P>
<P>
The outspoken power forward of the Houston Rockets made it
official Sunday, announcing at a preseason game near his hometown
that this season will be his last.
</P>
<P>
Barkley recently signed a one-year contract worth a reported $9
million. Through basketball and endorsements, he probably has made
close to $100 million in his 15-year career. And he decided to do
something with it.
</P>
<P>
"I made my mind up that I was really going to retire last
season," Barkley said during a speech at halftime of Houston's
exhibition game against the Detroit Pistons.
</P>
<P>
"I was doing an interview with a reporter, and he asked me a
really interesting question. He said you hear about athletes
making absurd amounts of money but you really don't hear about
them doing great things with it. And it really annoyed me, because
it was true.
</P>
<P>
"So I made up my mind that I was going to play this year and
that was going to be it, but what was I going to do with the money?
"
</P>
<P>
Barkley, who has talked about becoming governor of Alabama, is
going to give $1 million to three schools in his home state.
</P>
<P>
Barkley is one of just five players with 20,000 points and 10,
000 rebounds. He has received nearly every individual honor but
has yet to win a championship.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old has sat out the entire preseason with a
strained elbow. He has been hampered by injuires the past several
years, playing more than 70 games in a season just once from 1993-
98.
</P>
<P>
He is one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players, ranking 13th all-
time with 23,468 points and 15th with 12,337 rebounds. He reached
the NBA Finals in 1993, when his Phoenix Suns lost to Jordan's
Bull in six games. That season, Barkley was named Most Valuable
Player, averaging 25.6 points and 12.2 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Barkley is one of the most well-known athletes today, playing
for the "Dream Teams" that won gold medals at the Olympics in 1992
and 1996.

<HEADLINE> Lee Kuan Yew On Mainland, HK Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean Senior Minister
Lee Kuan Yew said here Monday that Hong Kong can maximize its
links with China's mainland in developing high technology.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote speech at the 4th anniversary dinner of
the Hong Kong Policy Research Institute, Lee said the opening-up
policy of the mainland has brought prosperity to Hong Kong in the
past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economic integration with the mainland accelerated
its transformation from a manufacturing to a service-based economy,
he said, noting that Hong Kong's service-based economy is now the
world's 9th largest exporter of commercial services.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is vast potential in high-tech
manufacturing and skills of Chinese engineers and Hong Kong
entrepreneurs are complementary.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's entrepreneurs have the savvy and ability to
commercialize innovations by Chinese scientists and translate them
into profits," he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the mainland can achieve five to seven
percent economic growth for the next 25 years and Hong Kong's
business with the mainland will increase.
</P>
<P>
While Hong Kong faces competition from China's developing ports
in Tianjin, Shanghai, Ningbo and Shenzhen, its value lies in being
different from other Chinese cities, Lee pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The rule of law, the transparency of all government legislation
and regulations, a level playing field for all players plus its
cosmopolitan lifestyle, with ease of communication in English, are
features Hong Kong's leaders and people keep retained, Lee Kuan
Yew said.

<HEADLINE> Police: Falun Gong Followers Leak State Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police have
investigated a number of cases involving Falun Gong followers who
have illegally obtained and leaked state secrets, the Ministry of
Public Security said here today.
</P>
<P>
Police have evidence that indicates members of the Falun Gong
cult, founded by Li Hongzhi, have in their possession 59
classified state documents, 20 of which are top-secret.
</P>
<P>
A senior police officer with the ministry said that the
evidence shows that Li Hongzhi and his banned organization not
only had political motives, but also used the Internet to spread
rumors based on information in their ill-gotten state documents,
which has created disturbances for the government and disrupted
social stability.
</P>
<P>
According to police, Li Tianming, head of the Falun Gong's
Weifang instruction center in east China's Shandong Province,
collected documents issued by the General Office of the Shandong
Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC). He then
copied the documents in large quantities, disseminated the copies,
and drafted the so-called "open letter addressing the state
leaders."
</P>
<P>
Police said the illegal Falun Gong organization has provided at
least ten classified state documents to overseas individuals or
organizations.

<HEADLINE> China Discloses 5-year Plan for Insurance Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China has outlined a five-year
plan to establish an insurance market system characterized by
diversified ownership, intensive management, a legalized
regulatory system and professional personnel.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the framework for China's insurance sector that
was discussed at a recent meeting held here by the China Insurance
Regulatory Commission (CIRC) and attended by senior officials of
domestically-owned insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yongwei, chairman of the CIRC, said at the meeting that the
insurance sector's development has been generally balanced and
healthy, but that it is also suffering from decreased growth rate
and dropping profits.
</P>
<P>
The official said these difficulties stem from a variety of
causes within insurance firms, and called on them to establish a
strict and effective internal control system and improve their
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of a five-year framework for the
development of the sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the CIRC's framework, domestically-owned insurance
firms would continue to play a major role in the market in the
next five years, during which they would form an effective
management system and be much more competitive in the market.
</P>
<P>
Stock-holding insurance firms would grow quickly and enjoy a
larger market share in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
The intermediary market would become an important part of the
insurance market and its size would be much larger, according to
the framework.
</P>
<P>
In the years ahead, China would further open its insurance
market, in which domestically-owned and overseas-funded insurance
firms would compete equally.
</P>
<P>
The chairman reminded insurance firms, especially life
insurance firms, to set up an effective risk prevention and
management system.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Reports High Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics show that
Tianjin, the north China port city, continues to register an
economic growth of 10.3 percent during the first three quarters
this year, compared to the national economic growth of 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The municipality realized 104.08 billion yuan in gross domestic
product during the period.
</P>
<P>
Accelerated industrial growth is regarded as a major driving
force which pushed up the municipal economy by seven percent. The
municipality achieved 46.07 billion yuan in industrial output
value during the first nine months, up 12 percent on the yearly
basis.
</P>
<P>
Due to the stimulative government policies and intensified
crackdown on smuggling, the energy and raw materials sectors
surged 20 percent and 66 percent, respectively, during the period,
while electronics, household electrical appliances, and high and
new technologies sectors have reported higher growth and continued
to serve as a major source of industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
The fast growth of the service sector, and recovering finance
and real estate sectors also contributed to the growth.
</P>
<P>
Increasing consumer demand and surging foreign trade are also
major factors behind the high economic growth. The municipality
reported a foreign trade turnover of 4.8 billion U.S. dollars
during the first nine months, a year-on-year increase of 23.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the high growth during the first three quarters,
economists said factors still exist that might hold the economic
growth such as declining fixed-asset investment and foreign
investment.

<HEADLINE> IFC Provides USD55.6m in Loans to Chinese Cement Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank signed an agreement today to
provide 55.6 million U.S. dollars in loans to the Lafarge
Dujiangyan Cement Company Ltd. in southwest China's Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The project is said to be one of the largest foreign investment
projects in China's inland area.
</P>
<P>
The Lafarge Dujiangyan Cement Plant is a joint venture between
the Lafarge China Offshore Holding Company Limited (LCOCH) and the
Dujiangyan Building Materials Corporation (DBMC).
</P>
<P>
The plant costs a total of 158.8 million dollars, with 75
percent from LCOCH and the other 25 percent from DBMC.
</P>
<P>
It would be the largest cement factory in southwest China with
an annual output of 1.2 million tons of quality cement, and would
use advanced environment-friendly technology.
</P>
<P>
IFC's 55.6-million-dollar financing package consists of 25.6
million dollars from its own account and a 30-million-dollar
syndicated loan.
</P>
<P>
Javed Hamid, IFC's Director for East Asia and the Pacific, said
the project would support the Chinese government's efforts to
improve the quality of infrastructure in the country's interior.
</P>
<P>
It would further boost the government's determination to shut
down older and smaller cement plants, which are often inefficient
in energy consumption and heavy polluters.

<HEADLINE> Psychological Problems Threaten Senior Citizen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese psychologists have
concluded that the aging population in Tianjin with psychological
problems is increasing rapidly, basing on an survey of 3,000
senior citizens above the age of 55.
</P>
<P>
Psychological problems the senior citizens are suffering from
include depression, schizophrenia and dementia, according to Feng
Zhiying, a psychological expert, who also called for immediate
attention to be paid to the problems.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that aged patients with psychological problems
accounted for ten percent of the city's total senior patients.
</P>
<P>
Feng attributed the issue to various reasons: loneliness and
discomfort as a result of the retirement, loss of family members,
frustrations, worry of death and other negative emotions.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that untimely and ineffective treatment of
such psychological diseases could do great harm to the physical
health of the patients, inducing vascular diseases in about one
third of them.
</P>
<P>
Feng said an effective way to reduce the occurrence of
psychological diseases among the senior citizens is for them to
have more nutritious food, keep on using brains, and actively
participate in social activities.
</P>
<P>
Love and support from their family members will also help the
old people to maintain mental health, Feng added.
</P>
<P>
China has the largest elderly population in the world,
including 120 million aged over 60 years and nine million aged
above 80 years.

ADDIS ABABA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned Ethiopian
Telecommunications Corporation will invite foreign consultants to
estimate its total assets so as to attract strategic equity
partners, an industrial official said.
</P>
<P>
Tilahun Kebede, General Manager of the Ethiopian Telecom Agency
(ETA), said Sunday that independent and efficient foreign
consultants would estimate current values of the corporations
assets ranging from buildings to implements.
</P>
<P>
He said studies are underway to designate the volume of share

and the experiences of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Prospective partner will have to chose one area among the

</P>
<P>
Shareholders are expected to comply with a set of directives in
the framework of the country's development program.
</P>
<P>
They will have say on ETA's administrative, business and
technical matters as they pledge to work jointly with the
Ethiopian government, the general manager said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Economic Development and Cooperation Minister Girma
Birru said in late September that Ethiopia would open its

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran earned 52 million U.S. dollars from the exports
of sea products last Iranian calendar year (ending March 20), an
official from Iran's Fisheries Company said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sea creatures output would reach 300,000 tons by the end of the
third five-year plan (2000-2005), creating 60,000 jobs in the
fishery sector, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Hassan
Salehi as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the period, the country's per capita fish
consumption would reach nine kilograms from the current 5.2
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia is in need of an estimated 1,000 new
schools over the coming 10 years at a total cost of about 30
billion rials (8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Saudi cabinet has approved a plan by the Education Ministry
on build schools in cooperation with the private sector, said
Undersecretary of Education in charge of buildings and school
equipment Abdulla Al Fawzan.
</P>
<P>
After the implementation of the project, modern school
buildings will replace those rented ones that currently house over
4,000 schools, local press quoted the official as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- The Yemeni government has decided to liquidate the
Yemeni Industrial Bank before the end of December because of
unsettled debts amounting to 15 million U.S. dollars, local
reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bank, the capital of which is 70 percent owned by the
public sector, has financed about 230 industrial projects in Yemen
with a total cost of 3.7 million dollars ever since its
establishment in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Total foreign reserves at Yemen's Central Bank have
risen from 1 billion U.S. dollars in mid 1999 to 1.2 billion
dollars by the end of September due to the considerable
improvement in oil prices on world markets.
</P>
<P>
The rise in reserves would enable Yemen to meet its imports
needs for basic commodities for six months at least, said an
official source at the central bank.
</P>
<P>
It was attributed to the country's improved economic
performance, rise in petroleum revenues, the successful
implementation of the government's austerity policy, growth in tax
revenues.
</P>
<P>
The central bank was able to maintain stability of the currency
and would possibly intervene in the supply and demand market at
any point to provide equilibrium and prevent speculation, said the
source.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Says Multi-Polarization Benefits World Peace, Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said that the multi-polarization of the world is an objective
trend that is independent of man's will during its course of
development.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro, Jiang said
that the development in the trend of world multi-polarization is
conducive to promoting the establishment of a just and reasonable
international political and economic order and benefits world
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
"There may be twists and turns in the process of multi-
polarization, but the fact that the world moving toward multi-
polarization is an objective trend independent of man's will,"
said the Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to build a unipolar world runs counter to the
historical trend of development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Historical lessons deserve the attention of the people, Jiang
said. "The world has seen hegemonic powers of one kind or another
in history and when they reigned they behaved in an extremely
arrogant way. They pursued the logic that power justifies all.
They tyrannized the weak wherever they went, stirred up chaos in
the world and subjected the people of the countries they bullied,
as well as their own people, to disasters and the abyss of misery.
But eventually, all of them fell down and collapsed."
</P>
<P>
With the end of the Cold War, the days are gone when two
superpowers contended for hegemony. However, the world affairs are
not be allowed to be decided by a single country, the Chinese
president said. "The future world should be a multi-polarized,
colorful one in which all countries work together for common
development."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China pursues a foreign policy of peace,
independence and self-reliance. It is willing to develop friendly
relations with all countries in the world on the basis of five
principles of peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to its ties with the United
States, France and other developed countries, and it also
treasures its cooperation with developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China will never seek hegemony nor the status of a superpower.
This is a solemn commitment made by the Chinese people to the
world, " the Chinese president said.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Adamant in Refusing to Extradite Bin Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
Monday again ruled out the handover of the alleged terrorist Osama
bin Laden to the United States, saying nobody has produced
evidence of his involvement in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The United States was behind the U.N. Security Council
announcement on October 14 threatening imposition of economic
sanctions against the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan if bin Laden
was not handed over to Washington within a month," said a
statement issued by the Afghan Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
Taliban Charge d'Affairs in Pakistan Maulvi Saeedur Rehman
Haqqani said in the statement that the handover of bin Laden "is
not the real issue" as "the world people in general and Afghans in
particular know as to what is the real objectives of the United
States."
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to hold talks on bin Laden issue with the United
States or any other country provided they present arguments and
proposals in this regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nobody has so far produced any authentic evidence to prove bin
Laden's involvement in terrorism, Haqqani said.
</P>
<P>
The United States accuses bin Laden of having masterminded the
bomb blasts at U.S. embassies in East Africa last year and has
been pressing the Taliban to extradite the Saudi dissident.
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that bin Laden is a Mujahid (holy warrior) who has
taken refuge in Afghanistan. Now his fate is linked with the
religious decree of the religious scholars," the Taliban envoy
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports reaching here said high-level officials from
the Taliban and the United States would likely open talks on the
bin Laden issue Monday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia has expressed the willingness to negotiate
with Washington on the issue. "Kabul favors good relations with
Washington," said the militia's top information official Mulla
Amir Khan Muttaqi Saturday.

<HEADLINE> China to Keep Improving Legislation System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China will maintain the system
of authorizing state organs to formulate administrative laws and
regulations as a complement to its existing legal system,
according to a national legislature meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
A senior legislator told the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC) that it is necessary to maintain and
improve the legislative system, under which governmental bodies
are authorized to make laws, since the legal system is still not
perfect.
</P>
<P>
"For example, the State Council can issue some administrative
regulations on market economy, insurance and taxation as interim
measures before the situation is ready for legislation," explained
Zhang Chunsheng, vice-chairman of Commission of Legislative
Affairs of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The preservation of the current legislation system has been
written into the draft of the Legislation Law, which is under
discussion in the seven day session.
</P>
<P>
The draft is meant to ensure the authorized government bodies
will exercise legislative powers within certain limits, while
asking the NPC and its Standing Committee to work out relevant
laws as soon as the legislation condition is mature.
</P>
<P>
China's Constitution had twice empowered the State Council to
promulgate administrative decrees or regulations in a move to
strengthen the government administration by law.
</P>
<P>
The practice has had a positive effect on the country's
economic and legal system construction, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
However, he believed that the delegated legislation system
would eventually become less important as a result of the
perfection of the legal system.

</P>
<P>
According to the French president, exchanges and cooperation
between French and Chinese leaders should be regular, especially
in the political field.
</P>
<P>
"Leaders of the two countries have attached great importance
to eliminating disputes through dialogues, and that explains why I
invited Jiang to my private residence and held such lengthy talks,
" Chirac said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The China-U.S. Joint Economic
Committee (JEC) held its 12th session here today with both sides
agreeing to continue to push forward the cooperative relations
between the two countries in the fields of economy, trade,
treasury and finance.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng and U.S. Secretary
of Treasury Lawrence Summers co-presided over the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The one-day event is mainly aimed to promote cooperative
relations between China and the United States, which Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton emphasized
at their meeting in New Zealand in September.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that China's position has always been positive on
its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). He pointed
out that China consistently maintains that WTO is a world
organization, "and as such, it will not be complete without the
participation of China, the biggest developing country."
</P>
<P>
He said that China will join WTO only as a developing country
member and on the principle that its rights and obligations must
be balanced.
</P>
<P>
Xiang noted that over the past 20 years, the Ministry of
Finance and the U.S. Treasury have engaged in regular dialogue
through the JEC mechanism to implement the principles for
cooperation worked out jointly by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"This mechanism has helped promote the mutual understanding and
cooperation between our two countries in economic, trade, fiscal
and financial areas, contributing significantly to the healthy
development of our relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that soon after the last JEC session held in Washington
in May, 1998, President Clinton visited China in return for
President Jiang Zemin's 1997 visit to the U.S.. And the two heads
of states met again in Auckland, New Zealand, in September.
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji also made a successful visit to the U.S.
in April.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and French President Jacques Chirac said that although there
still exist differences between them on human rights, they still
think the best way to solve the differences is to keep on
dialogues.
</P>
<P>
They made this statement to the press after holding talks here
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Chinese government has attached importance
to human rights and made great efforts to promote their
development since New China was founded 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Remarkable progress has been made since then," Jiang said,
adding that the European Union's attack on China's human rights is
baseless.
</P>
<P>
China and France have different national realities, different
geographic location and different level of development, Jiang said.
"So it's quite normal for the two countries to have some

Chirac said that China and Europe, and China and France have a
great deal of common understanding. "However, we never want to
cover up our differences."

"That's why President Jiang and I have held such long talks

</P>
<P>
China is going to be an economic and cultural power in the

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin: State Visit to France Achieves Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here on Monday that he has achieved his purpose of increasing
understanding between Chinese and French leaders during his
current visit here.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the press after holding talks with French
President Jacques Chirac, Jiang said that when Chinese leaders
make a visit to a foreign country, they always intend to increase
understanding with the leaders of their host country and increase
the understanding between the peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the information technology has made the
world seem smaller, it is very important to increase mutual
understanding between countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China's knowledge about other countries may not
be enough, but he found that the knowledge about China possessed
by Western countries is even more inadequate.
</P>
<P>
The only way to make up for this lack of understanding is to
increase mutual understanding between the leaders of China and
Western countries, and to have face-to-face talks with each other,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his talks with President Chirac have helped
achieve this purpose.
</P>
<P>
"I have held long-time and in-depth talks with President Chirac.
I can say that this is the first time that I have ever held such
lengthy and in-depth talks during my meetings with foreign leaders,
" said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said that both Chirac and himself have fully expressed their
respective views, which is very important to increasing mutual
understanding.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Asset Management Firm Signs Debt-to-Equity Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The China Orient Asset
Management Corporation (COAMC) today signed its first debt-to-
equity agreement with the Jiangxi Phoenix Optic Instrument (Group)
Co., Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the COAMC will change the 90 million yuan debt
owed to it into equities of the Phoenix group in central China's
Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chaosong, chairman of the Phoenix group, said the deal
would reduce the group's debt from 69 percent of its asset to 41
percent and would save it seven million in financial costs a year.
</P>
<P>
He said the deal would help his company establish a modern
enterprise system and lay a sound foundation for its future
development.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese government's policy for debt-equity
conversion, the COAMC would eventually cut its ties with the
Phoenix group through equity transfer and other means if the deal
proves successful in turning the group into a profitable company.
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix group is a large state-owned enterprise with
relatively advanced technology and products among Chinese
opticians.
</P>
<P>
However, the company has been unprofitable in years past due to
capital shortage and heavy financial burdens.
</P>
<P>
The COAMC was founded in mid-October to deal with the bad
assets of the Bank of China. It is one of the four similar firms
set up by the Chinese government to deal with the bad loans of its
commercial banks.

the Chinese people as well as the Japanese people themselves.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that younger generations will learn from
the past, and prevent the tragedy from being repeated.

They should promote mutual understanding and trust, expand

<HEADLINE> China Vows To Expand Coal Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China, the world's leading coal
producer, will try every means to expand its coal export, said a
top official of the industry here today.
</P>
<P>
China expects to export 38.5 million tons of coal this year, or
six million tons more than the 1998 figure, due to greater efforts
to this endeavor, said Zhang Baoming, director of the country's
Coal Industry Administration.
</P>
<P>
China produces 1.2 billion tons of coal, or one-third of the
world's total, each year.
</P>
<P>
However, the country exported only around 30 million tons of
coal annually over the past few years, accounting for merely six
percent of the world's total coal trade.
</P>
<P>
The official said that to expand coal export is of great
significance for the sustainable development of the country's coal
industry, which can effectively reduce coal stockpile and achieve
balance between coal supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the expansion of the coal exports will make the
country's coal sector more open to the rest of the world, and help
turn the coal sector from being extensive to intensive in terms of
management and operation.
</P>
<P>
At present, supply exceeds demand in coal markets both at home
and abroad. The dwindling demand for coal, lowering prices and
fierce competition for market shares have made it difficult for
China to increase coal export.

BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, expressed his
satisfaction with the development of Sino-Philippine friendly ties
here today during his meeting with a delegation from the
Philippine Senate.
</P>
<P>
Li told the Philippine delegation headed by Senator Franklin
Drilon that recent years have witnessed expansion of bilateral
cooperation in various fields between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 will mark the 25th anniversary of the
establishment of the diplomatic relations between the two friendly
neighbors, and China would like to join hands with the Philippines
to further the long-term and stable good-neighborly ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the delegation's current visit to China is
beneficial to enhancing the understanding between the two sides
and to furthering the relations between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Li also called on the parliaments of the two countries to work
for the smooth development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He briefed the guests on China's economic development and the
reform of State-owned enterprises at their request.
</P>
<P>
Drilon said that in the past 11 years he has visited China
three times, during which he witnessed the great economic
achievements China has scored.
</P>
<P>
As the Philippines is facing the same problems on its State-
owned enterprise reform, the country has always paid attention to
China's experience in this regard, he added.
</P>
<P>
Drilon is satisfied with the development of the Philippine-
China relations in recent years, saying that he would continue to
make his contributions to strengthening the friendship and

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of China's
National People's Congress Standing Committee, met with a French
delegation led by Senator Charles Pasqua here later today.
</P>
<P>
Li hoped the visit would allow the guests to see and understand
more about China's development.
</P>
<P>
He reviewed the history of Sino-French exchanges and told the
guests that the Chinese people appreciated the hospitality
extended by the French people and President Jacques Chirac to
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who was on a state visit to France.
</P>
<P>
On international affairs, Li pointed out that the world is
still far from complete peace after the Cold War. "China believes
that the world should be multi-polar instead of single-polar, for
a single-polar world can be a world of imbalance," he told the
guests.
</P>
<P>
Also, he stressed that the development path of a country could
only be chosen by its own people and state sovereignty should
never be infringed upon.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that China opposed such rhetoric as "human rights
over sovereignty," for it provided an excuse to interfere into
another country's sovereignty. "China and France share identical
or similar views on such issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pasqua told Li that one of the basic principles of the French
foreign policy set forth by General Charles de Gaulle specified
that people of a country have the right to choose their social
system in accordance with their own historic and cultural
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
He agreed with Li's views on a multi-polar world, saying that
only a multi-polar world can ensure world stability. State
sovereignty is important, he said, adding that the "interference
theory" has caused instability in certain regions.
</P>
<P>
The only superpower in the world not only considers its social
system the best in the world, but also always wishes to impose
this system upon others, he said.
</P>
<P>
He told Li that the European Union should be more unified and
independent from the United States. "We should defend our
independence and sovereignty," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also commented on the success of the ongoing state visit by
President Jiang.

Pasqua and his party are here as guests of the NPC's Foreign

Asefi's remarks came after Pakistani military ruler General
Pervez Musharraf met Iranian ambassador to Islamabad Serajeddin
Mousavi on Friday. He termed the meeting as "useful and positive."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the expansion of mutual relations between the two
neighbors would accelerate the establishment of peace and
stability in the entire region.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Musharraf pledged to make great efforts to
further expand bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Pakistan have cooled down as Tehran
accused Islamabad of supporting the Afghan ruling Taliban forces,
which killed eight Iranian diplomats and a reporter in northern
Afghanistan in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has also blamed Islamabad for failing to guarantee
security for Iranian citizens in Pakistan as over a dozen of
Iranians were murdered in Pakistan during the past five years.

<HEADLINE> China to Formulate Legislation Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua)-- China's highest legislative body
is seeking a legal solution to conflicts and confusion arising
from miscommunication among different departments in the process
of lawmaking.
</P>
<P>
The Commission of Legislative Affairs of the National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee today submitted a draft of the
Legislation Law to the ongoing 12th session of the NPC Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Numerous disputes have come about during law enforcement
because laws and regulations issued by different departments often
contradict each other, said a senior legislator.
</P>
<P>
Compared with some 350 laws and regulations published by the
NPC and its Standing Committee in the past two decades, the State
Council drew up more than 700 administrative regulations within 20
years and local legislatures and governments issued over 4,200
regulations in the recent five years.
</P>
<P>
"The rush of administrative regulations issued by governments
at various levels has brought some problems to the enforcement
work. So it is necessary to confirm limits of authority," Zhang
Chunsheng, vice chairman of the commission, explained the bill to
legislators.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, if the NPC Standing Committee affirms
that a regulation goes against the constitution or law, the
committee can instruct the relevant administrative body to revise
or repeal it.
</P>
<P>
The draft further defines the exclusive legislation scope of
the NPC and its Standing Committee, which includes enforcement
measures relating to citizens' rights of political and personal
freedom; civil codes on real rights, obligatory rights,
intellectual property rights, marriage and inheritance; lawsuits
and enforcement systems and some other major items concerning the
fundamental systems of politics, economy and laws of the state.
</P>
<P>
The draft provides detailed stipulations on the limits of
authority the regulations have at various levels.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chunsheng stressed that the legislation law, if adopted,
would help to standardize legislative work and implementation of
the rule of law in China.

HONG KONG, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Futures

<P>
HONG KONG, October 25 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition entitled "
Innovation 2000 - the Millennium Frontier" will be held from
November 26 to 30 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is held in response to the initiatives of the
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (
HKSAR) Tung Chee Haw's vision of developing Hong Kong into an
innovation and technology center for the region.
</P>
<P>
The event is co-organized by the Industry Department of the
HKSAR and the Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference announcing details of the event,

mainly exported to overseas markets and local people know little
about the technology contents of these products."
</P>
<P>
"Innovation 2000 aims to arouse public awareness of the
importance of innovation and technology to our daily lives. It
will also provide a platform for local companies, universities and
industry support organizations to demonstrate their innovative and
technological capabilities," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of the new millennium, we are entering a knowledge-
based and digitized society," Tang said, adding that "Innovation
will increasingly be a key enabling factor to meet the challenges
of the new era."
</P>
<P>
Over 300 exhibitors will display their innovative products and
technologies at the exhibition, including Hong Kong's major and
growing industries such as garment, toys, watch and clock, jewelry
and optical, information technology, according to Tang.
</P>
<P>
Tang expected the exhibition to attract over 100,000 local and
overseas visitors.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Religious Report Disregards Truth: Chinese Christian Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department's
Annual Report on International Religious Freedom for 1999 has no
regard for the truth in China, says a Chinese Christian leader.
</P>
<P>
"I'm astounded at its charges against China's policy on
religion. They are really unfair," said Han Wenzao, president of
the China Christian Council (CCC) in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Han said that the report irresponsibly condemned religious
affairs in many countries, including China, threw mud at China for
no reasons, listed China as a country for "special concern" based
on the Religious Freedom Act, and went so far as to threaten China
with sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"The entire Chinese religious circle, including the CCC, will
never accept these groundless accusations," Han said.
</P>
<P>
Han, who is also a Standing Committee member of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, became deputy director-general of the CCC in 1980 when
the council was established, and assumed his present position in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Han said that the past two decades have been the best period
for religion in the country, when the number of religious
believers and places of worship grew at the fastest rate on record.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Christianity, Han said, the total number of
followers has increased 17.5 times to top 13 million from the 700,
000 in 1949, when the People's Republic was founded, a jump much
bigger than the country's population growth.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 13,000 Christian churches and about 25,
000 meeting places across China, with some 2,000 clergymen and 70,
000 other church workers.
</P>
<P>
The CCC has set up 18 seminaries which have had a total of 3,
500 graduates, he said. And plans are underway for construction of
two more.
</P>
<P>
Han said that Chinese Christians have their own publishing
house, the Nanjing Amity Printing Co., Ltd., which is specially
engaged in the printing of Christian works.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, over 30 million copies of Christian books, including
20 million copies of the Bible, have been printed, according to
Han. Religious organizations from Canada, the Netherlands, Spain
and several other foreign countries and regions also have their
holy scriptures printed here.
</P>
<P>
Copies of the Bible are available at churches nationwide, Han
said.

<HEADLINE> Shell Commits $1.8Bln to Develop Nigerian Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Shell Petroleum Development
Company has committed 1.8 billion U.S. dollars to develop the E.A.
Oil and Gas Field discovered 35 years ago with an estimated
reserve of 350 million barrels, a company statement said.
</P>
<P>
One billion dollars would be spent on the field located in the
Shallan off-shore waters, 90 kilometers southwest of Warri in the
Niger Delta area, External Relations Manager of the company,
Precious Omuku said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
According to Omuku, the remaining fund is used to expand the
capacity at the 3.8-billion-dollar Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas
plant with a third processing train and related infrastructure,
the Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the Shell company, Ron Van Berg, also said
that the decision on the investment project is a vote of
confidence in the future of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"We have demonstrated our faith in the future of Nigeria and
the development of the Niger Delta in particular," Berg said.
</P>
<P>
When the project comes fully on stream in the second half of
2002, it is expected to produce 120,000 barrels of crude oil
everyday and supply 90 million standard cubic feet of gas per day
to the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas .
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group Phil Watts
said that " this is part of the largest program of inward
investment ever in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa."
</P>
<P>
The 1.8 billion dollars represent the second tranche of the 8.5
billion dollars integrated investment program announced earlier
this year by the Dutch/Shell Company for Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Shell, the leading oil producing company operating in the west
African country, has over one million barrels production capacity
per day but its current output is estimated at 930,000 barrels per
day.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Invites Tenders Bid for Revoked Oil Blocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is
scheduled to invite tenders to bid for the revoked deep water
blocks along with other unallocated blocks in order to expand oil
production and reserve.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government is working on the guidelines for the
bidding round, but should be completed before the end of the year,
said Rilwanu Lukman, Special Adviser to the President on Petroleum
and Matters.
</P>
<P>
The Obasanjo administration has planned to increase crude oil
production to three million barrels per day and oil reserves to 30
billion barrels by 2003, This Day newspaper Monday quoted Lukman
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, we have a production ceiling of some 1.8
million barrels per day and our production capacity is over two
million barrels per day," the presidential adviser said, adding
that Nigeria is scheduled to increase daily production to four
million barrels and oil reserve to 40 billion barrels by the year
of 2010.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government in July this year cancelled on merit 16
oil licenses which had been awarded to local companies by the
governments of late General Sani Abacha and General Abdulsalami
Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Following the assumption of office in May, President Olusegun
Obasanjo suspended the licenses and set up a contracts review
committee.
</P>
<P>
The 16 oil licenses were subsequently revoked based on the
recommendations of the committee headed by Christopher Kolade.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A famous young general of the
Armed Forces of Angola died in an unexpected mine explosion last
Saturday , media reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Simione Mucune, Lieutenant General of the Angolan government
army, was killed when he struck an anti-tank mine on his way of a
routine mission in Andulo, long-term headquarters of the UNITA
rebels, which was just been taken over by the government troops a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
During the just-ended offensive on Bailundo and Andulo, Mucune
was a commander of the troops which went through the Huambo and
Bie provinces and succeeded in conquering the two most important
bastions for the rebel National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Official Journal of Angola newspaper published an eye-catching
story with photos in its first page, mourning the death of Mucune
and singing high praise for his historical heroic deeds during the
bitter defensive warfare of Kuito in 1993 and 1994.

<HEADLINE> China Considers Amending Criminal Codes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China is mulling over
amendments to its 1997 criminal codes as it continues to intensify
crackdowns on dishonest accountants, irresponsible officials and
unscrupulous futures traders.
</P>
<P>
A draft of the amendments tabled by the top legislature here
today was based on two draft decisions on crimes violating the
laws covering accountants and crimes relating to futures trading.
</P>
<P>
Gu Angran, vice-chairman of the NPC Law Committee, said that
because China put into effect a comprehensive statute on criminal
penalties just two years ago, the legislature will no longer make
separate ordinances or decrees on criminal punishment in the
future, but instead will amend the existing laws.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft amendments, accountants found to have
forged papers, reports and committed other acts which have had
serious consequences shall be sentenced to up to five years in
prison and/or fines of up to 200,000 yuan. And officials who are
directly responsible for or misuse their power to forge accounts
may face the same punishment.
</P>
<P>
Ultimate penalties for officials who have been found derelict
in their duties and whose actions have had serious consequences
will receive seven-year prison terms instead of the current three,
the draft says.
</P>
<P>
People engaged in inside trading, creating and spreading false
information and who are responsible for the significant financial
losses of others shall be given prison terms of up to 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Stock Exchange to Hike Guarantee Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange
(PSE) said Monday it will raise enough funds by collecting five
percent from the volume traded daily to increase its standing
guarantee fund which will be used to keep the exchange afloat.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, PSE President and Chief Executive Officer Jose
Luis Yulo confirmed that the PSE was on the brink of collapse
because the share price of BW Resources experienced unusual
movement recently.
</P>
<P>
Yulo discounted the possibility that the PSE will crash as
claimed by Stock Exchange Commission Chairman Perfecto Yasay last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Yulo claimed that the PSE will have enough
funds to avert any impending collapse of the local stock market
considering that it generates millions of pesos from the volume of
shares traded daily at the exchange.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the guarantee fund will automatically
fluctuate depending on the value of shares accumulated at the end
of each trading day.
</P>
<P>
Yulo also shrugged off rumors that the PSE failed to halt the
trading of BW Resources shares of stocks from October 11 to 14,
1999 for allegedly manipulating BW's share prices during the
period.
</P>
<P>
According to the PSE chief, the trading of BW shares did not
break the PSE rules and regulations, adding that nothing bad
happened which is against the established trading rules of the
PSE.
</P>
<P>
He also clarified that the PSE does not impose any ceiling on
the volume of shares traded, and the only rule that the PSE has is
on the price movement.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Comments on Falun Gong's Harms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said that Falun Gong in China, like the cults the United States,
Japan and Europe, is harmful to the society and people and should
not be allowed to go unchecked.
</P>
<P>
In a written interview with the French newspaper La Figaro on
the eve of his visit to France, Jiang said that according to
incomplete statistics, Falun Gong has claimed the lives of more
than 1,400 practitioners, with many others becoming insane and
families ruined.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that most people began practicing Falun Gong for
health reasons and were unaware of the illegal activities of the
schemers, organizers and core members of Falun Gong. Once they
knew the truth of the anti-social, anti-scientific and anti-human
nature of Falun Gong, he said, they made a clear break with the
cult.
</P>
<P>
He noted that despite scientific and cultural advance in today'
s world, some cult organizations such as the Branch Davidian Cult
in the United States, the Aum Shinrikyo in Japan and the Order of
the Solar Temple in Europe still emerged to harm the physical and
mental health of the general public and jeopardize the normal
social order.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this phenomenon is of global implications and no
responsible government should let such cult activities go
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China is making efforts to overcome the
influence of such feudal superstitions and decadent ideas and to
develop a modern socialist culture.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Back from Abroad Contribute to China's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Scientists and scholars
returning from abroad have played an important role in upgrading
the educational structure and improving the research and
development at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Bai Chunli, vice-president of the CAS made the remarks at a
forum in Beijing today attended by people who came back to China
after completing their studies abroad.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, CAS had sent 14,000 people to study in
more than 40 countries and regions, said Bai, and over 9,000 of
them have returned to work in the CAS.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 2,100 returnees showed that about 80 percent of
them have received state and provincial awards for scientific
achievements, or have made scientific findings which can lead to
good economic results, or have published papers in eminent
scientific periodicals at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the CAS had recruited more than 200 people
from outside the academy through the "One Hundred People Project."
About 70 percent of them were Chinese back from abroad.
</P>
<P>
The CAS plans to employ 300 to 600 outstanding scholars from
overseas via the project during the next few years, said Bai,
adding that the CAS will also invite 200 outstanding scientists
from China and abroad to be senior visiting scholars every year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CAS is carrying out reforms in its management
and logistics systems, and will provide a better living and
working environment for its employees.

<HEADLINE> China to Revise Law for Product Quality Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers are to revise
the existing law on the quality of manufactured goods so as to
effectively punish those companies making shoddy products.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendments to the law will prohibit local
governments or departments from protecting persons responsible for
poor-quality goods and covering up illegal practices, according to
sources attending the 12th session of the National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee which started here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The country's top legislative body is considering giving more
power to central and local law enforcement organs in the field.
</P>
<P>
Some small factories in localities are churning out fake goods
randomly, and some manufacturers have even resisted legal
intervention, Li Chuanqing, director of the State Bureau of
Quality and Technical Supervision, said when explaining the draft
amendments to the legislators.
</P>
<P>
The amendments will also prohibit officials from illegally
protecting producers of fake goods, and will punish them according
to the severity of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
Those punished would not be permitted to conduct any business
in the field for a period of three years, the amendments said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the manufacturers of shoddy goods would be heavily
fined.
</P>
<P>
The state will implement a production quality certification
system on those goods which might endanger people's health and
property, according to the amendments.

<HEADLINE> West Bank-Gaza Safe Passage Opens After Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A safe passage route linking the
West Bank and Gaza opened Monday, more than three weeks behind
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The land link for the first time enables Palestinians to move
relatively freely between the two Palestinian self-rule areas on
the flanks of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The first Palestinian vehicle took to the route at 10 a.m.
local time (08:00 GMT) from Beit Hanoun/Erez in Gaza, heading for
Tarkumiyah, south of the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest peace deal with the Palestinians, Israel
pledged to open two safe passage routes - the southern route on
October 1 and the northern one October 31.
</P>
<P>
But the launch of the first one was delayed twice due to the
difference between the two sides on how to operate the route.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony for the opening of the passage,
Palestinian Minister of Civil Affairs Jamil Tarif described it as
a historical step and a great achievement for the peace process
because the Gaza Strip is for the first time linked to the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The southern safe passage route runs 44 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> WHO Begins Work on World's First Public Health Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from the member
states of the World Health Organization (WHO) and nongovernmental
organizations have begun working on the Framework Convention on
Tobacco Control (FCTC), the world's first multilaterally
negotiated public health treaty.
</P>
<P>
"I urge the world's leaders to take those decisions necessary
to protect future generations from an entirely avoidable cause of
disease and death," said WHO Director-General Dr Gro Harlem
Brundtland here Monday at the opening meeting on the FCTC. The
treaty aims to reduce the global use of tobacco and thereby reduce
tobacco-related deaths in the next century.
</P>
<P>
"We have a formidable challenge ahead of us, but together we
can give the world a policy tool with which to control tobacco,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco kills four million people per year, according to WHO
statistics. WHO's tobacco control program, the Tobacco Free
Initiative(TFI), estimates that if unchecked, this silent epidemic
could kill 10 million people a year by 2030, more than 70 percent
of them being in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
There are now 1.2 billion smokers around the world. WHO warns
that if new actions are not introduced, the figure could rise to 1.
6 billion in the first quarter of the next century.
</P>
<P>
WHO's tobacco control program was launched last May when its
governing body, the 191-member World Health Assembly, unanimously
backed a resolution calling for work to begin on the FCTC. This is
the first time in its 50-year history that WHO is exercising its
constitutional mandate to negotiate a convention.

suppliers are now looking for new markets for their products," he

</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said he was keen to discuss how sports at all levels,
including the Olympic Games, could be made drug free.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Ruling Coalition to Activate Election Machinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The component parties of
Malaysia's ruling coalition Barisan Nasional (BN) (National Front)
were Monday directed to activate their election machineries
without having to wait until nomination day.
</P>
<P>
Giving the directive, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who is
also BN chairman, said this called for cooperation among BN
component parties in setting up and activating operations rooms in
all constituencies.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the BN Supreme Council Monday agreed to set up a
BN manifesto drafting committee to be chaired by Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and a BN information committee to
be headed by the BN backbone party UMNO (United Malays National
Organization) Secretary General Khalil Yaakob to gather questions
and issues requiring the coalition's attention, Mahathir told a
press conference after chairing the meeting here.
</P>
<P>
On the much-expected announcement of the schedule of the next
general election by him, Mahathir did not give any particular
schedule, saying only: "The election will be definitely before
July next" which is the due time for the next general election.
</P>
<P>
Although the election is yet to be scheduled, the opposition
alliance Barisan Alternatif (Alternative Front) comprising four
major parties -- Democratic Action Party (DAP), Islam Party
Malaysia (PAS), Parti Keadilan Nasional (National Justice Party)
and Parti Rakyat (People's Party) Malaysia -- already announced
its election manifesto on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition also announced its plan to "table an alternative
Budget 2000" on Wednesday, two days before the government's
scheduled presentation of the 2000 Budget in Parliament on Friday.
</P>

<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The new governors of
Pakistan's three provinces Monday took oath of office amidst legal
controversy as to whether they can do so at a time when the
Constitution is suspended.
</P>
<P>
In respective provincial capitals, Chief Justices of High
Courts administered oath to the new governors of Punjab, Sindh and
Balochistan provinces.
</P>
<P>
Lt. General (Retired) Muhammad Safdar, Air Marshal (Retired)
Muhammad Azim Daudpota and Justice (Retired) Amir-ul-Mulk Mengal

Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) issued by Chief Executive
of Pakistan General Pervaiz Musharraf on October 15 when the
Constitution was suspended.

oath under the PCO without themselves taking oath under that
order, the law secretary said that it was not necessary for the
judges to take fresh oath.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR),
Monday stressed that the top priority should go to sustainable
growth in Hong Kong in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks at an opening ceremony of the second
stage of public consultation campaign on the Study on Sustainable
Development in Hong Kong for the 21st Century (SUSDEV 21) at
Pacific Place.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that a set of indicators for measuring and
implementing sustainable development have been formulated during
the first stage, which began in April 1998 and lasted three months.
</P>
<P>
"In the next three months, the Planning Department will consult
the public on these indicators and the measures to implement
sustainable development in Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
SUSDEV 21, commissioned in September 1997, aims to develop a
tool to assist decision makers in incorporating the concept of
sustainability into Hong Kong's future development.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging the widest possible public participation and
consultation is a key aspect of the study, which is being achieved
through two stages of public consultation campaign.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the second stage is to continue the awareness-
raising and consultation activities initiated during the first
stage.
</P>
<P>
Tung also announced at the ceremony that the provincial
government of Guangdong had agreed to cooperate with Hong Kong in
improving the air and water quality in the Pearl Delta Region.

<HEADLINE>   SOCOG Reveals Olympic Ticketing Details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australian public had
small chance of getting tickets for many of the best events at the
2000 Sydney Olympics after the Olympic family, sponsors and the
media took their share, ticketing figures showed.
</P>
<P>
After concerted pressure, the Sydney Organising Committee for
the Olympic Games (SOCOG) Monday released in Sydney the most
detailed Olympic ticketing information.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that there were small amount of seats in the
public ticket ballot for popular events held in small venues.
</P>
<P>
On only one of the six nights of track cycling finals at the 5,
500-capacity velodrome, there were just more than 300 seats made
available to the Australian public.
</P>
<P>
On two nights of diving finals just 16 of the 9,400 A grade
seats were included in the ballot for public, which also included
only 24 of 3,300 seats in the grandstand for the men's triathlon.
</P>
<P>
In other popular sports such as artistic gymnastics and
basketball where the stadiums were much smaller than for the 1996
Atlanta Games, the number of tickets for locals dropped
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
But SOCOG noted that in big venues such as the 110,000-seat
main stadium, Australians would be better represented than their
American counterparts in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The number of tickets that are available are the consequence
of the deals inherent with the IOC and their sponsors and their
constituencies in getting the Olympic Games and there is no
flexibility to move there," Olympics minister and SOCOG president
Michael Knight said.
</P>
<P>
For the opening ceremony at Stadium Australia, 24,296 or 23.08
percent of the tickets went into the ballot.
</P>
<P>
About 2,600 seats were set aside each night for the Australian
public at the swimming finals - all of which were heavily
oversubscribed.
</P>
<P>
For the most popular athletics session, including the women's
400m final where Cathy Freeman is the hot favourite, 35,960 seats
were in the ballot, giving Australian applicants a better than one
in three chance of success.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG has been most heavily criticised for failing to reveal
its scheme to sell 325,000 tickets of the best tickets to the
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
Ticketing subcommittee chairman Graham Richardson had
acknowledged that keeping quiet on the tickets for the rich scheme
was SOCOG's biggest mistake.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and its
federations require almost 440,000 of the total 9.6 million seats
and another 1.22 million go to the media.
</P>
<P>
Knight also stressed that every organising committee was
required to sell a large number of tickets - about 760,000 - to
Olympic committees in about 200 countries or regions, to be passed
on to fans, sponsors and relatives of athletes.

CAIRO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister
Youssef Wali on Monday met with visiting Vice Chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress Tian
Jiyun.
</P>
<P>
Wali said the successful visit to China by President Hosni
Mubarak in April has injected great momentum to the further
development of the existing close relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and China have ever since frequently exchanged visits by
senior officials, and bilateral cooperation in all fields has been
intensified, he said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that the Egyptian-Chinese relations will be
further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Tian said that both China and Egypt are countries
with long history and ancient civilization, and they are now
facing similar tasks and challenges.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to bolstering the friendly
relations with Egypt and is willing to develop cooperation with it
in various fields.

Through talks and meetings during his visit, Tian said, the two
sides enhanced mutual understanding and reached agreement on
promoting the bilateral ties, especially the cooperation in the

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt, MILF Formally Open Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) formally
opened their peace talks on Monday in Maguindanao province in the
southern Philippines, a report of the ABS-CBN TV station said.
</P>
<P>
The report said Robert Aventajado, presidential adviser on
flagship projects, represented Philippine President Joseph Estrada
in the opening program.
</P>
<P>
Joining him were Defense Undersecretary Orlando Soriano,
chairman of the government peace panel; Aleem Abdul Aziz
Mimbantas, chairman of the MILF peace panel; and other
negotiators, as well as foreign diplomats, most from Islamic
countries.
</P>
<P>
Soriano said in the opening rites that he hoped the
negotiations could lead to positive results.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio
interview that the opening of the formal talks shows the
government's commitment to exhaust all means of ensuring lasting
peace in the country, especially in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed optimism that the negotiations would proceed
smoothly despite the MILF stand on the issue involving its
formation of an independent state, a condition the government
finds unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada has been consistent in his stand on pursing
lasting peace in Mindanao, which he aims to transform into the
country's next food basket and regional economic hub.
</P>
<P>
The government forged a peace agreement in September 1996 with
the mainstream Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) headed by its
chairman, Nur Misuari, now governor of the Autonomous Region in
Muslim Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
However, the MILF, a group led by Hashim Salamat that broke
away from the MNLF, continued the fight for a separate Islamic
state.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is estimated to have some 13,000 fighters in 13 major
camps in Mindanao.

NAIROBI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Joint efforts to reform the
laws of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda have been stepped up so as to
beat the January 1 deadline set by the World Trade Organization
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
The law reform organs of the three east African countries are
examining their existing legislations related with international
trade to ensure that they conform with the new WTO requirements,
the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of October, a joint workshop on customs
evaluation was held in Entebbe, Uganda, focusing mainly on rules
of origin and pre- shipment inspection.
</P>
<P>
A week later, another workshop on textiles was held in Kenyan
port city of Mombasa to examine the possibility of protecting the
local industry, currently threatened by importation of cheap
second-hand goods.
</P>
<P>
The same group last week held another workshop in Entebbe on
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The workshop examined how vital agricultural export products
could be protected under the new rules.
</P>
<P>
Peter Omondi, regional coordinator and chief technical advisor
of the Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Project, said
recently that Uganda has already drafted its proposed laws in the
WTO Implementation Bill.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda Law Reform Commission's draft of the new trade rules
is expected to be submitted to parliament for approval soon, Peter

<HEADLINE> Chinese Softballers Aim for Olympic Medal in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women's softballers
boosted their hope of capturing a medal at the Sydney Olympic
Games with a reshuffled squad of veterans, middle-aged and
inexperienced players.
</P>
<P>
"All we hope for is a medal in the 2000 Olympics," said Hu
Jiashi, vice president of the Chinese Softball Association (CSA)
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
China, who won the silver medal at the Atlanta Olympic Games
with incredible "aged" players for an average age of 27, had
started a two-sponged strategy to develop their prowess in
softball after 1996.
</P>
<P>
Under the strategy, veterans have been encouraged to play
professional leagues aboard, such as the United States and Japan,
while young athletes have been trained more intensively by
conducting lots of courses.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy that our strategy work now. Most of our veterans
still keep their best forms and some young players also enhance
their skills to a higher level," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
China has re-called six veteran players from aboard to join
their inexperienced squad for the coming Asian women's softball
championship to be held in Shanghai, China from October 31 to
November 6.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to test our reshuffled squad in the Asian meet, and
accumulate experiences for the Olympic Games next year as the
contests in the Olympics are more intense," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
From its Olympic runner-up position, China slipped to the
fourth place, behind Australia, United States and Japan at the
World Championships in Fujinomiya, Japan last July,
</P>
<P>
According to the officials from CSA, Olympic champion the
United States and Australia are the first-rated squads while both
Japan and China are only ranked in the second echelon in the
international stage.
</P>
<P>
"They enjoy advantages of professional league with many world
elites, including some of our veterans. So it can be positive for
us to recall veterans playing aboard," Hu said.

<HEADLINE> EDS-More Added China National Legislature Opens New Session (More Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China's national legislature
convened a new session to discuss 12 draft laws including one on
fighting heretic cults and controversial amendment of a Highway
Law.
</P>
<P>
Heretic cults, such as the Falun Gong sect that has been banned,
and their organizations "have seriously undermined social
stability, endangered economic growth, the safety of people's
lives and property, and must be effectively curbed," a senior
legislator said at today's 12th session of the Ninth Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The draft of Highway Law amendment, which had been proposed by
the State Council in a bid to replace various vehicle fees with a
fuel tax, failed to pass by the legislature six months ago because
of disputes over the law content.
</P>
<P>
The draft, together with the drafts of Meteorological Law and
Accounting Law amendments, are expected to be voted on by the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee today also reviewed draft laws that
contradict the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR), amendments to the 1997 Criminal Code, and laws on
legislative power and procedures.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, presided over
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Three proposals of the State Council were submitted to the
session today for discussing whether China approves one amendment
to an international convention on controlling transboundary
movements of hazardous wastes, and whether the country joins two
international conventions, including the Convention for the
Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the legislature is to discuss additional appointments
for the Chinese Central Military Commission during the seven-day
session.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Reiterates China's Policy Toward Dalai Lama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has outlined the preconditions for the central government to open
talks with Dalai Lama over his personal future.
</P>
<P>
In a written interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro on
the eve of his visit to France, Jiang said that Dalai Lama must
truly give up his advocacy of "independence of Tibet" and stop his
activities to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Dalai Lama must also openly declare that Tibet is
an inalienable part of China and recognize that Taiwan is a
province of China and the government of the People's Republic of
China is the sole legitimate government representing whole China.
</P>
<P>
"Only on this basis will the central government open talks with
Dalai Lama over his personal future," Jiang stressed, added that
the contacts and talks of the central government with Dalai Lama
are purely an internal affair of China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang recalled that before Tibet was peacefully liberated, it
had been under the rule of an utterly barbarous feudal serf system
and Dalai Lama at the time was not only a religious leader but
also big serf owner.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that with the support of certain foreign forces,
Dalai Lama has over the past four decades been obstinately
sticking to his position of splitting China and advocating the so-
called "independence of Tibet" everywhere in the world in an
attempt to restore that dark political system in the region of
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Dalai clique has also instigated unrest and
terrorist violence in the region of Tibet and engaged in lots of
activities designed to split the motherland and undermine the
stability and development in the region of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
All Dalai Lama has done or is doing indicates that he has no
sincerity at all to repent and that all his efforts are aimed at
stepping up the activities of splitting the motherland, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> DFLP Leader Allowed to Enter Palestinian Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel announced on Monday
that the leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine (DFLP) can enter into the Palestinian-controlled areas
any time in the future.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made by Prime Minister Ehud Barak, in
meeting a request from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Barak's
office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Prime Minister's decision came following an appeal, for
some time, by Yasser Arafat and in light of (Nayef) Hawatmeh's
support for the peace process," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
But Hawatmeh will only be allowed to enter Palestinian areas of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, not Israel, it said.
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh set up the DFLP in 1969 as an opposition faction to
Arafat. Israel held him responsible for the death of 24 school
children and a soldier during a shoot-out between Israeli soldiers
and several DFLP fighters who had taken over a school in the
northern Israeli town of Malot in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh opened reconciliation talks with Arafat in Cairo in
August and the United States dropped the DFLP from its list of
foreign terrorist organizations earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh has said he supported an Israeli-Palestinian solution
based on two states living in peace side by side. He also said he
was willing to recognize Israel once it reached a final-status
peace with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat have set a September 2000 deadline for
reaching a final peace agreement that will resolve the issues of
borders, Jerusalem, refugees, settlements and water supplies.

<HEADLINE> Giant Pandas To Return To The Wild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China has been initiating a
program under which giant pandas produced by artificial
insemination will be prepared to return to nature.
</P>
<P>
The program is considered by many as an important step to save
giant pandas from extinction. Experiments will be carried out in
places such as Wolong Nature Reserve in southwest China's Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
A recent international symposium on the protection of giant
pandas held in Wolong Nature Reserve said that if experiments
succeed, two or three giant pandas will return to nature each year
to supplement the shortage of giant pandas in the wild. There are
46 head of giant pandas in captivity at the Wolong Nature Research.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas are considered to be one of world's most
endangered species. There are only about 1,000 giant pandas, both
in captivity and in the wild, remaining in China. Eighty percent
of pandas live in the mountains around the Sichuan Basin. Only
about 100 giant pandas are produced by artificial insemination or
cared by human beings.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Disarm Nomadic Tribe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
decided to disarm the Karimojong people, the nomads in the
northeastern part of the country, as a stabilizing effort to
maintain security in the region.
</P>
<P>
The guns there have been misused to kill innocent people and
caused insecurity in Kotido and Moroto districts, Chairman of
Karimojong Parliamentary Commission John Lorot said on Radio
Uganda Monday. He is leading a probe team in the region to assess
the situation there.
</P>
<P>
Debates on disarmament of Karimojong warriors have lingered on
for years in the parliament, but little action has been taken.
</P>
<P>
Some MPs argued that those people should be disarmed while
others said that they would be exposed to attacks from the nomad
people in neighboring countries once their guns were taken back by
the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Minister for Karamoja Affairs Peter Lokeris
has urged local people to concentrate on agricultural development
in order to face future challenges.
</P>
<P>
Karamoja have reportedly more than 20,000 guns due to historic
reasons. The nomad people often resort to cattle rustling to
accumulate wealth. Fighting over water supply in the region is
also quite frequent.
</P>
<P>
In the latest tribal clashes in the region one month ago, the
government had to send in troops there to quiet down the fighting
factions.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of armed warriors were said to be killed by the
government troops.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Introduces Stiffer Penalties for Child Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Parliament
Monday passed the Child Bill 1999 which seeks to impose stiffer
penalties on wide-ranging offenses relating to child abuse and
neglect, including perpetrators of child prostitution.
</P>
<P>
The bill defines a child as one under 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
Upon its passage, the bill would replace three existing laws --
the Juvenile Courts Act 1947 (Act 90), the Child Protection Act
1991 (Act 468) and the Women and Girls' Protection Act 1973.
</P>
<P>
Under the new bill when enforced as a new law, perpetrators of
child prostitution face mandatory imprisonment between three to 15
years and mandatory whipping of up to six strokes, besides fines
of up to 50,000 ringgit (13,157 U.S. dollars) upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
The existing laws against child prostitution provides that
offenders face a maximum five years' imprisonment and a fine of
10,000 ringgit (2,631 U.S. dollars) upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
Winding up debate on the bill which was tabled for second
reading last Wednesday, National Unity and Social Development
Minister Zaleha Ismail said those committing illicit sexual
intercourse with children face the same penalty for rape under the
Penal Code.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Slaps Intervention Under Pretext of Humanitarianism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
in a written interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro on the
eve of his visit to France, slapped international intervention in
a country's internal affairs under the pretext of humanitarianism.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government and people disapprove any
arbitrary intervention in any country's internal affairs under the
pretext of "humanitarian crisis" and oppose the use of force for
the so-called "humanitarian intervention" unauthorized by the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"As long as there exist different countries in the world and as
long as the people on our planet still live in different countries,
the human rights issue remains an internal affair of individual
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a basic principle that the human rights cause of a
country, big or small, strong or weak, should be accomplished
independently by that country's government with support of the
people," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Unless a particular country asks the United Nations for help,
no countries or international organizations have the right to
intervene," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in East Timor, Jiang said that the East Timor
issue is different from that of Kosovo. The multinational forces
were sent to East Timor at the invitation of the Indonesian
government and with the authorization of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that China hopes the East Timor issue will be solved
properly as soon as possible within the U.N. framework.
</P>
<P>
The tenet and principles of the U.N. Charter and other widely-
accepted norms of international relations still need to be abided
by in resolving any issues faced by the international community,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity, mutual non-interference in domestic affairs
and settling international disputes through peaceful means are not
at all obsolete," the Chinese president said. "In the current
situation, these principles should not be weakened. On the
contrary, they should be carried out in real earnest."

<HEADLINE> Jiang Reaffirms China's Policy on Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
reaffirmed China's basic policy of "peaceful reunification and one
country, two systems" in resolving the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro before he
left for his ongoing visit to Europe, Jiang said, "We sincerely
hope we can resolve the Taiwan question peacefully under the
principle of 'one country, two systems' and accomplish the great
cause of national reunification."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out Lee Teng-hui's recent "state-to-state" remarks
are a brazen provocation to the world-acknowledged "one China"
principle.
</P>
<P>
"His (Lee's) doctrine, which, in essence, aims to split Taiwan
from China, has naturally met with the resolute opposition from
the entire Chinese people, including the Taiwan compatriots, and
rejected by the international community, " the Chinese president
said.
</P>
<P>
It is the common desire and sacred duty of the Chinese people
to maintain state sovereignty and territorial integrity and
realize a complete national reunification, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan compatriots are our blood brothers and sisters," he
said. "The fact that we do not undertake to renounce the use of
force is not directed at the Taiwan compatriots but at foreign
forces that interfere in China's reunification, and at the
attempts of splittist forces in Taiwan that call for 'Taiwan
independence,'" Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people will not sit idle before any
political attempt to separate Taiwan from China, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added the Chinese government, people and armed forces have
the will as well as the ability to maintain the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Reserves to be Gauged at Asian Softball Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Ten teams will dispatch their
second-string reserves for the 7th Asian Women's Softball
Championship to be held in Shanghai, China, from October 31 to
November 6, with the host China and Japan showing up as an Olympic
rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
However, Olympic runner-up China has called back six veterans
from Japan for the quadrennial Asian meet, which features strong
squads from Japan, South Korea, DPR. Korea and Chinese Taipei
apart from the amateur teams from Thailand and Hong Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
"China and Japan are the only two teams in Asia that has
secured berths for the Sydney Olympic Games, so the event will
also serve as a pre-Olympic showdown between us," said Hu Jiashi,
secretary general of the organizing committee at a press
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
China, the three-time Asia champion, will try its utmost to
retain the title with a mixture of veterans and youngesters for an
average age of 24, as it has an even record against Olympic fourth-
placer Japan in their recent encounters, who boasts its national
softball league with foreign elites.
</P>
<P>
"After we called back our veterans who had competed in the
Atlanta Olympics and were playing in Japan, we have boosted our
hopes of keeping the Asian crown and cultivating the youngsters,"
Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei, preparing its lineup for the 2004 Olympic Games,
also poses the challenge for the host, while DPR. Korea is tipped
as a big threat in Asia as it has achieved amazing improvements in
the last two years, according to the officials from Chinese
Softball Association.
</P>
<P>
"It will be tough contests for those teams who are aiming to
develop their reserve athletes in Shanghai," Hu added.
</P>
<P>
The seven-day Asian championship, the first of the kind held in
China, will run the single round robin in the preliminaries and
page system for the top four teams in the play-offs.

<HEADLINE> Manila Hopeful on Talks With Rebel MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
its peace talks with the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) would be successful, as both sides opened their formal
negotiations on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the opening of the
formal talks shows the government's commitment to exhaust all
means of ensuring lasting peace in the country, especially in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"What we are after is peaceful talks. We'd rather be talking
than shooting at each other," Zamora said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed optimism that the negotiations would proceed
smoothly despite the MILF stand on the issue involving its
formation of an independent state, a condition the government
finds unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF are opening their formal peace
talks in Maguindanao province in Mindanao on Monday, after weeks
of planning and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has been consistent in his
stand on pursing lasting peace in Mindanao, which he aims to
transform into the country's next food basket and regional
economic hub.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has called on the MILF to lay down their arms and work
hand in hand with the government in pursing lasting peace and
development in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The government panel headed by Undersecretary Orlando Soriano
of the Department of National Defense and Ghazali Jaafar, MILF
vice chairman for political affairs, signed an agreement on
September 2, setting the venue of the opening ceremony of the
formal peace talks.
</P>
<P>
During the September 2 meeting, the two panels agreed to
continue the "inspection, verification and acknowledgment" of the
remaining MILF-identified areas until this task is completed on
December 31 this year, while negotiations are going on.
</P>
<P>
The government forged a peace agreement in September 1996 with
the mainstream Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) headed by its
chairman, Nur Misuari, now governor of the Autonomous Region in
Muslim Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
However, the MILF, a group led by Hashim Salamat that broke
away from the MNLF, continued the fight for a separate Islamic
state.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is estimated to have some 13,000 fighters in 13 major
camps in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Falls 13.6 Percent in First Half of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus
in the first half of fiscal 1999 ending next March fell 13.6
percent from a year earlier to 6,394.3 billion yen (54.1 billion
dollars), down for the first time in five half-year periods, the
Finance Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the decline to the stronger yen which
squeezed the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
In the April-September term, exports dropped 7.7 percent to 23,
914.8 billion yen (202.3 billion dollars), with shipments of
automobiles, office equipment and steel posting double-digit
declines due to a 16.3 percent rise in the yen's value against the
U.S. dollar, the ministry said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Imports, meanwhile, slipped 5.3 percent to 17,520.6 billion yen
(148.3 billion dollars), as imports of aircraft, coal and
alcoholic beverages shrank substantially.
</P>
<P>
Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States rose 10.2 percent to 3,770.5 billion yen (31.9 billion
dollars), the largest since the April-September period of fiscal
1987.
</P>
<P>
Japan's merchandise trade balance is measured on a customs-
clearance basis and is reported before adjustment for seasonal
factors.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate averaged 118.18 yen to the U.S. dollar during
the period, compared with 137.47 yen in the first half of fiscal
1998.
</P>
<P>
For the first half, Japan's trade surplus with its trading
partners in Asia fell 6.3 percent to 1,966.5 billion yen (16.6
billion dollars), while that with the 15-member European Union (EU)
amounted to 1,728.4 billion yen (14.6 billion dollars), down 21.3
percent for the first drop in five half-year terms.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Makes Marginal Progress in Women Rights: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Nepal has achieved marginal
progress in its efforts towards gender equality and women
empowerment after the Fourth International Women's Conference in
Beijing in 1995, the Kathmandu Post Monday quoted a report as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"In overall terms, implementation of Beijing Plan for Action
(BPFA) in Nepal for gender equality and women empowerment have
been slow as evidenced by only marginal improvements or virtually
no improvements in twelve areas of concern," said the report
released Sunday by the Ministry for Women and Social Welfare.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by a group of experts on women issues with
the co-ordination of the Ministry of Women and Social Welfare,
would be presented at the Beijing Plus Five regional meeting of
the countries in Asia Pacific Region to be held in Bangkok during
October 26-29.
</P>
<P>
Nepal still suffers gender disparity and social, economic and
legal discriminations against women, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out weak implementation of the Beijing
Agendas as the major cause of slow progress in creating gender
equality and empowering women in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"Political instability during the last four years, weak
governance, inadequate resources and political commitment, and
traditional patriarchal social thought are some of the most
important factors hindering proper implementation of the Beijing
agendas on women," the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report ended with some optimistic notes regarding
women's social and economic upliftment in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"The recent formation of a stable government, enactment of the
Local Self Governance Act, women's involvement in local
authorities and in the fields of education and health along with
private sector's involvement in women's empowerment can play
positive roles in this regard," said the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
expounded China's policies on major domestic and international
issues in a written interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro
before his current visit to France.
</P>
<P>
On domestic issues, Jiang said that the People's Republic of
China has gone through half a century of great but difficult
course and has made compelling prominent progress, and that China
is heading to the 21st century with an impressive posture.
</P>
<P>
To build socialism with Chinese characteristics is suited to
China's conditions and accords with the fundamental rights of the
overwhelming majority of the Chinese people, Jiang said. It's the
solely correct road to make China rich and powerful and bring
about well-being to its people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the newspaper that reform and opening-up has brought
about new and great changes in people's mentality, and that the
rich and positive mental outlook of Chinese people has provided a
powerful driving force for the building of material civilization.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope to solve the Taiwan issue by peaceful means
according to the policy of 'one country, two systems' so as to
accomplish the great undertaking of our motherland's reunification,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the Chinese government and people could not sit
by and watch any political conspiracy to separate Taiwan from
China. The Chinese government, people and army have the
determination and the capability to maintain the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the motherland, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also said the world in the future will be a multi-polar
and colorful one in which all countries commonly develop, and that
multi-polarity is an objective trend independent of man's will.
Any attempt to build a unipolar world will not be compliant with
the historical process, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Leftist Party Nominates Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's leftist JVP or
People's Liberation Front, the third largest party of the island
country, has nominated a candidate to contest the upcoming
presidential polls, press reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The party's General Secretary Tilwin de Silva was quoted as
saying that its candidate Nandana Gunatilake, western provincial
councilor and politburo member, had obtained support from the
Muslim United Liberation Front and the Nawa Sama Samaja Party (New
Equality Socialist Party).
</P>
<P>
Mr. Gunatilake, 37-year-old, joined the JVP in 1984 and has
been with the party through turbulent times. He also was actively
involved in the reconstruction of the party in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The JVP, responsible for the youth uprisings in 1971 and 1989,
has returned to the mainstream of political life in the country.
</P>
<P>
The party which was to contest 1994 presidential election
withdrew their candidate after Chandrika Kumaratunga of the ruling
People's Alliance promised to abolish the executive presidency
before July 15th, 1995.
</P>
<P>
This year JVP contested all the seven provincial council
elections and made a breakthrough in every single one of them
resulting in all the councils being hung councils with the major
parties being unable to obtain a clear majority in any of them.
</P>
<P>
JVP Propaganda Secretary Wimal Weerawansa said the party will
begin its campaign with a special party convention in Colombo on
November 8.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) reviewed a draft law today to
combat heretic cults such as the now banned Falun Gong sect.
</P>
<P>
"Cult organizations have seriously destroyed social
stability, endangered economic development, the safety of people's
lives and property, and must be effectively curbed," said Hou
Zongbin, chairman of the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee
of the NPC.
</P>
<P>
The draft urges courts, prosecutors, police and
administrative judicial organs must be on full alert to guard
against possible cult activities. The draft also stresses that
deceived followers and practitioners should be differentiated
from cult leaders. Local governments are asked to take necessary
measures to educate those deceived while punishing a small number
of cult leaders and those who have committed crimes.

<HEADLINE> New laws to Be Regulated to Battle Software Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua)-- Officials and experts call for
setting up a sound protection system for intellectual property
rights of software in China to promote healthy growth in software
industry, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Government departments, software companies and consumers should
bear the responsibility together to combat against software piracy,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Ying Ming, a research fellow with the Ministry of Information
Industry, pointed out that the way to protect software
intellectual property rights is to resort to law.
</P>
<P>
Ying warned participants of a seminar over the weekend that
final users of pirated software may be held legally responsible.
</P>
<P>
As one of the drafters for Rules on Protecting Computer
Software which went into force June 1991, Ying said China will
become a stronger and more sizable software exporter since
enforcement has improved.
</P>
<P>
Ying emphasized the establishment of China's rights protection
system is not because of foreign pressure, but domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the Business Software Alliance, a
worldwide organization accommodating many leading software
manufacturers, said that China's software market in 1997 was
valued at 1.4 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate is estimated at 28 percent and the
market value will hit 3.5 billion US dollars in 2001.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the software industry is expected to create 104,
000 job opportunities in 2001.
</P>
<P>
If the amount of pirated software is reduced by 60 percent, the
software industry can provide 190,000 job opportunities in China,
according to Zou Bian, secretary general of China Software
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem of unreasonable high prices of some
software, Ying called upon Chinese legislators to draft stricter
laws on anti-monopoly as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks Free to Open and Close Branches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand (BOT) will
allow commercial banks full freedom to open or close branches,
local newspaper the Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Thai banks had to request permission from
regulators before opening or closing branches.
</P>
<P>
Governor of BOT Chatumongol Sonakul was quoted as saying that
the rule would be canceled to allow their branch networks to suit
customer demand.
</P>
<P>
With increased competition coming from foreign institutions,
regulators say changes will be made to allow market forces to take
precedence, leading to improved customer services.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the central bank announced that it would
allow banks to set their own operating hours, prompting several
institutions to announce weekend and extended office hours.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said the new branch regulations had been completed,
but regulators were waiting for the "appropriate timing" before a
formal announcement given the impact branch closures and mergers
would have on certain communities.
</P>
<P>
He believed all local banks would eventually move to close
redundant or unnecessary branches in order to streamline costs.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt, MILF to Hold Formal Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks between the
Philippine government and the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) are scheduled to formally open Monday in Maguindanao
province in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Robert Aventajado, presidential adviser on flagship projects,
will represent Philippine President Joseph Estrada in Monday's
opening program, a report of Philippine Daily Inquirer said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Joining him are Defense Undersecretary Orlando Soriano,
chairman of the government peace panel; Aleem Abdul Aziz
Mimbantas, chairman of the MILF peace panel; and other
negotiators, as well as foreign diplomats, most from Islamic
countries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Soriano said earlier in a statement that Monday's opening rites
"signal an important milestone for Mindanao as we step into
another phase of our journey to peace."
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that the talks would lead to greater
understanding and wider consensus between the parties.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF spokesperson and vice
chairman for political affairs, said the issue of independence
would be the "main dish" in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Governor Nur Misuari of the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao also expressed support for the peace talks and hoped that
members of the peace panels would go to the negotiation table
"with open hearts and clean intention."
</P>
<P>
Misuari, who is also chairman of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF), said that people wanted the two panels to widen the
peace agreement in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF signed a peace pact with the government in 1996 after
more than 25 years of secessionist struggle.
</P>
<P>
However, the MILF, a group led by Hashim Salamat that broke
away from the MNLF, continued the fight for a separate Islamic
state.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is estimated to have some 13,000 fighters in 13 major
camps in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> China's Pilot Environment Projects Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua)-- Environmental pilot projects in
China have achieved positive results, in terms of advanced
technologies and management methods, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Council for International Cooperation
and Environmental Development (CCICED) which met recently, pilot
projects including utilization of biomass energy, rehabilitation
of grass vegetation and cleaner production have kicked off.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, minister of State Environmental Projection
Administration said that the experience of pilot projects are
essential for the working group of CCICED to propose more
practical and target-geared suggestions to the development of the
country.
</P>
<P>
CCICED has appointed another nine pilot cities on cleaner
production around the country.
</P>
<P>
The biomass demonstration stations in Northeast China's Jilin
Province, one of China's major production areas, is expected to
alleviate the crop stalk problem, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, large amounts of crop stalk left after harvest
were usually burned, causing heavy air pollution to rural people
especially to children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
The first pilot project, designed for small villages and
townships, can generate 1,500-2,000 cubic meters of gas with one
ton of stalk, which can supply fuel to 200 households for cooking.
</P>
<P>
The second pilot project can produce high quality gas and heat
for densely-populated townships and large-scale commercial
production by using dry distillation technology.
</P>
<P>
Though still in early stages, the projects have been welcomed
by the local residents, Liu Shuying, vice-governor of Jilin
Province was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Taiyan city in North China's Shanxi Province, has invested 1.5
billion yuan (181 million U.S. dollars) into 38 production
projects to provide a cleaner environment in the city, said Mayor
Cao Zhonghou.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Crude Oil Production Drops Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced a total of 1.66
million barrels of crude oil in the first half of this year, a 4.2
percent drop compared with the same period of last year which was
1.733 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data published by the country's Central
Statistical Organization, the output of natural gas was 852
million cubic-meters during the period, a 3.97 percent reduction
over the corresponding period of last year which was 887.3
million cubic-meters.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Myanmar produced a total of 3.424 million barrels of
crude oil and 1.749 billion cubic-meters of natural gas,
respectively reducing by 6.5 percent and 2 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar opened to foreign investment in late 1988,
foreign investment in the oil and gas sector coming from
Australia, Britain, France, Indonesia, Japan, Thailand and the
United States had reached 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in 46 projects,
accounting for 32.39 percent of the total foreign investment of
7.108 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Myanmar's crude oil and petroleum products are still
self-insufficient and the country has to import 280,000 to 300,000
tons of crude oil and 100,000 to 150,000 tons of diesel oil
annually, according to the official statistics.

<HEADLINE> Electric Power Production Drops in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Electric power generated by the
state-run Myanma Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE), the main
electricity supplier of the country, totaled 1.979 billion
kilowatt-hours (kwh) in the first half of this year, a 12.82
percent drop compared with the same period of last year which was
2.27 billion kwh.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures of the official Economic
Indicators, the installed capacity of the MEPE was 1,058 megawatts
(mw) by the end of June this year.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that in 1998, the MEPE produced a total
of 4.3 billion kwh of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Other official statistics indicate that the MEPE added a total
installed capacity of 509 mw in the past 11 years, of which
natural gas power plants represented 255 mw, while steam power
plants took up 143 mw and hydro-electric power plants 111 mw.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar is implementing five more hydro-electric
power plants -- Paunglaung, Zaungtu, Mone, Thaphanseik and Maipan.
Of them, Paunglaung, Mone and Thaphanseik are being built by
China.
</P>
<P>
The five power plants, upon completion, will add 407 mw more to
Myanmar's electric power installed capacity and will ease the
serious shortage problem of electricity in Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian New President Outlines Policy Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian new President
Abrurrahman Wahid Sunday mapped out his vision for the country,
promising to revive its economy and stressing the importance of
full autonomy for provincial administrations.
</P>
<P>
In his first major speech after he was sworn in on Wednesday as
the country's fourth president, Wahid also outlined sweeping
changes in domestic, foreign and defense policies.
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging speech at an international seminar entitled
"Indonesia Next" in Bali, Wahid assured the international business
community that his government would uphold market-oriented policy
and encourage foreign investors to take an active part in the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The head of state pledged to focus on improving people's
incomes which he considered a key to civil service reform,
strengthening the weak legal system and diluting the military's
role in politics.
</P>
<P>
"It is nonsense to talk about democratization, peace,
demilitarization and other big issues if people cannot afford even
their basic necessities," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He blamed Indonesia's problems on the failure to narrow the
wealth gap, defiance of the law and by too much control from
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
But he hinted that he may include in his cabinet, to be
announced on Tuesday or Wednesday, some of the members of his
predecessors B.J. Habibie and Soeharto, because he had to repay
the political debts that secured his election by the country's top
legislature.
</P>
<P>
"To attain the presidency, I have to make compromises. And
among the compromises, I have to take several people into the
cabinet, perhaps even from the past cabinet also," he said.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, they would have to "follow the current
government's interest in honesty, in fairness and, more
importantly, in our economic development".
</P>
<P>
He also talked about the urgent need for granting full autonomy
to provinces and even hinted at the possibility, sometime in the
future, of a federal system in the country.
</P>
<P>
"There will be federalism, although I can not say openly
whether it will be federalism in its real sense," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president appealed for Indonesians to put aside their
differences and said he and Vice President Megawati would
personally take charge of bringing peace to the troubled areas.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said he could understand people's growing demand for
discontinuation of the dual function (socio-political and military
roles) of the Indonesian Military.
</P>
<P>
"But I cannot simply order them (the military) to return to
their barracks without first solving their main problems," he was
quoted by national newspapers Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated his commitment to protecting all
citizens, regardless their religion, ethnic background and social
status.
</P>
<P>
He said he wanted to see people from different religions and
ethnic groups live in harmony.
</P>
<P>
Wahid also reiterated the imperative need for strengthening the
judicial system and for a rule-based, level playing field in the
market.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign policy, the president said he was willing to
adjust the government's foreign policy to whatever efforts would
be necessary to improve people's living conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Because when Indonesia was still poor as it is now, other
countries did not show any respect for Indonesia," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, his government would not make any
compromises when it comes to "our basic principles".
</P>
<P>
Wahid said it was imperative for the country to develop within
the region as well as on a broader international stage.
</P>
<P>
He will embark soon on a hectic schedule of foreign visits.
</P>
<P>
"I will first visit Singapore, then Malaysia, Burma, Vietnam
and the Philippines. I also would like to visit China, India and
Japan, before attending the informal ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) summit in Manila next month," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
He said he had apologized to the United States Ambassador
designate Robert Gelbard at a meeting on Thursday for not choosing
the superpower as his first overseas destination.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, according to him, praised his plan. "But my
daughter told me later the ambassador's face changed upon hearing
my plan," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president said Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim
nation, might follow some Arab countries and establish a trade
mission in Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said he would like to use resources from Israel to help fix
Indonesia's battered economy.
</P>
<P>
The three-day international conference, which ended on Sunday,
was organized by political and economic consultants Van Zorge
Heffernan and Associates. The meeting, which discussed Indonesia's
future, featured foreign and domestic analysts as main panelists.

<HEADLINE> Leeds United Maintain Lead Despite Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Leeds United maintained their
leading place at the English premier league team standings despite
a 4-4 draw at Everton on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An injury time equaliser by David Weir denied Leeds a club-
record 11th consecutive win but on reflection they will probably
be pleased with a share of the spoils.
</P>
<P>
Sunderland blew a chance to move top of the league when they
drew 1-1 at West Ham after the hosts equalised in the 89th minute
through Trevor Sinclair. But the point was enough to lift
Sunderland into third.
</P>
<P>
Leeds's draw puts them on 26 points from 12 matches, a point
above Arsenal and two ahead of Sunderland and Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United are in fourth place after losing 3-1 at
Tottenham on Saturday when Arsenal stunned Chelsea 3-2.
</P>
<P>
United missed out on a chance to top the table when
misunderstandings between keeper Mark Bosnich and his defence
handed Spurs victory.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal, meanwhile, completed an astonishing comeback at
Stamford Bridge in front of a watching FIFA delegation assessing
England's bid to host the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 2-0 after goals by Tore Andre Flo and Dan Petrescu,
Nigerian Nwankwo Kanu scored three in 15 minutes -- against a side
that had not conceded a goal at home all season -- to sit second
behind Leeds.

<HEADLINE> Mauresmo Wins First WTA Title in Slovak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Amelie Mauresmo of France won
her first WTA Tour title, beating Belgium's Kim Clijsters 6-3, 6-3
in the Slovak Indoor tennis tournament in Bratislava, Slovakia on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Mauresmo, who finished second in the Australian Open,
sealed the competition within one hour with a superior service
game against the 54th-ranked Belgian.
</P>
<P>
"Clijsters was a little tired after yesterday's match, and I
did not allow her to play her game. I tried to keep her from
getting into the court," Mauresmo said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Mauresmo had an easy sail into the final as her
semifinal opponent Kveta Hrdlickova of the Czech Republic was
forced to retire after being stung by a wasp.
</P>
<P>
Mauresmo earned 80 points in the WTA Tour rankings. The
tournament was the first WTA Tour event to be staged in the Slovak
capital.

<HEADLINE> (Urgent) De la Rua Wins Argentine Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Fernando de la Rua, the
candidate of the opposition Alliance, Sunday won the presidential
elections in Argentina, according to preliminary polls.
</P>
<P>
De la Rua obtained from 50 to 52 percent of the valid votes,
which makes unnecessary a run-off that will define the results,
according to local radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Duhalde, the ruling Justicialista (Peronist) candidate,
was second with 34 to 36 percent of the voters, according to polls
made out of the voting stations.
</P>
<P>
Should the official results unhold the figures, De la Rua would
become president on December 10, without the necessity to hold a
run-off on Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
According th the constitution, to triumph in one round, the
winner needs 45 percent outright, or must garner between 40
percent and 45 percent of the ballot with a 10-percent lead over
the runner-up.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the De la Rua, 62, triumph, to the fact
that he represented a renewal, a moderate change for the electors.
</P>
<P>
De la Rua said he would force government officials to follow
the standards for public servants, such as to declare assets and
to comply with tax obligations. He also offered a restructuring of
foreign debt and budget balance to save the country's financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, he ruled out the possibility for
unconditional alliance with the United States. Instead, he would
seek better cooperation with the European Union on political and
economic issues. He also promised to continue working for the
Southern Common Market (Mercosur) consolidation and reaffirmed his
position to recover sovereignty over the Malvinas islands.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance is mainly made up of the Radical Civic Union and
the Frepaso parties.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates, including former Economy Minister Domingo
Cavallo of the opposition Action for the Republic party, obtained
10 percent of the votes, according to opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
It was considered that 80 percent of the 24 million Argentines
legally able to vote went to the polls.
</P>
<P>
In Argentina, with 36.1 million citizens, voters also were
choosing new governors in six of the country's 23 provinces. And
they were filling 116 of the lower House of the Congress 257
seats. No Senate seats were up for election.

<HEADLINE> EU Experts To Meet On Row Over British Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A group of European Union (EU)
experts will meet Monday to study further information on
development of mad cow disease in order to settle the dispute
between France and Britain over whether Paris should lift the ban
on British beef exports that have been allowed to sell EU-wide
since August 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The group of 14 independent experts charged with preparing EU
Scientific Committee meetings failed to reach agreement 10 days
ago on the weight of evidence about the mad cow disease issue
after the French food safety agency AFSSA handed down its
unfavorable opinion of October 1 on the lifting of the ban.
</P>
<P>
The experts had decided to grant a 10-day period up to October
25 to assess the justification of French scientific arguments
which are at the root of Paris' refusal to lift the ban on British
beef being exported to the rest of the EU.
</P>
<P>
During their Monday meeting, the experts will need to study all
the data in order to determine whether there is any new evidence
justifying further scientific discussion of the issue, according
to the European Report, one of the EU publications.
</P>
<P>
Were this to be the case, the European Commission, the EU's
executive arm, might then refer the dossier back to the relevant
Scientific Committee on the basis of the experts' opinion, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The EU Scientific Committee will hold a meeting next Thursday
to assess the French evidence and the British interpretation about
the latest epidemiological studies on the incidence of mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
According to EU information, the British Department of
Agriculture recently recorded 1,341 new mad cow disease cases
between January 1 and August 31 of this year. The year-on-year
assessment could be even grimmer given that 421 suspected cases of
mad cow diseases are currently being examined.
</P>
<P>
This information confirms the upward trend in the "plateauing"
epidemic referred to by the French experts, EU report said.

<HEADLINE> Lithuania Protests Russia's Air Space Violation Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania's Foreign Ministry
Sunday lodged a protest with the Russian embassy over alleged
violation of Lithuanian air space by a Russian armed helicopter.
</P>
<P>
"Lithuania hopes that the details of this incident will be
immediately investigated, and such incursions won't be repeated
any more," said a press communique released by the Ministry in
Vilnius.
</P>
<P>
The Russian gunship violated Lithuanian air space from Russia's
Kaliningrad region, said the ministry without telling when the
occasion occurred.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoting Lithuanian sources said that
the copter first landed at a secondary school stadium in the town
of Jurbarkas, then took off again and finally exited Lithuanian
air space.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry's press service claimed
that it has no information about such an incident.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Says Religious Dialogue to Help Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said Sunday that dialogue between cultures and religions will
uphold and facilitate the peace process in the Middle East in the
present decisive phase of Arab-Israeli relations.
</P>
<P>
In a message prepared for a conference of the Friends of the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem Association, dedicated to the role
of the Holy City as a meeting point for the Islamic and Jewish
faiths in the third millennium, Dini said, "Traditions and
religion can be precious resources for politics."
</P>
<P>
The minister said the three Jewish, Muslim and Christian
traditions provide foundations for dialogue and the next few years
will be "decisive" for Arab-Israeli relations.
</P>
<P>
He cited the "great strategic problem" of "totally renewing the
image of Europe and the West in the Muslim world in general and
the Arab world in particular" and spoke of "prejudices we feel are
groundless but which, unfortunately, fuel mass culture."
</P>
<P>
Religious convictions are, of course, non-negotiable but, Dini
said, "fundamental freedoms and rights" cannot be considered so.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov arrived in Rome Sunday evening on his first official visit
to Italy.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov's visit, part of his Europe tour, will serve to outline
Russian plans for Chechnya, with an attack on the capital Grozny
imminent and Western appeals for a peaceful solution rising.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister said there was a tendency on the
part of Western media to distort events in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The future status of Kosovo will also top the agenda of his
talks here. Moscow has been firm in its rejection of an autonomous
status within the Serbo-Montenegrin federation of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov will also urge an end to the blockage of aid to Serbia
until President Slobodan Milosevic leaves power, stressing the
hardship facing Serbia as a Balkan winter looms.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to argue that domestic food shortages may only
strengthen Milosevic's support.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival here, Ivanov said the Russian economy is moving
slowly out of stagnation. On his tour, he will be asking for more
Western aid to cope with the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov will have talks Monday with Italian President Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi, Premier Massimo D'Alema and Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini.
