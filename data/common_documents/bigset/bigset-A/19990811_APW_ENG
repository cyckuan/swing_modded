<HEADLINE> Catfish Hunter Regains Consciousness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter regained  
consciousness today and responded to commands, but the Hall of Fame 
pitcher still was in critical condition after injuring his head in 
a fall at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is conscious and responding to commands -- wiggle your toes  
and that sort of thing,'' said Doug Boyd, a Pitt County Memorial 
Hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Hunter, who suffers from amyothrophic lateral  
sclerosis -- an irreversible deterioration of the muscles -- fell 
Sunday while negotiating concrete steps outside his home in 
Hertford, a friend said. 
</P>
<P>
	Family spokesman Keith Vaughan, pastor of the Hertford Baptist  
Church, said today that Hunter's condition showed ``slight 
improvement overnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd said the Hunter family wasn't talking to the media. ``The  
family is very private right now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter's wife Helen, however, issued a statement expressing  
gratitude for the solicitude of friends and fans of Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outpouring of love and support for us and for Jimmy is a  
tremendous encouragement to us,'' she said. ``Over the last year, 
we have been constantly encouraged by the calls, letters and phone 
calls from all over the world expressing their love and 
appreciation for Jimmy. Many people have asked what they can do. 
The greatest thing you can do for us at this time is to pray for 
Jimmy and all the thousands who suffer from ALS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he was injured, Hunter was taken to an Edenton hospital and  
then was transferred early Monday to the Greenville hospital, which 
serves the East Carolina University medical school and is a 
high-level trauma center for eastern North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Harrell, who lives next door to the Hunters, spent much of  
Tuesday on the phone with several of Hunter's former teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrell wasn't optimistic about his friend's condition.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's had some bad knocks before, but this is the worst,'' said  
Harrell. ``The only thing people can do right now is pray for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Harrell said Mrs. Hunter is handling the latest setback  
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Helen's tough,'' Harrell said. ``She's got a strength that a  
whole lot of people don't have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Childhood friend Charles Woodard said Hunter fell around 5:30  
p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was outside seeing off a friend and was going back up the  
steps to his house when his feet got tangled,'' said Woodard. ``He 
just fell backward and hit his head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former major league pitcher was diagnosed in September with  
ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, a neurological disease that 
interferes with the signals the brain sends to the muscles. Over 
time, the muscles degenerate. The cause is unknown, and there is no 
cure. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter pitched for 15 years, winning 224 games, including a  
perfect game. He received five World Series rings while playing for 
the Kansas City and Oakland Athletics and the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd said Hunter hasn't undergone surgery since he was admitted  
to the hospital. However, his head injuries caused blood clots on 
his brain, and he was undergoing a series of tests, The Pilot and 
Ledger Star of Norfolk, Va., reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors in Greenville are consulting with others at The Johns  
Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, who are 
treating Hunter's ALS.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Questions Gore on Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES (AP) -- Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, seeking  
to capitalize on what an aide to Vice President Al Gore now says 
was a miscue, questioned Gore's commitment to abortion rights 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect a woman's right to choose, and that includes women  
who are poor,'' Bradley said, referring to a story in last Sunday's 
editions of The Des Moines Register about Gore's position on 
abortion. The two men are vying against each other for the 
Democratic Party's presidential nomination next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Gore spokesman Roger Salazar said the vice  
president did not believe that federal money should be used to pay 
for abortions, except to save the life of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Salazar, reached Wednesday night to comment on Bradley's  
statement, said he gave the newspaper bad information. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not do my research.'' Salazar said. ``The vice president  
opposes any attempt to restrict Medicaid funding for abortions. He 
has fought to guarantee that Medicaid recipients who are victims of 
rape or incest should have access to abortion, in addition to those 
whose lives are endangered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1993, federal law has prohibited the use of federal funds,  
including Medicaid, to pay for abortions except in cases of rape, 
incest or instances where the mother's life is endangered.

<HEADLINE> Former Mayor Gets House Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The ex-mayor of Camden on Wednesday avoided  
prison for illegally receiving $20,833 in salary from his former 
post as school superintendent after he became mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold W. Webster, 68, could have faced up to 16 months in  
prison, but the federal judge granted a request for no 
incarceration from Webster's lawyer, who noted that the former 
mayor is blind and suffers from a heart condition and diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Webster was sentenced to six months' house arrest and  
three years of probation. U.S. District Judge Alfred M. Wolin also 
ordered him to repay all the money and assessed a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster was sworn in as mayor earlier than scheduled and a  
school computer kept sending him checks because it didn't have the 
new date in its system, Webster's lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster is the second official of the Camden school district,  
which has 20,000 students, to admit wrongdoing in less than two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Former school board president Elaine A. Bey served five months  
in prison after pleading guilty to embezzling more than $24,000 in 
school funds for personal use, including liquor and adult movie 
rentals.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Suspect Tied to Neo-Nazis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	METALINE FALLS, Wash. (AP) -- The man who surrendered Wednesday  
in the shootings of five people at a Jewish Community Center in Los 
Angeles has a painfully familiar history: a low-profile loner with 
racist views and a nasty temper. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who remember Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., 37, say he was a  
lonely, bespectacled overweight boy teased by his classmates. After 
high school, an injury kept him from completing Army boot camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he got involved with neo-Nazi groups near this timber  
town in eastern Washington and had a long relationship with the 
widow of a hate-group founder killed in a shootout with police. 
</P>
<P>
	After the relationship ended last year, Furrow tried to commit  
himself to a private mental hospital in the Seattle suburbs, 
telling the staff at Fairfax Psychiatric Hospital ``he was thinking 
about suicide and shooting people'' at a mall north of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I feel like I could just lose it and kill people,''  
Furrow was quoted as saying in papers filed by King County 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged last Nov. 2 with second-degree assault, accused  
of attacking a Fairfax nurse with a knife after he apparently 
changed his mind about committing himself and demanded his car keys 
back. Deputies found a 9mm handgun and ammunition and four knives 
in the vehicle. He pleaded guilty, served about five months in 
jail, and was released May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was described as a quiet guy by those who had contact  
with him here and in a rural area at the south end of Puget Sound, 
where he grew up. His father, also named Buford O. Furrow, retired 
in 1977 as a chief master sergeant in the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents were ``wonderful people,'' said junior-high  
schoolmate Loni Merrill. She said Furrow used to get teased about 
his allergy medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a loner, a kind of bookish guy -- what they'd call a  
nerd these days. But he was always nice to me,'' Ms. Merrill said 
Wednesday. ``He wasn't somebody that stood out. He was somebody who 
nobody knew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow graduated from high school in 1979 and joined the Army in  
August 1980. He got an honorable discharge two months later because 
of an ``unstable knee,'' said Army spokeswoman Verna Williams in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Years later, Furrow didn't make much of an impression in  
Metaline Falls, a town of 230 people in the Selkirk Mountain 
foothills near the Idaho border. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow apparently had addresses in Rosamond, Calif., near Los  
Angeles, in 1993 and 1994, but locals say he lived here for several 
years with Debbie Mathews, whose husband, Robert J. Mathews, 
founded the neo-Nazi group The Order, a violent offshoot of the 
Aryan Nations. Mathews was killed in 1984 when his hideout caught 
fire during a shootout with federal agents on Whidbey Island in 
Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler said he believes he married  
Furrow and Mathews around 1996, though the union was not recorded 
with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview Wednesday from his compound at Hayden  
Lake, Idaho, Butler said Furrow may have attended services at his 
Church of Jesus Christ Christian/Aryan Nations a few times several 
years ago, but he did not know him well. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what might have motivated Tuesday's shootings, Butler  
replied: ``The war against the white race. There's a war of 
extermination against the white male.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who answered the phone at the number listed for Debbie  
Mathews hung up on The Associated Press on Wednesday. There was no 
sign of her on her property, which has several ``No Trespassing'' 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Aryan Nations member Floyd Cochran said he met Furrow at  
the group's northern Idaho compound in 1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had basic conversations about Jews running the world,''  
Cochran said in a telephone interview from his home in Moshannon, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow ``was not any more violent than other people there,''  
said Cochran, who now lectures in opposition to hate groups. ``He 
had a fascination with guns, but at the Aryan Nations if you didn't 
have a fascination with guns you might get shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Furrow also ``was fascinated with where did the money  
from The Order go,'' adding: ``That might explain his fascination 
with Debbie Mathews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Robert Mathews' death, 22 Order members were jailed on  
racketeering charges, accused in the 1984 murder of Denver radio 
talk-show host Alan Berg and of robberies that netted more than $4 
million -- one-third of which was never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Cochran said Furrow also had dated Jeannie Yarbrough, whose  
husband was among those imprisoned, and that he'd heard Furrow used 
to dig in Yarbrough's yard, apparently looking for the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Reynolds of the Southern Poverty Law Center in  
Montgomery, Ala., which tracks hate groups and has a file on 
Furrow, said Furrow apparently followed the beliefs of the 
so-called Phineas Priesthood, which is opposed to interracial 
marriage and the charging of interest by banks. That loose-knit 
group also has been linked to 1996 Spokane-area bombings and bank 
robberies, and to recent fires at synagogues in Sacramento, Calif., 
Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow worked for just over a year as a mechanic at a  
farm-implement dealership in nearby Colville. He was let go in 
December 1995 due to a lack of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-workers remembered him as a hard worker, but mechanic Dan  
Villers said Wednesday he wasn't surprised by the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very racial. He did not like blacks and Jews,'' Villers  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if he did it to prove his loyalty to the Aryans,  
but I have a hard time believing he conjured this up on his own,'' 
the mechanic said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow left the area last year.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think (Ms. Mathews) dumped him a year or so ago, and I  
haven't seen him since,'' the town marshal, Rick Reiber, told The 
Spokesman-Review newspaper in Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow returned to the west side of the state, for a time living  
in a trailer near Lynnwood north of Seattle, The Seattle Times 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came his clash at the mental hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	After being released from jail in May, Furrow headed south to  
his parents' home near the state capital of Olympia. The house -- 
visited by the FBI after the shootings -- is tucked into lush woods 
in a rural area where blackberries and purple fireweed flowers line 
the roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Janet Tyrolt said she last saw Furrow about a week ago.  
</P>
<P>
	They only spoke once -- when they met at their mailboxes and  
joked about how dangerous it was to dash across the road to check 
the mail. Afterwards, ``he actually stopped the traffic for me,'' 
Ms. Tyrolt said. ``It was really nice.''

	1 Dead in Salt Lake City Tornado  
</P>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Gov. Mike Leavitt declared a state of  
emergency in Salt Lake City after a tornado ripped through the 
downtown early this afternoon, killing one person and injuring 100. 
Power lines were ripped down, roofs torn off, windows blown out and 
shards of glass were everywhere. The tornado also damaged the roofs 
of the Delta Center, home of the Utah Jazz basketball team, and the 
Salt Palace Convention Center, which was hosting an outdoor 
retailers show. The streets were littered with shredded tents set 
up for the convention. Mayor Deedee Corradini said dogs were being 
used to search the debris near the convention center.

	Clinton: L.A. Tragedy Disturbing  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today it is ``deeply  
disturbing'' to think that the shootings at the Los Angeles Jewish 
center were motivated by religious hatred. Clinton did not offer 
specifics but alluded to reports linking the suspected gunman, 
Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., and the white supremacist group The 
Order. Furrow turned himself in today to FBI agents in Las Vegas. 
He said he wanted his act to be ``a wake-up call to America to kill 
Jews,'' authorities said. Los Angeles County Deputy District 
Attorney Craig Hum plans to file a warrant charging Furrow with 
five counts of attempted murder.

	Georgia Teen To Be Tried As Adult  
</P>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- A 15-year-old boy accused of shooting six  
classmates at his high school should be tried as an adult, a judge 
ruled today, saying the crime was especially heinous because the 
boy was allegedly trying to copy the Columbine massacre. Juvenile 
Court Judge William Schneider said he believes society's need to 
prevent such shootings outweigh T.J. Solomon's interests. He 
ordered the case transferred to Superior Court, where Solomon could 
face life in prison if convicted of aggravated assault and other 
charges. Solomon, a sophomore at Heritage High School, is accused 
of opening fire May 20 with two guns at the school 20 miles east of 
Atlanta.

put to rest rumors that he is near death. ``The rumors are 
absolutely false,'' Nancy Reagan said in a statement read to The 
Associated Press by the Reagans' spokeswoman. Rumors about the 
88-year-old Reagan's health have been swirling for weeks.

	Study: Allergy Shots Block Symptoms  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monthly allergy shots can lessen the torment of  
hay fever for years after the shots are stopped, a study found. 
Researchers at the Imperial College School of Medicine in London 
found that patients who received immunotherapy monthly for three or 
four years reported weaker symptoms of the grass-pollen allergy 
three years after stopping the treatment. The research is reported 
in tomorrow's edition of The New England Journal of Medicine. The 
study found little difference between the severity of symptoms 
reported by patients who had continued allergy-shot treatment 
during the three-year trial and those who got dummy shots.

Instruments, are being offered as an optional feature with IBM's 
Aptiva line of computers, boosting the price by about $100, IBM 
said today. A built-in modem would likely make it easier and 
cheaper for people to switch from a dial-up Internet connection to

Chicago Cubs 7-5 today and opened a 7 1/2-game lead in the National 
League West. The Diamondbacks improved to 66-49 and topped their 
win total from 1998. Randy Johnson, who struck out 11 in eight 
innings and left with a 5-3 lead, lost a win when the Cubs tied the 
game in the ninth on Henry Rodriguez's RBI double off Matt Mantei 
and Glenallen Hill's run-scoring infield single.

<HEADLINE> Cisco Report Pushes Dow Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher today as a battered market  
revived, due in part to a better-than-expected earnings report from 
networking company Cisco Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 44.00 points at 10,699.15. This morning's gains followed through 
on a rebound that began Tuesday afternoon, when the Dow and other 
indicators regained some of the ground lost in early steep 
selloffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher today. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 9.10 at 1,290.53, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was up 22.54 at 2,512.65. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market was ripe for a modest rally following a  
slump that has left every major market index well below the lofty 
records reached in mid-July. But most Wall Street players expect 
market jitters to endure through Aug. 24, when Federal Reserve 
policy-makers hold their next meeting to set interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed is widely expected to raise short-term interest rates  
for the second time this year, hoping to prevent inflation from 
creeping into the robust U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	That possibility and growing fears of a third rate hike this  
fall are hurting stocks and bonds alike. Plummeting bond prices 
have pushed up the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to nearly 
two-year highs approaching 6.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For some investors, rising bond yields have presented an  
attractive alternative to returns on volatile stocks. Other stock 
investors are unsettled that an uptrend in interest rates will cut 
into corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco helped spark buying today, rising 1 7/16 to 60 3/16. Late  
Tuesday, the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat 
analysts' estimates, rounding out a fiscal year in which revenues 
grew 43 percent and operating profits improved 35 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 98.3 million shares, 
well ahead of Tuesday's early pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 3.19 at 606.56, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.95 at 772.72. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.05 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.6 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.0 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
0.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Former Presidents Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over the strains of ``Hail to the Chief,''  
Gerald Ford strode into the White House East Room 
shoulder-to-shoulder with President Clinton and was hailed as the 
steady statesman the country needed after the ``long national 
nightmare'' of Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford and seven other prominent Americans received the  
Presidential Medal of Freedom on Wednesday, 25 years to the week 
after Richard M. Nixon resigned as president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steady, trustworthy, Gerald Ford ended a long national  
nightmare,'' Clinton said, echoing the phrase Ford used when he was 
sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford became president after Nixon left office on Aug. 9, 1974,  
and served out what would have been Nixon's second term. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he left the White House after 895 days, America was  
stronger, calmer and more self-confident,'' Clinton said. ``America 
was, in other words, more like President Ford himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The medal is the nation's highest civilian honor. Clinton  
awarded it to former President Carter in Atlanta on Monday, making 
George Bush the only living former president who has not received 
the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Established by President Truman as a wartime honor, the medal  
was reintroduced by President Kennedy as way to honor civilian 
service. Clinton has awarded the medal to civil rights leaders, 
philanthropists, entertainers and statesmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``In honoring them we honor also the values and principles of  
our nation's founding and our nation's future,'' Clinton said of 
Wednesday's honorees. The recipients did not speak inside the White 
House, but Ford paused outside to reflect on the events of 25 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't avoid those reminiscences. It was a monumental  
day,'' he said. ``It was a unique situation as far as the country 
is concerned and I hope it never happens again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Ford, the honorees were:  
</P>
<P>
	--Lloyd M. Bentsen, Clinton's first Treasury secretary who served  
22 years in the Senate and six years in the House. The Texan was 
the Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	--Edgar M. Bronfman Sr., president of the World Jewish Congress.  
He has ``worked to ensure basic rights for Jews around the world 
and to fight anti-Semitism and has spearheaded the effort to 
retrieve the assets of Holocaust victims and their families,'' 
according to a White House tribute.

<HEADLINE> Woodstock Confirms Rap, Rock Wedding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If Woodstock '99 proved anything musically, it  
was how eagerly young fans have embraced the marriage between rap 
and hard rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Korn, Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Insane Clown Posse and Rage Against  
the Machine were the festival's breakout stars, and all combine 
clangorous guitars with the stutter-step beats of hip-hop. 
</P>
<P>
	During a down period for rock 'n' roll, these acts are selling  
discs: 1.7 million for Limp Bizkit's ``Significant Other'' in less 
than two months, 1.5 million for Kid Rock's ``Devil Without a 
Cause,'' according to Soundscan. Judging by the malevolent mood in 
the mosh pit, they've also restored a sense of danger to rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the only real surprise is how long it took for this  
hybrid to exert its muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	The raging, cathartic noise of heavy rock 'n' roll has been a  
staple of the musical diet of teen-age boys for four decades. 
Angry, hard-hitting rap has also been popular among many teen-agers 
during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``When rock first started, it was done with piano by Little  
Richard and Chuck Berry, and white kids loved it,'' said rapper and 
rocker Ice T. ``Rock came back again in the form of hip-hop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ice T shocked many music fans in the early 1990s when he started  
a parallel career with the hard rock band Body Count. It brought 
him more aggravation than sales, particularly when he was dropped 
by Time Warner because of the controversy over his song, ``Cop 
Killer.'' Body Count is still alive, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hip-hop in its truest form is rock 'n' roll,'' said Ice T.  
``What do we do say when we do hip-hop? We rock the mike, rock the 
house. Run-DMC, they were the kings of rock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Run-DMC broke down walls between rock and rap by collaborating  
with Aerosmith on a remake of ``Walk This Way.'' Red Hot Chili 
Peppers and the Beastie Boys also bridged the genres, but they were 
isolated successes rather than a movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's hot acts listened to both styles. The two members of  
Insane Clown Posse were big N.W.A. fans as teen-agers in Detroit. 
Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst listened to so much rap as a youngster 
that he was mocked by friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``They grew up with rap,'' said John Scher, Woodstock concert  
promoter. ``It was not unlike the important rock stars of the 1960s 
and 1970s, who grew up listening to rhythm 'n' blues and were 
tremendously influenced by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Limp Bizkit includes a rap-style DJ, former House of Pain member  
DJ Lethal, in its lineup. ``Significant Other'' features production 
by DJ Premier from Gangstarr, and a cameo by Method Man of the 
Wu-Tang Clan. 
</P>
<P>
	The band, from Jacksonville, Fla., became an MTV favorite  
through its voice-shredding cover of George Michael's ``Faith.'' 
Limp Bizkit also benefited from an early association with Korn, 
with whom it shares an intense, angry sound. Woodstock teetered on 
the edge of chaos when some fans took Limp Bizkit's song, ``Break 
Things,'' as a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
	Proud of its sound and contemptuous of imitators, Korn titled  
its latest album, ``Follow the Leader.'' The band's roots are in 
the fertile rock proving-ground of Orange County in California. Its 
singer, Jonathon Davis, is a star in the making. 
</P>
<P>
	Rage Against the Machine has been around longer, and isn't quite  
as visceral in its approach. Fiercely committed to leftist 
politics, Rage headlined a benefit concert earlier this year to 
raise money for Mumia Abu-Jamal, a former radio reporter on death 
row for the 1981 killing of a Philadelphia police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	While these are basically rock bands that use rap, Kid Rock and  
Insane Clown Posse are rap artists who use rock. While musically 
intense, they are also more comical: The Clowns dress in Kiss-like 
makeup and squirt soda pop on their audience during shows, and Kid 
Rock is a Howard Stern favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Insane Clown Posse doesn't even try to get on the radio. Since  
one of its new songs repeats an expletive 93 times, radio won't 
bother with them. 
</P>
<P>
	For followers of music history, these new acts follow a familiar  
pattern of white artists succeeding with a style invented in black 
communities. Ice T said he's a fan, and doesn't begrudge anyone 
success following a path he's been down before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think that black people accept the fact that in  
America, whatever you do, somebody white will do it and be 
bigger,'' he said. ``That's just part of being black.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White audiences are more likely to accept Korn and Limp Bizkit  
``because it makes them feel like they have a chance to do it, 
too,'' Ice T said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the musical integration embodied by the hot new bands  
doesn't necessarily extend to the audiences. Ice T is performing 
with Body Count on the Vans Warped package tour, with many 
like-minded rock bands, and he sees only an occasional black face 
in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodstock '99's audience, too, was almost exclusively white.  
</P>
<P>
	Ice T also performs on rap tours with overwhelmingly black  
audiences. He blames promoters who, through advertising and booking 
policies, make it much less likely that racially mixed audiences 
will come together. 
</P>
<P>
	Ice T said he wouldn't care if he was doing a show ``and a space  
ship with Martians showed up, as long as people were having fun.''

<HEADLINE> Customs Changing Search Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Customs Service, responding to allegations  
of abusive drug searches, said Wednesday it will begin seeking 
approval from a federal magistrate any time it wants to hold an 
airline passenger for more than four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy, effective Oct. 1, marks the latest change in the  
way Customs checks passengers for drugs, and is the most 
significant step to improve search procedures, said the agency's 
commissioner, Raymond Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
	The searches are intended to catch smugglers who hide cocaine or  
heroin inside their clothes or who swallow drug packets. The 
searches usually begin with a pat-down and, with reasonable 
suspicion, can proceed to a partial or full strip search, an X-ray 
or a monitored bowel movement. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, Customs now can detain passengers for long periods  
of time without court approval. Under the change, Customs would 
have to convince a federal magistrate that it had ``reasonable 
suspicion'' for continuing keeping a passenger in custody beyond 
four hours, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the magistrate declines the Customs request, the passenger is  
released. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking people's liberty away. We want judicial review of  
that,'' Kelly said. ``We want oversight as soon as reasonably 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union said it was a step in the  
right direction. But the group believes the reasonable suspicion 
standard is easy enough for law enforcement to meet and the change 
still does not ``protect people from abusive or discriminatory'' 
searches, legislative counsel Gregory Nojeim said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU would have preferred a tougher ``probable cause''  
standard that a crime has been committed, he said. ``They are not 
going the distance that they should to protect passengers' civil 
liberties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Customs arrived at the four-hour trigger because historical data  
showed that limit generally is the time frame when critical 
decisions are made about the need for more advanced searches, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs is facing numerous lawsuits from people alleging they  
were singled out for body searches because of their race and 
gender. The allegations first were reported by The Associated Press 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency announced Wednesday that in May it began collecting,  
for the first time, uniform data including the race, gender, age 
and citizenship of people detained for a personal search, along 
with the reason for the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, information was not reported in a consistent manner.  
Customs officials believe the information, stored in a national 
data base, eventually will give the agency a more accurate picture 
of who is being stopped and why. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, President Clinton ordered federal law enforcement  
officers, including Customs, to document the race and gender of 
those they arrest or detain. 
</P>
<P>
	Around 52,468 of the 71.5 million international air travelers  
who passed through Customs in 1998 were subjected to some level of 
body search, most of them simple pat-downs, Customs officials have 
said. Most people stopped for searches last year were Hispanic men, 
followed by white men, and black men; Hispanics can be members of 
any race. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this fiscal year, 6,829 whites were searched, followed by  
6,572 Hispanics and 4,068 blacks; there was no breakdown by gender. 
</P>
<P>
	An independent panel has been looking at complaints of racial  
bias by Customs inspectors involving personal searches and is 
expected soon to report its findings, Kelly said. Customs also is 
revising its handbook on personal searches. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs pledged to help passengers whose travel plans were  
disrupted if they were detained but not found to have smuggled 
drugs: new travel, hotel or transportation arrangements, with the 
government paying. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Customs changed its policy so a person detained for at  
least two hours could call someone about the delay. The agency also 
has clarified criteria for conducting searches, is retraining 
officers and has tightened the approval process for personal 
searches.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Filings Raise Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department used its final  
arguments in the Microsoft trial to present its most comprehensive 
rebuttal yet to claims that the $10 billion sale of the software 
giant's rival, Netscape Communication Corp., undermines the 
government's antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government and 19 states suing Microsoft devoted an  
entire section of their 776-page court filing Tuesday to deflect 
criticisms that Netscape's purchase by America Online Inc. makes 
the antitrust claims moot. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said the sale proved that competition was healthy in  
the high-tech industry, but the government argues that Netscape 
Communication Corp.'s purchase merely illustrates the effects of 
Microsoft's aggressive, predatory tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL's acquisition of Netscape itself evidences the harm to  
Netscape's browser business caused by Microsoft's predatory 
campaign,'' the government said. ``Netscape was acquired because it 
had been damaged by Microsoft's campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is considering  
the case without a jury, will base his verdict on the arguments, 
along with those filed by Microsoft. Earlier in the trial, Jackson 
said he found AOL's alliance with Netscape as possibly ``a very 
significant change in the playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its 450-page filing, Microsoft repeatedly denied it was a  
monopolist and rejected allegations that it ``has engaged in a 
broad pattern of unlawful conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defending itself against a central claim by the government,  
Microsoft argued that it built its Internet browser software into 
Windows -- its dominant computer operating system -- for free, to 
help consumers use the Web more effectively -- not to force out of 
business Netscape, which was selling similar browser software 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft's actions have produced higher quality Web browsing  
software and operating systems at lower cost to consumers, thereby 
contributing to the explosive growth of the Internet,'' the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also said the government failed to prove it blocked  
Netscape from distributing its Internet software from more than 40 
percent of consumers, a condition Jackson had established in an 
earlier ruling. It also argued that the $10 billion Netscape-AOL 
alliance ``provides new avenues for the widespread distribution of 
Netscape's Web browsing software.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The antitrust lawsuit, the company said in a summary of its  
filing, was ``largely a vehicle for Microsoft's competitors to 
attack Microsoft rather than compete in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lengthy filings largely repeat claims made in earlier legal  
documents and over 76 days of courtroom testimony, but Jackson will 
base the first phase of his two-part verdict -- expected later this 
year -- on these arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the foundation for everything,'' said Rich Gray, an  
antitrust lawyer in San Jose, Calif., who has been following the 
trial closely. ``They're critically important. If (the sides) can't 
tell their story forcefully at this stage, then they're in 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase of the judge's ruling is expected to foreshadow  
the eventual second part of his verdict, which probably will come 
early next year unless the sides settle. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's factual findings also are particularly important  
because appellate courts rarely challenge a trial judge's decisions 
on the facts of a case, but typically focus on his application of 
the law. Experts predict the Microsoft case to wind through appeals 
courts for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's factual findings will be ``much more difficult for  
Microsoft to attack on appeal,'' said Robert Taylor, another 
antitrust lawyer in California's Silicon Valley.

<HEADLINE> Cos. To Bankroll Family-Friendly TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Disgusted by sex-soaked and violent television  
programs, 11 major advertisers said Wednesday they will pay to have 
writers develop family-friendly shows for consideration by the WB 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertisers, including Procter &AMP; Gamble, General Motors, IBM  
and Sears, say they are taking the steps after finding fewer and 
fewer prime-time programs during which they feel comfortable 
selling their products. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to encourage responsible entertainment, and the  
programming that is available between the hours of 8 and 10 p.m. is 
not as family-friendly as we would like it to be,'' said Kaki 
Hinton, director of advertising services at the drug and consumer 
products maker Warner-Lambert Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertisers won't say how much money they are committing.  
But it generally costs between $60,000 and $90,000 to come up with 
a script, and they've agreed to bankroll at least eight. The WB 
will supervise the development and decide which scripts, if any, 
will go into production. 
</P>
<P>
	These advertisers have approached all of the broadcast networks  
with their concerns, but the WB came up with the most specific 
idea, said Andrea Alstrup, vice president of advertising at Johnson 
&AMP; Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Hollywood's creative people recoil from the idea of  
family-friendly shows, conceded Jordan Levin, executive vice 
president of programming for the WB. Such firm support from a group 
of advertisers will make more writers interested, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB's highest-rated show is ``7th Heaven,'' about a minister  
raising a family. But the network's stock in trade is 
teen-oriented, sex-obsessed dramas like ``Dawson's Creek,'' whose 
success has encouraged other networks to relentlessly go after 
young viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	While `7th Heaven'' draws many teen viewers, most television  
executives say family-oriented shows usually appeal to older 
viewers that the bulk of advertisers don't desire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confused as a viewer as to what the advertisers really  
want,'' said Dorothy Swanson, founder of Viewers for Quality 
Television. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertising group funding the new programs say they want a  
better balance of programming. ``We're not saying the other stuff 
should go away,'' said Gretchen Briscoe, a spokeswoman for Procter 
&AMP; Gamble, ``we're just saying we need more options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although television networks frequently take their cues from  
major advertisers about what programs are acceptable, Swanson said 
she was concerned that the WB may be giving away too much of its 
authority as programmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe they're going to be intrusive,'' Levin said.  
``We don't tell them how to do their jobs and they don't tell us 
how to do our jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alstrup said the advertisers ``don't plan to become production  
arms for the networks. What we are really trying to do is raise the 
level of awareness and encourage the writers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech, AT&AMP;T, Nationwide Insurance, Pfizer and Wendy's  
International are also contributing to the scripts. 
</P>
<P>
	For the WB, the deal gives financial help to what is often the  
least cost-effective functions of a network. Networks routinely pay 
millions of dollars to write and produce prospective shows that 
never get on the air or are quickly canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin said he expected one or two of the scripts will make it on  
the air, although not until next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertisers are coming up with other ways to advance their  
agenda, including sponsoring a page in TV Guide each week to steer 
viewers to family programming. They will also host an awards 
luncheon in Los Angeles next month for family-friendly shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't feel there were enough programs out there to warrant  
a dinner,'' Alstrup said.

<HEADLINE> Bills Lose Shawn Bryson for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Bills have lost fullback Shawn  
Bryson for the season with a torn anterior crucuiate ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	Head coach Wade Phillips said this morning that Bryson will  
undergo surgery on the knee and will be placed on injured reserve. 
He is expected to spend the next 6-8 weeks in rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryson suffered the injury during practice Tuesday afternoon  
when he made a cut during a run upfield. Teammates said they heard 
a popping sound when Bryson went down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough situation. That's why it is such a tough game,''  
Phillips said. ``Some people begrudge them and they talk about the 
money these guys make, but they can get hurt at any time, 
certainly, and it effects your job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryson was a third round selection in April's draft out of the  
University of Tennessee. He had 91 carries for 505 yards and eight 
touchdowns with the Volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryson had been drawing raves through the first week of training  
camp for his play, showing quickness out of the backfield and 
promise of being a pass receiver for a fullback.

<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The white supremacist wanted in the shooting of  
five people at a Los Angeles Jewish community center fled to Las 
Vegas in taxis, walked into an FBI office and confessed Wednesday, 
saying he wanted his act to be ``a wake-up call to America to kill 
Jews,'' authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., 37, was charged by federal prosecutors  
in the slaying of a postal worker shot Tuesday near the community 
center after Los Angeles police and federal agents poured into Las 
Vegas to question him. 
</P>
<P>
	California authorities expected to charge him in the community  
center shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	At his federal court appearance Wednesday, Furrow said little  
and waived extradition to Los Angeles, said his attorney, Art 
Allen. After the hearing, he was put on a helicopter that arrived 
in Los Angeles 1 1/2 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	When the judge asked if he understood the charges, Furrow  
responded: ``Yes, I do,'' Allen said. Reporters were barred from 
the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	As he was led out of the courthouse, a man shouted at Furrow:  
``You are a coward! You are a coward!'' Furrow smiled, then was 
hustled into a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow has ties to hate groups in the Northwest and had tried to  
commit himself to a psychiatric hospital last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly had the wherewithal to create a greater tragedy  
than the one we had,'' Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los  
Angeles, said Furrow's comments upon surrendering proved that the 
attack was a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``To these kinds of demented and warped minds, having a few  
hours under the sun where the whole world is paying attention to 
you is really tantalizing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow told authorities he took two cabs for the 275-mile trip  
from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, one to the California-Nevada line, 
the other the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	After surrendering, he told investigators ``he wanted this to be  
a wake-up call to America to kill Jews,'' an FBI source said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said Furrow walked unarmed into the office and said:  
``You're looking for me -- I killed the kids in Los Angeles.'' 
Furrow assumed he had killed some children, according to the 
source. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton on Wednesday said ``what we have heard about  
the suspect and his motives is deeply disturbing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only hope that this latest incident will intensify our  
resolve to make America a safer place, a place of healing across 
the lines that divide us,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles County prosecutor Craig Hum said he would file a  
warrant charging Furrow with five counts of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los  
Angeles, said it was uncertain whether federal civil rights charges 
also might be brought against Furrow. Federal civil rights statutes 
are so narrowly defined that the shooting might not be considered a 
hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was charged with federal murder and illegal possession of  
a firearm in the slaying of Joseph Ileto, 39, a postal worker who 
was killed about an hour after the center shootings Tuesday. 
Prosecutors could seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Ileto had just delivered mail to a home and was returning to his  
truck when he was shot several times. There was no indication of a 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Early indications are the community center gunman acted alone,  
Parks said, although investigators are looking into possible links 
to any groups or other individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacker strode into the community center's lobby and opened  
fire with a semiautomatic gun, peppering the building with 70 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman evaded police, who arrived at the center within four  
minutes of the shootings. Furrow allegedly hijacked a Toyota at 
gunpoint about 20 minutes later -- leaving behind a van full of 
ammunition, survival paraphernalia and a book linked to white 
supremacist thought -- then dumped the car at a motel and 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	He left Los Angeles on Tuesday evening, spending the night at a  
Las Vegas hotel, police Sgt. John Pasquariello said. Before the 
surrender, the hunt for Furrow had spread across the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was a member of the Aryan Nations in 1995, said Mark  
Potok, a researcher with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which 
maintains a database of white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a picture of him, Furrow, in a Nazi outfit,'' Potok  
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow lived at times in Metaline Falls, Wash., once a haven for  
the supremacist group The Order and had a relationship with Debbie 
Mathews, widow of Order founder Robert J. Mathews. Mathews was 
killed in 1984 when his hideout caught fire during a shootout with 
federal agents on Whidbey Island in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year Furrow tried to commit himself at the Fairfax  
Psychiatric Hospital in the Seattle suburbs, but got in trouble 
when he pulled a knife on a nurse. He eventually pleaded guilty to 
second-degree assault, served about five months in jail and was 
released on May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The wounded from the community center included a 5-year-old boy  
who was hit in the abdomen and leg. He was in critical condition 
Wednesday after undergoing six hours of surgery and was given a 
fair chance of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hurt were the center receptionist, 68-year-old Isabelle  
Shalometh; two 6-year-old boys and a 16-year-old counselor at the 
center's summer camp. The counselor and one of the boys were in 
good condition Wednesday, and the other boy was in fair condition; 
Mrs. Shalometh was released from the hospital Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center Wednesday, staff, parents and children slowly  
trickled back to summer programs under the gaze of armed security 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Eliad, a parent who was bringing his 4-year-old daughter  
back, said: ``Nobody's going to scare us away.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Feds Want Seat Belt Warning Labels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators want a warning label that  
says young children should not use seat and shoulder belt 
positioning devices in cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  
proposed requiring the warning label so that seat belt adjusters 
are not used on children under age 6 out of concern they would 
suffer greater injuries in crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This proposal, if adopted, would help parents provide for the  
safety of children,'' Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of after-market, seat-belt-positioning devices have  
been sold in the United States in the last decade. The devices 
often use cloth or clips to lower the shoulder belt for children or 
small adults so the belt does not ride up on their necks. 
</P>
<P>
	However, unlike child seats, they are not regulated by any  
federal motor vehicle safety standard. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, agency officials are worried that  
belt-positioning devices may cause the lap belt to rise up in a 
crash and rest above the child's hips, increasing the potential for 
abdominal injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is seeking public comment on the proposed label and  
also whether it should alter federal safety standards to include 
regulation of belt positioners. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Capps, chief executive officer of Blue Ridge  
International Products Co., the largest manufacturer of seat belt 
adjusters in the United States, welcomed the idea of warning 
labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Ridge makes and sells SafeFit, a triangle-shaped nylon  
pouch that fits over the shoulder and lap belts near the buckle. 
</P>
<P>
	Capps said SafeFit has always recommended using the product for  
children over 50 pounds, or age 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1990, Blue Ridge has sold more than 4 million of the  
devices in the United States and 23 other countries, Capps said. 
About a half-dozen other companies sell seat belt adjusters. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing done in 1994 by NHTSA, the federal safety agency,  
indicated the belt-positioning devices generally performed 
adequately in restraining a 6-year-old dummy, but the 3-year-old 
dummy registered increased risk of head injuries in a variety of 
tests. In many tests, the seat belts were generally more effective 
in restraining the dummies without the adjuster than with it. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency recommends that children weighing 20 pounds to 40  
pounds, or are roughly 1 to 4 years old, should be in child seats. 
Once they outgrow child seats, the agency recommends that children 
ride in booster seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``The data show that a 6-year-old child restrained in a  
belt-positioning booster seat is provided a greater level of safety 
protection than when using a seat belt positioning device,'' a 
32-page agency document on the issue said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Capps noted most children do not use booster seats after  
they have outgrown child seats. They are instead transferred to the 
ill-fitting adult shoulder belts that ride up on their necks. 
</P>
<P>
	``These children would have injuries (in crashes) without the  
shoulder belt adjuster because they're going to put the shoulder 
belts behind their back,'' Capps argued.

<HEADLINE>  Anderson, Falcons Agree to Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson, who  
missed the first two weeks of training camp because of a contract 
dispute, agreed to a five-year, $32 million deal with the Atlanta 
Falcons after nearly four hours of talks Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson and his agent, Jim Sims, reached the accord after  
meeting at a Greenville hotel with Falcons coach Dan Reeves and 
general manager Harold Richardson. The running back will get a 
signing bonus of $7.5 million, becoming the highest-paid player in 
Atlanta history. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who set a franchise record with 1,846 yards rushing  
and an NFL mark with 410 carries as the Falcons advanced to the 
Super Bowl last season, will join the team for a light practice 
Thursday afternoon. He won't play in Friday night's first 
exhibition game against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's missed some time, but we know he can make it up because  
he's a veteran and the system hasn't changed,'' Reeves said. 
``He'll be ready for the season opener against the Vikings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said he wanted to complete a deal by Friday, knowing  
that marks a month to go until the Sept. 12 contest against 
Minnesota, a rematch of last year's NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``A month is plenty of time to get ready,'' he said. ``Most guys  
will tell you that you really don't need to be in training camp for 
five or six weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson made an early-morning appearance on an Atlanta radio  
station before joining Sims in a stretch limousine for the 2 1/2-hour 
drive to Greenville. The player looked tired and frazzled after the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a bit shellshocked,'' Sims said.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, Anderson managed to display a bit of the wit that made  
him one of Atlanta's most popular athletes. He promised to unveil a 
new version of his ``Dirty Bird'' dance and joked that Reeves 
agreed to the deal when challenged to a boxing match. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately for Hollywood, I won't be able to do any feature  
films during the football season,'' the 26-year-old Anderson said. 
``But I'm happy it's over with. I want to play and it's great to 
see my teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sides basically agreed on the length and value of the  
contract but stumbled over the signing bonus, guaranteed money and 
structure of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson will become one of the highest-paid running backs in  
the NFL, according to his agent. He still trails Denver's Terrell 
Davis, who has a nine-year, $59 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves initially scoffed at Sims' request for a face-to-face  
meeting, hinting that it was a publicity stunt. But the coach 
conceded afterward that it was a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is better when you sit down face to face,'' Reeves said.  
``With the four of us there, we were able to get a lot of things 
cleared up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Anderson and Sims arrived at the hotel in their  
limo, Reeves and Richardson pulled up in a green Buick. Reeves, who 
has final say in contract matters, sat in on the talks for over an 
hour before leaving the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a good meeting, but I've got to go to practice,''  
the coach said. ``I'm late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Falcons held training camp at nearby Furman  
University, Richardson remained behind to continue the talks with 
Anderson and Sims. Finally, shortly after 5 p.m., the weary-looking 
Anderson emerged from the meeting room, saying he was hopeful of a 
deal getting done. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the only thing that remained was getting the approval  
of Reeves and Falcons owner Taylor Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson and Sims crawled back into their limo and followed  
Richardson's car to the Furman campus through rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson emerged from the vehicle at the player dormitories and  
pumped his arms in the air just as three of his offensive linemen -- 
Ephraim Salaam, Calvin Collins and Bob Whitfield -- pulled into the 
parking lot on a golf cart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, big money!'' Collins yelled.  
</P>
<P>
	Anderson embraced all three before jumping on the golf cart and  
riding away with them to their dorm room. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw him today, it was a great sight for sore eyes,''  
linebacker Jessie Tuggle said. ``To get in here now, it's still 
early, and I think the days he missed won't hurt him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons tried to carry on normally during Anderson's  
two-week-long holdout, but it was clearly a distraction for a team 
trying to follow up its first NFC championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't agree with what he did, and he knows that. He had a  
contract and I thought he should honor it,'' Reeves said. ``But 
that's part of the business. If you let it become personal ... it 
can get in the way of getting something done. We want to put it 
behind us and move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, set to make $2.6 million in the final year of his  
current contract, refused to report for the start of training camp 
July 29 without a new deal. He has since accumulated $70,000 in 
fines, but Reeves would not say if he still planned to collect the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims had raised the possibility of asking for a trade if  
Wednesday's talks didn't produce an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't get it done, I think from that point on we'll  
really have to push the trade option,'' Sims said Tuesday night. 
``He's not retiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves flatly rejected the idea of trading Anderson to another  
team, and the sides finally worked out their differences.

<HEADLINE> Science Standards Approved in Kan. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Following months of debate, the Kansas Board  
of Education on Wednesday approved a set of education standards 
that makes no reference to evolution -- the theory that living 
things evolved from earlier species. 
</P>
<P>
	The standards are suggestions only, and the 6-4 decision  
essentially leaves unchanged current state policy on the teaching 
of evolution in the public schools. Local schools now decide for 
themselves whether to teach the theory. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the state has no list of topics that should be on the  
statewide assessment tests. Educators are forming such a list, and 
the debate had been over whether evolution should be included. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the proposed standards never mentioned it, creationism --  
the belief that a higher power created the universe -- became part 
of the debate. Some board members originally supported proposals 
that defined creation as ``the idea that the design and complexity 
of the cosmos requires an intelligent designer.'' But that proposal 
was later withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the standards make no mention of one species evolving  
into another, the standards do mention natural selection -- the idea 
that advantageous traits increase in a population over time. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Wagnon, who voted against the standards, said ``I think  
they're weak -- they're mutated. They don't prepare students to take 
placement exams for college entry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the message to local school boards is ``we don't want  
you to think that (evolution) is important.''

<HEADLINE> Cisco Systems' Revenues Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nowhere is the Internet gold rush more apparent  
-- and real -- than at Cisco Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Capping a stunning fiscal year in which revenues grew 43 percent  
and operating profits improved 35 percent, Cisco's fourth-quarter 
results showed that it continues to dominate the frenzied race to 
upgrade systems for Internet communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the three month period ended July 31 totaled $3.55  
billion, a 48 percent increase from last year's fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., earned $727 million or 21  
cents per share, in the quarter, excluding one-time charges 
totaling $97 million for acquisition-related expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year-ago period, Cisco posted an operating profit of $525  
million, or 16 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The results edged most forecasts by industry analysts, which  
averaged 20 cents a share, according to a survey by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco's stock had retreated in advance of Tuesday's late  
afternoon report, but bounced back $2.25 per share to $61 in 
today's early Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some caution, however, on the part of Cisco executives  
regarding the uncertainty over whether concerns about the Year 2000 
computer bug would interrupt technology orders later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still don't know,'' said chief executive John Chambers.  
But, he added, ``We're more comfortable with Y2K than we were 
6-to-12 months ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Including all one-time factors, Cisco posted a net profit of  
$635 million, or 18 cents per share, in its fourth quarter, up from 
$493 million, or 15 cents a share a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco closed its fiscal year with revenue of $12.15 billion, up  
from $8.49 billion during the previous 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income totaled $2.55 billion, or 75 cents per share,  
for the fiscal year, an increase of 35 percent from the prior 
year's tally of $1.88 billion, or 58 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the fiscal year amounted to $2.10 billion, or 62  
cents per share. That compares with a net profit of $1.35 billion, 
or 42 cents per share, in the prior fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco again attributed its stellar results to the rapid growth  
of the Internet, including the race to bring high-speed, multimedia 
services to consumers over a single cable or phone wire. Revenues 
related to upgrading cable and phone systems for that purpose rose 
20 percent from the prior quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also pointed to the move away from traditional modes  
of voice and video communications, which are starting to be 
packaged in the format used to transmit data on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``By providing the systems that make the Internet work, Cisco is  
playing a major role in helping customers thrive in the explosive 
Internet economy,'' said Chambers. As a result, he boasted, Cisco 
is ``the fastest growing and most profitable company in the history 
of the computer industry.''

<HEADLINE> Underwood Won't Play With Vikings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood won't be juggling  
faith and football after all, at least not for the Minnesota 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said Wednesday that Underwood doesn't want to play, so  
the Vikings cut ties with the first-round draft pick who went AWOL 
after his first pro practice on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The team announced a financial settlement late Wednesday night  
in which Underwood's approximately $543,000 in bonus funds, most of 
which were frozen at his bank upon his disappearance, would be 
returned to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	When that happens, Underwood will be waived.  
</P>
<P>
	If Underwood is claimed, his new team would be responsible for  
his $475,000 base salary for 1999. But the Vikings would take the 
salary cap hit for Underwood's entire $1.725 million partially 
deferred signing bonus this season, rather than a prorated 
one-fifth slice of it. 
</P>
<P>
	If Underwood weren't picked up by another team, the Vikings' cap  
number this year would be only $345,000, the 20 percent cut of his 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the rookie pass rusher blamed his disappearance on  
inner turmoil over sports and religion coexisting in his life but 
said after a conversation Monday with defensive end-turned-minister 
Reggie White that he wanted to return to the Vikings if coach 
Dennis Green would have him back. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood flew from Philadelphia to Minneapolis and met with  
Green on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings had planned a news conference Wednesday but instead  
issued a short statement that read: ``Dimitrius told Coach Green 
that he has no desire to play football and has decided not to play 
for the Vikings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team added: ``There will be no further discussion by the  
Vikings until certain other issues are resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief among them were the financial implications of the team and  
Underwood parting ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Underwood's future in Minnesota has been cleared up,  
several questions remain. Why did Underwood change his mind about 
his desire to return to the Vikings? Did Green actually talk him 
out of it? 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's agent, Craig Domann, who sat in on the meeting  
between client and coach, didn't return phone calls Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Green reiterated that the Vikings were never worried about -- nor  
distracted by -- a rookie who walked out on them without telling a 
soul. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to focus on one player. We wouldn't want to  
focus on that one player even if it was Randy Moss,'' Green said. 
``Our football team wants to focus on the entire team. We're not a 
team that operates on one player or one coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, quarterback Randall Cunningham said that doesn't mean the  
Vikings don't care about Underwood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just pray that whatever he does, God leads him and he does  
it from his heart,'' Cunningham said. ``I don't know what he's 
going through in his life. I know that he needs a lot of godly 
people in his life and if he needs me, I'll definitely be there for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Underwood sought spiritual guidance from White, the  
NFL's career sacks leader who retired from the Packers last winter, 
he never pursued players on his own team who are noted for 
balancing faith and football, such as Cunningham or Cris Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've ever talked to him,'' Cunningham said.  
``I've only seen him probably once or twice. We'd like to see the 
best for him, but as long as he's in God's arms, he's going to be 
OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, the 29th pick in the NFL draft out of Michigan State,  
left the Vikings without explanation one day after signing a 
five-year, $5.3 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	He hitched an 80-mile ride to the Minneapolis-St. Paul  
International Airport and apologetically told his agent the next 
day that he'd had to tend to a family crisis and was on his way 
back to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	But once again, he didn't return and didn't call anybody.  
</P>
<P>
	A reporter from the Star Tribune of Minneapolis finally tracked  
him down over the weekend in a Philadelphia hotel lobby, where 
Underwood said he'd been torn between his faith in God and a career 
in professional football. 
</P>
<P>
	After speaking at length with White, Underwood said he'd decided  
to return to the Vikings, who had already begun exploring ways to 
part company with him rather than fine him $5,000 per missed day 
and give him another chance.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOCATION, LOCATION -- NOT!: When it comes to business travel,  
women and men have surprisingly different views. 
</P>
<P>
	A new survey by New York University's Center for Hospitality,  
Tourism and Travel Administration and Wyndham Hotels and Resorts 
found that 90 percent of the 403 women surveyed ranked ``responsive 
service'' as the most important factor when selecting a hotel for a 
business trip. ``Location,'' was second, with 71 percent, followed 
by ``affordable rates,'' with 62 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 203 men surveyed agreed with the women's choices, but ranked  
them differently. Sixty-five percent of the men said ``location'' 
was key; 60 percent named ``responsive service'' and 58 percent 
ranked ``affordable rates'' as number one. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found that men are more likely to find business  
travel a hassle (55 percent of men to 40 percent of women), and to 
avoid overnight trips (63 percent of men to 52 percent of women). 
Perhap's that's because women are more likely to view business 
travel as an opportunity to incorporate some leisure time away from 
home (68 percent of women to 52 percent of men). 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	TENNIS ANYONE?: Forget the company car, free dry-cleaning and  
tuition reimbursements, today's executives want health club 
memberships. According to a new survey by international 
outplacement consulting firm Lee Hecht Harrison, 58 percent of 
1,058 out-of-work managers said they would like a health club 
membership in their new job. Flextime ranked second, with 57 
percent of votes. 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked if they actually expect to receive such benefits,  
only 8 percent foresee a health club membership, while 24 percent 
think flextime is feasible. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	MOVING BLUES: Moving for a new job doesn't necessarily mean a  
better one. The 1999 biennial Survey and Analysis of Employee 
Relocation Policies and Costs, published by Runzheimer 
International, surveyed 263 relocation managers and found only 30 
percent of employees who were transferred last year were promoted, 
versus 36 percent who experienced a move to a similar job and no 
raise. Another 5 percent were demoted, and 29 percent were new 
hires. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those transferred, middle-management made up the largest  
segment. Sales and marketing staff were moved the most frequently. 
The average cost to relocate a homeowning transferee increased by 
$6,500 from two years ago to $42,160; the average cost to relocate 
renters rose to $15,022 from $10,802.

<HEADLINE> Gore and Bradley Seeking Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, seeking a  
slice of attention from the GOP-driven media frenzy, warned 
Wednesday against ``a right-wing U-turn'' from Republicans 
desperate to win back the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are hungry to roll back this progress,'' Gore said.  
``They are hungry to win this election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey swept through  
separate sections of the state Wednesday, both focusing on farm 
issues in hopes of drawing a contrast with Republicans vying for a 
high-profile straw poll on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spelled out his plan for dealing with a sour farm  
economy at the Dunlap Livestock Auction. He endorsed the 
$11-billion emergency aid package for farmers that the Senate 
Republican majority rejected before its August recess. ``We have an 
obligation to help good people through tough times and these are 
tough times for Iowa farmers,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also called on the Justice Department to launch an antitrust  
investigation of the meat-packing industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lack of competition has led to Depression-era prices for hogs  
while the meatpacking industry is making record earnings,'' Bradley 
said. ``That is unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore joined with Gov. Tom Vilsack to lead a discussion with  
farmers about their troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president called for revisions to the nation's basic  
farm legislation, the Freedom to Farm Act, as well as an emergency 
package of $10 billion in aid to farmers on the financial edge 
because of historic low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are in 1999, two Iowas,'' Gore said. ``There is an Iowa  
with unemployment under 2.6 percent with an economy that's booming 
and a future that's bright, but there's also a farm economy that's 
hurting badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was swinging through a series of small Iowa towns making  
his point, and was spending the night at a private home. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with activists in a Newton cafe, Gore departed from his  
farm theme to launch an spirited assault on Republicans and their 
``risky tax scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that is a reckless idea,'' said Gore, warning it would  
spark renewed deficits ``at a time when we have just dug our way 
out of the hole they put us in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's motorcade was rolling through a light rain, with the vice  
president sporting khaki slacks and cowboy boots in keeping with 
his rural theme. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore made it clear he wanted changes in farm policy, ``which is  
in serious need of improvement and change. 
</P>
<P>
	The Freedom to Farm legislation was a sharp change in farm  
policy, ending most traditional subsidy payments while also ending 
most planting restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	With farm commodity prices well below the cost of production,  
there's pressure for change. The issue is a delicate one for Gore 
because President Clinton signed the measure into law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pledge my support and all-out help to Iowans in both of  
those economies,'' said Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is the early favorite for the Democratic nomination, with  
much of the party's establishment quietly in his camp. He 
demonstrated those ties in opening his latest campaign swing, 
collecting the endorsements of a string of prominent Democrats like 
Des Moines Mayor Preston Daniels and six Democratic legislators 
along with prominent central Iowa Democrats like Polk County 
Attorney John Sarcone. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the attention this week has been on Republican straw  
poll fight, with has drawn up to 600 journalists to the state. Both 
Gore and Bradley were seeking a slice of that attention. Gore was 
rolling through the central part of the state in his campaign bus, 
while Bradley was in western Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	In his headline event of the day, Gore headed to farm outside  
Marshalltown to join with Vilsack and Iowa Agriculture Secretary 
Patty Judge to discuss farm woes. 
</P>
<P>
	The three perched on stools in the yard outside a rural  
Marshalltown farm to pledge aid to farmers, and hear worries from 
farmers in a 90-minute session. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore argued that farm legislation was inadequate to deal with  
tough economic times. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would resist using food as a weapon by slapping  
embargoes on foreign rivals, arguing that should be done only in 
``some exceptional cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Vilsack, a Democrat, has said he will stay neutral in the fight  
between Bradley and Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore used his farm forum to hammer his backing for  
ethanol-blended fuels, noting that the administration is moving to 
provide incentives for ethanol use under Clean Air Act regulations. 
Ethanol production is an important market for corn farmers.

<HEADLINE>  Alleged L.A. Gunman Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The white supremacist wanted in the shooting of  
five people at a Los Angeles Jewish community center fled to Las 
Vegas in taxis, walked into an FBI office and confessed Wednesday, 
saying he wanted his act to be ``a wake-up call to America to kill 
Jews,'' authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., 37, was charged by federal prosecutors  
in the slaying of a postal worker shot Tuesday near the community 
center after Los Angeles police and federal agents poured into Las 
Vegas to question him. 
</P>
<P>
	California authorities expected to charge him in the community  
center shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	At his federal court appearance Wednesday, Furrow said little  
and waived extradition to Los Angeles, said his attorney, Art 
Allen. After the hearing, he was put on a helicopter that arrived 
in Los Angeles 1 1/2 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	When the judge asked if he understood the charges, Furrow  
responded: ``Yes, I do,'' Allen said. Reporters were barred from 
the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	As he was led out of the courthouse, a man shouted at Furrow:  
``You are a coward! You are a coward!'' Furrow smiled, then was 
hustled into a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow has ties to hate groups in the Northwest and had tried to  
commit himself to a psychiatric hospital last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly had the wherewithal to create a greater tragedy  
than the one we had,'' Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los  
Angeles, said Furrow's comments upon surrendering proved that the 
attack was a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``To these kinds of demented and warped minds, having a few  
hours under the sun where the whole world is paying attention to 
you is really tantalizing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow told authorities he took two cabs for the 275-mile trip  
from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, one to the California-Nevada line, 
the other the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	After surrendering, he told investigators ``he wanted this to be  
a wake-up call to America to kill Jews,'' an FBI source said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said Furrow walked unarmed into the office and said:  
``You're looking for me -- I killed the kids in Los Angeles.'' 
Furrow assumed he had killed some children, according to the 
source. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton on Wednesday said ``what we have heard about  
the suspect and his motives is deeply disturbing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only hope that this latest incident will intensify our  
resolve to make America a safer place, a place of healing across 
the lines that divide us,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles County prosecutor Craig Hum said he would file a  
warrant charging Furrow with five counts of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los  
Angeles, said it was uncertain whether federal civil rights charges 
also might be brought against Furrow. Federal civil rights statutes 
are so narrowly defined that the shooting might not be considered a 
hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was charged with federal murder and illegal possession of  
a firearm in the slaying of Joseph Ileto, 39, a postal worker who 
was killed about an hour after the center shootings Tuesday. 
Prosecutors could seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Ileto had just delivered mail to a home and was returning to his  
truck when he was shot several times. There was no indication of a 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Early indications are the community center gunman acted alone,  
Parks said, although investigators are looking into possible links 
to any groups or other individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacker strode into the community center's lobby and opened  
fire with a semiautomatic gun, peppering the building with 70 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman evaded police, who arrived at the center within four  
minutes of the shootings. Furrow allegedly hijacked a Toyota at 
gunpoint about 20 minutes later -- leaving behind a van full of 
ammunition, survival paraphernalia and a book linked to white 
supremacist thought -- then dumped the car at a motel and 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	He left Los Angeles on Tuesday evening, spending the night at a  
Las Vegas hotel, police Sgt. John Pasquariello said. Before the 
surrender, the hunt for Furrow had spread across the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was a member of the Aryan Nations in 1995, said Mark  
Potok, a researcher with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which 
maintains a database of white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a picture of him, Furrow, in a Nazi outfit,'' Potok  
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow lived at times in Metaline Falls, Wash., once a haven for  
the supremacist group The Order and had a relationship with Debbie 
Mathews, widow of Order founder Robert J. Mathews. Mathews was 
killed in 1984 when his hideout caught fire during a shootout with 
federal agents on Whidbey Island in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year Furrow tried to commit himself at the Fairfax  
Psychiatric Hospital in the Seattle suburbs, but got in trouble 
when he pulled a knife on a nurse. He eventually pleaded guilty to 
second-degree assault, served about five months in jail and was 
released on May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The wounded from the community center included a 5-year-old boy  
who was hit in the abdomen and leg. He was in critical condition 
Wednesday after undergoing six hours of surgery and was given a 
fair chance of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hurt were the center receptionist, 68-year-old Isabelle  
Shalometh; two 6-year-old boys and a 16-year-old counselor at the 
center's summer camp. The counselor and one of the boys were in 
good condition Wednesday, and the other boy was in fair condition; 
Mrs. Shalometh was released from the hospital Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center Wednesday, staff, parents and children slowly  
trickled back to summer programs under the gaze of armed security 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Eliad, a parent who was bringing his 4-year-old daughter  
back, said: ``Nobody's going to scare us away.''

<HEADLINE>  Anderson, Falcons Agree to Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson, who  
missed the first two weeks of training camp because of a contract 
dispute, agreed to a five-year, $32 million deal with the Atlanta 
Falcons after nearly four hours of talks Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson and his agent, Jim Sims, reached the accord after  
meeting at a Greenville hotel with Falcons coach Dan Reeves and 
general manager Harold Richardson. The running back will get a 
signing bonus of $7.5 million, becoming the highest-paid player in 
Atlanta history. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who set a franchise record with 1,846 yards rushing  
and an NFL mark with 410 carries as the Falcons advanced to the 
Super Bowl last season, will join the team for a light practice 
Thursday afternoon. He won't play in Friday night's first 
exhibition game against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's missed some time, but we know he can make it up because  
he's a veteran and the system hasn't changed,'' Reeves said. 
``He'll be ready for the season opener against the Vikings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said he wanted to complete a deal by Friday, knowing  
that marks a month to go until the Sept. 12 contest against 
Minnesota, a rematch of last year's NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``A month is plenty of time to get ready,'' he said. ``Most guys  
will tell you that you really don't need to be in training camp for 
five or six weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson made an early-morning appearance on an Atlanta radio  
station before joining Sims in a stretch limousine for the 2 1/2-hour 
drive to Greenville. The player looked tired and frazzled after the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a bit shellshocked,'' Sims said.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, Anderson managed to display a bit of the wit that made  
him one of Atlanta's most popular athletes. He promised to unveil a 
new version of his ``Dirty Bird'' dance and joked that Reeves 
agreed to the deal when challenged to a boxing match. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately for Hollywood, I won't be able to do any feature  
films during the football season,'' the 26-year-old Anderson said. 
``But I'm happy it's over with. I want to play and it's great to 
see my teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sides basically agreed on the length and value of the  
contract but stumbled over the signing bonus, guaranteed money and 
structure of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson will become one of the highest-paid running backs in  
the NFL, according to his agent. He still trails Denver's Terrell 
Davis, who has a nine-year, $59 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves initially scoffed at Sims' request for a face-to-face  
meeting, hinting that it was a publicity stunt. But the coach 
conceded afterward that it was a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is better when you sit down face to face,'' Reeves said.  
``With the four of us there, we were able to get a lot of things 
cleared up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Anderson and Sims arrived at the hotel in their  
limo, Reeves and Richardson pulled up in a green Buick. Reeves, who 
has final say in contract matters, sat in on the talks for over an 
hour before leaving the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a good meeting, but I've got to go to practice,''  
the coach said. ``I'm late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Falcons held training camp at nearby Furman  
University, Richardson remained behind to continue the talks with 
Anderson and Sims. Finally, shortly after 5 p.m., the weary-looking 
Anderson emerged from the meeting room, saying he was hopeful of a 
deal getting done. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the only thing that remained was getting the approval  
of Reeves and Falcons owner Taylor Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson and Sims crawled back into their limo and followed  
Richardson's car to the Furman campus through rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson emerged from the vehicle at the player dormitories and  
pumped his arms in the air just as three of his offensive linemen -- 
Ephraim Salaam, Calvin Collins and Bob Whitfield -- pulled into the 
parking lot on a golf cart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, big money!'' Collins yelled.  
</P>
<P>
	Anderson embraced all three before jumping on the golf cart and  
riding away with them to their dorm room. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw him today, it was a great sight for sore eyes,''  
linebacker Jessie Tuggle said. ``To get in here now, it's still 
early, and I think the days he missed won't hurt him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons tried to carry on normally during Anderson's  
two-week-long holdout, but it was clearly a distraction for a team 
trying to follow up its first NFC championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't agree with what he did, and he knows that. He had a  
contract and I thought he should honor it,'' Reeves said. ``But 
that's part of the business. If you let it become personal ... it 
can get in the way of getting something done. We want to put it 
behind us and move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, set to make $2.6 million in the final year of his  
current contract, refused to report for the start of training camp 
July 29 without a new deal. He has since accumulated $70,000 in 
fines, but Reeves would not say if he still planned to collect the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims had raised the possibility of asking for a trade if  
Wednesday's talks didn't produce an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't get it done, I think from that point on we'll  
really have to push the trade option,'' Sims said Tuesday night. 
``He's not retiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves flatly rejected the idea of trading Anderson to another  
team, and the sides finally worked out their differences.

<HEADLINE> Court Blocks Cuba Victims' Reward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Relatives of three men shot down by Cuban jets over  
international waters can't claim more than $6.2 million owed to 
Cuba by U.S. telephone companies, a federal appeals court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling issued Wednesday by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals in Atlanta reversed U.S. District Judge James Lawrence 
King's decision, which prolonged the disruption of direct phone 
service between the United States and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	King ruled March 18 that President Clinton had no authority to  
waive a new anti-terrorism law allowing the families of three of 
four fliers killed on Feb. 24, 1996, to be paid using blocked Cuban 
assets held in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court ruled that Cuban telephone company Empresa de  
Telecommunicaciones de Cuba, S.A., also known as ETECSA, is not a 
legal stand-in for the Cuban government and can't be fined in lieu 
of the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Four members of the Miami-based group exile group Brothers to  
the Rescue were searching for Cuban refugees on rafts when Cuban 
MiGs shot down two planes in the Florida Straits that separate Cuba 
and the Florida Keys. 
</P>
<P>
	Three men -- Armando Alejandre, 45; and pilots Carlos Costa, 29,  
and Mario de la Pena Jr., 24 -- were U.S. citizens, making their 
families eligible to sue under U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, relatives won a $187 million judgment against  
Cuba and the Cuban Air Force. The families were unable to collect 
because of Clinton's waiver and State Department objections. 
</P>
<P>
	The $6.2 million King awarded to the families last spring was to  
have come from payments for long-distance calls from U.S. telephone 
companies to ETECSA. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest payment was to have come from AT&AMP;T, more than $4.1  
million. MCI International Inc. faced the second largest payment, 
about $1.05 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the Cuban telephone company stopped most direct  
service to the United States because U.S. phone companies had been 
withholding payments since December 1998, awaiting King's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. carriers then rerouted calls to Cuba, apparently  
through third countries or onto Sprint telephone lines, which were 
not affected.

<HEADLINE> Bucks Coach Doesn't Want GM Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Milwaukee Bucks coach George Karl says he does  
not want to take on the additional duties of general manager now 
that the team has decided not to renew Bob Weinhauer's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to do both jobs. I have never said I'd do both  
jobs,'' Karl said Wednesday after throwing out the first pitch at 
the Milwaukee Brewers game with the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl has taken added responsibility for roster and personnel  
decisions over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think right now we're looking to improve a little more.  
I think we're just trying to make this the best situation in 
basketball,'' Karl said. '' But I don't have time to do both 
jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karl said he wanted to work closely with Weinhauer's  
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, I want a good working relationship. I want an  
opportunity to have a say in what goes on. And we all battle 
together, fight together,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Karl's first season as coach, the Bucks returned to the  
playoffs for the first time since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl said Weinhauer also was responsible for the success because  
of deals he had made to acquire key players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Bob did a great job in helping us get back in the  
playoffs. And I wish him the best,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks recently lost Michael Curry and Dell Curry, free  
agents who signed with other clubs after playing key roles as 
reserves. Karl said their loss bothered him but he did not 
criticize what the team did to retain them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't deny that I'm disappointed,'' Karl said. ``I thought  
last year one thing we developed was our bench. And that now has 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I also think our organization did what they were supposed  
to do with the offers that were made. We did everything possible to 
get those players back.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Babbitt Won't Be Prosecuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt  
reportedly will not be prosecuted over allegations that campaign 
gifts influenced the agency's rejection of a proposed Indian casino 
in Wisconsin and that he lied about the matter to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent Counsel Carol Elder Bruce also has made a  
preliminary decision not to indict former Deputy White House Chief 
of Staff Harold Ickes Jr., The Sacramento Bee reported Wednesday, 
citing sources familiar with the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce spent 15 months investigating the Interior Department's  
rejection of a request by three Chippewa tribes to open a casino in 
Hudson, Wis. She was trying to determine whether Babbitt lied under 
oath before a Senate committee about the circumstances surrounding 
the casino decision, particularly whether it was influenced by 
promises of campaign contributions to the Democratic Party by other 
tribes opposed to the casino. 
</P>
<P>
	The rival tribes later gave the Democratic National Committee  
nearly $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt has denied any connection between campaign contributions  
and the casino decision. He also has denied intending to mislead 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime friend, Paul Eckstein, a lobbyist for the tribes  
seeking the casino, testified to the same Senate Governmental 
Affairs Committee that Babbitt -- during a meeting the day the 
casino decision was made -- alluded to Democratic campaign 
contributions and pressure from the White House to have the matter 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt has said Eckstein misunderstood the conversation.  
Babbitt was vacationing in Maine on Tuesday and could not be 
reached for comment by the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce also investigated other Clinton administration officials  
and key Democratic fund-raisers, the newspaper reported. She also 
explored the administration's decision involving at least one other 
tribal casino.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Tests Self-Serve Machines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Did somebody say kiosks? McDonald's is testing a  
machine that lets customers punch in their orders, pay with cash 
and wait at a table for their burgers and fries. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the Oak Brook-based company is trying out two machines  
in its Illinois laboratories and one in a children's ``Playplace'' 
at a McDonald's restaurant in Wyoming, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great for parents who have kids,'' says Lisa Howard, a  
McDonald's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Competitors have set up similar systems, with varying degrees of  
success. Burger King tried a text-based system (McDonald's is 
picture-based) 12 years ago in Boston but eventually dumped it 
because of wrong orders and slow service, said Kim Miller, a 
spokeswoman for the Miami-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers were somewhat receptive to it,'' Miller said, noting  
that the company wouldn't be opposed to trying again. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an Arby's franchisee in Golden, Colo., is trying out  
its own patented kiosks at five of its 62 restaurants. The machines 
do not allow automatic payment but instead are placed in threes and 
fours around a cashier. 
</P>
<P>
	The system has had its share of problems, says Mark Eagleton,  
senior manager of the franchise company -- everything from customers 
spilling sodas on the system's touch screens to grease from fryers 
gumming things up. That's made Arby's officials reluctant to use 
the kiosks nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eagleton says response from customers -- including  
Spanish-speakers who can order in their language -- has been worth 
the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike McDonald's machines, the Arby's system also allows  
customers to use credit and debit cards -- a factor that has caused 
them to spend an average of $4 more per order, Eagleton says. 
</P>
<P>
	``And some people, believe it or not, prefer computers because  
there isn't a rude employee standing across from them,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Jodi Hall, a customer at the McDonald's test site in Michigan,  
said she's one who often prefers the machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty cool. It's something different. And sometimes when  
I don't feel like talking, I can use it,'' the 14-year-old Wyoming, 
Mich., resident said Wednesday, while ordering an ice cream from 
what looks like an ATM with an oversized screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Her purchase was delayed slightly because she only had coins and  
had to borrow a dollar. The McDonald's machine only takes paper 
money up to $50 bills at this point. The customer's change arrives 
in a paper cup when employees bring the order to the specified 
table. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at McDonald's corporate headquarters say they plan to  
add a couple more machines in yet-to-be-determined restaurants in 
other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, they say they may develop similar machines for  
those who prefer to order at drive-thrus -- though those kiosks 
would have to be made of tougher, vandal-proof materials. 
</P>
<P>
	But Howard, the McDonald's spokeswoman, cautions that it's too  
early to tell if the idea will work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we serve the customer better with this new technology?  
Will it be accurate? How does it integrate with the operations 
behind the counter?'' she asks. ``Those are the kinds of questions 
we need to answer.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Calif. Poster Protest Man Gets Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- A shopkeeper who sparked weeks of  
demonstrations by hanging a picture of Ho Chi Minh in his store in 
Little Saigon has been sentenced to 90 days in jail for video 
piracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Truong Van Tran, 37, was found guilty on the felony charge  
Tuesday during a non-jury trial. He also was sentenced to three 
years probation and 80 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Police raided Tran's HiTek video shop in March, seizing about  
15,000 allegedly pirated videos, mostly of Asian soap operas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran had faced up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  
</P>
<P>
	His attorney, Ron Talmo, said Tran will appeal. He said Tran did  
nothing wrong by renting and copying the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran had said he put up the Ho Chi Minh display to encourage his  
Vietnamese neighbors to see their homeland in a new light. The 
displays attracted protests for 53 days, with crowds of up to 
10,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the neighborhood's 200,000 residents are former  
political prisoners or refugees who despise Vietnam's communist 
government.

<HEADLINE> Religion Linked to Good Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH (AP) -- Seniors who attend church or synagogue regularly  
might possess the secret of longevity. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report linking good health with religion, Duke  
University researchers say seniors with regular church or synagogue 
attendance are not only healthier but also more likely to live 
longer than the non-religious. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers, studying nearly 4,000 North Carolinians over 64  
years old, found that the death rate of the faithful was 28 percent 
less than those who didn't attend services regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies in recent years focusing on the spiritual dimension of  
health have yet to show that religious attendance or spirituality 
cause physical wholeness. But a mounting body of evidence 
associates the religious with better mental health, lower blood 
pressure and other health improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step, says the study's lead author, Dr. Harold Koenig,  
is to identify the behavioral and biological mechanisms linking 
religion to disease prevention and good health. 
</P>
<P>
	``These studies do not show that if they are going to church for  
health reasons, their health will improve,'' Koenig said. ``But if 
people go to church for religious reasons, they have better health 
and survive longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The findings released in the July-August medical sciences  
edition of the Journal of Gerontology examined 3,968 adults in five 
North Carolina counties from 1986-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers interviewed participants each year about church  
attendance, their health, social support and alcohol and tobacco 
use. The subjects, mostly Christians and Jews, were categorized 
according to whether they attended religious meetings once weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1992, 1,177 participants had died.  
</P>
<P>
	Analyses showed 46 percent fewer of the church attendees died  
during the period than nonchurchgoers. But the rate dropped to 28 
percent when the differing ages, health and social factors and 
smoking and alcohol use within the sample were taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
	The respective mortality risks are comparable to those  
experienced by smokers versus nonsmokers, Koenig said. The risk 
decline was 35 percent in women and 17 percent in men, according to 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health,  
is not the first to tie religious practice to a lower risk of 
dying. A California study of 5,300 people over 28 years generated 
similar findings, but the survey sample ranged from 21 to 65 years 
of age. And the sample's mortality was 15 percent, compared with 
about 30 percent for the Duke study. 
</P>
<P>
	The health benefits of church attendance may be related to the  
increased social support found in religious groups, Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other members are committed to you, praying for you,'' he  
said. ``You get sick and don't show up for church, and people call 
you and ask why you weren't there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Church attendance also may prompt the faithful to be more  
conscientious about taking medication. A deep religious faith, 
while not synonymous with attending church, also helps people cope 
with tragedy and may relieve stress, Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Kasl, an epidemiology professor at the Yale University  
medical school, called the Duke study ``an important contribution'' 
to firming up the church-good health association. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have many of these kind of studies,'' said Kasl.

<HEADLINE> Track Athlete Going for Jackpot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- A leading contender for a gold medal  
at the World Championships relied on his powers of persuasion to 
stay in the running for a Grand Prix track bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Barmasai, world record-holder in the 3,000-meter  
steeplechase, told speeding Kenyan compatriot Christopher Koskei to 
drop back just before the end of the race Wednesday in the 
Weltklasse meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said `Leave it for me' and that's why he slowed down,''  
Barmasai told stunned journalists shortly after clocking a winning 
time of 8 minutes, 5.16 seconds -- a fraction ahead of Koskei. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris could have won, but because he is my friend and we have  
to live together, he let me win,'' said Barmasai, who has posted 
the season's four best times in the steeplechase and is the only 
athlete to run under 8 minutes this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Barmasai is one of four athletes with a chance for the Golden  
League jackpot of $1 million awarded to any athlete unbeaten after 
the seven biggest Grand Prix meets. There are now just two meets 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	He indicated that -- if successful -- he would share the spoils  
with his friends -- presumably including Koskei. 
</P>
<P>
	In track, the use of runners who set a fast pace at the start  
and drop out later to help set up records is common. But Barmasai's 
confession of collusion at the end of the race was surprising. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie, the 5,000-meter world  
record-holder and winner his race Wednesday, said Barmasai had no 
need to cut deals with rivals or compatriots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barmasai is a top athlete. He has sprint and distance power,''  
Gebrselassie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark's Wilson Kipketer, another Golden League jackpot  
contender, stressed that running was an individual rather than team 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jackpot is important. But the main thing is to run the  
race,'' Kipketer said. ``You can't get paid until you do the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Kipketer said a dangerous bout of malaria following training  
last winter in his native Kenya gave him other values apart from 
money and glory. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I had malaria, I was fighting life and death,'' Kipketer  
said. ``I'm lucky to be running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Marion Jones kept up her claim to the Golden League  
jackpot by winning the 200 in 22.10 seconds, extending her unbeaten 
streak in the event to 21 races. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I felt the tailwind on the straight, I was flying home,''  
said Jones, the only woman to run under 22 seconds this summer. ``I 
hope I'll do as well in Seville. That's what I'm training for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unbeaten in the event since 1997, the 23-year-old American is a  
strong favorite heading into the World Championships in Seville, 
Spain, later this month. She has a chance for four world titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth Golden League jackpot contender is Romania's  
3,000-meter specialist Gabriela Szabo, who set a meet record of 
8:25.03. She said that her main priority was not the Seville 
championships or the Grand Prix payout, but next year's Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	In an intriguing men's 1,500, world record-holder Hicham El  
Guerrouj of Morocco bested a strong field that included Kenyan 
sensation Noah Ngeny and Olympic champion Noureddine Morceli. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj finished in 3:28.57 -- almost three seconds slower  
than his own world record. Ngeny finished second, while Morceli 
finished seventh, 3.62 back. 
</P>
<P>
	American Maurice Greene, who broke the world 100-meter record  
earlier this year, won the last major 100 before the World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting a slight headwind, Greene finished in 9.99 seconds to  
collect his fifth straight victory. Obadele Thompson of Barbados 
finished second, 0.03 seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his string of successes, Greene said he still had not  
accomplished a perfect race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, it will come out in a meet sometime,'' Greene said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he was unaffected by the withdrawal due to injury of his  
rival, friend and training partner, Ato Boldon of Trinidad, and the 
absence of Olympic champion Donovan Bailey of Canada. The American 
said he preferred to concentrate on his own performance rather than 
other racers.

<HEADLINE> For a Fit Brain, Drive With Mittens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Ever try driving with mittens on? Sniffing  
vanilla or peppermint first thing in the morning? Brushing your 
teeth or eating with the ``wrong'' hand? Choosing potatoes at the 
grocery with your eyes closed? 
</P>
<P>
	No, it's not a Dr. Seuss story. A Duke University scientist and  
a New York writer say the brain needs novelty and multisensory 
experiences to stay sharp. They propose those activities as part of 
their brain fitness regimen, which they call ``neurobics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Lawrence C. Katz and Manning Rubin lay it out in ``Keep Your  
Brain Alive,'' throwing in 83 exercises to get the brain's cerebral 
cortex and hippocampus off the couch and out the door. The book has 
gone into a fourth printing since it hit bookstores April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz and Rubin said daily life has the potential to be a  
``neurobic brain gym,'' satisfying their program's two daily 
prerequisites: Experience the unexpected and enlist all the senses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not about tricks, or about coming up with a few things  
that will help you remember a list of names, but how to live a life 
that is brain-healthy,'' said Katz, a Duke neurobiology professor 
who runs a brain research lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Some exercises are simple: taking a different way to work,  
switching seats at meals and shopping at a farmers' market. Others 
might make people wonder about your sanity: turning your desk 
calendar and clock upside down, wearing earplugs to breakfast, 
getting into your car and starting it with eyes closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Neurobics, a synthesis of recent brain research findings and  
Katz's own research at Duke, wakes up the brain's ``attentional 
circuits'' to start the flow of growth-promoting molecules called 
neurotrophins, according to their book. 
</P>
<P>
	Neurotrophins create new circuits that improve memory and  
creative and logical thinking. The brain produces neurotrophins 
when stimulated by novelty and experiences that engage the emotions 
and two or more senses, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doing daily activities in a slightly different way can have a  
very positive effect,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz, on the cusp of middle age at 42, said he and Rubin, who is  
close to 60, were inspired to write the book after watching Katz's 
young children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's remarkable how much more they rely on all their senses,''  
he said. ``They use touch and hearing, smell and taste to learn 
about the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adults tend to abstract things,'' Katz said. ``You look at  
something and figure you know everything you need to know. ... 
That's a kind of impoverished way of looking at the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neurobics can be practiced at the beginning and end of the day,  
while commuting, at work and during meals and leisure time. Katz 
said the book's 83 exercises are just a start. There is a Web site 
(www.keepyourbrainalive.com) where people can share other neurobic 
exercises they have discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	For people reaching advanced age, the exercises can reduce the  
inevitable decline in brain processing that occurs, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you age, you want to have a healthy body, and you want to  
have a brain that won't stop you from doing a lot of things,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallmarks of people who age well always have been a willingness  
to break routines and attempt the new -- the very same cornerstones 
of neurobics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They decide to hike the Appalachian Trail at 75, or take up a  
new hobby or language,'' said Katz. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're always living a life where they're taking on new  
mental challenges, or not falling into the routine of watching TV 
every day: woodworking or gardening, volunteering at Habitat for 
Humanity. It's non-routine and very good for the brain.''

<HEADLINE> Jamal Anderson To Meet With Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Jamal Anderson could return to the  
practice field today for the Atlanta Falcons. Then again, he might 
be requesting a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson and his agent, Jim Sims, were planning to hold their  
first face-to-face meeting with coach Dan Reeves and general 
manager Harold Richardson since training camp began July 29 at 
Furman University. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims portrayed the gathering as a chance to break the impasse  
that has kept the All-Pro running back out of camp -- or cause 
irreparable damage to the negotiating process. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said today he was confident a deal could be worked out.  
``I think a deal could be done today,'' he said in an interview 
with WHTA-FM in Atlanta. ``I'm trying to remain here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By this afternoon, he said, ``me and Dan will be dancing and  
smiling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If a deal can't be reached today, Sims said he would ask the  
Falcons to trade Anderson, who set a franchise rushing record with 
1,846 yards and an NFL mark with 410 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims first raised the trade possibility a couple of weeks ago  
when his client refused to report to training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I we don't get it done, I think from that point on we'll  
really have to push the trade option,'' the agent said. ``He's not 
retiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he did several weeks ago, Reeves flatly rejected the idea of  
dealing Anderson to another team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll meet with them and he won't get traded,'' the coach  
vowed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, dozens of reporters converged on the sleepy campus  
at the edge of the Appalachians, expecting a meeting between 
Anderson and the Falcons. The running back arrived in Atlanta on 
Monday morning, putting him within a 2 1/2-hour drive of Greenville. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sims, based in Oakland, Calif., said he had trouble getting  
a flight out of the Bay Area, so the meeting was pushed back 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves seemed perturbed by all the attention devoted to the star  
running back, who is refusing to play out the final year of his 
current contract for $2.6 million. Anderson wants a long-term deal 
that's in line with the NFL's other top runners. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just want more publicity and y'all are doing a great job  
of giving it to them,'' Reeves groused to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach, who has final say on contract matters, continued to  
draw a line in the sand at Anderson's demands. He said the running 
back should accept the Falcons' offer or live up to his contract 
and become a free agent at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anything being different just because we're  
meeting face to face ... instead of talking on the phone,'' Reeves 
said. ``We've stated our stance and that's not going to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did concede a willingness to shift some money to earlier  
years in the contract. While the two sides have basically agreed on 
a new five-year deal worth $28 million to $30 million, Anderson is 
seeking around $13 million in the first three years and the Falcons 
have offered $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Falcons have offered a $7 million signing bonus, while  
Anderson is seeking at least $7.5 million after initially asking 
for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	If a deal is reached today, Sims said his client could take part  
in practice this afternoon or Thursday morning. The Falcons play 
their first exhibition game Friday night against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves seemed somewhat heartened that Anderson was at least  
making the effort to be at training camp, even if didn't plan on 
being in uniform right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's better than nothing,'' Reeves said. ``We'll sit down  
and talk and see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sims sparked the first face-to-face talks by cutting short a  
European vacation and sending a new proposal to Richardson on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can't be a bigger commitment than going to training camp  
ready to go to work,'' Sims said. ``Hopefully, we'll get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, facing fines of $65,000 for skipping 13 workouts as of  
Tuesday, has been unwilling to take the field without a new 
contract since the Falcons can still retain his rights next season 
by designating him a franchise player. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in that situation, he would be assured of making at least  
the average salary of the top five players at his position. 
</P>
<P>
	While Anderson can't force the Falcons to trade him, Sims said  
it would be foolish to keep the player if negotiations reach a 
point where he no longer wants to play for the NFC champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only vindictive for a team not to go forward and try to  
entertain the trade option,'' Sims said, pointing out that the 
Falcons would be stuck with a $3.6 million salary cap cost whether 
Anderson plays or not. ``Then where we are going to be next year? 
Starting off at square one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Falcons went through another day of practice on a  
scorching 95-degree day, their thoughts far away from Anderson's 
contract impasse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think about Jamal until you asked me,'' linebacker  
Jessie Tuggle told a reporter. ``That's the truth. I want him out 
here as quick as possible, but I'll promise you I'm not losing any 
sleep over him.''

<P>
	Denver coach Mike Shanahan dispelled rumors of a developing  
quarterback controversy with one word: ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Bubby Brister's first pass was intercepted and he  
went 2-for-7 for 13 yards in the exhibition opener, Shanahan said 
Brister is the Broncos' first-string quarterback. Period. 
</P>
<P>
	While Brister's performance in Saturday's 20-17 victory over San  
Diego was disappointing, third-string quarterback Chris Miller 
played brilliantly. In his first game since concussions forced him 
out of the NFL in December 1995, the 10-year veteran was 11-of-13 
for 137 yards. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	Although the medical prognosis suggests otherwise, injured  
quarterback Ryan Leaf said he hopes to return to play by midseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, the second overall pick in the 1998 draft, was back at the  
Chargers' UC San Diego training camp for a second day as he 
recovers from the shoulder injury that was expected to sideline him 
for the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope because I'm younger and maybe will heal a little  
faster, maybe by Week 8 or Week 9,'' the 23-year-old Leaf said. 
``There's a possibility that I can be back out there and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, who lost his starting job last season because of  
disappointing play, rejoined the Chargers on Monday without wearing 
the sling that he had worn since he underwent surgery two weeks 
earlier.

was no word of progress in his stalled contract talks with the

	Agent Leigh Steinberg checked out of his hotel and did not  
immediately respond to a telephone message left at his California

	During a procedure at the Hospital for Special Surgery-Cornell  
Medical Center in New York City, the ligament and a piece of bone 
still attached to it were anchored back in place by Dr. Andrew

	Johnson, sidelined last season after a tumor was found in his  
chest, was expected back at training camp at the University at

<HEADLINE> Federated Earnings Rise 28 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Federated Department Stores Inc.'s earnings  
rose 28 percent in the second quarter as sales increased in 
virtually all merchandise categories nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for the quarter ended July 31 were $137 million, or 61  
cents per share, compared with $107 million and 47 cents in the 
same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were better than analysts had forecast. Shares of  
Federated rose $1.12 1/2 to $50.12 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 17 percent to $4.11 billion from $3.52 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best start to a year that any of us can  
remember,'' said James Zimmerman, Federated's chairman and chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the most critical earnings time for retailers is the  
Christmas sales period in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	During the quarter, two Lazarus stores -- in Glendale, near  
Indianapolis, and in the Century III mall in West Mifflin, Pa. -- 
were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati-based retailer operates more than 400 department  
stores in 33 states under the names Bloomingdale's, The Bon Marche, 
Burdines, Goldsmith's, Lazarus, Macy's, Rich's and Stern's. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailer also operates the Fingerhut Cos., an Internet  
retailer, Bloomingdale's by Mail, Macy's by Mail, and Macys.Com 
catalog and electronic commerce subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of this year, Federated earned $224 million,  
or $1.02 per share, up 33 percent from $167 million and 74 cents 
per share in the same period last year. Revenues rose 3 percent to 
$7.22 billion from $6.98 billion.

	U.S. midfielder Claudio Reyna scored with 14 minutes remaining  
Wednesday night as Glasgow Rangers beat visiting Parma 2-0 in the 
first leg of their European Champions Cup qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
	With Parma playing a man short following the ejection of star

<P>
	Many of Europe's bigger teams had byes in the first two rounds  
of qualifying. The 16 teams advancing from third and final round of 
qualifying will join Europe's top 16 teams from last season in the 
first round and be drawn into eight four-team groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiorentina, returning to the competition after 30 years, beat  
Poland's Widzew Lodz 3-1 on goals by Daniele Adani, Sandro Cois and

<HEADLINE> Miller Tries a Comeback With Broncos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- Anyone who wanted to know if Chris Miller  
could still play football just needed to watch the former all-pro 
quarterback last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with second and third-string players, Miller, 34,  
completed 11 of 13 passes for 136 yards Saturday and directed the 
Broncos to the tying and winning field goals over the San Diego 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have gone over everything and I am just getting familiar  
with the system,'' Miller said Wednesday at training camp. ``Once 
you know what you are doing and had enough reps, you can do less 
thinking and let things happen more naturally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller left the game in 1995 after a series of concussions, but  
joined the Broncos again because he knew he could play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically I felt great, my arm felt good and mentally I feel  
sharp,'' he said. ``That is the big reason why I came back. If I 
couldn't throw the ball like this I wouldn't have thought about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak concurred: ``There is nothing  
wrong with Chris Miller. ``The guy can play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before retiring, Miller had thrown for 18,793 yards and 121  
touchdowns in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	The only difference Miller has discovered between his former  
teams and the Broncos is the terminology. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to get used to it if you hadn't been familiar with  
the West Coast offense because there is a lot of memorization,'' 
Miller said. ``Some of our play calls are 15 to 16 words long and 
that takes some getting used to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller offers Shanahan the luxury of an experienced backup to  
Bubby Brister and Brian Griese as well as a veteran player who 
accepts his role. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the third-string quarterback. Bubby is the starter and  
Brian is No. 2,'' Miller said. ``The plan of Gary Kubiak is just to 
get me to where I am familiar with everything, where when I go in 
there I'm not hurting us, slowing things down and I am not making 
mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller suffered a minor setback when a sore elbow forced him out  
of workouts on Tuesday and Wednesday. Doctors ruled the injury 
insignificant enough to keep him in the game plan for Saturday's 
game with the Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``His elbow is sore. All it is tendinitis,'' Shanahan said. ``So  
we gave him a couple of days off. Hopefully, it will be back to 
normal.''

<HEADLINE> Lions Rep Visits Barry Sanders' Dad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSITY CENTER, Mich. (AP) -- A representative from the  
Detroit Lions is in Wichita, Kan., visiting with the father of 
recently retired running back Barry Sanders. But the elder Sanders 
today said his son wasn't a big topic of conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Hughes, director of security for the Lions, has been at  
William Sanders' home for two days. The Detroit News said today 
that Hughes is visiting apparently in hopes of setting up further 
talks between Sanders, his family and the team's front office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's the start of something good,'' Sanders' father  
told the News. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by the newspaper if any talks will be a drawn-out affair,  
the elder Sanders said: ``I hope with all my heart it's not 
time-consuming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But today, Sanders said Hughes just came down to spend some time  
with him. He said the two are friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``We discuss Barry once in a while,'' Sanders said. But he said  
he didn't think the Lions had sent Hughes specifically to discuss 
his son's football future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't discuss my son's future because I don't know what my  
son's intentions are,'' he said. He said he hasn't talked with his 
son since before Barry Sanders announced his retirement last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Lions spokesmen with knowledge of the Sanders situation were not  
immediately available for comment this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, who retired from the Detroit Police Department as an  
inspector, has headed the Lions' security department for four 
years. He is a former member of the Harlem Globetrotters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders announced his retirement July 28, the day before the  
team reported to training camp at Saginaw Valley State University. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Sanders said his desire to quit football outweighed  
his desire to play. When camp opened July 29, Sanders was in London 
on a European vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said it was believed he will return this week.  
Sanders has a home in Rochester Hills. He also spends considerable 
time at his parents' home in Wichita, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	His father earlier said Hughes was sent to Wichita by Lions vice  
chairman William Clay Ford Jr., son of owner William Clay Ford. The 
younger Ford talked to Sanders' father by telephone July 29 and 
told him he would do what he could to talk to Sanders and get him 
back in uniform with the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (Hughes) represents Bill Ford,'' William Sanders told  
the News. ``He (Ford) impressed me as being a fine gentleman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But today, Sanders downplayed the Lions' role in Hughes' visit.  
He said Hughes will stay ``as long as my wife will feed him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions have not made a significant move to replace Sanders.  
Only one back, Jerris McPhail, has been signed who was not on the 
roster at the time Sanders announced his retirement. McPhail was 
with the Lions last year but did not carry the ball or catch a 
pass. He was picked by the Browns in the expansion draft, but was 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Rivers, Sanders' backup the last four years, is No. 1 on the  
depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders has avoided all contact with the Lions' front office and  
coaching staff since the final game of the 1998 season. Coach Bobby 
Ross attempted to contact him through a total of 13 telephone calls 
or handwritten letters, but Sanders did not respond to any of them.

<HEADLINE> Dropouts May Have To Repay Grants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Education Department has proposed  
requiring college dropouts to repay federal grant money regardless 
of how much they spend before quitting school, an across-the-board 
plan that critics argue would hit poorest students hardest. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current federal rules, most students who drop out don't  
have to return federal need-based grants unless they leave on or 
before the first few days of classes. Financial aid officers take 
into account how much grant money the student received and the 
amount of expenses on books, parking stickers, supplies and the 
like. If students receive more grant money than their expenses 
justify, only then is repayment required. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal calls for one grant-repayment formula to cover  
every school and every student, based on how long the student stays 
on campus before withdrawing. The new rules are expected to take 
effect after the public-comment period ends Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every student would owe a repayment regardless of whether the  
financial aid received was enough to cover the expenses they 
incurred,'' said Linda B. Michalowski, director of federal 
relations for the California Community Colleges system. ``They no 
longer look at how much they (the students) got. It's just bam, you 
owe a percentage. And our students will pay the highest price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Community college students, unlike those who attend  
more-expensive state schools or private universities, rarely have 
loans and other money to supplement tuition, books, fees and 
housing, she said. Loans, unlike grants, always require repayment, 
regardless of student status. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Department, which based its proposal on a federal  
law enacted last year aiming to make sure federal grants are used 
wisely, maintains the new approach is fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aid is awarded to a student with the expectation that the  
student will complete the period of time for which the aid has been 
awarded,'' said Dan Madzelan, the Education Department's chief 
policy analyst for higher education. ``If the student doesn't 
complete the term, then there is a return that is required.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1.1 million Pell Grant recipients each can get a  
maximum $3,125 per year. The $6.3 billion program was responsible 
for 10 percent of federal student aid last year. College trade 
groups say colleges with nontraditional students, who may be older, 
working full-time or with lower incomes, report higher percentages 
of Pell Grant students dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Department says it doesn't know how many Pell  
Grant recipients nationwide drop out in an average year. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's proposed rule throws out the old individual  
repayment calculations that could be based on a college's tuition 
instead of the grant amount and instead requires the return of 
``unearned'' financial aid if a student drops out before completing 
60 percent of an academic term. Both college and student are 
responsible for what's left, and the law applies only to federal 
grant aid outlined in the Higher Education Act as it was renewed 
last year. Veterans' grants and other programs are not covered. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules account for student startup costs by drawing  
the repayment line at the 60 percent enrollment time, Madzelan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a student completes 60 percent of the enrollment, the  
assumption is that they've earned 100 percent of the aid,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule also would help the college, which must repay any  
grant money it receives from a student, Madzelan said. That's 
because, he said, they have more trouble filling the seat 
three-quarters of the way into a school term than on the first or 
second day. 
</P>
<P>
	Some college aid officers fear the enrollment-based formula  
could be cumbersome because not every student marches into a 
registrar's office to announce withdrawal as soon as he or she 
stops going to class, said Terry Hartle, senior vice president of 
the American Council on Education, a Washington-based college trade 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you give money to somebody for a purpose and they don't  
make use of the full service, you have no idea how to figure what 
was spent,'' he said. ``It's a difficult computation that is tilted 
against students and incomprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not exactly sure what will happen to students who don't  
have the money to repay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He doubts the new refund policy will force students to stay in  
school.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Gives Clemency to Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton offered on Wednesday to  
commute the sentences of 16 Puerto Rican independence activists if 
they sign agreements renouncing the use of violence. Most belonged 
to the FALN guerrilla group, which staged some 130 bomb attacks on 
political and military targets in the United States from 1974 to 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also conditioned the clemency offer on the  
independence advocates signing written statements agreeing to abide 
by all conditions of release set by law or the Parole Commission. 
Officials said none of those affected were involved in any deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokeswoman Chris Watney declined to explain  
Clinton's reasons for the decision. She did say the Justice 
Department, as is customary, submitted a report and recommendation 
to Clinton, but declined to describe it. 
</P>
<P>
	But administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity  
said Clinton's action was in response to a campaign by human rights 
advocates who have argued that members of the FALN -- the Spanish 
initials for Armed Forces of National Liberation -- were punished 
too harshly in light of their crimes. The commutations were 
recommended by Charles F.C. Ruff, the chief counsel who left his 
White House post last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the president did, based on the recommendation of  
counsel, was grant clemency to individuals on a case-by-case basis 
that recognized the serious nature of the crimes that they were 
convicted of but also took into account the excessive nature of the 
sentences that were imposed upon them 20 years ago,'' said one 
administration official. 
</P>
<P>
	``The persons here were not convicted in cases involving death  
or serious injury,'' the official said. They were convicted, in 
some cases, of armed robbery and supplying resources for FALN 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors branded those convicted for FALN activities as  
terrorists. But in recent months, Puerto Rican and U.S. church 
leaders, politicians and residents have sent 75,000 signatures to 
the White House to demand the prisoners' freedom. South Africa's 
retired Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu; Coretta Scott King, widow 
of the slain civil rights leader; and three members of Congress are 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came to light shortly after Puerto Rico's governor,  
Pedro Rossello, attended a White House ceremony for Presidential 
Medal of Freedom honorees, including Isolina Ferre, a Puerto Rican 
nun recognized for her work with the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossello, a proponent of Puerto Rican statehood and long an  
opponent of clemency for the prisoners, said that Clinton ``did 
this in the most prudent and just manner possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States after the  
Spanish-American War in 1898. It is a U.S. commonwealth that enjoys 
local autonomy but has no vote in Congress or for president. The 
FALN was committed to independence for the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven members of the group would be released immediately from  
prison if they agreed to Clinton's conditions; two others would 
have to serve additional prison time before release; and three 
would have the unpaid balance of their criminal fines canceled, 
according to a Justice Department announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the two who would have to serve additional time also  
would have the unpaid balance of his fine waived. Of the three 
whose only clemency offer was a reduction in fine, two already 
completed their prison sentences in 1994 and the third remains in 
prison with no reduction in his 15-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 original prison sentences for which Clinton offered  
reductions ranged from 35 years to 90 years. He offered to reduce 
them to a range of four years to 44 years. Watney could not 
immediately supply the amount of fines being waived. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombings attributed to the FALN killed six people and wounded  
dozens, but the 11 offered immediate clemency were not directly 
involved the deaths and injuries, officials said. The 13 didn't 
defend themselves at trial, saying they didn't recognize U.S. legal 
jurisdiction over them. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the prisoners were convicted in a $7.5 million armored  
truck robbery in West Hartford, Conn. The 1983 robbery was to 
finance the separatist group Los Macheteros, which has attacked 
U.S. government installations in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	There is precedent for pardons. In 1977 and 1979, President  
Carter pardoned four Puerto Rican nationalists who were convicted 
in a 1954 shooting attack on Congress that wounded five lawmakers. 
Carter also pardoned a fifth nationalist who was convicted of 
plotting to kill President Truman in 1950.

<HEADLINE> INS: Legal Immigration Rate Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recording the lowest level of legal  
immigration in a decade, the United States last year granted legal 
permanent residence to 660,477 foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	The green card figures for fiscal 1998, announced Wednesday by  
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, marked a 17 percent 
decrease from 1997 and a 28 percent drop from the year before that. 
</P>
<P>
	The decrease wasn't a reflection of reduced demand, however.  
Rather, it was a sign of the agency's continued difficulty in 
dealing with a rising backlog of applications. INS estimated it 
would have granted legal permanent residence to as many as 140,000 
additional people last year had it been able to keep pace with its 
caseload. 
</P>
<P>
	The backlog currently stands at 890,000 -- a sharp increase from  
the backlog of 121,000 applications in fiscal 1994. With the rising 
caseload, processing times have soared from an average of four 
months in 1994 to as much as three years now. 
</P>
<P>
	``The `S' in INS does stand for service. They may want to  
remember that occasionally,'' said Matt Tallmer, spokesman for the 
American Immigration Lawyers Association. ``Their backlog is just 
atrocious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the backlog owes to Congress' decision in the mid-1990s  
to allow illegal immigrants eligible for legal permanent residency 
to pay a fine and file their paperwork at INS offices within the 
United States. Before, they had to leave the country and apply at 
U.S. consulates abroad, which are operated by the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The since-ended program, known as 245(i), ``appears to be the  
chief reason for INS' inability to issue green cards expeditiously 
enough,'' said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for 
Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors reduced legal 
immigration rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress placed an enormous burden on the INS at the same time  
as citizenship applications increased dramatically,'' Krikorian 
added. ``Some people are going to point to this as another sign of 
the INS' dysfunction but in fact this is really a consequence of 
Congress' decision, not INS'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly three-quarters of the green cards granted last year went  
to relatives of U.S. citizens, as expected under a federal 
immigration policy that places highest priority on the 
reunification of families. Another 77,517 green cards were granted 
for business reasons, while refugees and asylees accounted for 
nearly 55,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
	One-fifth of the legal immigrants admitted last year came from  
Mexico. Immigrants from North America accounted for 38 percent of 
the total - one-fifth of which came from Mexico. Thirty-three 
percent of the total came from Asia and 14 percent came from 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	California, New York, Florida, Texas, New Jersey and Illinois  
were the top destinations for the new immigrants -- as has been the 
case since 1971, INS said.

<HEADLINE> Test May Improve Syndrome Detection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Researchers seeking a safer way to detect Down syndrome in a  
fetus say combining blood and ultrasound tests from the first and 
second trimesters would be more accurate than standard screenings 
and reduce the need for riskier testing. 
</P>
<P>
	The method would spare many women the need for a definitive test  
called amniocentesis, in which a needle withdraws fluid from the 
amniotic sac. That triggers miscarriage about 1 percent of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with the testing that is standard in the United States,  
the new system would prevent the miscarriages of about 1,400 
healthy fetuses each year and detect about 800 more fetuses with 
the chromosomal abnormality, said Dr. Nicholas Wald, the lead 
researcher. He said the new system would reduce by 80 percent the 
number of women for whom amniocentesis would be recommended. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got an improvement in detection, but the real gain is  
the reduction in the number of women who have to have an amnio,'' 
said Wald, chairman of the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine 
in London. 
</P>
<P>
	The screening also could reassure expectant parents their baby  
doesn't have Down syndrome, a condition in which an extra 
chromosome causes mental retardation and physical abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1 in 700 babies has Down syndrome, which is marked by a  
broad, flat face with slanting eyes -- and an early death. Older 
women have a higher risk of delivering a baby with Down syndrome -- 
for example, for a woman who is 40, the rate is 1 in 106. 
</P>
<P>
	Wald's research is reported in Thursday's edition of The New  
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``For women who don't want an invasive procedure, this offers  
them a very viable choice,'' said Dr. Anne Summers, director of the 
Maternal Serum Screening Program at North York General Hospital in 
Toronto, which will begin using the system soon. ``This has great 
potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wald and colleagues developed a complicated computer program  
that integrates results of tests in both trimesters. First, a woman 
is given an ultrasound and a blood test for a protein linked to 
Down syndrome, both done 10 to 14 weeks into the pregnancy. A month 
later, she has blood tests for abnormal levels of four substances 
associated with a high risk of Down syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	American women generally get only second-trimester screenings  
for three of those substances -- two hormones and a protein. 
</P>
<P>
	Wald's computer program can be set to allow only a 1 percent  
chance of a false positive result that would lead a doctor to 
suggest the invasive amniocentesis test. With that setting, the 
program correctly identified 85 percent of Down syndrome cases. 
Standard screening detects 46 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Summers' hospital plans to use Wald's system, she said  
more research is needed to confirm the accuracy of his research. 
That's because his calculations were done by piecing together data 
from three other studies, each involving different women receiving 
only some of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Another expert who agreed, Dr. Fergal Malone, director of  
perinatal research at New York Presbyterian Hospital, said Wald's 
system probably is accurate, ``but it should not lead to a change 
in clinical practice'' until another, larger trial is performed 
using all of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone and Wald are now running studies of the tests on tens of  
thousands of expectant mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial in the journal, Dr. Joshua Copel and Dr. Ray  
Bahado-Singh of Yale University argue that Wald's method won't gain 
wide acceptance because it requires withholding results of 
first-trimester tests until they are combined with the later data. 
Women might prefer an earlier warning so they could terminate the 
pregnancy safely, they said.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Outline Ag Advances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA FALLS, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore on Thursday will  
outline how new biotechnology targets by the Clinton administration 
that Gore claims could eventually boost farm income in Iowa by up 
to $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was scheduled to sign an executive order Thursday,  
according to aides speaking on the condition of anonymity, to 
establish as a national goal a tripling in the use of biomass 
products and technologies by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	Details on how the government would encourage that growth were  
unavailable. But Gore will argue that achieving the goal will cut 
sharply into greenhouse gas emissions in addition to bolstering 
farmers' income, according to aides. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is set to announce the goals at an Iowa campaign stop and  
tout the impact of them to farmers suffering from sagging commodity 
prices that threaten to drive thousands from the land. 
</P>
<P>
	The goals, aides said, recognize recent advances in farming and  
biological technologies allowing for a far more diverse use of 
trees and other crops for a variety of purposes. Those range from 
distilling of ethanol to blend with gasoline to make it burn 
cleaner to bio-based textiles and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	While backers of biomass technology say it's environmentally  
friendly and can cut greenhouse gases blamed for global warming, a 
study in May by the National Academy of Sciences on corn-based 
ethanol found ``little air-quality impact in terms of ozone 
reduction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plants used in biomass technology -- such as trees -- absorb  
carbons during their growth, and Gore contends that their use in 
energy and other applications can also cut into ozone-producing 
carbon emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the plants are largely deep-rooted varieties which  
are helpful in controlling erosion and filtering chemicals from 
groundwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Gore and his rival for the Democratic presidential  
nomination next year, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, are both 
campaigning in Iowa this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening the gate for the production of new and nontraditional  
commodities could hold out hope for farmers, and could provide the 
fodder for new research at places like Iowa State University on 
seeking even more new uses for biomass technology. 
</P>
<P>
	While not well known in many parts of the country, ethanol and  
biomass have been hot topics for years in Iowa, with nearly $600 
million in annual tax subsidies for ethanol helping prop up prices 
for corn in a state that is the largest grower of it.

<HEADLINE>  Sanders' Dad Hopes He Will Come Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Barry Sanders' father played down  
speculation that his son might return to the NFL but vowed to try 
to persuade him to come back. 
</P>
<P>
	William Sanders said Wednesday that the running back didn't even  
ask his advice when he retired from the Detroit Lions at age 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, 1,458 yards short of Walter Payton's career rushing  
record, walked away from the game on July 28, the day before the 
Lions began training camp at Saginaw Valley State University. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Sanders said his desire to quit football outweighed  
his desire to play. 
</P>
<P>
	William Sanders said he told his son not to retire three years  
ago when he was considering it. ``This time he didn't ask me, he 
just quit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Hughes, director of security for the Lions, has been  
staying at the elder Sanders' home in Wichita since Monday, 
generating speculation that the running back might be rethinking 
his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, a family friend, said Wednesday he came in response to a  
long-standing invitation -- and not at the urging of the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not down here to try to convince anyone,'' he told The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes said he told only one coach that he was coming so he  
wouldn't be considered absent without leave. He said he decided to 
take a few days off during training camp and planned to stay in 
Wichita another day or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here to relax and have a good time,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lions spokesman Bill Keenist said Hughes was visiting Sanders as  
a Lions official, but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Conspicuously absent was Barry Sanders, who was traveling in  
Europe. His father said he hasn't heard from him recently, and 
didn't even know exactly where he was now. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only time Barry called me often was when he was at  
Oklahoma State and he needed money,'' he said. ``He only calls me 
every once in a while now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Sanders said he expected to see his son when he comes  
back from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said his son called to tell him about his decision to  
retire only so that he heard it from him rather than the news 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was disenchanted with the direction the team was going. He  
was tired of losing,'' Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said he would do everything he could to get his son to  
come back to the team and had promised the Lions before Hughes' 
visit that he would try. 
</P>
<P>
	``It stung me a little bit, but it didn't disappoint me,'' he  
said of the retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions have not made a significant move to replace Sanders.  
Only one back, Jerris McPhail, was not on the roster at the time 
Sanders announced his retirement. McPhail was with the Lions last 
year but did not carry the ball or catch a pass. He was picked by 
the Browns in the expansion draft, but was cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Rivers, Sanders' backup the last four years, is No. 1 on the  
depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders has avoided all contact with the Lions' front office and  
coaching staff since the final game of the 1998 season. Coach Bobby 
Ross attempted to contact him through a total of 13 telephone calls 
or handwritten letters, but Sanders did not respond to any of them.

<HEADLINE> Spice Girls Founder Dies in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Bob Herbert, the man who formed the Spice Girls  
and who lately had managed the teen pop group Five, has been killed 
in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert, 57, was killed Monday when he lost control of his car  
in heavy rain and collided with another car in Windsor, west of 
London, according to RCA, Five's record company. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert's management of the Spice Girls capitalized on the trend  
of pop groups manufactured to target teen-aged record buyers. 
Earlier, Herbert created Bros, the brother act of Luke and Matt 
Goss. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert and his son, Chris, sought candidates for the Spice  
Girls through an ad in a trade magazine in 1996, seeking 
``streetwise, ambitious and dedicated'' young women. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 women answered the ad. The Herberts chose five for  
the band, initially called Touch, and then spent a year teaching 
them to sing and dance. 
</P>
<P>
	They later fired him in favor of another manager, and their  
number was reduced to four when Ginger Spice -- Geri Halliwell -- 
quit the group last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all shocked and saddened to hear the news,'' the Spice  
Girls said in a statement Tuesday. ``Our deepest sympathy goes out 
to his family. We know he will be sadly missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that without that little advert in 'The Stage' I  
wouldn't be where I am today,'' said Halliwell, who has come out 
with a solo album and is a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. 
Population Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will always remember him for the fact that he never gave up  
his dream of managing a great band, which he found in Five,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five was on a promotional trip in South America and was  
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the Spice Girls, we thought we could teach them enough to  
get by because we didn't consider talent to be the most important 
thing,'' Herbert was quoted as saying in a 1997 story in The 
Independent newspaper. ``This time we've got a band that's 
talented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert, who lived in Camberley, south of London, is survived by  
his wife, Ann, daughter Nicky, and son Chris, who is co-manager of 
Five. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were not announced.

<HEADLINE> Panel Will Probe Columbine Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Hoping to learn from the Columbine High School  
massacre, a state commission will review how authorities and school 
officials responded to the tragedy that left 15 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will recommend ways to prevent and prepare for similar  
events, and a report will be issued to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to learn as much as possible from Columbine to help  
prevent similar tragedies,'' Gov. Bill Owens said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which will be financed with a $68,800 federal grant,  
will be formed after Jefferson County sheriff's deputies complete 
their investigation into the shooting attack. Emergency response 
crews, law enforcement agencies and SWAT teams received some 
criticism after the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is not to criticize or blame but to learn lessons  
across the board,'' said Troy Eid, the governor's chief counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, he said, ``some law enforcement agencies were not  
able to communicate with other law enforcement or emergency 
responders because different radios are tuned to different 
frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the types of things the panel will look into is whether  
a new system that allows everyone to communicate on the same 
channel would have been helpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, to be composed of 12 experts on law enforcement,  
school safety and public education, will also review the emergency 
medical response and evacuation protocols and techniques used at 
Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens announced plans to create the commission as Jefferson  
County school officials paid tribute to Dave Sanders, the only 
teacher killed April 20 when seniors Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan 
Klebold opened fire and hurled bombs in the school. Twelve students 
were also killed and 23 others injured before the gunmen committed 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	As gunfire and explosions echoed through the cafeteria, Sanders  
raced through Columbine's hallways, herding students to safety. 
Shot twice in the chest, he bled to death in a classroom several 
hours later.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks made their broadest, sharpest gains of  
August as the Federal Reserve offered calming words Wednesday on 
the growth of the U.S. economy and Cisco Systems provided proof of 
strong corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 132.65 points, or by 1.2  
percent, to close at 10,787.80. The blue-chips gained momentum over 
the course of the session, breaking a recent pattern of starting 
strong only to sputter late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 rose 20.50 to 1,301.93, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 
74.87 to 2,564.98, its biggest point gain since June 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market was ripe for a minor rally following a  
slump that has left every major market index well below the lofty 
records reached in mid-July. But most Wall Street players said the 
advance was fragile. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a nervous market and will continue to be for a  
while,'' said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. 
in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Many believe the market will have trouble sustaining gains at  
least until Aug. 24, when Fed policy-makers hold their next meeting 
to set interest rates. Wednesday, the Fed offered some reassurance, 
saying its latest economic survey turned up little evidence of 
rising inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Fed survey, dubbed the ``beige book,'' did note  
developments that could lead to increased inflationary pressures, 
most notably widespread labor shortages and scattered reports of 
higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed, which raised rates slightly on June 30, has clearly  
signaled its willingness to raise short-term interest rates for a 
second time this year, hoping to prevent inflation from creeping 
into the robust U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of economic news for people to look at in  
advance of the next meeting,'' Berman said. ``Under different 
circumstances, the beige book might not attract a lot of attention, 
but investors are looking for guidance on what exactly the Fed 
plans to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Growing fears of a third rate hike this fall have hurt stocks  
and bonds alike. Plummeting bond prices in recent days have pushed 
up the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond closer to 6.25 percent, 
leaving long-term borrowing costs at the highest level in nearly 
two years. But bonds rallied after the Fed's report was released 
and on a strong auction response to the sale of 10-year Treasury 
notes, and yields slipped to 6.21 percent from 6.24 percent on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For some investors, rising bond yields have presented an  
attractive alternative to returns on volatile stocks. Other stock 
investors are unsettled that an uptrend in interest rates will cut 
into corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco sparked buying Wednesday, rising 4 3/16 to 62 15/16. Late  
Tuesday, after markets closed, the company reported fourth-quarter 
earnings that beat analysts' estimates, rounding out a fiscal year 
in which revenues grew 43 percent and operating profits improved 35 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online rose 7 3/8 to 92 3/8 after company executives held an  
upbeat conference call with analysts and major investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Kaltbaum, chief technical analyst at J.W. Genesis said the  
strength of those shares hinted at renewed leadership by 
well-established technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can't send them down in a bad market, they'll be likely  
to lead when things are looking up,'' Kaltbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	A wave of deals in the aluminum industry also moved the market.  
Early Wednesday, Alusuisse-Lonza (Algroup) of Switzerland, Pechiney 
of France and Alcan Aluminium of Canada said they would merge, 
passing U.S.-based Alcoa as the world leader in aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alcoa had a surprise of its own, going public with an offer  
to buy No. 3 Reynolds Metal Co. for $5.6 billion in cash and stock. 
Reynolds soared 9 3/8 to 65 1/4, and Alcoa, a Dow component, rose 2 15/16 
to 69 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Alcan rose 3 1/16 to 36 11/16 and Pechiney rose 2  
5/16 to 30 9/16, although Algroup shares slipped on the Zurich 
stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The market for new stocks was mixed. Shares of video rental  
chain Blockbuster were priced at 15 and ended the day at 15. But 
Red Hat, a seller of Linux software, saw its shares soar from an 
offering price of 14 to close at 52 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 938.91 
million shares, compared with 966.11 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 6.85 to 610.22, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 6.60 to 777.37. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.37 to 428.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.05 percent.  
Germany's DAX index rose 0.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained 
0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Spielberg Honored by Pentagon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who won five  
Academy Awards for his gritty ``Saving Private Ryan,'' collected 
the military's highest civilian honor Wednesday at a special 
Pentagon ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the gathering his goal in making the movie was to  
``remember unsparingly the sacrifices of my father's generation'' 
while trying to help his children's generation understand the 
importance of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that today's youth have a tendency to live in the  
present and work for the future but to be totally ignorant of the 
past,'' said Spielberg, who is 52. 
</P>
<P>
	His World War epic won 1999 Academy Awards for directing and  
four other categories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in the Army now,'' Spielberg joked as Defense Secretary  
William Cohen helped pin the Medal for Distinguished Public Service 
on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen called Spielberg's blockbuster, a graphic reenactment of  
the Allies' invasion of Europe on D-Day, June 6, 1944, an 
``emotional catharsis'' for all who saw it, particularly World War 
II veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	```Ryan,' I must be quick to point out, is not a recruitment  
promotional for the Pentagon,'' Cohen said. ``It speaks to us, 
however, about the importance of values, discipline, determination 
and sacrifice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Spielberg: ``I feel that in my experience as a filmmaker,  
lightning has only struck twice in a way that has filled me up with 
such pride. One of those times was 'Schindlers List' and the other 
time was 'Saving Private Ryan.''' Spielberg won an Academy Award 
for ``Schindler's List'' in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the ceremony that he was trying to pursue an ``active  
remembrance'' of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very easy, as we move into the next thousand years, to  
forget the last thousand. It's very easy to forget the last 10,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony, in a room near Cohen's office, was attended by  
Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, other 
military brass and invited guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen noted that Spielberg's father had served on B-25 bombers  
in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The award honored Spielberg for making ``a historic contribution  
to the national consciousness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other recent recipients of the award include former German  
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and former 
Sens. Bob Dole, R-Kan., and John Glenn, D-Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Rem Murray Re-Signs With Oilers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Rem Murray re-signed with the Edmonton  
Oilers on Wednesday, avoiding an arbitration hearing that was 
scheduled in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not announced.  
</P>
<P>
	Murray, 27, scored 21 goals and had 18 assists last season, his  
third in the NHL. In 221 career games, the left wing has 41 goals 
and 47 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always preferable to arrive at a mutually agreeable  
contract rather than go through arbitration,'' said Doug 
Risebrough, the Oilers' vice-president of hockey operations. ``This 
is a fair contract, and now we hope Rem will continue to improve.''

<HEADLINE> Jewish Center Security Tightened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Security was tightened at the Jewish Community  
Center in Denver as a precaution following the shootings at a 
similar center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	And across the country, the Union of American Hebrew  
Congregations advised its synagogues and Jewish schools to take 
similar steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We brought in an off-duty police officer,'' said Bernie  
Karshmer, associate director of the center in east Denver. ``We'll 
have him at the preschool, and we'll have off-duty police here for 
the next three days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver police also stepped up patrols of the area Tuesday  
afternoon and said the patrols will continue indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just decided to do that on our own,'' said Lt. Eric Rubin.  
``We're taking reasonable precautions at this point. We have no way 
of knowing if our center will be targeted or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles police believe a 37-year-old white man opened fire  
Tuesday morning at the North Valley Jewish Community Center, 
wounding three young children and two staff members. 
</P>
<P>
	Many parents called the Denver center to ask whether it was  
closing early Tuesday and asking about security. Karshmer said 
staff members reassured them, and added that activities at the 
center will continue as usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said it was unknown whether the suspect, Buford Oneal  
Furrow, targeted the center because the students were Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Simon Wiesenthal Center said a book was found in the van  
written by the American Nazi Party. And Furrow also reportedly has 
links to a group responsible for one of Denver's most notorious 
hate crimes, the June 1984 murder of Alan Berg, a Jewish talk-radio 
host. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spokesman-Review of Spokane, Wash., said Furrow had a  
relationship with Debbie Mathews, widow of Robert J. Mathews, 
founder of the hate group called the Order that was implicated in 
the Berg shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathews was killed in 1984 when his hideout caught fire during a  
shootout with federal agents on Whidbey Island in Washington state.

<HEADLINE> Southwest Airlines CEO Has Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Herb Kelleher, the flamboyant, chain-smoking  
leader of low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines, has prostate cancer, 
the company disclosed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher, 68, the co-founder and longtime chief executive and  
chairman, will begin eight weeks of radiation treatment today at 
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher joked his way through a half-hour conference call with  
reporters, downplaying his ``mundane, routine'' case of prostate 
cancer and saying the illness would not interfere with his ability 
to run the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Some stockholders have complained about Kelleher's smoking and  
questioned whether the company has an adequate succession plan for 
the man who helped found the airline in 1971. Kelleher dismissed 
the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't intend to make any changes in my lifestyle, and  
certainly there will be no changes in the business of Southwest 
Airlines as a consequence,'' he said, adding that the only impact 
will be a curtailed travel schedule while he commutes to Houston 
each weekday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also dismissed the succession worries. ``There is no need to  
update any succession plan because our board discusses that issue 
on a regular basis,'' said Kelleher, whose contract runs through 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancer was discovered at an early stage during a routine  
annual prostate examination, and is in a mild stage of development, 
said Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach, director of the prostate cancer 
program at M.D. Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Kelleher is expected ``to lead a fully active and  
productive life just as if he had never had prostate cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher co-founded Southwest Airlines in 1971. He was named  
chairman in 1978 and assumed titles of president and CEO in 1981. 
His flamboyant leadership and high-flying spirit have been 
considered the keys to Southwest's success. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's disclosure comes just months after a shareholder  
raised concerns about Kelleher's longevity, complaining about his 
penchant for cigarettes, Wild Turkey liquor and frequently flying 
aboard an airline that routinely offers fat- and salt-laden 
peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal put forward by the shareholder would have made  
Kelleher, who is also president, choose between running either the 
board or day-to-day operations. The proposal never made it for a 
vote at the company's annual meeting in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher has always had a tongue-in-cheek style that has created  
a casual corporate culture at an airline known for high customer 
satisfaction. Fortune magazine named it the country's most admired 
airline, and this year, the best place to work in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas-based Southwest is the nation's fourth-largest carrier in  
terms of customer boardings and the seventh-largest in terms of 
revenue. It operates more than 2,450 flights a day and has more 
than 28,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, its stock dipped 37 1/2 cents to $16.12 1/2 a share in  
early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer found  
in American men, after skin cancer. The American Cancer Society 
estimates that there will be about 179,300 new cases of prostate 
cancer in the United States this year, and about 37,000 men will 
die of this disease.

<HEADLINE> Boldon Pulls Out of Zurich Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- World 200-meter champion Ato Boldon  
pulled out of Wednesday night's Golden League track meet because of 
a lingering hamstring injury and ruled himself out of the World 
Championships later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon, who has not run an individual race since straining his  
hamstring during warmups at the Golden League meet in Paris on July 
21, said his injury appeared worse than first thought and was not 
recovering as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon made a tentative return to competition last Saturday,  
running in the 400-meter relay at Cyrstal Palace in London. He was 
scheduled to run in the 100 and 200 at the Weltklasse Golden League 
meet in Zurich but pulled out hours before the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not be going to Seville,'' where the World  
Championships begin Aug. 21, Boldon said. ``I made the decision 
and, though I'm not happy about it, it wouldn't be smart to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon is the training partner of American sprinter Maurice  
Greene, who set a world record of 9.79 seconds in the 100 meters in 
Athens on June 16. Boldon has twice run 9.86 in the 100 this season 
and has posted the fastest time (19.86) in the 200 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe anyone has a chance to beat Maurice in  
Seville,'' Boldon said. ``What bothers me most is that I felt 
Maurice and I could provide something special there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ``I don't want to be stupid. I don't want to get there and  
say, 'well, maybe the 200.'''

<HEADLINE> McGwire Sits Out With Back Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mark McGwire, the major league leader with  
44 homers, missed Wednesday night's game against the Phillies due 
to tightness in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire left the game Tuesday night in the second inning after  
walking in his only plate appearance. He said he felt tightness in 
his lower back and came out as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who put on two sensational batting practice shows  
before the first two games of the series, did not take BP 
Wednesday. He was not in uniform at game time and was doubtful to 
be available to pinch hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals are off Thursday, and trainer Barry Weinberg said  
McGwire likely will return to the lineup Friday against the Chicago 
Cubs and Sammy Sosa at Busch Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has battled back problems since 1989 and missed three  
games last month due to back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I'll have to deal with the rest of my life,''  
McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't homered in 13 at-bats since hitting his 500th and  
501st last Thursday against San Diego. He was 1-for-10 with no 
extra-base hits in a four-game series at Pittsburgh over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's longest homerless drought this season was 41 at-bats,  
between his fifth and sixth homers of the season. He has gone 15 
at-bats without a homer only five times this season.

<HEADLINE> Sears Drops `Orchard' Name Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Sears Roebuck &AMP; Co. has decided against  
converting its 250 hardware stores nationwide to Orchard Hardware &AMP; 
Garden outlets after a test run in Ohio flopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers of Sears' 10 Columbus-area hardware stores preferred  
the Sears name and product line, company spokesman Chuck Merydith 
said Tuesday. The name was changed two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus was Sears' only test market for the concept, which  
downplayed Sears' trademark tools and appliances in favor of 
Orchard's broader line of home-and-garden products. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives hoped the Orchard format would bring more female  
shoppers through the doors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Merydith said that didn't happen.  
</P>
<P>
	``In our research, we asked customers where they liked to shop  
and they said Sears Hardware, and they preferred it not only to 
Orchard but also to the competition,'' he said. ``They told us that 
they wanted Sears Hardware back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sears replaced the Orchard signs last weekend and plans to hold  
a grand reopening for its stores Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears bought Orchard in 1996, attracted by the California  
chain's broad selection of housewares, nursery supplies and 
hardware. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears renamed its Columbus stores after Orchard and changed the  
stores' merchandise mix a year later, spending an estimated $10 
million on the overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	To accommodate the added merchandise in the same  
20,000-square-foot stores, the company eliminated its line of large 
stationary power tools, most of them bearing Sears' Craftsman 
trademark.

	1 Dead, 100 Injured in Utah Tornado  
</P>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The tornado that ripped through downtown  
Salt Lake City this afternoon killed an exhibitor at an outdoor 
retailers convention that was being set up at the Salt Palace 
Convention Center. Allen Crandy, 38, of Las Vegas, was killed when 
he was struck in the head with flying debris, authorities said. 
Crandy worked for Renaissance Management. A spokeswoman for the 
Utah Comprehensive Emergency Management, said 50 people were 
hospitalized, 12 with moderate injuries and two in critical 
condition. Between 100 and 150 more treated for minor injuries at 
the scene.

postal worker. Furrow was also charged with illegal possession of a 
firearm in the slaying of Joseph Ileto, 39, who was killed when he 
returned to his mail truck about an hour after the center shootings 
yesterday. Furrow turned himself in to the FBI in Las Vegas, saying 
he wanted his attack to be ``a wake-up call to American to kill 
Jews.''

said he wanted to show support for Gov. Pedro Rossello, who is 
urging the Navy to leave the training ground on the outlying island 
of Vieques after recent accidents at a bombing range there. Jackson 
was to meet Rossello tomorrow and then visit the bombing range, 
where protesters have set up camp amid unexploded ordnance to 
thwart further exercises.

	Better Down Syndrome Testing Found  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Researchers seeking a safer way to detect Down  
syndrome in a fetus say combining blood and ultrasound tests from 
the first and second trimesters would be more accurate than 
standard screenings and reduce the need for riskier testing. The 
method would spare many women the need for a definitive test called 
amniocentesis, in which a needle withdraws fluid from the amniotic 
sac. That triggers miscarriage about 1 percent of the time. 
Compared with the testing that is standard in the United States, 
the new system would prevent the miscarriages of about 1,400 
healthy fetuses each year and detect about 800 more fetuses with 
the chromosomal abnormality, said Dr. Nicholas Wald, the lead 
researcher.

	PHOENIX (AP) -- Mirroring successful claims made by numerous  
states, the nation's largest Indian tribe sued the tobacco industry 
today to recover the cost of caring for sick smokers. The complaint 
filed in Navajo court alleges tobacco companies deceived Navajo 
Nation consumers, illegally targeted minors and burdened their 
healthcare system. The claim seeks unspecified damages from eight 
tobacco companies, including Phillip Morris and R.J. Reynolds. 
Twice as many American Indians smoke in comparison to other groups, 
according to the surgeon general. The figures are worse for the 
Navajo.

	Fed Says Economy Growing Strongly  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy is growing strongly with even the  
beleaguered manufacturing sector showing signs of a rebound, the 
Federal Reserve said today in a new survey of business conditions 
around the nation. While nearly every region of the country faced 
labor shortages, the Fed said wage pressures did not seem to be 
accelerating or causing widespread pressures on inflation. 
Financial markets took heart from the Fed's lack of alarm about 
inflation. But private economists said the Fed report did not 
change their view the central bank is getting ready to raise 
interest rates for a second time this year when policy-makers meet 
Aug. 24.

<HEADLINE> Jamal Anderson To Meet With Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Jamal Anderson could return to the  
practice field today for the Atlanta Falcons. Then again, he might 
be requesting a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson and his agent, Jim Sims, were planning to hold their  
first face-to-face meeting with coach Dan Reeves and general 
manager Harold Richardson since training camp began July 29 at 
Furman University. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims portrayed the gathering as a chance to break the impasse  
that has kept the All-Pro running back out of camp -- or cause 
irreparable damage to the negotiating process. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said today he was confident a deal could be worked out.  
``I think a deal could be done today,'' he said in an interview 
with WHTA-FM in Atlanta. ``I'm trying to remain here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By this afternoon, he said, ``me and Dan will be dancing and  
smiling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If a deal can't be reached today, Sims said he would ask the  
Falcons to trade Anderson, who set a franchise rushing record with 
1,846 yards and an NFL mark with 410 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims first raised the trade possibility a couple of weeks ago  
when his client refused to report to training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I we don't get it done, I think from that point on we'll  
really have to push the trade option,'' the agent said. ``He's not 
retiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he did several weeks ago, Reeves flatly rejected the idea of  
dealing Anderson to another team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll meet with them and he won't get traded,'' the coach  
vowed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, dozens of reporters converged on the sleepy campus  
at the edge of the Appalachians, expecting a meeting between 
Anderson and the Falcons. The running back arrived in Atlanta on 
Monday morning, putting him within a 2 1/2-hour drive of Greenville. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sims, based in Oakland, Calif., said he had trouble getting  
a flight out of the Bay Area, so the meeting was pushed back 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves seemed perturbed by all the attention devoted to the star  
running back, who is refusing to play out the final year of his 
current contract for $2.6 million. Anderson wants a long-term deal 
that's in line with the NFL's other top runners. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just want more publicity and y'all are doing a great job  
of giving it to them,'' Reeves groused to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach, who has final say on contract matters, continued to  
draw a line in the sand at Anderson's demands. He said the running 
back should accept the Falcons' offer or live up to his contract 
and become a free agent at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anything being different just because we're  
meeting face to face ... instead of talking on the phone,'' Reeves 
said. ``We've stated our stance and that's not going to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did concede a willingness to shift some money to earlier  
years in the contract. While the two sides have basically agreed on 
a new five-year deal worth $28 million to $30 million, Anderson is 
seeking around $13 million in the first three years and the Falcons 
have offered $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Falcons have offered a $7 million signing bonus, while  
Anderson is seeking at least $7.5 million after initially asking 
for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	If a deal is reached today, Sims said his client could take part  
in practice this afternoon or Thursday morning. The Falcons play 
their first exhibition game Friday night against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves seemed somewhat heartened that Anderson was at least  
making the effort to be at training camp, even if didn't plan on 
being in uniform right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's better than nothing,'' Reeves said. ``We'll sit down  
and talk and see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sims sparked the first face-to-face talks by cutting short a  
European vacation and sending a new proposal to Richardson on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can't be a bigger commitment than going to training camp  
ready to go to work,'' Sims said. ``Hopefully, we'll get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, facing fines of $65,000 for skipping 13 workouts as of  
Tuesday, has been unwilling to take the field without a new 
contract since the Falcons can still retain his rights next season 
by designating him a franchise player. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in that situation, he would be assured of making at least  
the average salary of the top five players at his position. 
</P>
<P>
	While Anderson can't force the Falcons to trade him, Sims said  
it would be foolish to keep the player if negotiations reach a 
point where he no longer wants to play for the NFC champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only vindictive for a team not to go forward and try to  
entertain the trade option,'' Sims said, pointing out that the 
Falcons would be stuck with a $3.6 million salary cap cost whether 
Anderson plays or not. ``Then where we are going to be next year? 
Starting off at square one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Falcons went through another day of practice on a  
scorching 95-degree day, their thoughts far away from Anderson's 
contract impasse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think about Jamal until you asked me,'' linebacker  
Jessie Tuggle told a reporter. ``That's the truth. I want him out 
here as quick as possible, but I'll promise you I'm not losing any 
sleep over him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
                             *Broncos    	
</P>
<P>
	Denver coach Mike Shanahan dispelled rumors of a developing  
quarterback controversy with one word: ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Bubby Brister's first pass was intercepted and he  
went 2-for-7 for 13 yards in the exhibition opener, Shanahan said 
Brister is the Broncos' first-string quarterback. Period. 
</P>
<P>
	While Brister's performance in Saturday's 20-17 victory over San  
Diego was disappointing, third-string quarterback Chris Miller 
played brilliantly. In his first game since concussions forced him 
out of the NFL in December 1995, the 10-year veteran was 11-of-13 
for 137 yards. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Chargers    	
</P>
<P>
	Although the medical prognosis suggests otherwise, injured  
quarterback Ryan Leaf said he hopes to return to play by midseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, the second overall pick in the 1998 draft, was back at the  
Chargers' UC San Diego training camp for a second day as he 
recovers from the shoulder injury that was expected to sideline him 
for the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope because I'm younger and maybe will heal a little  
faster, maybe by Week 8 or Week 9,'' the 23-year-old Leaf said. 
``There's a possibility that I can be back out there and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, who lost his starting job last season because of  
disappointing play, rejoined the Chargers on Monday without wearing 
the sling that he had worn since he underwent surgery two weeks 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Colts    	
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis practiced again without their top draft pick.  
</P>
<P>
	Running back Edgerrin James has already missed more than two  
weeks of camp and Saturday's exhibition game at Chicago, and there 
was no word of progress in his stalled contract talks with the 
Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Leigh Steinberg checked out of his hotel and did not  
immediately respond to a telephone message left at his California 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Club president Bill Polian said Monday he had no intention of  
calling Steinberg and did not respond Tuesday to phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	Running back LeShon Johnson's comeback from cancer was put on  
hold when he had surgery to reattach a torn ligament in his right 
thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	During a procedure at the Hospital for Special Surgery-Cornell  
Medical Center in New York City, the ligament and a piece of bone 
still attached to it were anchored back in place by Dr. Andrew 
Weiland, a hand specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, sidelined last season after a tumor was found in his  
chest, was expected back at training camp at the University at 
Albany by Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants coach Jim Fassel said Johnson might return to practice  
next week. He will miss the team's exhibition opener at Minnesota 
on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
                            *Cardinals    	
</P>
<P>
	Chris Dishman's injured right elbow and neck injuries to Aeneas  
Williams and Zack Walz were the biggest concerns among a long list 
of players who were hurting at training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Dishman, the starting left guard, might undergo arthroscopic  
surgery to remove bone fragments from the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a Pro Bowl starter at cornerback the last four  
seasons, has soreness in his neck, a condition that also bothered 
him last year.

<HEADLINE>  Solar Eclipse Sweeps Across Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMNICU VALCEA, Romania (AP) -- The moon smothered the light of  
the sun today as the last total solar eclipse of the millennium 
swept across Europe toward the Bay of Bengal. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands crammed the streets of Ramnicu Valcea, the  
south-central city in Romania where the spectacle could be seen the 
longest -- 2 minutes and 23 seconds. Hundreds more made the trek to 
a half-dried up salt lake just outside the city, munching on 
barbecued prawns and steak as they prepared for an unimpeded view 
of the eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a bit scared,'' said Silvia Popa, a 44-year-old  
accountant, reflecting age-old Balkan superstitions connected with 
the sun's disappearance. ``They say after an eclipse, there is 
either a storm or a cataclysm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was neither, as the moon ate its way into the sun, slowly  
obscuring it. But temperatures in the high 80s dropped noticeably 
as the clear skies grew darker. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharing the view with her and other Romanians at the lake were  
hundreds of tourists from Germany, Japan, Britain and other 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ramnicu Valcea, a city of 100,000 dominated by gray prefab  
concrete buildings, traffic was light, with most people opting for 
a view from sidewalks and rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
	As the eclipse approached totality a loud cheer went up from the  
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rome, Pope John Paul II cut short his weekly audience with  
pilgrims, saying: ``I know that some of you are in a hurry to see 
the eclipse of the sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Sarajevo, streets were deserted in a scene reminiscent of the  
worst days of the Bosnian war. With special viewing glasses 
unavailable, most people stayed indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Middle East, Muslims shuttered themselves inside on the  
orders of clerics. Others flocked to mosques as earthquakes and an 
out of season hailstorm intensified eclipse unease. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eiffel Tower was packed with thousands of people on its base  
and hundreds more on the monument itself. As Paris reached its 
darkest stage, street lights came on and the tower was lit. 
Elsewhere in the city of high fashion, some were spotted wearing 
upscale designer viewing glasses. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cornwall, at the southwest tip of England and the eclipse's  
landfall, heavy clouds made the two-minute spectacle invisible to 
hundreds of thousands who had come to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our first eclipse and we are kind of disappointed not  
to be seeing anything,'' said Carolyn Willard, from Kent, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	The eclipse reached totality in western England at 11:10 a.m.  
(6:10 a.m. EDT). 
</P>
<P>
	Darkness fell on London, where the eclipse was 96.5 percent of  
totality. Trials were adjourned briefly at the Old Bailey criminal 
court to allow jurors and lawyers -- but not defendants -- to go out 
to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people poured into Stuttgart, Germany, despite  
rainy weather. People crowded rest stops on the A8, the so-called 
``Eclipse Autobahn,'' because it follows the path of the eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
	A 24-year-old student who climbed a 16-foot utility pole in  
Landau, near the French border in southern Germany, to get a prime 
eclipse viewing position accidentally touched the electrical line 
and received a 20,000-volt shock. He was hospitalized with serious 
burns. 
</P>
<P>
	For some it was a scientific wonder; for others, a spiritual  
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hundred people boarded a Concorde flight at Heathrow, making  
a supersonic chase of the shadow from a cloud-free 55,000-foot 
height. 
</P>
<P>
	In some villages in northern Gujarat in India, priests planned  
to ring temple bells and take turns beating steel plates with 
sticks to ward off evil. 
</P>
<P>
	From Land's End, the moon's shadow dashed at 1,522 mph across  
parts of France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Yugoslavia, Hungary, 
Romania, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, turning day to night across 
a path 60 miles wide, before sinking at sunset in the Bay of 
Bengal. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists gathered at remote sites in Turkey, Iran and Iraq,  
seeking to learn more about the corona, the superheated gaseous 
layer that surrounds the sun. Seldom visible, it appears as a 
radiant halo at the time of totality, when the moon completely 
covers the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	With the sun at the height of its 11-year cycle of activity,  
this is a good chance to investigate why the corona sizzles at 3.6 
million degrees, despite the bitter cold of space. The temperature 
at the surface of the sun is only about 11,000 degrees, while the 
sun's core is estimated at 27 million degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists also hope to learn more about giant gas explosions  
that erupt on the sun's surface, causing magnetic storms that can 
interfere with radio, TV and telephone signals on earth and disrupt 
satellite communications. 
</P>
<P>
	And because eclipses are the nearest nature comes to turning off  
the sun, they also provide a chance to study the earth's 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	A solar eclipse occurs when the moon crosses between the Earth  
and sun, blocking the sun's light. The moon is only one-400th the 
size of the sun, but the sun is 390 times farther away from the 
Earth, making the moon's image almost exactly the same size as the 
sun's when viewed from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there are at least two solar eclipses a year, most are  
partial. The next total solar eclipse will be in 2001 over southern 
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rebuffs Starr Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former defendant in one of Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr's prosecutions lost a legal battle to have 
the government pay her attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton rejected the arguments of  
Julie Hiatt Steele that Starr's case was ``vexatious, frivolous and 
in bad faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an Aug. 3 ruling, Hilton said the government won't have to  
pay costs and attorneys fees for Ms. Steele because ``the evidence 
was sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to find the defendant 
guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury on May 7 deadlocked 9-3 in favor of convicting  
Ms. Steele on charges that she obstructed Starr's investigation of 
allegations by Kathleen Willey that President Clinton made an 
unwanted sexual advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr decided not to retry Ms. Steele, who denied Mrs. Willey's  
assertion that she confided the alleged advance to her friend hours 
after it happened.

	Rumblings about Ryder Cup compensation can finally fade from  
view when the PGA Championship, the final major of the 20th 
century, begins Thursday at Medinah Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, the strongest field of the year will be paid to play -- a  
record $3.5 million purse with $630,000 for the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	But David Duval would pay to be holding the Wanamaker Trophy on  
Sunday afternoon. So would Phil Mickelson, Colin Montgomerie or any 
other player who has yet to win his first major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players are going to be willing to play in these tournaments  
because of what history the event brings, what the trophy brings to 
the player -- and I'm not talking financial,'' Mickelson said 
Wednesday. ``There's no price tag you can put on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No need to tell that to Duval, who has done everything but win a  
major this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He won four times in his first eight tournaments. He already has  
earned more than $3 million. He has twice risen to No. 1 in the 
world ranking. And he has been making headlines -- too bad they have 
come from his complaints of Ryder Cup revenue and not his play in 
the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you could rate my performance much above  
mediocre,'' Duval said. ``All in all, it's probably been not quite 
what I would have hoped for. But I have another good opportunity 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He certainly is at the right major for that.  
</P>
<P>
	Ten of the last 11 champions won their first major in the PGA  
Championship, starting with Jeff Sluman in 1988 through Vijay Singh 
last year at Sahalee. The lone exception was Nick Price, who won 
his third major and second PGA at Southern Hills in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	No one is quite sure what to expect of Medinah.  
</P>
<P>
	At 7,401 yards, it is the longest course at sea level in the  
history of major championships, and yet only one of the par 4s 
measures longer than 452 yards. And while Medinah has been the site 
of three U.S. Opens, it has never held a major this late in the 
summer, and it shows. Record heat has burned brown patches into 
some of the greens, affecting not only the look but the speed. 
</P>
<P>
	A greater mystery may be Tiger Woods, whose game has improved  
dramatically since his record-breaking Masters victory in 1997, but 
who hasn't won a major since then. 
</P>
<P>
	That could change this week. Since returning from this year's  
post-Masters break, Woods has won three of six tournaments, and has 
finished no worse than seventh in the other three. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eventually, either someone else is going to make a mistake and  
I'm going to sneak into a victory, or I'm going to outplay 
somebody,'' Woods said. ``You can't win every time you're in the 
hunt. The key is to keep giving yourself chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That holds true for those who haven't yet won a major. Singh was  
one of those players last year until he held off Steve Stricker in 
the final round at Sahalee. Singh will try to become the first 
player since Denny Shute in 1937 to successfully defend his PGA 
title, and the first player since the PGA switched to stroke play 
in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are only four majors out there, and they're the hardest  
golf tournaments to win,'' Singh said. ``And you may not be able to 
play to the best of your ability that particular week. You may play 
the best golf that week, but somebody else may beat you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie has tasted that. Among his close calls in the majors  
is the 1995 PGA at Riviera, where he birdied the last three holes 
to get into a playoff, only to lose on the first extra hole when 
Steve Elkington made a 20-foot birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie can't complain about his form. For the third  
straight major, he arrives full of confidence from a win in Europe. 
Now if he can only keep it going through four rounds of a major. 
The last European-born player to win the PGA was Tommy Armour in 
1930. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I win a major, it happens,'' Montgomerie said. ``If I  
don't, I won't lose any sleep over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the attitude from Mickelson, playing in only his  
second tournament since the U.S. Open because of the birth of his 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	As a 20-year-old, Mickelson tied for 29th in the 1990 U.S. Open  
at Medinah. He won on the PGA Tour as an amateur the next year, and 
has won 12 times since turning pro in 1992. But this is his 30th 
major, and he's still looking to be part of history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just disappointed in myself for being out here seven,  
eight years and not having won one,'' Mickelson said. ``I certainly 
had higher expectations than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So did Duval, who also played the '90 U.S. Open and acquitted  
himself well for an 18-year-old. He was 3-under on Sunday, just 
five strokes out of the lead until he blew up on the back nine and 
tied for 56th. 
</P>
<P>
	When he wasn't defending his position on Ryder Cup money, Duval  
was trying to recover some of the memories of Medinah. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have some great history and great memories here,'' he said.  
``It's pretty neat to come back now and play a major on a course 
that I played my first major on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be even sweeter to finally win one.

<HEADLINE> PGA Major Overshadowed by Ryder Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- It figured that Medinah Country Club would  
help decide the U.S. Ryder Cup team. What no one could figure was a 
Ryder Cup controversy overshadowing the start of the season's final 
major. 
</P>
<P>
	Long the stepchild of the four major championships, the PGA  
Championship begins today amid a variety of Ryder Cup subplots 
unfolding both on and off the famed No. 3 course. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost lost among them is that perhaps the strongest field of  
the year -- from Tiger Woods to Jean Van de Velde -- will play on a 
widely praised and traditional golf course to decide the last major 
title of the 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you win this tournament, you have beaten the best field in  
the world,'' said Davis Love III, who did just that in the PGA two 
years ago. ``When you measure yourself against other golfers, this 
is the one you want to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vijay Singh is the defending champion, but he has been mostly  
overlooked in pretournament practice dominated by remarks from the 
likes of Woods and David Duval that the Ryder Cup players should 
get something more than just the reward of representing their 
country next month. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to an angry outburst by captain Ben Crenshaw on the eve  
of the tournament directed at a couple of team members who ``know 
who they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It burns the hell out of me to listen to some of their  
viewpoints,'' Crenshaw said. ``Playing for your country, I can't 
imagine anymore than that. It's an honor in itself. It's a duty, a 
duty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw, a four-time Ryder Cup player himself and a golf  
historian, invoked the names of players such as Arnold Palmer and 
Ben Hogan in suggesting that today's top players think more about 
themselves than their country and the game of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether some players like it or not, there are some people who  
came before them that mean a hell of a lot to the game,'' Crenshaw 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the outburst, Crenshaw was one of the most watched  
players in the field, even though he hasn't made a cut all year and 
doesn't figure to be a factor at the age of 47. 
</P>
<P>
	He does, however, have the last two picks for the 12-member  
team, and plans to carefully watch the performance of a group of 
golfers just outside the top 10 in Ryder Cup points to decide who 
he will pick for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those on the bubble are Tom Lehman, who figures to get one  
of the picks, and such players as Steve Stricker, Tim Herron, Lee 
Janzen and Chris Perry. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these fellows know what's at stake this week,'' Crenshaw  
said. ``They have to succeed this week. There's a few players on 
the hot seat so to speak, and they need to step up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods and Duval, of course, already have positions on the team,  
but there's one thing Woods has that Duval doesn't -- a major title 
on his resume. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, who has made more news lately for what he has said rather  
than how he has played, gets a chance to start to rectify that in 
the featured threesome today that includes Greg Norman and Fred 
Couples. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a return trip to Medinah for Duval, who first played here  
in the 1990 U.S. Open as an 18-year-old amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	``All in all, it's probably been not quite what I would have  
hoped for,'' Duval said. ``But you know, I have another good 
opportunity here. It's pretty neat to come back now and play a 
major on a course that I played my first major on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medinah is stretched more than 200 yards since that Open, one of  
three it has hosted, and now plays 7,401 yards. But the rough isn't 
as severe as the British Open and there is some playing room in the 
fairways. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the driver will be back in the bag of most players,  
even such long hitters as Singh, who hit his driver only four times 
in as many days in winning his first major tournament at Sahalee 
Country Club near Seattle last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no fear of pulling out my driver and hitting it here,''  
Singh said. ``I'm very at peace with my game right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singh continued a PGA Championship streak last year by becoming  
a first time major winner. Of the last 11 championships, 10 have 
been won by players who had never won a major previously. 
</P>
<P>
	Love broke through with his first major in the PGA two years  
ago, and Duval, Phil Mickelson, Colin Montgomerie and Lee Westwood 
are among those in the field who have legitimate shots at their 
first majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the field is Van de Velde, whose spectacular collapse on  
the final hole of the British Open wasn't enough to keep him out of 
the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not that I intend to forget things very quickly, but that's  
it,'' Van de Velde said. ``You don't live in the past.''

<HEADLINE> Killer of Girl Executed in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A junk dealer who abducted and shot a  
9-year-old girl was executed on Wednesday, the fourth Texas 
prisoner put to death this month and the second in two days. 
</P>
<P>
	James Otto Earhart, 56, was the 20th person executed in Texas  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	When the warden asked whether Earhart wanted to make a final  
statement, Earhart replied, ``No. No, sir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earhart was arrested after authorities found the decomposing  
body of Kandy Janell Kirtland two weeks after she disappeared from 
her home in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Her hands were tied behind her back. An autopsy determined she  
had been shot once in the head with a .22-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors saw her get off her school bus for the short walk  
home. She was last seen talking to a huge man with a stubby beard 
and dirty clothes. Earhart was 5-feet-9 and more than 400 pounds at 
the time of his arrest.

<HEADLINE> Jets' Testaverde's Thumb OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Vinny Testaverde's jammed thumb isn't  
serious enough to keep him out of Saturday's preseason game. 
</P>
<P>
	When the New York Jets veteran quarterback injured his thumb  
during Tuesday afternoon's workout, it created a ripple of concern. 
But he practiced Wednesday with little pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde, who iced his hand after getting hurt Tuesday, is  
expected to start Saturday's preseason opener at Green Bay, playing 
into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to get the swelling out,'' Testaverde said before  
the afternoon session at the club's training camp facility at 
Hofstra University. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've done it before,'' Testaverde said of the injury,  
sustained when his throwing hand collided with a defensive 
lineman's hand during a passing drill. 
</P>
<P>
	He also suffered a slight tear of skin near his thumbnail, but  
Jets coach Bill Parcells didn't overly concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wasn't anything,'' coach Bill Parcells said of  
Testaverde' problem. ``It's nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, any pain is a concern to the Jets, whose quarterback  
situation beyond Testaverde is uncertain. Scott Zolak, signed away 
from the Patriots during the offseason, hasn't been sharp in the 
early days of training camp. Converted special-teams ace Ray Lucas, 
battling with Zolak for the backup role, is a longshot to earn the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lucas will get the majority of snaps after Testaverde leaves  
against the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Punter Tom Tupa, who can also play quarterback, has seen plenty  
of action in practices. But Parcells has stressed that Tupa, also a 
former Patriot, was brought in to punt. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde stressed that he'll be ready to go against the  
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always get little injuries during the season,'' he said.  
``There are the ones that you are concerned with and the ones not 
to be concerned with. I would put this one as not to be concerned 
with -- from my perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not playing in Saturday's preseason game will be tight ends  
Blake Spence, nursing a slightly separated shoulder, and Lawrence 
Hart, whose left swollen eye after being poked in practice. 
Additionally, cornerbacks Otis Smith, sidelined with a broken left 
collarbone, and Del Lee, limping with a hamstring, will not play.

<HEADLINE> Fen-Phen Suit Gets Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- One of the manufacturers of the  
fen-phen diet drug misled doctors about the damage the pills could 
do, putting patients at increased risk for heart and lung ailments, 
a lawyer said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' attorney Esther Berezofsky comments' came as opening  
statements got under way in the first class-action suit to come to 
trial against Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products Corp., 
manufacturer of half of the fen-phen diet drug combination. 
</P>
<P>
	Three New Jersey women are suing the company on behalf of 94,000  
New Jerseyans who took the pills. 
</P>
<P>
	AHP -- which made fenfluramine, the ``fen'' half of the drug duo,  
marketed under the brand names Redux and Pondimin -- could be forced 
to pay more than $1 billion over the next decade if it loses the 
civil case, brought by patients who took the drug combination for 
at least three months. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs say they want checkups for the next several years  
to check for any signs of heart and lung problems. Such complaints 
forced the drugs off the market in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not here for money, we're here for monitoring,'' said  
Berezofsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 4,000 individual lawsuits, along with a number of other  
class-action lawsuits, are pending against the company nationwide, 
AHP said. The case is the only one in which healthy people are 
seeking medical checkups rather than financial awards for damage 
already suffered. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a Texas jury awarded $23 million to a 36-year-old  
woman who faces lifelong heart problems she blames on fen-phen. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Peter Bleakley said today AHP ``acted lawfully  
and responsibly when it learned of the risks posed by Redux and 
Pondimin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bleakley said of the plaintiffs: ``None of them have taken  
Pondimin for at least two years. None of them has any symptoms 
whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the drugs were always meant to treat obese people, not  
people who simply needed to lose a few pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6 million Americans took either fenfluramine, which was  
sold under the brand name Pondimin, or its chemical look-alike, 
dexfenfluramine, sold under the name Redux, to lose weight. Both 
drugs make the brain trick the stomach into feeling full. 
</P>
<P>
	AHP pulled them off pharmacy shelves in September 1997, several  
months after reports from the Mayo Clinic linked the drugs to 
potentially fatal heart valve damage in some patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated  
with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.

<HEADLINE> Anthony Radziwill Dies of Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anthony Radziwill, a television executive and  
cousin of the late John F. Kennedy Jr., has died of cancer, one 
week after his 40th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of Lee Bouvier Radziwill Ross -- sister to Jacqueline  
Kennedy Onassis -- and Prince Stanislas Radziwill, died Tuesday at 
New York Hospital after a 10-year illness, said a statement from 
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Radziwill had a steadfast friendship with first cousin John F.  
Kennedy Jr. When Kennedy married Carolyn Bessette in 1996, 
Radziwill was best man at the clandestine wedding ceremony in 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anthony was immensely talented, but he was also an immensely  
engaging and decent human being,'' Kennedy said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``His loss so soon after the death of his close friend and  
cousin, John Kennedy, is very hard for our whole family. But 
Anthony lived a happy life of high achievement and great courage, 
and that is how we will always remember him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Radziwill grew up in England, where his parents lived at the  
time. In 1982, he received a bachelor's degree in broadcast 
journalism from Boston University and started his career as an 
associate producer for NBC Sports, doing Emmy-award winning work 
during the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined ABC News as a producer for ``Prime Time Live'' in  
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was both fearless and humane in his reporting. He thought  
nothing of going into the streets, knocking on doors, or talking to 
strangers to get the story,'' recalled Diane Sawyer, co-anchor of 
``Prime Time Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Radziwill won television's prestigious Peabody Award  
for an investigation of new Nazism in the United States. He later 
won two more Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
	Radziwill is survived by his wife, Carole, mother, stepfather  
Herbert Ross, and sister Anna Christina Radziwill. 
</P>
<P>
	No funeral plans were announced.

<HEADLINE> Oz Says 'Bowfinger' Not for Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Frank Oz directs with the bombastic style of  
Miss Piggy and the Jedi skills of Yoda when he makes one of his 
trademark off-kilter comedies. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, he gave life to those world-famous puppets so they  
must pull his strings occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 55-year-old director said his latest project, the  
Hollywood satire ``Bowfinger,'' isn't for kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the subversive quality in movies,'' Oz said in a  
telephone interview. ``There has to be that edge. And when you make 
edginess acceptable to the audience, it becomes funny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Bowfinger'' stars Steve Martin as the title character -- a  
wannabe director who makes a low-budget thriller by secretly 
filming an anxiety-ridden action star played by Eddie Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	Oz is currently recuperating from back surgery and taking some  
time to relax after one of the busiest seasons of his 36-year 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had a ``hand'' in two other big summer movies this  
season -- as a puppeteer for the little green Jedi in ``Star Wars: 
Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' and for Kermit the Frog in 
``Muppets From Space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with credits such as ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' ``What  
About Bob?'' and ``In &AMP; Out,'' the director has earned a reputation 
for exposing the funny side of deception, humiliation and phobias. 
</P>
<P>
	Loneliness is a theme in ``Bowfinger,'' which features Murphy in  
another role as a celebrity look-alike who performs death-defying 
stunts to befriend the group of down-on-their-luck moviemakers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Martin said Oz always knows how to find humor and heart in  
what would otherwise be a troubling story. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both recognize that all good, well-rounded characters have  
a dark side,'' Martin said. ``But what he enjoys first is comedy 
and humor. He never lets anybody get in the way of clarity of 
joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pair have been friends since the 1970s, but Oz first  
directed Martin in the 1986 film ``Little Shop of Horrors,'' a 
musical about a young couple in love and their bloodthirsty, 
man-chomping plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin played a sadistic dentist who becomes the plant's first  
meal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't get a laugh, he tells me why,'' Martin said of Oz.  
``And I used to think, 'How does this guy know so much about an 
audience?' Then I realized he has done thousands and thousands of 
shows in front of a live audience as a puppeteer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oz said he was interested in directing ``Bowfinger'' because  
Martin's characters were cunning, but also had endearing qualities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve has a real sweet side to him, and that really comes  
through,'' Oz said. ``There can be no false sentimentality. If 
there is, the audience will see it and puke all over the aisles. 
And so will I.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The director entered show business at 19 when Muppets creator  
Jim Henson hired him to operate the right hand of Rowlf the Dog. 
(Henson died in 1990.) 
</P>
<P>
	Oz went on to perform numerous Muppets, including Miss Piggy,  
Fozzie Bear and Animal. He said Henson was his mentor both as a 
puppeteer and as a director. 
</P>
<P>
	But he bristles when asked if there is any similarity between  
manipulating a puppet and directing actors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always find that insulting. You don't manipulate actors. You  
work with them and respect them,'' he said. ``It makes them more 
open, and they contribute more, and that's what you hope for with 
talented people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oz said he tries to empathize with his actors by occasionally  
taking straight acting roles, and his cameo appearances are a 
trademark of fellow director John Landis. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the thin, bald man with the mustache or beard who plays  
the test monitor in the espionage farce ``Spies Like Us,'' the 
pathologist in the horror-comedy ``Innocent Blood,'' and John 
Belushi's corrections officer in ``The Blues Brothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``John (Landis) asks me to be in his films when he needs someone  
to play a (jerk),'' Oz said. ``And it's good for me as a director 
to take those small parts. That way I remember how frightening and 
vulnerable it is to be in front of the camera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those roles also give him a chance to linger on a movie set  
without all the directing responsibilities.

<HEADLINE> Bush Wages Frugal Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- George W. Bush is sitting on a massive  
war chest but his campaign is still pinching pennies, directing 
employees nationwide to lay off the 411 calls and use free 
directory-assistance Internet sites instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential front-runner's campaign sent an  
e-mail memo on the matter to staffers across the country Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been informed that there are Internet sites that allow  
you to look up a person's phone number or address FOR FREE,'' 
stated the memo, written by campaign office manager Julie Thomas. 
``Please try to use them rather than spending money on directory 
assistance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush's fund raising dwarfs that of all other presidential  
candidates, the Texas governor has earned a reputation for thrift. 
Many presidential candidates serve lavish meals at donor 
gatherings, but Bush, who raised $37 million in the first half of 
the year, often hands out peanuts and pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who sent the memo from the campaign's Austin, Texas  
headquarters, declined to comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a suggestion to save the campaign money,''  
campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said. ``We try to run an 
efficient operation here at the campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign collected $31 for every $1 it spent on fund  
raising in the first half of the year. The Gore campaign took in $6 
for every $1 it spent to raise money.

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole  
said she's not distracted by Texas Gov. George W. Bush's huge 
financial edge as she seeks to counter his financial muscle with 
brand-new voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at history,'' Mrs. Dole said Tuesday, while arguing that  
money can't be the sole basis for a bid for the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The former head of the American Red Cross slogged through four  
Des Moines campaign stops seeking to lure new voters to the polls, 
and to a big straw poll on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are coming to the events, it's not a matter of having to  
pull them in. They are there,'' Mrs. Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	At campaign stops, Mrs. Dole carefully positions herself at the  
door after speaking, shaking hands and speaking with all who 
attend. At the same time, aides are busily scurrying around with 
pledge cards, seeking to sign up backers for the Saturday straw 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowds are heavily female and young, and Mrs. Dole said  
that's who she is targeting as she seeks to broaden the Republican 
base. While she claimed progress, the success rate of aides was 
well under 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a tough task, because straw polls and precinct caucuses are  
new to many who attend her events. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Dole doesn't focus her campaign strictly on her  
gender, she points to a series of firsts she's had that appeal to 
women voters. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------

<P>
	GRUNDY CENTER, Iowa (AP) -- Steve Forbes says the tax-cut plan  
approved by the GOP-controlled Congress last week was better than 
nothing but would not significantly help Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes to a little more than 3 cents on the dollar over 10  
years,'' the GOP presidential hopeful told people Tuesday who 
turned out to greet him during campaign stops across north-central 
Iowa. ``And yet to hear all the hoopla in Washington, you would 
think it was the most radical and revolutionary thing since 1776. 
It's pennies to the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey publisher has campaigned as a political outsider.  
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa for Saturday's straw poll, he repeatedly poked fun at  
Washington politics, calling the 10-year, $792 billion package 
approved by Congress a ``supposed, great-big tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who advocates a flat-tax plan, said the tax-cut proposal  
would do nothing to alleviate people's concerns over the 
complicated U.S. tax system. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Forbes' campaign, which asked audience members at  
each stop to turn out and support him Saturday at the GOP straw 
poll in Ames, announced new help from another Republican campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich of Ohio dropped out of the Republican  
presidential race in July and threw his support behind Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. But three of Kasich's top Iowa campaign staffers, 
including former state director Karen Slifka, said Tuesday they had 
joined the Forbes campaign.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Partnerships Plan Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The American Bar Association is putting on hold a  
proposal to let lawyers join with accountants and other 
professionals to offer clients one-stop shopping for legal, 
financial and other services. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest lawyers' group decided Tuesday to delay the  
issue for more study after many members raised objections. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the longstanding ban on lawyers forming partnerships  
with other professionals such as accountants, psychologists and 
social workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers face increasing competition from huge, multi-service  
international firms. Outgoing ABA President Philip Anderson said 
lawyers cannot ignore the fact that the practice of law is 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response of `I don't like it' is not going to make it go  
away,'' Anderson said. ``I don't like it either but it's here and 
it's going to stay here, and the question is what are we going to 
do about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone will write the rules,'' Anderson said. ``The lawyers  
should write the rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some ABA members said forming partnerships with non-lawyers  
would harm lawyers' professional standards and their ability to 
promise confidentiality and undivided loyalty to their clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a nightmare,'' said Philadelphia lawyer Lawrence J. Fox.  
He said he dreamed he was attending a conference of 
multi-profession partnerships and an award was being given to Rep. 
Tom DeLay, R-Texas, for his ``bringing together of extermination 
and legal services.'' DeLay formerly ran a Houston pest 
extermination company. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA's policy-making House of Delegates decided on a majority  
vote to delay the issue. Even if the proposal had passed, the 
ethics rule changes would have taken effect only after an 
additional ABA vote at a future meeting and then by authorities who 
regulate lawyers' ethics in each state. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherwin P. Simmons of Miami, who chaired the ABA panel that made  
the proposal, said he hopes the issue will be raised again when the 
lawyers' group meets in New York next July. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed ethics changes would allow people to get legal help  
and accounting or financial planning advice all in one place. Or 
lawyers who practice family law could form partnerships with 
psychologists or social workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban on lawyers' partnerships with non-lawyers is intended to  
protect attorneys' independent judgment, protect confidential 
client information and ensure awyers' loyalty to their clients by 
avoiding conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would specify that legal ethics rules apply to all  
lawyers no matter where they work. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said about 5,000 lawyers already work for other companies on  
such matters as taxes or mergers and acquisitions. He said they are 
making the ``disingenuous argument that they are not practicing 
law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said another lawyer accused him of ``defending the buggy  
whip in the age of the automobile.'' But he said he wanted to 
``circle the wagons around loyalty to clients, confidentiality, 
client accountability and legal independence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons said consumer groups' members want to get legal help  
through non-traditional means, such as at accounting firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we do this in a way which will protect the public? So  
they'll know who's giving them advice and what to expect?'' Simmons 
said. ``We want to have another shot at this. We want to have more 
input from you,'' he told the delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Tuesday, ABA delegates passed a resolution calling on  
federal, state and local legislators to require police to keep 
statistics to help determine whether traffic stops and searches are 
being conducted for racially discriminatory reasons. A number of 
motorists say they have been stopped for no apparent reason other 
than ``driving while black.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, the delegates defeated a proposed ethics rule that would  
restrict lawyers from making political contributions aimed at 
getting government work, a practice known as ``pay to play.''

<HEADLINE> Yates, Irwin To Split After Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Robert Yates said Wednesday that Kenny  
Irwin, driver of the No. 28 Ford Taurus since the start of the 1998 
season, will not return to his racing team next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenny Irwin and I have mutally agreed that it is in the best  
interests of both Kenny and the team to not continue our 
relationship together into the year 2000,'' said Yates, whose team 
also fields the No. 88 Ford of Winston Cup points leader Dale 
Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin, the top 1997 rookie in the Craftsman Truck Series and a  
surprise pick to replace Ernie Irvan last year, won Winston Cup 
Rookie of the Year honors for 1998 after winning a pole, turning in 
one top-five and three top-10s and finishing 28th in the points. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yates was openly critical of Irwin at times during that  
first season, complaining that the former U.S. Auto Club short 
track star was not focusing enough on racing. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems were seemingly put behind late last season when  
Irwin said he had re-dedicated himself to racing. But Irwin has 
been also a forgotten man so far this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first 20 races of 1999, the 30-year-old driver has added  
a second career pole, one top-five and two top-10s and is 20th in 
the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to emphasize that this change is being made in the  
interest of all concerned,'' Yates said. ``Kenny is a talented 
driver and all of us at Robert Yates Racing wish him the best in 
his future endeavors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yates said Irwin will finish the season in the No. 28 car and  
that no decision has been made regarding a new driver for next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are exploring our options and will interview drivers before  
making a decision,'' Yates said.

<HEADLINE> Schilling Suffers Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Phillies ace Curt Schilling suffered another  
setback Wednesday when he was unable to throw off the mound as 
scheduled due to muscle spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, who had a cortisone shot this week to ease the  
effects of tendinitis and mild rotator cuff swelling, will try to 
throw again Thursday. If he experiences pain again, team doctor 
Michael Ciccotti said he will consider shutting him down 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's not able to throw the way he normally would two days  
before a start, then that's enough,'' Ciccotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, whose string of 117 consecutive starts ended July 28  
due to biceps tendinitis, was supposed to pitch off the mound 
Wednesday. But he experienced spasms in his neck and behind his 
shoulder blades while playing catch and cut the session short. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciccotti said if he has similar discomfort Thursday, an MRI  
might be prescribed -- although the doctor believes Schilling's 
shoulder is structurally sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the results of his throwing session Thursday might go a  
long way toward deciding if Schilling is sidelined indefinitely, 
Ciccotti said, ``Yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Schilling might not make the team's trip to Cincinnati  
this weekend if things don't go well Thursday, Ciccotti said, 
``That's a consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was another dose of bad news for Schilling, who had been on  
schedule to start Friday against the Reds. But even before 
Wednesday's setback, the Phillies had already pushed him back to 
Saturday -- a nationally televised matchup against Pete Harnisch, 
another pitcher who has battled tobacco addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Schill doesn't especially like to pitch in the day  
sometimes, but I think it's better if we give him the extra day,'' 
Francona said before Schilling's bullpen session. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling will come to Veterans Stadium to test his shoulder on  
Thursday, an off-day for the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, who started for the National League in the All-Star  
game, led the league with 300 strikeouts, 268 2-3 innings and 15 
complete games last season. He's dropped to fifth in the NL in 
strikeouts this season, fading in his bid to join Nolan Ryan as the 
only pitchers to strike out 300 batters in three consecutive 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old right-hander is second in the majors to Randy  
Johnson with eight complete games, throwing five straight early in 
the season. But the Phillies have stopped short of saying 
Schilling's shoulder problem is due to overwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling had major shoulder surgery to repair a torn labrum and  
remove a bone spur in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I'd call it overwork,'' Ciccotti said. ``Yes,  
he throws a lot and he throws very hard. ... The style of pitcher 
he is and his competitiveness unquestionably puts tremendous stress 
on the whole shoulder girdle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling said through a Phillies spokesman that he was  
unavailable to comment before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's appropriately distressed,'' Ciccotti said. ``But he's  
very willing to do the things we're suggesting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want him to pitch, and we want him to pitch pain-free. We  
don't want him to put himself at risk, not only for the rest of the 
season, but for the rest of what will be a very long career.''

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Bob Herbert, the man who concocted the Spice  
Girls, was killed in a car accident Monday. He was 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert, who brought the Spice Girls together and lately managed  
the teen pop group Five, died after he lost control of his car in 
heavy rain and it collided with another car in Windsor, west of 
London. Two people in the other car were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert and his son, Chris, sought candidates for the Spice  
Girls via an ad in a trade magazine in 1996. They selected and 
coached the five young women, who went on to international pop 
stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	The group later fired Herbert in favor of another manager, and  
their number was reduced to four when Geri Halliwell -- Ginger Spice 
-- quit last year.

<P>
	Irwin died at home, said his wife, poet P.K. Page.  
</P>
<P>
	He began his journalism career as a reporter for the Toronto

</P>
<P>
	Irwin later served as ambassador to Brazil, Mexico and  
Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon retiring from the diplomatic corps, he returned to  
journalism as publisher of the Victoria Times in 1964.

	LONDON (AP) -- TV cook Jennifer Paterson, one of the ``Two Fat  
Ladies'' who joyfully salted their recipes with political 
incorrectness, died Tuesday. She was 71 and had lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Paterson fell ill in July during filming of ``Two Fat  
Ladies,'' a cooking show where the colorful chefs were the main 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	Perfectly happy to be plump, the women toured the country on  
Miss Paterson's old Triumph motorcycle -- she in the driving seat 
and Clarissa Dickson Wright, in Red Baron-style helmet, squeezed 
into the sidecar. 
</P>
<P>
	They went from one cooking job to the next, chortling and  
trading wry quips about food, love and life and happily loading 
their food with butter and cream. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Dickson Wright once called the program ``a cookery show  
with anarchy and a motorbike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chain-smoking Miss Paterson, often filmed with a cigarette  
clamped firmly in her mouth, spoke with a very upper-class accent

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: History of Spam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- For all of the encyclopedic tomes ever  
written on critical issues confronting mankind, never before has 
there been an in-depth examination of that pillar of American 
culture, luncheon meat. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now.  
</P>
<P>
	Author, philosopher and woman-about-town Carolyn Wyman has  
produced the definitive treatise on the subject, ``SPAM: A 
Biography.'' Wyman says the tribute to the pink, gelatinous 
brick-in-a-can is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a work of serious Spam scholarship,'' said Wyman, a  
graduate of Brown University. ``By my nature, my training, my 
education, I'm into looking at every aspect. I examine Spam in a 
very comprehensive way, and I think I really have a handle on my 
subject matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wyman, a nationally syndicated food columnist, is considered by  
many to be the world's foremost authority on convenience foods such 
as Spam, Twinkies and Jell-O. 
</P>
<P>
	Her previous works include, ``I'm a Spam Fan,'' which is a  
history of more than 100 brand-name supermarket food products, and 
``The Kitchen Sink Cookbook: Offbeat Recipes From Unusual 
Ingredients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her latest volume, published by Harcourt Brace &AMP; Co., delves  
into the very essence of Spam -- its history, its socioeconomic 
implications, how it earned a place in the Smithsonian Institution, 
its cult following on the Internet, its place in poetry and prose 
and the rise of a Spam religion. 
</P>
<P>
	And yes, she also includes recipes for gourmet fare. There's  
Spam, baked bean and pineapple casserole, a Spam cheesecake and 
that perennial party favorite, pig newtons. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyman, something of a purist, takes her Spam straight-up, fresh  
out of the can. As that pungent Spam odor wafts through the air, 
she waxes poetic about that taste of 
something-like-ham-but-not-quite. 
</P>
<P>
	``The taste is incredibly distinct. It's salty. It's hammy. It's  
soft. It's mushy, sort of, like butter,'' she said, licking her 
lips. 
</P>
<P>
	``It tastes even better fried,'' she enthuses.  
</P>
<P>
	Incidentally, Wyman's work is an unauthorized biography of Spam.  
Although Hormel gave Wyman access to its archives, the company says 
it is in no way associated with Wyman or her book. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Hormel spokesman Allan Krejci affectionately described  
this homage to the luncheon loaf as ``an all-encompassing 
historical review.'' The company estimates that 120 million cans 
are sold worldwide each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyman, 43, majored in English at Brown. She grew up in  
Cumberland, R.I., and became a fan of good writing -- and Spam -- 
through the influence of her father, James Wyman, the retired 
executive editor of the Providence Journal-Bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brought reporters home, and they seemed like they had an  
exciting life,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``SPAM: A Biography'' came out in July with an initial press run  
of 50,000 books. ``I'm a Spam Fan'' sold out its first and second 
press runs. But there were mixed results with ``The Kitchen Sink 
Cookbook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wyman contends that Spam is the quintessential American  
processed food, endearing because it is so far from its original 
state that it no longer resembles anything found in nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans have tamed our foods just as surely as we've tamed  
the West,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Within the text, she seeks to dispel various Spam myths,  
including the prevailing wisdom that it's made of pig snouts, lips, 
ears and tongue. In fact, the ingredients are rather basic: pork 
shoulder with ham, salt, water, sugar and a preservative called 
sodium nitrite. 
</P>
<P>
	The name ``Spam'' was derived from a combination of words, Wyman  
says. Citing sources she does not identify, Wyman says the name 
comes from the words ``spiced ham.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, another theory points to the words ``shoulder of pork  
and ham.'' Webster's Dictionary describes Spam as ``seasoned pork 
and ham'' but gives no opinion about the derivation of the word. 
</P>
<P>
	Spam's nutritional attributes are questionable. Each 2-ounce  
serving has 170 calories and 16 grams of fat -- six of them 
saturated. But Spam also boasts 7 grams of protein and 2 percent of 
the daily recommended supply of iron. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyman concedes that the power of Spam's preservative has been a  
topic of controversy. The oldest can of Spam known to have been 
safely consumed was 25 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no need for an expiration date. Its shelf life is  
practically indefinite,'' Wyman said. She notes that there has 
never been a government recall of Spam and that no major illness or 
disease has ever been blamed on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Spam was first created by Jay C. Hormel in 1937, it did  
not reach prominence until World War II, when it became a staple of 
wartime rations both on the home front and in the trenches. 
</P>
<P>
	America's wartime heroes -- for some of whom Spam would be their  
final meal -- quickly developed a love-hate relationship with the 
product. It was variously described as ``Ham that didn't pass its 
physical,'' ``Meat loaf without basic training,'' and ``The reason 
war is hell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, to this day, Spam occupies a special place in  
kitchen cupboards across the country. Wyman, who has been eating 
Spam regularly since childhood, explains that many simply can't 
part with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``People get close to weeping, reminiscing about Spam and how  
they had it when they were a kid,'' she said. ``It recalls a 
simpler time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she thinks the final chapter on Spam has yet to be written.  
As the century ends, many people fearing a millennial meltdown are 
stocking up, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great product for the millennium. I seriously expect a  
big spike in Spam sales because it's a perfect food for the 
bunker,'' she said. 
</P>

	The ``miracle meat'' Spam pervades popular American culture.  
Some examples: 

</P>
<P>
                         *SPAM TRUE OR FALSE   	
</P>
<P>
	-- Legend holds that during World War II, Spam was dropped from  
planes to neutralize hostile populations in enemy territory. FALSE. 
</P>
<P>
	-- People on the U.S. territory of Guam eat more Spam than any  
other people on the planet, mostly because Guam suffers frequent 
typhoons that leave residents without power for weeks. TRUE. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Spam is made of leftover pig parts that nobody wants, such as  
lips. FALSE. (Spam is actually made of pork shoulder with ham, 
salt, water, sugar, and a preservative called sodium nitrite.) 

</P>
<P>
                           *STARRING SPAM   	
</P>
<P>
	-- Spam has played roles in TV shows like ``M-A-S-H,'' ``Northern  
Exposure,'' ``Mad About You'' and ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' and 
has been featured in the movies ``Empire of the Sun,'' ``Grumpy Old 
Men'' and ``Blankman,'' among others. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In a 1987 airing of his late NBC show, David Letterman  
introduced Spam-on-a-rope, a product for people ``who are really on 
the go and who like to eat in the shower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- In a 1996 sketch, ``The Tonight Show'' star Jay Leno slid out  
of the Spam NASCAR racing car with the aid of a gelatin coating. 

</P>
<P>
                        *SPAM, WONDERFUL SPAM   	
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, the British comedy troupe Monty Python  
immortalized Spam in a skit set in a cafe that served a heavily 
Spam-influenced menu: 

</P>
<P>
	(An innocent couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bun, enter the diner.)  
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Bun: What have you got, then?  
</P>
<P>
	Waitress: Well, there's egg and bacon; egg, sausage, and bacon;  
egg and Spam; egg, bacon, and Spam; egg, bacon, sausage, and Spam; 
Spam, bacon, sausage, and Spam; Spam, egg, Spam, Spam, bacon, and 
Spam; Spam, Spam, Spam, egg, and Spam; Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, 
Spam, Spam, baked beans, Spam, Spam, Spam, and Spam; or lobster 
Thermidor aux crevettes with a Mornay sauce garnished with truffle 
pate, brandy, and a fried egg on top of Spam. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bun: Have you got anything without Spam in it?  
</P>
<P>
	Waitress: Well, Spam, egg, sausage and Spam. That's not got much  
Spam in it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bun: I don't want any Spam.  
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Bun: Why can't she have egg, bacon, Spam, and sausage?  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bun: That's got Spam in it!  
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Bun: Not as much as Spam, egg, sausage and Spam.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bun: Look, could I have egg, bacon, Spam, and sausage  
without the Spam? 
</P>
<P>
	Waitress: Uuuuuugggh!  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bun: What d'you mean, uuugggh? I don't like Spam!  
</P>
<P>
	(Enter Vikings, singing): Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam. Spam, Spam,  
Spam, Spam. Lovely Spam, wonderful Spam. Lovely Spam, wonderful 
Spam ... 

</P>
<P>
                       	 *SPAM IN CYBERSPACE   	
</P>
<P>
	Unwanted, pointless and repetitive advertising and e-mail on the  
Internet is referred to as ``Spam.'' Sending such dreck is known as 
``spamming.'' The term is thought to have been inspired by the 
Monty Python ``Spam'' sketch. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	Over the years, a variety of exotic recipes has elevated Spam to  
haute cuisine. Some recipes for the adventurous gourmet found in 
``SPAM: A Biography'':

<HEADLINE> Indians 4, Angels 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Manny Ramirez hit his 30th homer and  
Roberto Alomar hit his 20th as the Cleveland Indians beat Anaheim 
4-3 Wednesday night to complete a three-game sweep and send the 
Angels to their sixth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, who hit 45 homers last year, connected off Lou Pote in  
the eighth for his second homer in two nights and raised his major 
league-leading RBIs total to 116. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Burba (9-7) allowed one run and seven hits in six innings  
to win for the first time in four road starts since June 13. He 
escaped a bases-loaded jam in the first inning by retiring Garret 
Anderson on a weak tapper back to the mound and stranded eight 
runners in the first five innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Jackson got three outs for his 26th save in 29 chances,  
allowing a two-out, two-run homer to Todd Greene, the first home 
run by an Angels' pinch hitter in 51 at-bats this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mo Vaughn then singled, but Jackson struck out Tim Salmon to end  
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Sparks (5-9), who retired 13 of his first 14 batters, lost  
for the fifth time in his last six decisions, giving up three runs 
and seven hits in five-plus innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Last-place Anaheim has lost 22 of 26 to fall to 46-67, dropping  
22 games back in the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians designated hitter Jim Thome sat out after complaining of  
flu-like symptoms. Alex Ramirez was inserted as the DH and broke a 
scoreless tie with an RBI double in the fifth following a double by 
Richie Sexson. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar Vizquel opened the sixth with a single and Alomar followed  
with a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Huson's opposite-field RBI single in sixth was the only run  
allowed by Burba. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Sparks' wild pitch in the fourth was his first in 64 1-3  
innings and only his second in 103 2-3 innings. He threw five wild 
pitches in his first 18 innings this season. ... Tim Salmon's 
first-inning double was his 969th career hit, moving him past Rod 
Carew for fifth place on the Angels' career list. Carew had 
additional 2,085 hits for the Minnesota Twins. ... Darin Erstad sat 
out after sprained right knee Tuesday night. ... Angels two-time 
Gold Glove center fielder Jim Edmonds played first base for the 
first time since June 26, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Geneva Conventions Turn 50 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Olga Villarrubia smiles at the memory.  
</P>
<P>
	The Red Cross delegate was visiting Croatians captured by Serbs  
in their 1991 war when one man, overjoyed at the friendly face, 
gave her one of his most precious possessions: dice made from his 
bread ration. 
</P>
<P>
	Months later, the released prisoner found his way to her office  
in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, just to thank her. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Villarrubia's smile fades. She's recalling the despair of a  
detainee in Sierra Leone who wept at news Villarrubia was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you spend hours with a person. You say you will come  
back, but the person looks at you and they don't believe it,'' she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Villarrubia's stories show the Geneva Conventions at work.  
</P>
<P>
	Fifty years old Thursday, the conventions lay out humane and  
dignified treatment of prisoners and civilians in wartime. 
Compliance visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross 
have given hope to decades of detainees struggling against 
isolation and, frequently, abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	But with a ceremony planned at Geneva's town hall and special  
events around the world, the conventions today are perhaps better 
known for the violations against them than the respect for them. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, the conventions ban torture, hostage-taking, mass  
extermination, summary executions, deportations and the wanton 
destruction of civilian property, all of which were commonplace in 
the recent wars in Sierra Leone and Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The conventions boast the signatures of 188 nations, more than  
the U.N. membership of 185. A big problem, however, as some see it, 
is that individual signatory states are left to police themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the problem is in the texts,'' says Isabelle  
Scherer, a local representative for Amnesty International, the 
human rights organization. ``The texts are excellent, but there is 
no mechanism to measure their respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Claudio Cordone, director of Amnesty's main policy unit in  
London, says many states don't realize that signing the conventions 
gave them the responsibility to apprehend and prosecute war 
criminals in their own courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a growing recognition that impunity is linked to  
violations of both human rights law and the law of war,'' he says. 
``There are often very good judges that don't actually know that 
they have this authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four conventions were drawn up in the aftermath of World War  
II's horrors to establish minimum conditions for prisoners of war, 
civilians and the sick and wounded during international armed 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	They replaced several earlier, more limited agreements, also  
known as Geneva conventions, that covered battlefield wounded, 
signed in 1864; sailors wounded or captured at sea, 1906; and 
prisoners of war, 1929. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1949 conventions designated the International Red Cross as  
observers. Last year, the ICRC visited 212,000 detainees in 59 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The conventions stipulate that a nation treat captured or  
injured ``enemy'' troops and civilians the same way as its own 
soldiers and release them when war ends. They make special 
provision for medics, clergy and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The modern treaties were updated with two additional protocols  
in 1977 that strengthened protection for civilians in civil wars as 
well as international conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	George Moose, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva,  
says the conventions ``will rank high among the list of noble 
accomplishments this century bequeaths to the next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To assess their importance we need only contemplate the  
suffering that has occurred where they haven't been respected,'' 
Moose says. 
</P>
<P>
	But the changing nature of warfare has limited the good the  
conventions -- and the Red Cross -- can do. 
</P>
<P>
	As written, the conventions envisage a traditional war between  
law-abiding armies -- where troops from one nation attack troops 
from the other until one is victorious. 
</P>
<P>
	But most modern conflicts involve internal strife or armed  
rebellions, neither addressed in detail by the conventions. 
Although the 1977 protocols strengthened the rights of civilians 
caught up in civil war, state sovereignty is still held paramount. 
</P>
<P>
	In internal conflicts, the Red Cross has to seek a government's  
permission to send in a delegate. China still forbids access, for 
instance, and visits to Myanmar and Algeria are beginning only now, 
after years of negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in an ``international'' war such as the bombing of  
Yugoslavia by NATO, the Red Cross had to wait weeks before it was 
allowed to visit three U.S. soldiers captured by Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	The ICRC is the first to concede the conventions are far from  
perfect. But it isn't urging reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Villarrubia, who coordinates ICRC visits from the Geneva  
headquarters, says enforcement should be the priority of the 
international community, rather than rewriting the conventions. 
``If we had to renegotiate the Geneva Conventions, we would never 
reach what we reached in 1949,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't stop the war. We can't go into a country and say this  
is right and this is wrong,'' she says. ``But we are convinced we 
have a role in calming down, even if only by checking the 
conditions of detention, by assisting the population, by being 
present.''

	Fed Finds Strong U.S. Economy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy is still growing strongly  
with labor shortages reported nationwide, the Federal Reserve said 
today. The Fed's ``beige book'' survey of economic conditions, 
compiled from reports from its 12 regional banks, found only 
scattered signs of mounting wage pressures and little evidence of 
rising inflation in general. But the Fed survey did note 
developments that could lead to increased inflationary pressures, 
including scattered higher prices.

for $5.6 billion in cash and stock just hours after three foreign 
aluminum rivals announced a deal that would catapult them to the

upstart Linux operating software and shunning rampant market 
pessimism toward initial public offerings. The warm investor 
reception toward Durham, N.C.-based Red Hat, the first Linux-only 
company to go public, is expected to trigger more IPOs by companies 
promoting the operating system as an alternative to Unix and

writers develop family-friendly shows for consideration by the WB 
network. The advertisers, including Procter &AMP; Gamble, General 
Motors, IBM and Sears, say they are taking the steps after finding 
fewer prime-time programs during which they feel comfortable 
selling their products. The advertisers agreed to bankroll at least 
eight scripts that can cost as much as $90,000 each. WB will 
supervise the development and decide which scripts, if any, will go 
into production.

	DALLAS (AP) -- Herb Kelleher, the flamboyant chief executive of  
Southwest Airlines, said today that he has prostate cancer, which 
his doctor said was caught in the early stages. Kelleher, 68, who 
pioneered no-frills, low-cost air service and built Southwest into 
one of the country's top airlines, began radiation treatment today. 
Analysts were reassured by an upbeat prognosis from doctors, though 
they remain concerned about who will succeed the colorful, 
68-year-old executive. Southwest stock fell 1/8 at 16 3/8.

	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Struggling manufactured-home builder  
Oakwood Homes Corp. said today its longtime chief executive, 
Nicholas St. George, will retire and that the company is no longer 
looking for a suitor. President and chief operating officer William 
G. Edwards will be his successor. The company, which is the 
nation's largest retailer of manufactured homes, also said it had 
halted efforts to look for a buyer after a succession of poor 
earnings reports. Oakwood also said that recent layoffs, attrition 
and three plant closings have eliminated about 1,000 jobs since 
April. Oakwood stock fell 1 9/16 at 7 5/8.

	IBM Helps Airlines With E-Tickets  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A collaboration between IBM and the airline  
industry could make ticketless air travel much more convenient for 
passengers and air carriers. At some domestic airlines, up to half 
of all passengers now use electronic tickets. But unlike paper 
tickets, airlines cannot honor each other's electronic tickets 
unless they establish costly links between their e-ticket systems. 
IBM and the International Air Transport Association announced today 
that they are developing a computer system that would link all 
airlines that offer ticketless travel beginning next year. IBM 
shares closed up 3 15/16 at 123 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Shatner's Wife Accidentally Drowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- William Shatner and his wife of two years had  
reconciled after he filed for divorce last fall, said the agent for 
Nerine Shatner, who accidentally drowned in the family pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner, the star of ``Star Trek,'' dived in when he spotted his  
40-year-old wife in the deep end late Monday, but he was unable to 
resuscitate her, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My beautiful wife is dead,'' Shatner, 68, said tearfully when  
he briefly stepped out of his Studio City estate on Tuesday. ``She 
meant everything to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner filed for divorce Oct. 21, 11 months after the couple  
wed, citing irreconcilable differences. They had separated Oct. 14, 
but it was not clear if Shatner intended to proceed with the 
divorce, according to papers filed in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The two had reconciled, said Pam Loar, Mrs. Shatner's agent.  
</P>
<P>
	``She was like a comet, very bright, vivacious, the biggest  
heart you could come across,'' Loar said. 
</P>
<P>
	The office of Leonard Machtinger, Shatner's attorney, referred  
questions about the divorce filing to the actor's manager, Larry 
Thompson, who did not return a phone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy was scheduled for today.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence of foul play,'' police Detective Mike  
Coffey said. ``Subsequent investigation revealed Mrs. Shatner was 
home alone for a short period of time and accidentally drowned 
while swimming in the family pool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner said he was in Orange County, south of Los Angeles,  
until about 9:30 p.m. Monday. ``I arrived home and I found my wife 
at the bottom of the pool,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After pulling her body from the deep end, Shatner called 911 and  
was told to begin CPR. When paramedics arrived ``she was beyond our 
help,'' Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner married Nerine Kidd, a former model, in November 1997 in  
a private Pasadena ceremony. It was his third marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner, best known as Capt. James T. Kirk from the ``Star  
Trek'' television series and movies, also starred in the TV police 
drama ``T.J. Hooker'' and was the host of ''Rescue 911.''

<HEADLINE> Survivor of Bataan Death March Sues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A survivor of the Bataan Death March sued a  
Japanese company on Wednesday, saying he was beaten by employees of 
Mitsui &AMP; Co. Ltd. and forced to work as a slave for the huge 
conglomerate after being captured during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit brought by Lester I. Tenney, 79, of San Diego is the  
first filed under a new California law that allows victims of slave 
labor to sue multinational corporations in state courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want them to apologize. I want them to say to the world,  
'We're sorry for what we did,''' said Tenney, a retired Arizona 
State University finance professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsui forced American POWs to work in a coal mine considered  
too unsafe for Japanese workers, Tenney said outside the Superior 
Court building where the suit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Each day, Japanese soldiers escorted POWs to the mine near  
Nagasaki, where Mitsui employees beat and tormented the Americans 
as they worked, Tenney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.  
</P>
<P>
	Defendants include Mitsui and several subsidiaries of the  
Tokyo-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsui, one of Japan's largest international trading companies,  
is involved in a wide range of businesses, including mining, 
insurance, shipping and commodities trading. The company reported 
$131 billion in revenue during fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Hira Bayashi, spokesman for Mitsui USA, wouldn't comment. He  
referred calls to the parent company's Tokyo headquarters, which 
was closed for the day by the time the lawsuit was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The California law, which took effect in July, was written  
specifically to apply to foreign companies that profited from slave 
labor during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenney was taken prisoner in 1942 in the Philippines, where he  
had been deployed with his Illinois National Guard tank battalion. 
He survived the Bataan Death March, a 60-mile trek to a prison camp 
in the Philippines, and escaped to join an Allied guerrilla group 
before being recaptured and shipped with other POWs to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	POWs worked daily without breaks and were given just enough food  
to stay alive. Tenney said his weight dropped from 185 pounds to 
101.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Introduce Layden As GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scott Layden ducked every controversy Wednesday  
and left the comic relief to his new underling, Jeff Van Gundy, as 
the New York Knicks introduced their new brain trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden, who spent 18 years with the Utah Jazz, joins the Knicks  
as general manager and executive vice president. Van Gundy, who has 
survived four mostly tumultuous seasons as coach of the Knicks, got 
a multi-year contract extension lasting at least through the 
2002-03 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep having these press conferences to say I'm still here,''  
Van Gundy said, ``and here I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layden was chosen for the job over Ed Tapscott, the Knicks  
player personnel director who had been performing the general 
manager's duties on an interim basis since the end of the NBA 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts said he  
interviewed other candidates, all of whom were ``all too willing to 
give their opinions'' on Knicks personnel and the way the offense 
was run last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made this decision because the chemistry between the two of  
them is exactly what this organization needed,'' said Checketts, 
who met with Layden last weekend and convinced him to take over the 
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden will be Van Gundy's boss and will have a say on personnel  
moves equal to that of his predecessor, Ernie Grunfeld, who was 
ousted by Checketts in April because a rift had developed between 
GM and coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will have the final say, but I see it as a teamwork  
effort,'' Layden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden diplomatically refused to discuss any specifics related  
to the Knicks, be it Latrell Sprewell's history, Patrick Ewing's 
reduced role or the possibility that Charles Oakley might be 
reacquired. Layden said he needed to discuss those matters 
internally first. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden also would not say whether he'd maintain some of the  
philosophical standards he employed in Utah, such as refusing as a 
matter of principle to stash players on the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden also refused to give his take on the Knicks'  
turmoil-filled 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks were 21-21 with eight games left and Grunfeld was  
reassigned. New York went on to defeat Miami, Atlanta and Indiana 
in the playoffs before losing 4-1 in the finals to the San Antonio 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``My focus is to look forward, and I don't know the details of  
what went on,'' Layden said. ``It'd be foolish from my perspective 
to dwell on the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said he expected to take the same roster to training  
camp in October while also disclosing that he's ``leaning'' toward 
moving Sprewell into the starting lineup on a permanent basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell seethed last season as Van Gundy kept him in a sixth  
man role until the Eastern Conference finals. Sprewell will be 
entering the final season of his contract, and could choose to play 
it out and become a free agent if he is returned to a reserve role. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts said the Knicks are eager to sign Sprewell to a  
contract extension that will keep him in New York well into the 
next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Tapscott, who was considered to be aligned with Grunfeld, is  
expected to discuss his future role with Layden and Checketts in 
the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	``His association with Ernie had very little to do with this  
decision,'' Checketts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts said race had nothing to do with him choosing Layden,  
who is white, over Tapscott, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about race or ethnic origin, it's not about  
sending messages,'' Checketts said, ``it's about making the right 
decision for this organization.''

<HEADLINE> Ky. School Displays 10 Commandments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MCKEE, Ky. (AP) -- With essentially no community opposition,  
volunteers placed the Ten Commandments in every classroom in a 
rural eastern Kentucky school district before classes began on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jackson County school board and superintendent made the  
decision as part of ``an effort to start having good morals in 
school ... because of all the violent issues that have been showing 
up,'' said Betty Bond, principal of Jackson County High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Crawford, the district's attorney, said he's concerned  
about lawsuits, but believes the Ten Commandment plaques in the 
district's five schools are allowed by law because they were paid 
for and posted by local volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Lakes, a business teacher at Jackson County High School,  
said the Ten Commandments were posted in the classroom when he was 
growing up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the flag,'' Lakes said. ``We've been tearing down  
symbols that have been in this country'' for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson County isn't the only school district in Kentucky or the  
country where the Ten Commandments are on display in schools. Tonya 
Adams, principal of Union Chapel Elementary School in Russell 
County, which has had the Ten Commandments posted for years, said 
she's never received any complaints about it. 
</P>
<P>
	In Adams County, Ohio, a group of ministers paid to place Ten  
Commandments tablets outside four high schools to counter ``moral 
decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Vessels, executive director of the American Civil Liberties  
Union of Kentucky, said the organization just became aware of the 
situation in Jackson County and has not had time to consider a 
response. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very concerned,'' he said in a telephone interview from  
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a Kentucky case that  
posting the Ten Commandments violated the Constitution's ban on 
government-established religion. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the U.S. House passed a measure allowing the Ten  
Commandments to be posted in schools and other government 
buildings. The bill now goes to the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Teen To Be Tried As Adult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- A 15-year-old boy accused of shooting six  
classmates at his high school should be tried as an adult, a judge 
ruled Wednesday, saying the crime was especially heinous because 
the boy was allegedly trying to copy the Columbine massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Juvenile Court Judge William Schneider said he believes  
society's need to prevent such shootings outweigh T.J. Solomon's 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
	He ordered the case transferred to Superior Court, where Solomon  
could face life in prison if convicted of aggravated assault and 
other charges. The maximum juvenile sentence would have been 60 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon, a sophomore at Heritage High School, is accused of  
opening fire May 20 with two guns in the commons area of the school 
20 miles east of Atlanta. Six students were injured, the most 
serious a 15-year-old girl who spent almost a week in the hospital 
with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's ruling came at the end of the three-day hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	A state investigator testified during the hearing that Solomon  
left a note referring to the shooting spree at Columbine High 
School in Littleton, Colo., that left 15 dead on April 20, exactly 
a month before the shooting at Conyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Schneider made note of that in his decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the child has attempted to copy a heinous,  
premeditated crime and showed such disrespect for the safety of 
others ... makes the public's interest to treat him as an adult 
paramount to any interest of the individual child,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Solomon intended to hurt people, and should be  
tried as an adult. Defense attorneys Don Samuel and Ed Garland 
argued that Solomon is mentally ill and should be committed to a 
psychiatric hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Garland said Solomon has the maturity level of an 11-year-old.  
</P>
<P>
	``Children require special care, they require special treatment  
and they require special punishment,'' he said. ``If we send T.J. 
off to the adult system, perhaps we'll find him hanging in his 
prison cell one day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys may appeal the ruling to the Georgia Court of  
Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Cheek, father of one of the victims, said he was pleased  
with Schneider's order. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he made the right decision,'' he said. ``(District  
Attorney) Richard (Read) said it properly. He sent a bullet through 
the hearts of this community and the entire country. Everybody's a 
loser with this one.''

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Tests Self-Serve Machines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- McDonald's is testing a machine that lets  
customers punch in their orders, pay with cash and wait at a table 
for their burgers and fries. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the company is trying out two machines in its Illinois  
laboratories and one in a children's ``Playplace'' at a McDonald's 
restaurant in Wyoming, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty cool,'' said Jodi Hall, a 14-year-old customer at  
the Michigan restaurant. ``It's something different. And sometimes 
when I don't feel like talking, I can use it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her ice cream purchase was delayed slightly because she only had  
coins and had to borrow a dollar. The McDonald's machine only takes 
paper money up to $50 bills at this point. The customer's change 
arrives in a paper cup when employees bring the order to the 
specified table. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at McDonald's corporate headquarters say they plan to  
add a couple more machines in yet-to-be-determined restaurants in 
other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Competitors have set up similar systems, with varying degrees of  
success. Burger King tried a text-based system (McDonald's is 
picture-based) 12 years ago in Boston but eventually dumped it 
because of wrong orders and slow service, said Kim Miller, a Burger 
King spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers were somewhat receptive to it,'' Miller said, adding  
that the company wouldn't be opposed to trying again. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an Arby's franchisee in Golden, Colo., is trying out  
kiosks at five of its 62 restaurants. The machines do not allow 
automatic payment but instead are placed in threes and fours around 
a cashier.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Car Sales Up Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Sales by South Korea's three major  
carmakers increased strongly during the first seven months of this 
year, helped by recovering consumer demand at home, company 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea's largest carmaker, sold 307,351  
vehicles in South Korea between January and July, a 69 percent 
increase from the same period last year. Total sales, including 
exports, increased 45.6 percent to 709,246 cars during the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo Motors Co., the No. 2 automaker, sold 179,392 cars  
domestically, up 37 percent from last year. Total sales reached 
518,584 cars, up 15.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Kia Motors Corp. sold 163,331 cars at home during the  
first seven months of 1999, up 87 percent. Total sales reached 
424,516 cars, an increase of 52.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean consumers tightened their belts last year amid a  
serious economic recession, but began to spend money again this 
year as the economy showed signs of a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Automotive Research Institute, a private research  
center, predicted that domestic sales will rise to 1.13 million 
cars this year from 780,000 last year. In 1997, 1.5 million cars 
were sold.

<HEADLINE> White House Warns Deutsche Telekom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration raised the  
potential of another bruising trade fight with Europe on Wednesday 
when it warned that it was prepared to file a complaint if German 
telephone giant Deutsche Telekom imposes unfair connection charges 
to limit foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said she was  
taking action after U.S. telecommunications companies complained 
that the former German monopoly telephone service was trying to 
impose high interconnection fees and other roadblocks in their 
efforts to offer services in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``German regulatory authorities must take concrete steps to  
ensure that Deutsche Telekom provides timely interconnection at 
fair rates, terms and conditions for prospective entrants,'' 
Barshefsky said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the U.S. trade office would be closely monitoring  
upcoming decisions by German regulators and would not hesitate to 
bring a case before the World Trade Organization if those decisions 
are not consistent with a global agreement opening up 
telecommunications services to greater competition. 
</P>
<P>
	In issuing the warning, Barshefsky said U.S. officials welcomed  
recent rulings in which German regulators decided to ``reject most 
of the unreasonable rates, terms and conditions that Deutsche 
Telekom has sought to impose immediately on new entrants to the 
telecommunications market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she said the concern now was upcoming rules to be issued in  
the fall that will set the conditions for foreign competition 
beginning in the year 2000 and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	``Further action by the regulator is essential to secure market  
access for U.S. industry in the newly liberalized German 
telecommunications services market,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the United States is involved in two high-profile  
trade fights with the 15-nation European Union in which it has 
imposed punitive tariffs on more than $300 million of European 
products in retaliation for the EU's refusal to abide by WTO 
decisions involving American beef and bananas.

<HEADLINE> Study: Allergy Shots Block Symptoms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Monthly allergy shots can lessen the torment of hay fever for  
years after the shots are stopped, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the Imperial College School of Medicine in London  
found that patients who received immunotherapy monthly for three or 
four years reported weaker symptoms of the grass-pollen allergy 
three years after stopping the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may never relapse into symptoms as severe as what they  
had originally,'' said Samantha Walker, one of the study's authors. 
``In carefully selected patients, this form of treatment is 
extremely effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The research is reported in Thursday's edition of The New  
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The British researchers asked patients to keep detailed diaries  
of their hay fever symptoms in 1993, '94 and '95. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found little difference between the severity of  
symptoms reported by patients who had continued allergy-shot 
treatment during the three-year trial and those who got dummy 
shots. Those who had never had immunotherapy reported much more 
severe symptoms than the others. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also found that the immune systems of the  
patients who discontinued treatment produced less of the 
allergen-fighting substances that cause runny noses and other hay 
fever symptoms than the untreated group. Those who maintained 
allergy-shot treatment had even fewer of those symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the clearest demonstration of a long-term effect of  
immunotherapy that I'm aware of,'' said Dr. Marshall Plaut, chief 
of the Allergic Mechanisms Section at the National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said their findings and other studies suggest  
that starting immunotherapy sooner after an allergy appears, 
particularly in children, could prevent the allergy from becoming 
severe and prevent development of additional allergies. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may lower the bar for me to start people a little earlier  
on immunotherapy,'' said Dr. Leonard Bielory, director of the 
Asthma and Allergy Research Center at the University of Medicine 
and Dentistry of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 20 percent of people in the United States and northern  
Europe have hay fever. Allergy shots were the primary treatment 
until the 1940s, when antihistamine medications were introduced, 
but the shots are still widely used.

<HEADLINE> Red Hat Shares Soar in IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Red Hat Inc. shares nearly quadrupled in their  
first day of trading Wednesday, underscoring investor confidence in 
the upstart Linux operating software and shunning rampant market 
pessimism toward initial public offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	The warm investor reception toward Durham, N.C.-based Red Hat,  
the first Linux-only company to go public, is expected to trigger 
more IPOs by companies promoting the operating system as an 
alternative to Unix and Windows NT for running business computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat closed at $52.06 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market after being  
initially priced at $14 and opening at $46. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the biggest price leap in at least two weeks among IPOs,  
which recently have hit a wall of investor nervousness about small, 
money-losing companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Its share price Wednesday gives Red Hat a staggering market  
value of $3.8 billion -- even though Red Hat had sales of just $11 
million and lost money last year -- a seeming return to the gigantic 
valuations investors showered on Internet stocks before the recent 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat sold 6 million shares to raise $84 million for spending  
on its Web site, software development and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a phenomenal opening, just given the current market  
conditions,'' said Paul Bard, an analyst with Renaissance Capital 
Corp., a Greenwich, Conn., IPO research firm that also operates a 
mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Bard said demand appeared to be heightened by scores of  
volunteer Linux programmers who got the word out about the IPO over 
the Internet and who comprised some of the investors as well. In 
addition, investors generally are willing to pay a premium for 
companies that are first to market in their industry sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Linux-only company expected to come to market is VA  
Linux Systems Inc., a maker of business computers that come 
pre-loaded with Linux software. 
</P>
<P>
	More typical of this week's IPO market was Blockbuster Inc., the  
big video-rental chain, whose shares barely budged from their 
offering price Wednesday amid investor concern that new media will 
doom the video-rental business over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Blockbuster, which priced at $15, closed at $15 after  
hitting a high of $15.06 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	While many IPOs issued earlier this year enjoyed heady gains in  
their first day of trading, more recent IPOs have risen only 
slightly -- or even dropped in price. The last time an IPO had a 
similar jump to Red Hat was back on July 28, when shares of 
drugstore.com nearly tripled. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux was created in the early 1990s by Linus Torvalds, a  
Finnish student who released his blueprints over the Internet so 
programmers around the world could contribute improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Linux can be downloaded for free off the Web or bought in  
packages with technical support for as little as $30. A growing 
minority of corporate technology workers are embracing Linux as an 
adjunct -- if not an alternative -- to the Unix and Windows NT 
computers at the hub of networks of business machines, and on 
computers that run Web sites.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: L.A. Tragedy Disturbing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Wednesday it is  
``deeply disturbing'' to think that the shootings at the Los 
Angeles Jewish center were motivated by religious hatred. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did not offer specifics but alluded to reports linking  
the suspected gunman, Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., and the white 
supremacist group The Order. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have heard about the suspect and his motives is deeply  
disturbing. Nothing could be further from the values we honor here 
today,'' Clinton said during a ceremony to bestow the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom on former President Gerald Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that Furrow had turned himself in, Clinton thanked law  
enforcement officials who ``quickly responded to the crime, 
identified the suspect and kept the pressure on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only hope that this latest incident will intensify our  
resolve to make America a safer place, and a place of healing 
across the lines that divide us,'' Clinton said. He also again 
expressed sympathies for the victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said she was concerned about  
the five people wounded in the shooting -- four of whom were 
children ages 5 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``When children are the victims of gun violence, it shocks the  
conscience of our nation,'' she said. ``There is no place for 
violence or intolerance in our country and it is urgent we address 
these issues now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton last week reiterated his appeal to Congress to pass a  
hate crimes bill that would make it easier for the Justice 
Department to investigate and prosecute such offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved the measure last month and added it to a  
still pending spending bill. The House Judiciary Committee held a 
hearing on the measure last week. Critics say a federal law is 
unnecessary since states prosecute hate crimes.

<HEADLINE> Southwest Airlines CEO Has Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Herb Kelleher, the flamboyant chief executive of  
Southwest Airlines, said Wednesday that he has prostate cancer, 
which his doctor said was caught in the early stages. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher, 68, who pioneered no-frills, low-cost air service and  
built Southwest into one of the country's top airlines, began 
radiation treatment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts were reassured by an upbeat prognosis from doctors,  
though they remain concerned about who will succeed the colorful, 
68-year-old executive. Kelleher relishes his image as a 
heavy-smoking workaholic with a penchant for Wild Turkey bourbon 
and an evangelical zeal for a friendly workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as he can hold a shot glass, I want him running this  
airline, and so does every Southwest shareholder,'' said Glenn 
Engel, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. ``The day when it appears 
Herb is mortal, then Southwest's stock will go down more than it 
did today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas-based Southwest's stock dropped 12 1/2 cents to $16.37 1/2 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange after dropping as much as 
$1.06 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher displayed his characteristic humor and loud, cackling  
laugh during a half-hour conference call with reporters in which he 
said his ``mundane, routine'' case of prostate cancer would not 
interfere with his ability to run the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher said cancer was suspected after a routine physical exam  
about a month ago and subsequently confirmed by an antigen test and 
biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	He will undergo radiation therapy every weekday at M.D. Anderson  
Cancer Center in Houston -- commuting from his office in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach, director of the prostate cancer  
program at the hospital, said the cancer was discovered early and 
is in a mild stage of development. He said Kelleher is expected 
``to lead a fully active and productive life, just as if he had 
never had prostate cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among American  
men, after skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates 
179,300 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in the 
United States this year, and about 37,000 men will die of this 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher said he received an otherwise clean bill of health from  
doctors and doesn't plan to make any changes in his lifestyle, 
although doctors urged him to quit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them, 'Well, that's something I'll consider after these  
treatments are concluded,' '' Kelleher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some stockholders have complained about Kelleher's smoking and  
questioned whether the company has an adequate succession plan for 
the man who helped found the airline in 1971. Kelleher dismissed 
the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no need to update any succession plan because our  
board discusses that issue on a regular basis,'' said Kelleher, 
whose contract runs through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	James Higgins, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,  
said Southwestern has ``a deep bench'' of executives capable of 
replacing Kelleher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether they have his personality and his visceral  
understanding of labor relations is another question,'' Higgins 
added. ``He is an impossible act to follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candace Browning of Merrill Lynch praised Kelleher for not  
anointing an heir apparent, saying that other talented executives 
who were not tapped might have left the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher, a lawyer from San Antonio who started the airline with  
one of his clients, was named chairman in 1978 and assumed titles 
of president and CEO in 1981. His spirited leadership -- including 
dressing up as Elvis, a leprechaun and a cross-dressing male nurse 
-- are part of the fabric at a company known for high customer 
satisfaction. Fortune magazine named it the country's most admired 
airline, and, this year, the best place to work in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest is the nation's seventh largest airline in terms of  
revenue, though the fourth-largest carrier in terms of number of 
passengers. It operates more than 2,450 flights a day, many of them 
less than 500 miles, and has more than 28,000 employees.

<HEADLINE> Nancy Reagan Dismisses Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former President Ronald Reagan is in slow  
decline from Alzheimer's disease, but there has been no sudden 
change in his condition, Nancy Reagan said Wednesday in an effort 
to put to rest rumors that he is near death. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rumors are absolutely false,'' Nancy Reagan said in a  
statement read to The Associated Press by the Reagans' spokeswoman, 
Joanne Drake. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Reagan suffers from Alzheimer's, a progressive  
disease. However, there has been no dramatic change in his 
condition that would be cause for the alarming rumors that we are 
hearing,'' Mrs. Reagan said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that people would be more sensitive than this to the  
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about Reagan's health have been swirling for weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. News &AMP; World Report item, published Monday, quoted  
unidentified sources as saying said Reagan representatives have 
talked about logistics for a state funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Tuesday, an e-mail attachment appeared with some  
versions of the California Senate Republican Caucus daily briefing 
distributed by state Sen. James Brulte, a Republican from Rancho 
Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rumors from newsrooms are that Ronald Reagan's health is  
fading and he is on a 36-hour death watch,'' the briefing said. 
</P>
<P>
	A staffer in the office of state Sen. John Lewis, an Orange  
County Republican, attached the e-mail item to another briefing, 
which was distributed to yet another list of people, Brulte said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the rumors spread through California GOP circles late  
Tuesday, Reagan was enjoying a scoop of sorbet outside Brentwood's 
Haagen-Dazs ice cream shop, manager Abbas Malik said. A Secret 
Service agent purchased the treat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just saw him the other day and he's fine. Quit scaring the  
family,'' son Michael Reagan said. ``My kids have to deal with it. 
People come up to them and they ask me if something's wrong with 
grandpa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan, who disclosed in 1994 that he had the incurable brain  
disorder, now makes weekly appearances at his Century City office 
rather than the daily regimen he had maintained since leaving the 
White House, Ms. Drake said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 88 years old and he maintains as physically active a  
schedule as possible,'' Ms. Drake said. That includes frequent 
Venice beach walks and park visits to watch sporting events, she 
said. On Monday, he swam in his pool at home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was late for an appointment the other day with me at home  
because he got up early and went down to watch some kids fly model 
airplanes,'' Michael Reagan said. ``I'm going to see him tomorrow. 
He's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ronald Peterson of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.,  
visited with Reagan in March and described his condition in a July 
appearance on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is gradually declining with respect to various  
functions. He's having the difficulties most patients have with 
Alzheimer's disease,'' Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average lifespan of someone with Alzheimer's is eight years  
after the disease is diagnosed, but some people live 20 years or 
longer, according to the Chicago-based Alzheimer's Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Four million Americans have the degenerative disease of the  
brain, which attacks memory and eventually leads to total 
dependency on others for help in everyday needs such as eating and 
bathing. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease affects people in different ways, association  
spokesman Danny Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are vulnerable to a lot of things,'' Chung said. ``Your  
body becomes susceptible to pneumonia and other complications.''

<HEADLINE> Dolphins: Webb May Miss NFL Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Seven-time Pro Bowl tackle Richmond Webb may  
miss the start of the Miami Dolphins season because of a contract 
stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson predicted that Webb will wait until  
just before the season to sign, meaning backup Brent Smith would 
start the opener Sept. 13 at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are totally prepared to go with Brent Smith,'' Johnson said  
Tuesday. ``I would guess Richmond won't come in until the week 
before the start of the season because he doesn't want to miss his 
paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that happens, he won't be ready. It would take him a few  
weeks at least to get ready to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans such as Webb earn $800 per week during the preseason  
and don't begin collecting their salaries until the first week of 
the season. The Dolphins have offered Webb a one-year, $3.4 million 
deal, meaning each game missed would cost him more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb has missed 12 days of training camp and two scrimmages. His  
agent, Steve Zucker, declined to comment Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 10  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, on double standards:  
</P>
<P>
	Ethics and professional standards aren't what they used to be.  
</P>
<P>
	Contrast the American Bar Association's response to cases of  
presidential misconduct involving Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, a year before Nixon left office under threat of  
impeachment, the bar association adopted a resolution condemning 
him and his colleagues for their role in the Watergate scandal and 
called for swift disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast forward to just a couple weeks ago. U.S. District Judge  
Susan Webber Wright orders Clinton to pay more than $90,000 in 
contempt-of-court sanctions for lying under oath during his 
deposition in the Paula Jones case. The bar's response: Come 
address our annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
	So the question is, have the legal profession's standards  
plummeted that much, or are there two set of standards -- one for 
liberals and one for all the rest? 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 6  
</P>
<P>
	Houston Chronicle, on paying down national debt:  
</P>
<P>
	The hyperbole and gamesmanship in the debate over tax cuts and  
the supposed federal budget surplus have been rampant. 
</P>
<P>
	We have argued, long and repeatedly, that a more productive  
approach would be to apply some of the speculative ``surplus'' to 
saving Medicare and Social Security and using the rest to pay down 
the monstrous $3.6 trillion federal debt, which requires hundreds 
of millions of dollars each year just to service. 
</P>
<P>
	Some prefer spending the excess money. Others are stuck on the  
argument that the tax money should be returned to the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	The truth is, we all ran up the national debt together. We all  
continue to pay interest on it. And we are in danger of just 
passing it on to our children and grandchildren. Shame on us. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, we should consider it largely the cost of  
waging a war -- the Cold War -- that we fortunately won and now must 
pay for. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 6  
</P>
<P>
	The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer, on KKK rally:  
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Police Patrolman's Association has won an  
at-least-temporary legal victory in its effort to keep the Ku Klux 
Klan from using the Justice Center garage as a staging area for its 
Aug. 21 rally. But that victory is not one against racism or 
intolerance. It is merely a tactical political triumph over Mayor 
Michael R. White. And if the court ruling is not reversed, the 
likely result is to heighten the danger of violence during the 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	White has proposed using the garage as a dressing area not  
because he wants to promote the Klan's message, as police 
protesters ridiculously allege, but because it is the best way for 
authorities to keep the hate group under control during its short 
visit to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	We once again appeal to all parties in this issue to stop  
tossing matches in streets already knee-deep in racial tinder. The 
evidently irresistible urge to play politics with the Klan's visit 
already has put everyone on edge and threatens to turn what ought 
to be a community celebration of the Browns' return into an ugly 
confrontation. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 5.  
</P>
<P>
	The Post and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on Zapruder film:  
</P>
<P>
	The federal arbitration panel's decision on the value of the  
famed Zapruder film showing the assassination of President John F. 
Kennedy is a stunner: $16 million for a 26-second segment of 
celluloid that is too fragile to run through a projector. The panel 
appears to have confused the importance of the event with the 
importance of an artifact that already has been duplicated a 
multitude of times. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the panel's 2-1 vote can't be appealed since the  
arbitration process was agreed upon as a way to settle its value 
after the film was declared a permanent possession of the 
government by the federal Assassination Records Review Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zapruder family had sold the film previously to Life  
Magazine following the assassination in 1963 and then bought it 
back 12 years later for $1, according to the Houston Chronicle. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Auction house experts who testified before the panel estimated  
the value of the film between $1 million and $25 million. The 
Zapruders wanted $30 million; the government offered $1 million. 
The arbitration panel split the difference, more or less. Too bad 
the government couldn't have given it back and kept a copy. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 5  
</P>
<P>
	The Stuart (Fla.) News, on toddlers and television:  
</P>
<P>
	Even if the American Academy of Pediatrics had never uttered a  
syllable on the subject, many parents would have figured out for 
themselves that too much TV is bad for their children. But many 
might not have concluded that children under 2 should be kept from 
the tube entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	The pediatricians say so, however, and while they cannot  
demonstrate definitively that damage is done by such early viewing, 
they do make the interesting case that a blaring, nearby TV could 
keep these infants and toddlers from what counts far more in their 
development -- face-to-face interaction with their parents and other 
caring adults. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Television can affect attitudes and breed habits of passivity.  
It clearly can have psychological, physical and societal 
consequences, as the pediatricians claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Television is a fact of life in our times, and in some families,  
its regulation obviously can be difficult. ... But aiming to 
control the watching of TV by children is a good idea for parents, 
and the American Academy of Pediatrics deserves credit for saying 
so. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 7  
</P>
<P>
	The Intelligencer, Wheeling, W.Va., on playgrounds:  
</P>
<P>
	Playgrounds today feature a lot of really neat structures for  
kids, with all manner of things to climb, slide on and crawl 
through. Some of it is fun enough to make an adult want to elbow a 
6-year-old to one side and get at it. But amid all this updating of 
playgrounds, you may not have noticed that some old childhood 
favorites have disappeared. Teeter-totters, for example, are 
particularly hard to find, the Associated Press reports. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It seems that kids sometimes fall off teeter-totters and get  
hurt, or -- not that we ever did such things -- some dirty rotten 
kids will play tricks like jumping of the teeter-totter when the 
other kid is raised up high. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern every-complaint-deserves-a-lawsuit America being what it  
is, what used to cause a few tears and -- okay, we'll admit it -- 
perhaps some cruel laughter, now generates lawsuits and fat 
contingent fees for lawsuit lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety advocates of the sort who believe in their hearts that  
all risk should be removed no matter the expense say this is a good 
thing. Playgrounds undoubtedly are safer. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet something of the fun and adventure of childhood has been  
lost. Kids, after all, want -- whether it really makes sense at the 
moment or not -- to test their limits and see what they can do at 
play. They'll always want to climb higher, run faster and whatnot -- 
and some number of kids always will get hurt. Hard lessons are part 
of the way we learn. ...

	Daily Freeman, Kingston, N.Y., on late state budget:  
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to state government, words occasionally fail us.  
</P>
<P>
	We scratch our heads and stroke our chins looking for just the  
right one to describe in polite company what passes as public 
service in Albany. The well nearly runs dry. 
</P>
<P>
	For today, ``shameless'' will have to do. ...  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, after finally putting the finishing touches on a  
budget, nearly the latest adopted in state history, the Capitol's 
Big Three -- Gov. George Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, 
D-Manhattan, and Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, R-Brunswick -- 
virtually tripped over each other to declare how well they'd done. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in the hours just before and after legislative  
approval of the spending plan, fax machines in newsrooms all over 
the state were humming with press releases from local assemblymen 
and senators, all eager to brag about money they'd helped steer to 
various hometown district projects. ... 
</P>
<P>
	All this for a four-month-tardy budget that is the product of  
one of the most politically charged systems in the country, a 
budget that again set back the state's credit rating and a budget 
that caused uncertainty and fear among countless constituencies, 
particularly non-profits and the education community. ...

	Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal, on new rules governing private  
mailboxes: 
</P>
<P>
	Because the U.S. Postal Service has received more than 600  
complaints and questions since its revised private mailbox rules 
were announced in April, it is putting off their effective date 
from this fall to next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a wise move that will not only give private mailbox  
renters a chance to use up their old stationery, but may give the 
public time to see that the rules make sense for consumers and 
businesses alike. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules require an identifier in the address for private  
boxes, verification of renter identity and, importantly, also give 
the Postal Service time to make sure privacy is maintained for 
private box holders. 
</P>
<P>
	Most needed is the rule that vendors require photo  
identification of applicants. If a customer can't comply, the 
commercial mailer cannot rent that person a box. U.S. Post Offices 
already do this with box applicants. 
</P>
<P>
	The other contentious issue is the requirement that ``PMB'' (for  
``private mailbox'') be affixed to the address of everyone using 
such a box. Critics claim ``PMB'' carries a stigma, mainly because 
the rules were first announced in tandem with a call for curbing 
mail fraud. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Unclear, however, is who will have access to the box renter's  
application information, including the renter's home address. This 
is a critical question the Postal Service says it will clear up 
between now and next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The USPS says it will appoint a task force to ensure only law  
enforcement agencies and those with a court order can get that 
personal information. This must be done.

	Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Russian President Boris Yeltsin:  
</P>
<P>
	Russia's President Boris Yeltsin must enjoy starting a week with  
draconian personnel change. This week, he fired his prime minister, 
Sergei Stepashin, who had just been appointed in May. Stepashin's 
tenure lasted only three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander Lebed, governor of Krasnoyarsk, made the glib  
observation that the reason Yeltsin's subordinates are so bad that 
they have to be removed from office one after another is because 
their boss himself is so bad. It is indeed extraordinary to go 
through five prime ministers in just a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin named Vladmir Putin, director of the Federal Security  
Service and secretary of the Security Council, as prime minister. 
... Yeltsin has thus surrounded himself with men who have made 
their careers in security or political police administration. If 
they are respected not for their political and managerial prowess, 
but for their inclination to take control of government machinery 
as the president wants, there cannot be much hope of their 
injecting new vigor into the Russian government. Yeltsin, in poor 
health, seems to presume that the decisive power of his authority 
comes from the way he demonstrates it by shuffling personnel. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 10  
</P>
<P>
	La Stampa, Turin, Italy, on Boris Yeltsin:  
</P>
<P>
	Boris Yeltsin's imagination seems boundless. Less than three  
months after dismissing Yevgeny Primakov and nominating Sergei 
Stepashin, Yeltsin is now replacing Stepashin with the even 
less-known Vladimir Putin whom he has touted as future president. 
It seems farcical that the Russian people -- only two percent of 
whom opinion polls show support the President -- have no choice 
other than to accept Yeltsin's protege. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's objective seems to avoid elections altogether, and in  
spite of this strategy's inherent dangers, the Kremlin seems to 
think that it's less dangerous than losing an election. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet now an even greater danger lurks. Moscow's governor, Yuri  
Luzhkov, has formed an alliance with powerful regional leaders. 
This cartel can expect the support of the most popular man in 
Russia, Yevgeny Primakov. Boris Yeltsin has nobody to stand with 
him in opposition to this party, besides himself and Vladimir 
Putin. It seems that that won't be enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, Russia has many problems, but its most pressing one is  
an inability to free itself peacefully from Czar Boris and his 
``Family.'' Yet the White House still assures, ``For us, this 
changes nothing.''

</P>
<P>
	Other families have daft old men who are a constant source of  
embarrassment. But the Windsors' one is turning into a particularly 
unsavory example of the breed. 
</P>
<P>
	We have tolerated Prince Philip's countless gaffes over the  
years because he is the queen's husband. But his more recent antics 
go beyond a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	He has insulted the Scots, Chinese and Hungarians, the grieving  
parents of Dunblane and the deaf. Yesterday he surpassed himself 
with an outrageous slur on Indians, insinuating they can only make 
poor quality fuse boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	It was so offensive even by Philip's standards that he had to  
issue a rare apology. But that is not good enough. Philip has been 
dropping the queen in it for too long and dragging down the 
reputation of the royal family as he does so. ... 
</P>
<P>
	He may well have been a loyal and trusty consort to her majesty,  
and he may well have performed many selfless acts of charity. But 
the truth is his behavior has become a liability at a time when the 
monarchy needs to modernize and move with the times. ...

tactless, off-the-cuff remarks, But his latest, that a fuse box in 
a hi-tech electronics company looked as if it had been ``put in by 
an Indian,'' is a gaffe too far. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he has left it to a Buckingham Palace spokesman to do his  
dirty work and apologize on his behalf. If the duke was made to eat 
humble pie in person, it might drive home the offense his comments 
cause.

<P>
	Japan's Asian neighbors will be watching very carefully to see  
that a stronger national self-confidence doesn't turn into a new 
nationalism or even militarism. So far there is no weighty sign of 
that. But Japan has to continue to promote trust in its peaceful 
intentions, above all because it has so far dodged a convincing 
coming-to-terms with its militaristic past.

	El Pais, Madrid, on Pinochet extradition to Spain:  
</P>
<P>
	The Chilean government proposal presented to the Spanish  
government for (resolving the Pinochet extradition case through) 
friendly arbitration would avoid the handing over of the dictator 
(to Spain) to face charges. ... 
</P>
<P>
	... Any negotiated way out (of the Pinochet case) that is not  
based in the courts would have incalculable consequences for the 
defense of human rights. Apart from mocking the memory of the 
victims, a hypothetical settlement between governments would open 
an uncontrollable escape route for present or future perpetrators 
of torture or genocide, sheltered by the highest levels of the 
state and protected in their respective countries by laws that give 
them immunity. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Many countries have the means to pressure others and Chile,  
undoubtedly, can pressure Spain. But higher values must also be 
weighed, the most important being the principle that those 
responsible for committing crimes against humanity should face 
justice.

	The Straits Times, Singapore, on rebuilding Balkans:  
</P>
<P>
	The Sarajevo postscript to the destruction of Yugoslavia has a  
rich irony not lost on fair-minded people. In a meeting in the 
Bosnian capital on July 30, the United States and its allies in the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization resolved that, having bombed 
part of the Balkans to near oblivion, they will spend billions to 
rebuild the region. Do not even ask where the money is to come 
from. 
</P>
<P>
	What should be asked is whether, in humanitarian terms, this is  
not a grotesque distortion. Speaking of the genocide and famine in 
Africa which have displaced four million people compared with 
Kosovo's 850,000, the United Nations' two principals for refugees 
and human rights, Mrs. Sadako Ogata and Mrs. Mary Robinson, have on 
accasion decried the inattention paid that continent. To little 
avail. The Balkans are just the newest edition of selective 
recompense. Why? Is this Judeo-Christian triumphalism? 
Afro-compassion is out of vogue? Political expediency? Sadly, 
nobody wants to know.

	Der Bund, Bern, Switzerland, on crisis in Belgium:  
</P>
<P>
	Belgium's new prime minister, Guy Verhofstadt, is really not to  
be envied. He had barely taken office before he had to struggle 
with the unpleasant traces of dioxin which the cabinet of his 
predecessor Jean-Luc Dehaene had left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The domestic farming industry is complaining of a dramatic loss  
of sales and is demanding, in spite of empty state coffers, 
financial assistance and the relaxation of expensive regulations on 
meat. Conversely, skepticism is increasing in other countries 
towards Belgium's meat production: its EU partners are only 
prepared to import Belgian food with strict controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Maneuvering between the demands of the domestic cattle industry  
and the legitimate concerns of the neighboring countries, the new 
government is skidding hopelessly out of control. Brussels has 
apparently learnt nothing from the mistakes of the past: with its 
muddling, amateurish information policy, the coalition has 
increased the mistrust in other countries even more. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Hope for an improvement in the Belgian patient has evaporated  
for the moment. With his inconsistent crisis management, 
Verhofstadt is muddling his way through the dioxin scandal in the 
same manner that led to the downfall of his predecessor Dehaene.

	The Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald, on Aboriginal  
Australians: 
</P>
<P>
	When world attention focuses on Australia before and during the  
Sydney Olympics next year, international interest in the position 
of Aboriginal Australians will intensify. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the story almost every foreign newspaper, magazine or  
television network will want to explore, raising the specter of 
possible Aborigine-inspired boycott action. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, barely a year away, Aboriginal leaders are talking not of  
boycott but a more subtle strategy -- that of shaming Australian 
governments in the eyes of the world for their mistreatment and 
neglect of Aborigines. 
</P>
<P>
	This strategy will anger many Australians but such anger is not  
only futile but misdirected. 
</P>
<P>
	If international scrutiny shames white Australia into necessary  
reappraisal of flawed policies, well and good. If it also sharpens 
Aboriginal leaders' understanding of the need for greater efforts 
on their part, even better.

<HEADLINE> Happyanunoit Wins Palomar Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- Happyanunoit, a 13-1 longshot, took the  
lead midway through the stretch and held off 3-5 favorite Tuzla by 
a length to win today's $134,750 Palomar Handicap at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Brice Blanc and carrying 113 pounds, Happyanunoit  
covered 1 1-16 miles on turf in a stakes-record 1:41 1-5 and paid 
$28.80, $5.60 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	The race went from one mile on turf to 1 1-16 miles in 1988.  
</P>
<P>
	The fifth victory in nine lifetime starts for the New  
Zealand-bred Happyanunoit was worth $68,750. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuzla, ridden by Corey Nakatani and carrying 123 pounds, crossed  
the finish line a half-length in front of Isle De France and 
returned $2.40 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuzla won the race last year in 1:42 1-5.  
</P>
<P>
	Isle De France, ridden by Chris McCarron and carrying 118

<HEADLINE> Glitz Winning in Iowa Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- It's glitz thinly disguised as politics, where  
NBA star Karl Malone is as big a draw as those who would be the 
next leader of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	For those not attracted to sports, how about a concert with the  
likes of crooner Vic Damone or pianist Roger Williams? Outdoor 
enthusiasts can choose between skeet shooting and bass fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all happening, appropriately enough, under giant circus  
tents. Glitz and politics, it seems, have collided in the Iowa 
Straw Poll -- and glitz has taken an early lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has taken on a life of its own,'' sighed Sara Miller,  
Finance Director of the Iowa Republican Party and an organizer of 
Saturday's doings. 
</P>
<P>
	Straw polls have been a staple of Iowa politics for the better  
part of 25 years, but none have approached this year's edition. 
There isn't a bus to be had anywhere in the state, and the same 
thing holds true for golf carts. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't even think about renting a tent.  
</P>
<P>
	``The party rental places are pretty well cleaned out,'' Miller  
said. Caterers will make out about as well as Republicans, who will 
collect $25 for every vote cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine contenders for the Republican presidential nomination are  
headed for Ames, and most are throwing lavish parties for backers, 
organizing legions of buses to truck backers into town for the day 
and fighting for attention from the 600 or so journalists signed up 
to chronicle the event. That's three times the number of reporters 
who accompanied the president and first lady to Africa in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa event picked up additional steam when Texas Gov. George  
W. Bush, the overwhelming front-runner, said he'd not only compete 
but play to win. ``The Bush people really raised the bar on this 
thing,'' said Bob Haus, an organizer for publisher Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	With that, things spun happily out of control.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been hyped to the point where you'd think the election  
was this Saturday,'' said former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not a party without some entertainment, and the Iowa State  
Center at Iowa State University will be as much concert as 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander is bringing in country  
star Crystal Gayle to croon for backers munching on barbecue. 
``We've got baby back ribs,'' said aide David Kochel. Pork, of 
course. There's a hog industry crisis going on. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch promises the Osmond Brothers, Williams and  
Damone, in a concert clearly designed with baby boomers in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is leaning toward the athletic, with a touch of salsa, a  
natural for a candidate courting Hispanics. Former pro football 
star Roger Staubach and pro basketball star Sean Elliot will be on 
hand, but the big local draw is retired University of Iowa football 
coach Hayden Fry, a very popular transplanted Texan. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to be outdone, Hatch is bringing in Malone, the Utah Jazz  
star. 
</P>
<P>
	A string of salsa bands will enliven the Bush tent. Politicians  
will be heading for the Bush tent in a motorcycle parade headed by 
Colorado Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Wisconsin Gov. Tommy 
Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ames is a mid-sized college town of 47,000 with all the usual  
amenities, but forget about renting a hotel room there. Folks are 
being shipped 30 miles away to Des Moines to find a room. 
</P>
<P>
	Some resources are getting strained. The various campaigns  
really have rented all the available buses in Iowa, and there are 
no golf carts available because the 300 or so volunteers will be 
buzzing around the grounds on their electric wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	The best guess is about 15,000 activists will be on hand, and  
there'll be plenty of politicos mingling with the entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole aide Monte Shaw insisted that they're playing things  
low-key. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not bringing in any quote, unquote stars,'' he said.  
``We've got real people showing up to help a real candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of the candidates are being tight-lipped about their  
spending, but it's huge. Rumor has it Bush has leased more than 100 
buses and the phone banks in most of the campaigns have been 
humming for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	There is time for perspective, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Just down the road in Des Moines, the Iowa State Fair opens this  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking a million people and 400 acres and 15,000  
vehicles,'' said marketing director Kathie Swift. ``I think it 
would be somewhat bigger than those concerns, not to demean those 
concerns.''

<HEADLINE> Web Sites' Price That Can't Be Beat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Adam Prentice, a Web entrepreneur working out of his home in  
Ottawa, Canada, has hit on the perfect price for the 1,000 products 
listed on his Internet site: Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Called Totallyfreestuff.com, his Web destination links visitors  
to give-aways on hundreds of other sites, ranging from beef jerky 
to bath soap to pantyhose. Yet despite a lack of pricetags, he says 
his business is expected to take in $70,000 in U.S. dollars this 
year, thanks to advertising sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's doing alright,'' said Prentice, 25, who quit his  
technical support job for Compaq Computer Corp. last year to focus 
full-time on his Web venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice has good company: Giving away stuff on the Internet is  
big business. Spurred by intense competition for Web surfers, the 
occasional come-on of a few years ago has exploded into an 
essential commercial strategy -- key to drawing visitors to Internet 
sites, stoking interest in for-fee products and getting online 
businesses off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great time to be a consumer,'' said Carl Steidtmann,  
chief economist at the PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP consulting firm. 
``The price of everything is coming down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind just software and e-mail services. Like winners of a  
giant shopping spree, consumers can find items in Web categories 
stretching from technology to entertainment. Though figures on 
total Internet freebies were not available, a recent search looking 
for ``free'' and ``give-away'' on AltaVista, itself a free search 
service, reveals 1,142,840 Web pages with both words. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch is that some free sites require bargain hunters to  
look at advertisements, give up personal information to marketers, 
or buy related products. 
</P>
<P>
	But the offerings are clearly alluring.  
</P>
<P>
	There are music downloads, pornography and videos. There are  
desktop themes to jazz up any computer screen, animated greeting 
cards and a missing-person people finder. There are even free 
jokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Freemania.net, one of dozens of Web sites that lists only free  
stuff, includes a product called FreeDrive, which gives on-the-go 
computer users storage space on the Internet, easier than 
transporting files in floppy disks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hungry? Troll around a Web site devoted to giveaways, and find  
herbal tea, chocolate, and even gourmet chocolate chip-oatmeal 
cookies ($1 shipping and handling not included). 
</P>
<P>
	Oh yeah, you could be using free Internet access, or even a free  
personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, businesses always have given away items to try to  
stoke demand, especially in the early stages of an industry. Like 
researchers experimenting in a laboratory, companies try different 
formulas to see which work best to make money and build markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very old model of marketing. It goes back to Gillette  
giving away razors in order to sell blades,'' Steidtmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	But while give-aways are typical of young, competitive  
industries, the nature of technology and the Internet has greatly 
escalated this tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	For one, the broad reach of the Internet has vastly eased  
people's ability to get the freebies. It used to be you had to trek 
down the bank to get a free toaster. Now you simply click your way 
to a Web site and wait for the mailman to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
	That pervasiveness is spurring businesspeople such as Prentice  
to try to get bargain-hunters to observe paid advertisements on 
sites or purchase something else during visits. Some businesses, 
like the online magazine Slate, tried charging but later changed 
their minds. After abandoning paid subscriptions in February, the 
Microsoft-owned Web site says it saw monthly visitors nearly 
quintuple to 1 million as it brought in more than $2 million in new 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Still other businesses give away software and services to lure  
visitors to buy a premium version of the freebie. 
</P>
<P>
	EFax.com, for instance, offered a free service last February  
that lets people receive faxes as e-mail attachments, so they can 
open them up on their computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
	But after signing up nearly 1 million people, the company  
recently started selling a premium version of the service, which 
lets people do the reverse -- send an e-mail attachment as a fax. 
The cost is $2.95 a month, plus 5 cents for every 30 seconds of 
faxing. EFax.com vice president of marketing Ron Brown says the 
company so far has signed up 14,000 paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The free service ``is an important part of building revenue for  
our business,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's another reason Web businesses are giving away the store.  
</P>
<P>
	In technology, unlike other industries, prices of parts  
routinely drop. Because computer chips and hard-disk drives cheapen 
every year, for instance, the cost of giving away the PC is less 
than ever, making it a cost-effective marketing tool to sell 
services, such as Internet access. That's why several makers of 
computers were able to join with providers of Internet service this 
summer to offer free PCs to people who agree to buy up to three 
years of Web access for at least $700. 
</P>
<P>
	Conversely, Dell Computer Corp. is offering a year of free  
Internet access to people who buy its $959 desktop computer (not 
including a monitor). 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on the Web, businesses are willing to trade their  
products for what they view as an even more valuable currency: 
personal information about potential customers, from buying habits 
to addresses, that lets sellers precisely pinpoint potential 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Database software running on powerful computers enables  
companies to easily match the traits of millions of consumers with 
products they may like -- and possibly sell the information to third 
parties eager for customer data. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, that's a big catch for consumers -- the willingness to  
subject oneself to advertisements. FreePC gives away computers with 
free online access to select, high-income consumers who agree to 
fill out lengthy questionnaires covering who they are, their 
incomes and shopping habits. ZapMe!, a Silicon Valley company, 
gives schools free computers and Internet access in exchange for 
the right to display a constant stream of on-screen advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	Other freebies seem more like come-ons.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, many trial promotions on the Internet, such as a  
free week's ``membership'' to a pornography site, place the onus on 
consumers to cancel the order before it turns into a for-fee 
subscription. To sign up for the offer, the user needs to enter a 
credit-card number to show he is 18 years or older. But sheer 
inertia can keep bargain-hunters from actually canceling. 
</P>
<P>
	While the ``free era'' is arguably good for savvy businesses, it  
could harm others. 
</P>
<P>
	Encyclopaedia Britannica's sales have fallen by more than 50  
percent since 1990, after Microsoft began giving away its CD-ROM 
encyclopedia, Encarta, to personal computer buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other losers include salespeople, such as investment brokers who  
have seen their commissions whither as more people join the rush to 
trade stocks online at discounted prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Enjoy the bargains while they last. As Web carrots work their  
magic -- the number of wired U.S. households will nearly double to 
67 million in 2003 from 35 million today, predicts Jupiter 
Communications -- businesses will start charging for what used to be 
free. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet of tomorrow will continue to contain free things,  
but expect more sites to start charging for the most useful 
information. For example, an everyday leisure seeker might freely 
browse for information on skin diving, but an aficionado may have 
to pay for getting specific information. Some Web sites run by 
newspapers provide today's news for free, but charge for older 
articles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the Internet is more popular, people will know the sites  
and they won't have as much of a need to give away stuff,'' says 
Prentice, the Totallyfreestuff.com owner. 
</P>
<P>
	But it may not be a great loss, he adds. ``It's not like you can  
live off the free items. They just give you a taste of the products 
you like.''

<HEADLINE> Browns' RB Still Has His Playbook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Running back Terry Kirby had some personal  
belongings stolen. Not the Cleveland Browns' secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby's sports utility vehicle was broken into Monday night  
outside Fawcett Stadium in Canton, Ohio, while the Browns were 
playing the Dallas Cowboys in the Hall of Fame Game. 
</P>
<P>
	When a police report was filed, among the items listed as  
missing was the Browns' playbook, a thick, spiraled notebook which 
is about the size of the Cleveland phone directory. 
</P>
<P>
	But, as it turns out, the report was incorrect. A smaller  
notebook, containing some of the notes Kirby takes during team 
meetings was stolen, along with a DVD player, some clothes and a 
pair of Kirby's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't his playbook, it was his notebook,'' Browns coach  
Chris Palmer said. ``No, they didn't get the key to the castle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said his players are required to leave their playbooks at  
the Browns' training facility to guard against them getting lost or 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyway,'' Palmer said. ``It's so heavy, I don't think a lot of  
players would carry it with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said he wasn't concerned about what the thieves might  
have in their possession, and that Kirby would not be fined. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicle showed no sign of forced entry, according to a  
police report. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't nothing major,'' Kirby said. ``It was just broken  
into. Shoot, I was more upset my DVD player was taken.''

<HEADLINE> Rain Pulls Grains, Soybeans Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated Wednesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade as beneficial showers moved into Midwest 
growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	While rains across key growing states were expected to do little  
to reverse damaged caused by hot, dry weather over the past few 
weeks, some market participants believed the precipitation will 
slow the deterioration in crop conditions that has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers were expected in Illinois and Indiana, two key growing  
states that hold the most potential for yield loss, but forecasters 
predict rainfall totals will amount to less than an inch. Still, 
the moisture gave investors a chance to take a breather after a 
sharp rally in the past few sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices also fell as investors squared their positions in  
advance on Thursday's early morning release of the U.S. Agriculture 
Department's latest production estimate and demand reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 7 1/2 cents to $2.89 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 5 1/2 cents to $2.35 1/4 a bushel; December oats fell 
1/4 cent to $1.19 a bushel; November soybeans fell 7 1/4 cents to $4.86 1/4 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures were mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while feeder cattle were mixed. Pork futures were mostly 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .37 cent to 65.72 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .45 cent to 77.12 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose .62 cent to 54.37 cents a pound; February pork bellies 
fell .70 cent to 57.75 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Criticized in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- McDonald's Corp. has raised the eyebrows of  
Hong Kong government censors with a television ad that shows a 
woman loudly slapping her boyfriend in the crotch for stealing her 
French fries. 
</P>
<P>
	After being struck with a shopping bag, the man collapses in  
agony, clutching his groin. Some Hong Kong viewers were not amused. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the commercial was aired Aug. 1, eight people complained  
to the territory's censorship board, the Television and 
Entertainment Licensing Board, that ``the commercial has a bad 
theme and has bad influence on young people,'' said Mandy Au Yeung, 
the board's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The board is investigating and could warn or fine the two  
television stations that had broadcast the commercial, Au Yeung 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayee Tang, a McDonald's spokeswoman in Hong Kong, said the  
commercial was intended to show ``the kind of craving people could 
have for McDonald's French fries.'' The commercial targeted 
teen-agers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. fast food chain had not received any formal complaints,  
but was aware of public concerns after a viewer phoned the company, 
Tang said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concerns were around the slap. We had some big sound  
effects. Some thought that maybe it was too violent,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's started airing a new version Tuesday, which was  
edited to tone down the sound effect and cut some of the shots, 
Tang said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spot now only has one shot of a pained expression on the  
man's face and ends with the woman showing a ``cheeky but warm and 
sweet expression,'' Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Weighs Rival Draft Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's got to be one of the least politically  
popular proposals in years: reviving the draft to keep the military 
from losing its post-Cold War battle with attrition. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's just what some military-minded lawmakers are  
suggesting may be necessary if the services can't fill their ranks 
due to growing recruitment and re-enlistment shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon is dead set against any talk of reviving the draft,  
suggesting the 26-year-old all-volunteer force is a great success, 
despite current recruiting problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, just as talk is growing over whether to revive the  
draft, the House is prepared to take up legislation that would do 
just the opposite: terminate the Selective Service System. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress seems to be moving in two directions at once in this  
particular case,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon observed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dueling proposals underscore the attention Congress is  
giving to the issue of military readiness and the difficulties the 
services are having in recruiting and keeping people at a time of 
growing peacekeeping deployments and higher-paying private-sector 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	House Armed Services Chairman Floyd Spence, R-S.C., calls the  
military's recruiting and retention problem ``a desperate situation 
that keeps getting worse'' and suggests returning to some form of 
compulsory military service. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Herbert Bateman, R-Va., chairman of the subcommittee on  
readiness; Steve Buyer, R-Ind., chairman of the military personnel 
subcommittee; and Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C, former chairman of 
the Senate Armed Services Committee, have also suggested a fresh 
look at reviving the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	But such suggestions are not receiving wide support.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned about the trends away from public service, both  
the military and otherwise,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, 
senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. ``The recruiting 
goals are not being met except by the Marines. But I don't' think 
that's a good reason to reinstate the draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the Army had an authorization for 480,000  
positions but was down to 469,400. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's about a 10,000 shortage,'' Skelton said. ``Do you  
really want to reinstate the draft to get 10,000 soldiers? I 
question that. We'll just have to do a better job of retention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force may fall 2,500 recruits short of its annual goal  
and come up 1,400 pilots short of requirements, and the Navy 
projects a shortage of 22,000 sailors. Only the Marine Corps, the 
smallest service, seems capable of meeting recruitment goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Skelton and others point to a military compensation package near  
final passage in Congress that would provide the biggest increase 
in pay and retirement benefits since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes an across-the-board 4.8 percent pay raise to take  
effect next January, with additional increases set at half a 
percentage point above the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Air Force Col. Paul Arcari, director of the Retired Air  
Force Officers Association, said the new compensation package will 
go a long way toward making military pay and benefits more 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Arcari characterized reviving the draft as ``politically  
unpalatable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said the Defense Department is  
working hard to fix ``recruiting problems, many of which reflect 
the strong economy. ... The military has to show more imagination 
and hard work to meet its recruiting goals, and I believe we're 
doing that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that as long as our all-volunteer force does its  
job well in protecting the national interests, there should not be 
a need for a national mobilization,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said, the Selective Service System, which  
continues to register 18-year-old men for a potential military 
call-up, ``provides a very good backup, should that be necessary 
someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A provision to shut down the 59-year-old agency is tucked in a  
spending bill to be taken up when the House returns after Labor 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee approved the agency  
termination before the August recess with little debate, mostly as 
a cost-cutting move. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no advance warning,'' said Lew Brodsky, the  
service's director of public and congressional affairs. He noted 
Selective Service survived previous attempts to abolish it, in 1993 
and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Randy Cunningham, R-Calif., has said he'll mount an effort  
on the floor to restore the funds and save the agency.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Discusses Peace With Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton discussed prospects for  
Mideast peacemaking today with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel 
amid signs the United States may have to help fix a timetable for 
an Israeli pullback on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak telephoned Clinton and they spoke for about 20 minutes  
about ways to make Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's upcoming 
trip to the region productive, White House spokesman Barry Toiv 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before going, Albright intends to meet here with the senior  
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and with Yasser Arafat's deputy, 
Mahmoud Abbas, widely known also as Abu Mazen. Arafat has been 
quoted as saying he wanted Abbas to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright is due in Jerusalem on Sept. 2, tentatively planning to  
stop first in Morocco and Egypt. She also will hold talks with 
Israeli officials in Jerusalem, with Palestinians in Gaza and the 
West Bank and with Syrians in Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
	If a timetable for a phased pullback by Israel from another 11  
percent of the West Bank is not settled by then, Albright could 
intervene to prod Israel and the Palestinians into an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	While Israel prefers handling its negotiations with the  
Palestinians with minimum U.S. mediation, Albright has said she 
would ``calibrate'' her diplomacy to any need to keep the parties 
on track to an accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's conversation with Barak and Albright's planned meeting  
here with Palestinian officials are ``designed to see how we can be 
as helpful as possible, both in insuring the implementation of the 
Wye River agreement as well as assisting the parties in pursuing a 
permanent peace accord,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those two objectives are what Albright will be working on,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Barak envoy, Gilead Sher, is due to meet Erekat in Jerusalem  
later today to work on the timetable for Israel's pullback under 
the Wye accords that were negotiated last October in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel agreed to relinquish 13 percent of the land in exchange  
for stronger action by the Palestinians against terrorism. After 
yielding 2 percent, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called 
a halt, saying the Palestinian Authority's efforts were not 
sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	With Barak pledging to implement the Wye accords, Israel and the  
Palestinians have agreed the pullback would resume in September. 
However, they are in disagreement on when the two phases should be 
completed.

<HEADLINE> Earle M. Jorgensen Dies at 101 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Earle M. Jorgensen, a steel entrepreneur and  
the last surviving member of Gov. Ronald Reagan's ``kitchen 
cabinet,'' died Wednesday at his Los Angeles home. He was 101. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorgensen sold steel to California's burgeoning oil, aircraft  
and construction industries from the 1920s to the 1990s. The 
company he founded in 1921, now called EMJ Co., grew to sales of 
more than $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	He remained active in the steel business he founded until his  
death., 
</P>
<P>
	``Can't stop,'' Jorgensen said in 1997, two years after he had  
heart bypass surgery. ``Might not get started again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jorgensen and his second wife, Marion, were among the social  
elite of Los Angeles. The couple remained close friends with Ronald 
and Nancy Reagan for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorgensen was among a small group of Reagan advisers who urged  
the former movie star to run for governor, and then for the 
presidency. As governor, Reagan appointed Jorgensen to the State 
College Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	A stepson, Donald Bren, said of Jorgensen's close ties to  
Reagan: ``I asked him once whether he wanted to join his friends 
who were going to Washington, and I'll never forget his reply: 
`That's not my business. I need to stick to what I know best.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A son by his first marriage, John, died in 1989 at the age of  
64. He had run day-to-day operations of the steel company, and his 
father decided to take over the company reins again at age 91. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Jorgensen sold his company, with 28 plants in 24 cities  
nationwide, to a group backed by leveraged buyout specialists Kelso 
&AMP; Co. He wouldn't say what he received in the $264 million dollar 
purchase, but he had owned 32 percent of the company stock -- worth 
about $84 million -- and retained 13.5 percent for a Jorgensen 
family trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were private.

<HEADLINE> NY's Lazio Puts Senate Run on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAY SHORE, N.Y. (AP) -- Rep. Rick Lazio may not agree with Gov.  
George Pataki that New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is the better 
Senate candidate, but he bowed to the governor's wishes Wednesday 
and put his own Senate hopes on hold -- at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me be clear about this, I am not leaving the race,'' Lazio  
said at a Long Island news conference. ``We are keeping our powder 
dry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio said he would wait until Aug. 31 to see if Giuliani  
decides to face likely Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton 
in the November 2000 race. If not, he said he would ask Pataki to 
``re-evaluate his position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki had asked Lazio to put off an announcement of his  
candidacy planned next week until Giuliani decides whether he will 
seek the Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	At an upstate appearance Wednesday, Giuliani was asked about  
Lazio's Aug. 31 deadline and replied: ``I think the most graceful 
thing for me to do is not say anything about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reminded that GOP Chairman William Powers also had suggested  
that date, Giuliani said, ``I'm great at resisting pressure.'' And 
when asked by an audience member whether or not he would run, he 
replied only: ``It looks that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor said Giuliani had earned the right to be  
the GOP candidate. Lazio, who represents Suffolk County on Long 
Island, said he disagreed, but is a team player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the better candidate. I am ready to get into this race,  
but I am doing right now what is in the best interests of the 
Republican Party. I don't agree with Governor Pataki here but I am 
doing this out of respect for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki, at odds with Giuliani since the mayor endorsed  
then-Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994, had been under pressure 
from some GOP leaders to keep Lazio out of the race to avoid a 
divisive primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio acknowledged that unity is key if the Republicans want to  
secure the Senate seat now held by retiring Democratic Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	His loyalty won him praise from both the governor and state GOP  
Chairman William Powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rick Lazio has done the right thing for himself, for his party  
and for New York state,'' Pataki said. ``As I said last week, he is 
a rising star with a bright future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Giuliani has formally entered the race  
but Lazio, like Powers, urged Giuliani to make the decision soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressman has already raised $3.1 million for the race,  
compared to Giuliani's $2.6 million. A third potential GOP 
candidate, Rep. Peter King of neighboring Nassau County, has raised 
$487,596. The Democrats have set a fund-raising target of $25 
million for the Senate race.

<HEADLINE> IRS Gets Rare Victory in UPS Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service won a rare  
victory in its campaign to curb offshore corporate tax shelters 
when a federal judge ruled that the United Parcel Service set up a 
Bermuda company to avoid paying income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS officials said Wednesday they strongly disagree and are  
likely to appeal this week's ruling by a U.S. Tax Court judge, 
which could cost the Atlanta-based package carrier hundreds of 
millions of dollars in back taxes, penalties and interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision runs counter to other recent Tax Court cases  
involving similar arrangements by companies including Gulf Oil and 
U-Haul. At the same time, the Treasury Department is urging 
Congress to approve tougher penalties on corporate tax shelters 
that are estimated to cost taxpayers some $10 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Provisions which provide certain incentives and confer certain  
benefits on taxpayers will always be debatable,'' Treasury 
Secretary Lawrence Summers said in a recent speech. ``But there 
should be little doubt about transactions whose only objective is 
to reduce tax liabilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although there is major disagreement on how to define a tax  
shelter, leading Republicans in Congress say legislation aimed at 
blocking many of them could move later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``High rollers are cheating and gaming our tax system, and  
honest taxpayers have to make up the difference,'' said Rep. Lloyd 
Doggett, D-Texas, sponsor of one bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The intricate nature of these tax shelters is apparent in the  
UPS case, which illustrates the how difficult it is for the IRS to 
prove they are improper. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, UPS created a subsidiary in Bermuda that was later  
called Overseas Partners Ltd., which was subsequently spun off but 
remains owned by UPS employee-shareholders. Its purpose was to 
provide reinsurance -- a way of spreading risk -- for UPS packages 
insured for over $100, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to that, UPS had handled this ``excess value'' package  
insurance itself and reported the revenue as income for tax 
purposes. After Overseas Partners was set up -- such companies are 
called ``captives'' -- the profit from the insurance was funneled to 
the Bermuda company not liable for U.S. income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS insists that Overseas Partners was a legitimate operation  
and that a key reason for its creation was to avoid possible state 
regulations that could hamper its insurance activities. In 
addition, UPS argued that the Bermuda company was always intended 
to become a full-service insuror. 
</P>
<P>
	``UPS made a legitimate decision to get out of the insurance  
business,'' said company spokesman Norman Black. ``OPL is its own 
separate business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are good reasons to create an offshore captive insurer,  
said Timothy McCormally of the Tax Executives Institute. For 
example, an oil company might not be able to find unrelated 
insurers willing to cover costs of environmental cleanups at an 
affordable price. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real key in the tax shelter area is, do the companies have  
a business purpose for entering into the transactions?'' said 
McCormally, whose group represents tax officials at major 
corporations. ``If you don't have a legitimate non-tax business 
purpose, it's going to be overturned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the UPS case, Tax Court Judge Robert P. Ruwe said there was  
no evidence in company documents that UPS researched any pending 
state insurance problems. He also said the insurance rates were 
much higher than they should have been. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruwe said the company was ``motivated by the reduction of  
federal income tax'' in what the judge called a ``sham 
transaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The question of who should be taxed depends on which person or  
entity in fact controls the earning of the income rather than who 
ultimately receives the income,'' Ruwe wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS issued a notice of tax deficiency in 1995 for the tax  
years 1983 and 1984, which totals $67 million in taxes plus 
penalties and interest. UPS has continued the practice, however, 
and could owe some $259 million for 1985 through 1990 -- IRS is 
seeking taxes for those years as well -- and potentially millions 
more for years after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said UPS believes it is complying with all laws and is  
likely to appeal the ruling to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals in Atlanta. ``There are more than sufficient grounds for an 
appeal,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Court: UPS Avoided Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United Parcel Service owes hundreds of  
millions of dollars in back federal taxes that the package carrier 
avoided by creating a subsidiary located in Bermuda, a federal 
court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the U.S. Tax Court held that Atlanta-based UPS  
is liable for taxes, penalties and interest for deductions it took 
related to the income of Overseas Partners Ltd., now an independent 
company that provides ``excess value'' insurance for certain 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling directly covers penalties and interest on $67 million  
in taxes from 1983 and 1984, a total estimated at $300 million. The 
company could owe some $259 million more in taxes alone to the 
Internal Revenue Service for tax years through 1990 and, because it 
has continued a similar practice since then, could be liable for 
millions more. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS spokesman Norman Black said today that UPS believes it is  
complying with all laws and is likely to appeal the ruling to the 
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are more than sufficient grounds for appeal,'' Black  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, however, marks a victory for the IRS in its effort  
to stop practices by large companies to shield income from taxes 
through creation of overseas subsidiaries that have no real 
economic purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	In the strongly-worded ruling, released Monday, Tax Court Judge  
Robert P. Ruwe called creation of the subsidiary a ``sham 
transaction'' and dismissed UPS's contention that a key reason for 
doing so was to avoid possible state regulations against the 
insurance activities it was performing. 
</P>
<P>
	Trial testimony, Ruwe noted, provided no evidence that UPS  
officials had actually researched whether such state regulations 
were pending and little evidence that the Bermuda subsidiary was 
ever exposed to an insurance loss. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the ruling states, the ``extra value'' insurance was  
mainly a way of transferring profit from corporate headquarters to 
avoid federal income taxes by taking large deductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Company documents, Ruwe said show that UPS ``seriously  
considered and was motivated by the reduction of federal income tax 
that would occur'' by making the transactions.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Judge Rules on Sex Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The state's highest court has dealt a blow to the  
state's sex offender registry law, issuing a ruling that could 
entitle all sex offenders to a hearing before they're listed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased with the ruling and I think the courts are again  
reaffirming that not all sex offenders are the same,'' said Larni 
Levy, an attorney at the Committee for Public Counsel Services, the 
state's public defender agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy said the impact of the Supreme Judicial Court ruling issued  
Wednesday would be a ``complete shutdown'' of the registry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sex Offender Registry Board will ``have to cease -- and  
police departments will have to cease -- giving out any names to the 
public for any offenders,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The registry law became effective on Oct. 1, 1996. The idea was  
to protect the public from sex offenders living in their midst and 
to aid police in catching them. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, people convicted of certain offenses were  
required to register with their local police departments. Their 
names could be made available to people inquiring at the department 
and, for more dangerous offenders, police were to take steps to 
actively notify people in the community. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge to the law was brought by a man who was found  
delinquent as a juvenile in 1993 because of a child rape 
conviction. The man, referred to in the opinion only as ``John 
Doe,'' challenged attempts to require him to register as a sex 
offender. 
</P>
<P>
	The court decreed that the man was not required to register  
until a hearing was held. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the attorney general's office and the public defenders  
interpreted the ruling to mean that hearings were required for 
people convicted of all of the various crimes for which the law 
requires registration. 
</P>
<P>
	Alice Moore, chief of the government bureau in Attorney General  
Thomas Reilly's office, said she was disappointed in the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It further delays bringing information about sex offenders to  
parents who may want that information to take necessary steps to 
protect their children,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will work with the Legislature to craft a bill that  
complies with the SJC's decision today to require a hearing for 
every sex offender.''

<P>
	It's been a wild four days for Wade Boggs. After becoming the  
23rd player with 3,000 hits, Boggs joined Ty Cobb as the only 
members of that club to take the pitcher's mound. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on their way to a 17-1 loss  
Tuesday night to the Baltimore Orioles, manager Larry Rothschild 
turned to his future Hall of Fame third baseman to get the final 
four outs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't much of a choice. It was going to be a position  
player, and Wade had done it before,'' Rothschild said. ``He throws 
a knuckleball, so I don't worry as much about him hurting his 
arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight for the 17,848 fans at Tropicana Field came with  
two outs in the eighth inning when Boggs entered with the bases 
loaded. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a hell of a week,'' said Boggs, who became the first  
player to homer for his 3,000th on Saturday night. ``I was dead 
serious about getting them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving a standing ovation, Boggs retired Charles  
Johnson on a fly ball to right field. He got the first two batters 
out in the ninth, including a strikeout of Delino DeShields. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys that made outs off of Wade Boggs, they came back and  
I said, `A Hall of Famer got you out,''' Baltimore manager Ray 
Miller said. ```Don't let it bother you. Just don't tell anybody it 
was a hitter.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs allowed one run on three hits, including an RBI single by  
Mike Bordick, before retiring Albert Belle on a soft fly ball to 
center to finish the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting, but weird. After seeing him get his 3,000th  
hit and now he's out there trying to strike you out,'' Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs also threw a scoreless inning for the New York Yankees at  
Anaheim on Aug. 19, 1997. Cobb, who pitched in two games in 1918 
before getting his 3,000th hit, pitched one shutout inning in 1925 
for Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	In other AL games, it was Toronto 10, Minnesota 6; Boston 9,  
Kansas City 6; Oakland 6, New York 1; Texas 4, Detroit 3; Seattle 
4, Chicago 3; and Cleveland 2, Anaheim 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Sidney Ponson threw his league-leading sixth complete game for  
Baltimore. Ponson (11-7) allowed one run and six hits in recording 
his third complete game in his past six starts. The right-hander 
struck out five and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
	Bordick tied his career-high with five RBIs. The Orioles, who  
won for just the fifth time in their past 15 games, had dropped six 
straight to Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Devil Rays starter Dave Eiland (2-7) allowed six runs and six  
hits in 1 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Blue Jays 10, Twins 6    	
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Delgado hit two of Toronto's five home runs and the Blue  
Jays had 15 hits, giving them 40 in two nights at Texas and 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon Stewart, Darrin Fletcher and Homer Bush also homered off  
Brad Radke (8-11) as Toronto maintained a one-game lead over Boston 
in the AL wild-card race. Delgado has seven homers in his last five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelvim Escobar (10-8) allowed three runs and four hits in five  
innings. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Red Sox 9, Royals 6    	
</P>
<P>
	At Kansas City, Brian Daubach's double capped a four-run 10th  
inning after Tim Wakefield (4-8) struck out four in the ninth, but 
still blew the save. 
</P>
<P>
	Darren Lewis and Jose Offerman had RBI singles in the 10th off  
Matt Whisenant (4-4), and Daubach hit a two-run double off Mac 
Suzuki. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Garces earned his first save.  
</P>
<P>
                       *Athletics 6, Yankees 1    	
</P>
<P>
	Scott Spiezio's two-run double in the sixth broke up a scoreless  
duel, and Ben Grieve followed with a two-run homer off Roger 
Clemens (10-5). 
</P>
<P>
	Omar Olivares (10-9) allowed one run in six innings to win his  
second game since he was traded to Oakland from Anaheim on July 29. 
Doug Jones earned his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
	The A's, 10-2 on a homestand that ends Wednesday, improved their  
home record to a major league best 41-18 and stopped the Yankees' 
six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Rangers 4, Tigers 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Royce Clayton hit a game-winning single off Nelson Cruz (2-4) in  
the bottom of the 12th, Texas' first hit since the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Patterson (2-0) pitched the 12th for the win. Rangers  
relievers Tim Crabtree, Jeff Zimmerman and Patterson did not allow 
a hit in the final 5 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Mariners 4, White Sox 3    	
</P>
<P>
	At Seattle, Ken Griffey Jr. hit his AL-leading 36th homer and  
pinch-hitter Tom Lampkin's two-run double off Bob Howry (2-3) in 
the ninth inning gave the Mariners the win. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Moyer (11-6) pitched an eight-hitter for his first  
complete game of the season and 17th in his career. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Indians 2, Angels 1    	
</P>
<P>
	At Anaheim, Manny Ramirez hit a tiebreaking sacrifice fly for  
his major league-leading 115th RBI as Cleveland won for the 10th 
time in 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was the Angels' 21st in 25 games and fifth in a row,  
dropping them a season-worst 21 games out of first place in the AL 
West and 20 games under .500. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime Angels teammates Chuck Finley and Mark Langston pitched  
to a draw before the Indians got to Mark Petkovsek (9-4) in the 
10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricardo Rincon (1-2) got four outs for the win and Mike Jackson  
earned his 25th save.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Softbank Corp., Tokyo Electric Power Co.  
and Microsoft Corp. announced Wednesday that are setting up a joint 
venture offering a low-cost, wireless Internet connection service. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will be able to connect to the Internet using wireless  
transmitters that communicate with relay base stations installed on 
utility poles owned by Tokyo Electric Power, the world's largest 
electric power company. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint venture is to be set up in Tokyo in September and  
begin offering the service in the summer of 2000, starting in the 
Tokyo area. 
</P>
<P>
	The high cost of local calls has hindered Internet use in Japan.  
</P>
<P>
	The new company, as yet unnamed, will be capitalized at 6  
billion yen ($52.3 million), with Softbank, Tepco and Microsoft 
each taking a 31 percent stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet service provider Yahoo Japan Corp. will hold a 5  
percent stake. The companies did not say who would hold the 
remaining 2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tree-Shaped Frost Found on Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --The planet Mars is an infamous deceiver. Early  
astronomers thought they saw canals crisscrossing the red planet, 
and now a NASA spacecraft has snapped pictures of dark shapes that 
at first glance look like trees sprouting from the frozen south 
pole. 
</P>
<P>
	But what appears to be rolling hills covered with vegetation  
probably are sand dunes topped with melting frost, scientists said 
Tuesday of the new images from the Mars Global Surveyor. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may look at this and say, as did I, 'Gee, those look like  
trees and plants,''' said Mike Malin, the scientist responsible for 
the spacecraft's camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since this whole area is at about minus 150 degrees Celsius,  
these are clearly not plants growing up out of the frost, but 
something else is happening,'' Malin said. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the scientists thought the tree shapes and other,  
circular formations might have been caused by small gas pockets 
exploding under sand dunes. 
</P>
<P>
	But they now propose that the dark shapes are patches of exposed  
sand standing out among the frost-covered dunes. As spring warms 
southern Mars, some of the frost sublimes -- or turns directly from 
solid to gas, bypassing the liquid stage. Wind then blows the frost 
and sand into patterns that resemble trees when viewed from space. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest images from the $250 million Surveyor, which has been  
mapping the planet since March, offer an interplanetary weather 
report of swirling clouds, dust devils as tall as mountains and 
sand dunes blown into intricate patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the monstrous dunes observed by the missions to Mars in  
the 1970s, the new images show smaller dunes, the size of those 
found in the Mojave Desert. Detailed close-ups of the dunes look 
like a Japanese stone garden, with precise, wind-blown patterns 
etched into the dust. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our view of the red planet has been of something stuck in the  
freezer for millions of years, but looking at the new pictures 
shows us a dynamic and active planet,'' said Michael Meyer of the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's office of space 
science. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Martian frost consists of frozen carbon dioxide. But  
when the temperature rises, the carbon dioxide flashes into a gas 
too quickly to be observed, Malin said. So most of the frost 
features must be caused by water ice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The frost appears at night, when Surveyor can't watch, so  
whether it forms on the ground or falls as snow from the atmosphere 
is still a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other NASA spacecraft will arrive at Mars later this year.  
The Mars Climate Orbiter will reach Mars in September and will make 
more detailed weather observations from orbit. In December, the 
Mars Polar Lander will arrive and dispatch two smaller probes to 
search for water below the surface. The Polar Lander then will 
touch down at the south pole to study the soil. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA plans to announce the landing site on Aug. 25.

<HEADLINE> US, Senate in Confirmation Squabble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Judges in waiting, ambassadors on hold, a top  
Justice Department job still in dispute -- President Clinton is 
prodding the Senate again to get going on confirmation of his 
nominees next month. 
</P>
<P>
	He complains of a political slowdown, but that's only part of  
his problem. The balky confirmation system reflects the strains 
between any White House and any Senate, heightened when they are of 
opposing parties. A nominee a president wants confirmed can be 
hostage to something a senator wants done, or undone. 
</P>
<P>
	That accounted for the final stall before Richard Holbrooke was  
confirmed, 81-16, as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to take 
a job that will have been vacant for a year by the time he gets 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Holbrooke holdup was over the complaint of one Republican  
senator at the job transfer -- he says demotion -- of a U.N. 
whistleblower, and the demand of two others that Clinton appoint 
their candidate to a GOP vacancy on the Federal Election 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't get their man. Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said  
he'd made progress on the whistleblower case, but he's not 
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	So when he lifted his hold -- the practice by which any senator  
can block action -- on Holbrooke, Grassley substituted a new one, to 
block three other ambassador nominees. He said that would increase 
his leverage, because he didn't think Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright was concerned enough to be ``out of sorts with the hold up 
of the Holbrooke nomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of them is A. Peter Burleigh, a career diplomat who stood in  
at the U.N. during the long wait for Holbrooke, and has been 
nominated ambassador to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton didn't send Holbrooke's nomination to the Senate until  
Feb. 10, after eight months of background checks and ethics 
investigations involving his contacts with former government 
colleagues as a private businessman. He agreed to pay a $5,000 
civil fine, while denying he'd done anything wrong. Then the 
ponderous Senate system took over, and when the Foreign Relations 
Committee finally approved the nomination on June 30, Grassley and 
the others put it on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the general public is somewhat perplexed about the  
procedures of the Senate,'' Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said, as the 
impasse yielded to confirmation on Aug. 5 after a 35-minute debate 
with no arguments; it was spent largely on praising Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton weighed in on the judges before the American Bar  
Association in Atlanta on Monday, complaining that political 
considerations are stalling confirmations needed to deal with a 
``mounting vacancy crisis'' in the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee,  
tried to preempt him on Sunday with a letter saying that handling 
has been balanced and thorough. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said only 11 of his 61 federal judge nominees this year  
have been confirmed, 13 have been approved by Hatch's committee, 
and ``37 are still stuck there.'' Hatch said the administration has 
been slow to send up background material the committee needs to 
assess the nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	No mention of the power play involved in that process. Hatch had  
stopped holding hearings on judicial nominees last winter because 
Clinton didn't name his candidate to a Utah court opening. He 
reopened the process in June after getting Clinton's assurance that 
Ted Stewart, a former Hatch aide, would be nominated. He was, on 
July 27. No delay on that one. The Judiciary Committee approved it 
three days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the unyielding Republican stall on the nomination  
of Bill Lann Lee, Clinton's choice to be assistant attorney general 
for civil rights. That one has been blocked in the Judiciary 
Committee; Hatch and other opponents say Lee pushed racial hiring 
quotas when he was a lawyer for the NAACP. He was named to the 
Justice Department's top civil rights job late in 1997, but there's 
never even been a hearing on a nomination Clinton has submitted 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the ABA he is going to ask the Senate to ``do the  
right thing'' and approve Lee. That isn't going to happen. Nor is 
it going to make much difference. When Lee's nomination was 
blocked, Clinton installed him as acting assistant attorney general 
for civil rights, so he's been on the job since, despite the 
Senate.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Judge Rules on Sex Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The state's highest court dealt a crushing blow  
Wednesday to the state's sex offender registry law, issuing a 
ruling that could entitle all sex offenders to a hearing before 
they're listed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased with the ruling and I think the courts are again  
reaffirming that not all sex offenders are the same,'' said Larni 
Levy, an attorney at the Committee for Public Counsel Services, the 
state's public defender agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy said the impact of the Supreme Judicial Court ruling would  
be a ``complete shutdown'' of the registry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sex Offender Registry Board will ``have to cease -- and  
police departments will have to cease -- giving out any names to the 
public for any offenders,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alice Moore, chief of the government bureau in Attorney General  
Thomas Reilly's office, said she was disappointed in the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It further delays bringing information about sex offenders to  
parents who may want that information to take necessary steps to 
protect their children,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will work with the Legislature to craft a bill that  
complies with the SJC's decision today to require a hearing for 
every sex offender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge to the sex offender registry law was brought by a  
man who was found delinquent as a juvenile in 1993 because of a 
child rape conviction. The man, referred to in the opinion only as 
``John Doe,'' challenged attempts to require him to register as a 
sex offender. 
</P>
<P>
	The SJC decreed that the man was not required to register until  
a hearing was held. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the attorney general's office and the public defenders  
interpreted the ruling to mean that hearings were required for 
people convicted of all of the various crimes for which the law 
requires registration. 
</P>
<P>
	The sex offender registry law became effective on Oct. 1, 1996.  
The idea was to protect the public from sex offenders living in 
their midst and to aid police in catching them. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, people convicted of certain offenses were  
required to register with their local police departments. Their 
names could be made available to people inquiring at the department 
and, for more dangerous offenders, police were to take steps to 
actively notify people in the community.

<HEADLINE> National Science Director Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The director of the National Science  
Foundation division focusing on science and math education is being 
replaced after nine years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Luther Williams is leaving NSF at the end of August to take a  
post at the Payson Center for International Development and 
Technology Transfer at Tulane University. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have a policy of rotation and he has served admirably  
and well and we agreed it was time for some change both for him and 
for the foundation,'' NSF Director Rita Colwell said Wednesday in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Judith Sunley has been named interim head of the  
division. The education directorate has an annual budget of $689 
million, according to Science Now, the electronic journal of the 
American Association for the Advancement of Science, which first 
reported the change. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a former biology professor, had been active in seeking  
improvements in elementary and secondary school science and math 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Colwell said she was not beginning an immediate search for a  
permanent replacement for Williams. Sunley is a mathematician and 
has served as an NSF administrator.

<HEADLINE> Former Presidents Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Twenty-five years to the week after he was  
thrust into the presidency by Watergate, Gerald Ford returned to 
the White House on Wednesday to be praised as the steady hand that 
helped America heal. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents Clinton and Ford strode side-by-side into the East  
Room, where Ford and seven other people received the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steady, trustworthy, Gerald Ford ended a long national  
nightmare,'' Clinton said, referring to the Watergate scandal and 
President Nixon's resignation on Aug. 9, 1974. Ford then became 
president, and served out what would have been Nixon's second term. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he left the White House after 895 days, America was  
stronger, calmer and more self confident,'' Clinton said. ``America 
was, in other words, more like President Ford himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The medal is the nation's highest civilian honor. Clinton  
awarded it to former President Carter in Atlanta on Monday, making 
George Bush the only living former president who has not received 
the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Established by President Truman as a wartime honor, the medal  
was reintroduced by President Kennedy as way to honor civilian 
service. Clinton has awarded the medal to civil rights leaders, 
philanthropists, entertainers and statesmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``In honoring them we honor also the values and principles of  
our nation's founding and our nation's future,'' Clinton said of 
Wednesday's honorees. The recipients did not speak inside the White 
House, but Ford paused outside to reflect on the events of a 
quarter-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't avoid those reminiscences. It was a monumental  
day,'' he said. ``It was a unique situation as far as the country 
is concerned and I hope it never happens again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Ford, the honorees were:  
</P>
<P>
	--Lloyd M. Bentsen, Clinton's first Treasury secretary who served  
22 years in the Senate and six years in the House. He was the 
Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	--Edgar M. Bronfman Sr., president of the World Jewish Congress.  
He has ``worked to ensure basic rights for Jews around the world 
and to fight anti-Semitism and has spearheaded the effort to 
retrieve the assets of Holocaust victims and their families,'' 
according to the White House tribute. 
</P>
<P>
	--Evy Dubrow, an advocate for more than 50 years of laws to  
improve domestic labor conditions. ``She has been influential in 
numerous causes, including broadening laws against discrimination 
and protecting American industry from unfair foreign competition,'' 
the tribute said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sister M. Isolina Ferre, founder of community service centers,  
clinics and programs to empower the poor in Puerto Rico, New York 
and Appalachia. She gained international recognition in the late 
1950s and 1960s for her mediation efforts with youth gangs in 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	--Oliver White Hill, civil rights lawyer. He is best known for  
litigating one of the school desegregation cases that became the 
landmark Brown vs. Board of Education case. 
</P>
<P>
	--Max Kampelman, lawyer, diplomat and negotiator in Democratic  
and Republican administrations. ``In those roles, he emphasized 
human rights in East-West diplomacy and prepared the foundation for 
long-term arms reductions between the United States and the Soviet 
Union,'' the tribute said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Edgar Wayburn, five-time president and a member of the board of  
directors of the Sierra Club for almost 40 years.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton and Gore Campaign Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The good, the bad. The wins, the losses.  
Whatever legacy history bestows upon Bill Clinton's White House 
also belongs to Al Gore. Or so goes the president's endorsement of 
his vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The record of this administration is his record,'' Clinton  
told Democratic fund-raising bigwigs Tuesday night after an 
unusually joined-at-the-hip day with Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is a record of achievement,'' Gore replied. ``But  
the question is where we go from here.'' Gore, who wants to go from 
No. 2 to No. 1, called Clinton ``a true friend ... a partner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, they toured a mop factory together and conducted a  
roundtable with workers to highlight Gore's agenda for small 
business. They shared a limo back to the White House, lunched 
together in private, then ate not one, but two dinners together. 
The two supper shifts allowed Clinton and Gore to schmooze campaign 
financiers -- including Seagram Chairman Edgar Bronfman Jr. and New 
Jersey Nets basketball star Jayson Williams -- in more intimate 
groups of 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans seized on all the togetherness and issued a public  
reminder of Clinton's impeachment scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been together under all kinds of circumstances,''  
Clinton said before his first dinner -- of chicken and rice. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were times of great elation, times of great triumphs,  
times of defeat, times of frustration, times of intense 
difficulty,'' the president said. ``But we've also been together in 
personal ways. I talk to him about everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, Clinton and Gore paired up for the first time on  
the Campaign 2000 trail, picking up more than $300,000 in Arkansas 
and trying to put to rest lingering reports of dissension between 
them. More joint fund-raisers are planned. 
</P>
<P>
	But no money changed hands Tuesday night. Instead, said Gore  
campaign spokesman Roger Salazar, the reception and two dinners 
were intended to energize the people organizing future 
fund-raisers, thank those who already have and recruit new blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need your help,'' Gore said. ``The decision will be  
contested because change always is resisted and we have been 
bringing change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, Republican National Committee Chairman Jim  
Nicholson put out a mock Gore 2000 campaign poster with the caption 
``Bosom Buddies'' under a photo of Gore hugging Clinton with both 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release, Nicholson recalled Gore's statement in June,  
as he launched his presidential campaign, that Clinton's Oval 
Office affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky was 
``inexcusable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now Gore and Clinton are back on the prowl, as a fund-raising  
tag team, working to shake down Democrat fat cats,'' Nicholson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Begala, a veteran of the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign and a  
former White House political strategist, said Gore is smart to 
exploit the president's ``unmatched ability to raise issues and 
money'' and to rally Democrats. Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley 
is challenging Gore for the party's presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	But, added Begala, a Gore booster, ``You don't want them joined  
at the hip. Gore has to stand up and define himself with some 
force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their identical Tuesday schedules, Clinton and Gore kept  
distinctly different paces. Gore was the man with things to do, 
places to go. He kept the president and his motorcade waiting at 
the White House before dinner then dashed from dinner with a cell 
phone to his ear. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton acted the part of a man with time on his hands,  
lingering at the Hay Adams Hotel for a full 32 minutes after Gore 
and many dinner guests already filtered out.

<HEADLINE> Medinah Country Club a Unique Place  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- If the mosque-like clubhouse can't convince  
you, with its Egyptian murals, hand-painted rotunda and patios that 
look like something from ``Casablanca,'' then the hand-carved sign 
on the way out will. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allah Be With You,'' it reads.  
</P>
<P>
	As players and fans at the 81st PGA Championship are discovering  
this week, there's something special about Medinah Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like it anywhere in the United States,'' said  
Don Larson, a Medinah member since 1975 and general chairman of 
this week's tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	No offense, Augusta. Pardon us, Pebble Beach. But Medinah  
combines challenging golf with impressive architecture, gorgeous 
scenery and a history that seems better suited to Hollywood than 
the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	A bear once lived here. A camel used to visit. And all because  
in the early 1920s, some members of the Ancient Order of Nobles of 
the Mystic Shrine -- yes, that really was the name of their 
philanthropic group -- wanted a country retreat for their families. 
</P>
<P>
	As members of the Medinah Temple -- named for the Muslim holy  
city of Medina -- they wanted the club to reflect that history in 
everything from its name to its architecture. So before he drew his 
blueprints for the clubhouse, designer Richard Schmid spent two 
years traveling the Middle East and Europe in search of 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is a clubhouse that looks like a smaller version of  
the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. The brown- and orange-brick building 
is three stories high and 104,000 square feet, with towers on the 
left and right sides. There used to be a minaret, too, but the top 
was knocked off by lightning and never restored. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the building is the 60-foot rotunda. While  
the ceiling looks like a mosaic of cream, blue, orange, black and 
red tiles, it's actually hand-painted. The walls of the rotunda 
also are hand-painted, giving them a Byzantine flavor. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't anybody who walks in there for the first time that  
doesn't just gasp,'' Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of Medinah's three courses opened in September 1925,  
and its first tournament, the Medinah Open, was held in 1930. It 
has played host to three other major championships, the 1949, 1975 
and 1990 U.S. Opens. 
</P>
<P>
	There is more to Medinah than golf. There's a gun club and a  
pool. In the early years, members could boat and fish on Lake 
Kadijah or go skating in the winter. There also was a ski jump and 
toboggan runs. 
</P>
<P>
	There were different events and parties, including the one to  
which a camel, Miss Medinah, was brought in to entertain members. 
There also was a bear that lived in a cage on the grounds for a 
brief time. But it bit a little girl's finger and members found it 
a new home. 
</P>
<P>
	Medinah currently has almost 1,000 members, though only about  
500 people have golf memberships, and there is a waiting list of 
more than six years. The most famous member is Michael Jordan, who 
joined in April and created a stir last month when he played with 
buddy Tiger Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a wonderful time,'' Woods said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite its luxury now, Medinah has known hard times. Members  
had to bail the club out during the Depression, and Course No. 2 
was shut down during World War II, said Wally Hund, the club 
historian. A herd of sheep grazed on the other two courses to keep 
them in shape. 
</P>
<P>
	And when club officials asked the members to approve a  
renovation in 1995, it barely passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Times were tough from the time this club started,'' Hund said.  
``What makes this club so special is the blue-collar people. Most 
of us are first-generation money. We're just a bunch of 
blue-collars who make this thing go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $10 million renovation closed the clubhouse for more than a  
year. The plumbing, heating and air conditioning were redone. The 
original murals and painting were restored. Rooms that once housed 
employees were turned into office space. 
</P>
<P>
	A golf lobby was created outside the locker rooms to display  
pieces of the club's history, including Hale Irwin's clubs from the 
1990 U.S. Open and the clubhouse's original blueprints. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17th hole on Course No. 3, the PGA Championship's host  
course, also was rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Medinah is back to its original glory, Hund said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty special,'' agreed David Steele, a Medinah member  
since 1979. ``Every time I play golf, I sit on the bench and look 
at the clubhouse. You sit there and think, `We're pretty lucky to 
be here.'''

<HEADLINE> Sanders' Dad Hopes He Will Come Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Barry Sanders' father played down  
speculation that his son might return to the NFL but vowed to try 
to persuade him to come back. 
</P>
<P>
	William Sanders said Wednesday that the running back didn't even  
ask his advice when he retired from the Detroit Lions at age 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, 1,458 yards short of Walter Payton's career rushing  
record, walked away from the game on July 28, the day before the 
Lions began training camp at Saginaw Valley State University. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Sanders said his desire to quit football outweighed  
his desire to play. 
</P>
<P>
	William Sanders said he told his son not to retire three years  
ago when he was considering it. ``This time he didn't ask me, he 
just quit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Hughes, director of security for the Lions, has been  
staying at the elder Sanders' home in Wichita since Monday, 
generating speculation that the running back might be rethinking 
his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, a family friend, said Wednesday he came in response to a  
long-standing invitation -- and not at the urging of the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not down here to try to convince anyone,'' he told The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes said he told only one coach that he was coming so he  
wouldn't be considered absent without leave. He said he decided to 
take a few days off during training camp and planned to stay in 
Wichita another day or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here to relax and have a good time,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lions spokesman Bill Keenist said Hughes was visiting Sanders as  
a Lions official, but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Conspicuously absent was Barry Sanders, who was traveling in  
Europe. His father said he hasn't heard from him recently, and 
didn't even know exactly where he was now. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only time Barry called me often was when he was at  
Oklahoma State and he needed money,'' he said. ``He only calls me 
every once in a while now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Sanders said he expected to see his son when he comes  
back from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said his son called to tell him about his decision to  
retire only so that he heard it from him rather than the news 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was disenchanted with the direction the team was going. He  
was tired of losing,'' Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said he would do everything he could to get his son to  
come back to the team and had promised the Lions before Hughes' 
visit that he would try. 
</P>
<P>
	``It stung me a little bit, but it didn't disappoint me,'' he  
said of the retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions have not made a significant move to replace Sanders.  
Only one back, Jerris McPhail, was not on the roster at the time 
Sanders announced his retirement. McPhail was with the Lions last 
year but did not carry the ball or catch a pass. He was picked by 
the Browns in the expansion draft, but was cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Rivers, Sanders' backup the last four years, is No. 1 on the  
depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders has avoided all contact with the Lions' front office and  
coaching staff since the final game of the 1998 season. Coach Bobby 
Ross attempted to contact him through a total of 13 telephone calls 
or handwritten letters, but Sanders did not respond to any of them.

<HEADLINE> Magic Ships Austin to Wizards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The Orlando Magic, undergoing a massive  
overhaul, traded center Ike Austin to the Washington Wizards for 
Terry Davis, Ben Wallace, Tim Legler and Jeff McInnis on Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, who signed a three-year, $15 million as a free agent in  
January, is the fourth Magic starter from last season to be dealt 
since the club initiated plan to assemble a younger, more athletic 
team for first-year coach Doc Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Horace Grant was sent to Seattle in a draft-night trade  
that brought rookie Corey Maggette to Orlando. Swingman Nick 
Anderson was moved to the Sacramento Kings for Tariq Abdul-Wahad, 
and four-time All-Star Penny Hardaway went to the Phoenix Suns last 
week in a sign-and-trade deal for Danny Manning and Pat Garrity. 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard Darrell Armstrong is the only starter remaining for  
a team that posted a surprising 33-17 record before losing in the 
first round of the playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transaction continues to set the foundation for our plans  
to relaunch the Magic,'' general manager John Gabriel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to the contributions of Terry Davis and Ben  
Wallace in the frontcourt and Tim Legler and Jeff McInnis in the 
backcourt. We certainly wish Ike well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, who will turn 30 next week, was a disappointment in his  
only season in Orlando. He averaged 9.7 points and 4.8 rebounds, 
and his role diminished as the year progressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this trade, we have acquired a talented center in Isaac  
Austin,'' Washington general manager Wes Unseld said in a 
statement. ``Ike is just coming into his prime, and he addresses a 
vital need for this team. His abilities in the low post give us 
weapons we just did not have last season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 32, started 34 games and averaged 3.4 points and 3.8  
rebounds for Washington last season, while Wallace, 24, led the 
Wizards with 8.6 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Legler, 32, is a 44 percent career 3-point shooter who headed to  
his seventh team in 10 seasons. He averaged four points during the 
lockout-shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	McInnis, 24, was a second-round draft pick of the Denver Nuggets  
in 1996. He appeared in 35 games last season, averaging 3.7 points 
and 2.1 assists.

<HEADLINE> N.Y.'s Lazio Suspends Senate Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAY SHORE, N.Y. (AP) -- Rep. Rick Lazio said today he will put  
his U.S. Senate campaign plans on hold while New York City Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani mulls getting into the race. But he urged the 
mayor to decide quickly for the good of the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	While bowing to Gov. George Pataki's wish to give Giuliani a  
chance to make up his mind, Lazio said he was not withdrawing from 
the race and did not rule out a primary run against the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not closing any doors,'' Lazio said at a news conference  
where he stood at a podium adorned with a Lazio 2000 campaign 
poster. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he publicly disagreed with the governor's view that  
Giuliani has earned the right to be the GOP candidate, Lazio said 
he was acquiescing ``out of respect'' for Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Pataki asked Lazio to defer the Senate candidacy  
announcement he had planned to make next week. The Republican 
governor said Giuliani had earned the right to the GOP Senate 
nomination and urged the mayor to quickly declare his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio's action could allow Giuliani to concentrate completely on  
his likely Democratic opponent in the general election, first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But Giuliani on Tuesday warned that ``everybody has escalated  
this election way too fast. People are going to be really bored 
with it in about three months if we don't slow it down a little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the mayor refused to comment on Lazio's plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got my own decisions to make, campaign to put together,  
money to raise, political support to gather,'' Giuliani said. ``I'm 
not going to pay attention to anybody else's campaign until some 
time a year from now when this election really gets started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki's move was designed to avoid a potentially bitter GOP  
primary. The governor had been under pressure from some national 
and New York GOP leaders to use his muscle to keep Lazio out of the 
race on the grounds that Giuliani would be a stronger Republican 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	State GOP Chairman William Powers, a Pataki ally and Giuliani  
booster, said Tuesday that he has encouraged the mayor to announce 
his candidacy before the end of this month. Powers said the mayor 
was noncommittal, but had agreed to step up his campaign-like trips 
across the state. Giuliani planned a speech to a Republican women's 
club in Cooperstown today. 
</P>
<P>
	Powers said he feared that by not declaring his candidacy  
quickly, the mayor could hurt his money-raising efforts for a race 
in which Mrs. Clinton's backers have set a fund-raising target of 
$25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats were quick to jump into the fray, claiming Tuesday  
that Lazio was a victim of the governor's desire to please Texas 
Gov. George W. Bush and enhance his own chances of winning the No. 
2 spot on the GOP national ticket next year by forging Republican 
unity in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	While both Mrs. Clinton and the mayor have formed Senate  
exploratory committees and are raising money for their possible 
Senate bids, neither has formally announced their candidacies. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki has had frosty relations with Giuliani since 1994 when  
the mayor crossed party lines to endorse then-Democratic Gov. Mario 
Cuomo in the governor's race won by Pataki.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton and Gore Campaign Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The good, the bad. The wins, the losses.  
Whatever legacy history bestows upon Bill Clinton's White House 
also belongs to Al Gore. Or so goes the president's endorsement of 
his vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The record of this administration is his record,'' Clinton  
told Democratic fund-raising bigwigs Tuesday night after an 
unusually joined-at-the-hip day with Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is a record of achievement,'' Gore replied. ``But  
the question is where we go from here.'' Gore, who wants to go from 
No. 2 to No. 1, called Clinton ``a true friend ... a partner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, they toured a mop factory together and conducted a  
roundtable with workers to highlight Gore's agenda for small 
business. They shared a limo back to the White House, lunched 
together in private, then ate not one, but two dinners together. 
The two supper shifts allowed Clinton and Gore to schmooze campaign 
financiers -- including Seagram Chairman Edgar Bronfman Jr. and New 
Jersey Nets basketball star Jayson Williams -- in more intimate 
groups of 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans seized on all the togetherness and issued a public  
reminder of Clinton's impeachment scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been together under all kinds of circumstances,''  
Clinton said before his first dinner -- of chicken and rice. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were times of great elation, times of great triumphs,  
times of defeat, times of frustration, times of intense 
difficulty,'' the president said. ``But we've also been together in 
personal ways. I talk to him about everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, Clinton and Gore paired up for the first time on  
the Campaign 2000 trail, picking up more than $300,000 in Arkansas 
and trying to put to rest lingering reports of dissension between 
them. More joint fund-raisers are planned. 
</P>
<P>
	But no money changed hands Tuesday night. Instead, said Gore  
campaign spokesman Roger Salazar, the reception and two dinners 
were intended to energize the people organizing future 
fund-raisers, thank those who already have and recruit new blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need your help,'' Gore said. ``The decision will be  
contested because change always is resisted and we have been 
bringing change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, Republican National Committee Chairman Jim  
Nicholson put out a mock Gore 2000 campaign poster with the caption 
``Bosom Buddies'' under a photo of Gore hugging Clinton with both 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release, Nicholson recalled Gore's statement in June,  
as he launched his presidential campaign, that Clinton's Oval 
Office affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky was 
``inexcusable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now Gore and Clinton are back on the prowl, as a fund-raising  
tag team, working to shake down Democrat fat cats,'' Nicholson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Begala, a veteran of the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign and a  
former White House political strategist, said Gore is smart to 
exploit the president's ``unmatched ability to raise issues and 
money'' and to rally Democrats. Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley 
is challenging Gore for the party's presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	But, added Begala, a Gore booster, ``You don't want them joined  
at the hip. Gore has to stand up and define himself with some 
force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their identical Tuesday schedules, Clinton and Gore kept  
distinctly different paces. Gore was the man with things to do, 
places to go. He kept the president and his motorcade waiting at 
the White House before dinner then dashed from dinner with a cell 
phone to his ear. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton acted the part of a man with time on his hands,  
lingering at the Hay Adams Hotel for a full 32 minutes after Gore 
and many dinner guests already filtered out.

<HEADLINE> Death Upheld for N.J. Girl's Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court affirmed today the  
murder conviction of Jesse Timmendequas and his death sentence for 
the 1994 rape and slaying of 7-year-old Megan Kanka. 
</P>
<P>
	The court in a 4-3 ruling rejected arguments by defense  
attorneys that Timmendequas' 1997 trial in Mercer County was 
tainted by local publicity since it was only a few miles from the 
murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The murder prompted a state and national movement to enact  
``Megan's Laws'' to keep track of convicted sex offenders after 
their release from prison and to provide community notifications on 
the whereabouts of the most dangerous ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Timmendequas had been convicted twice of serious sex crimes but  
the Kanka family, who lived across the street from him in quiet 
Hamilton Township, had no idea of his past. 
</P>
<P>
	Timmendequas, 37, was convicted of luring the girl into his  
home, raping and strangling her and dumping her body in a nearby 
park. Megan's mother, Maureen Kanka, has become a national advocate 
for tougher sex-offender laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Timmendequas' lawyers argued that because the case was so widely  
known, it is likely the jury -- which was bused in from neighboring 
Hunterdon County -- was aware of his prior convictions. Information 
about prior offenses is usually not permitted at criminal trials 
because it could prejudice the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Timmendequas is now entitled to two more appeals to check the  
verdict for fairness as compared with other cases and to seek a new 
trial.

<HEADLINE> Energy Futures Rocket Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures rose sharply Wednesday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange after industry reports showed U.S. inventories 
fell to their lowest levels since January. 
</P>
<P>
	Other energy prices also gained. On other markets, grain and  
soybean futures fall sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude rose to its highest level in nearly two years after the  
American Petroleum Institute reported inventories fell 3.16 million 
barrels, or 1 percent, last week to 323.1 million barrels, the 
lowest level since Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	That was double what even the most optimistic analysts had  
estimated, and came as imports tumbled 5 percent during that week. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline inventories also fell an unexpectedly sharp 3.476  
million barrels, the API reported, while heating oil and other 
distillates fell unexpectedly by 647,000 barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline, the third in as many weeks, highlighted the  
concerted effort made by world oil producers to keep supplies off 
the market in a bid to boost prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude futures also gained after Chevron Corp. reported a fire  
forced it to close a pipeline that ships 210,000 barrels a day of 
crude through Texas. The pipeline moves nearly 4 percent of U.S. 
production and could further reduce supplies across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains come amid estimates that predict world oil demand will  
rise sharply next year as Asian markets rebound from an economic 
slump and U.S. and European demand remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for September delivery rose 22 cents to $21.52 a barrel;  
September unleaded gasoline rose 0.94 cent to 65.97 cents a gallon; 
September heating oil rose 0.55 cent to 55.65 cents a gallon; 
September natural gas fell 4.4 cents to $2.704 for each 1,000 cubic 
feet. In London, Brent crude rose 14 cents to $20.63 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures retreated on the Chicago Board of  
Trade as beneficial showers moved into Midwest growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	While rains across key growing states were expected to do little  
to reverse damaged caused by hot, dry weather over the past few 
weeks, some market participants believed the precipitation will 
slow the deterioration in crop conditions that has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers were expected in Illinois and Indiana, two key growing  
states that hold the most potential for yield loss, but forecasters 
predict rainfall totals will amount to less than an inch. Still, 
the moisture gave investors a chance to take a breather after a 
sharp rally in the past few sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices also fell as investors squared their positions in  
advance on Thursday's early morning release of the U.S. Agriculture 
Department's latest production estimate and demand reports. 
</P>
<P>
	December wheat fell 7 1/2 cents to $2.89 1/4 a bushel; December corn  
fell 5 1/2 cents to $2.35 1/4 a bushel; December oats fell 1/4 cent to 
$1.19 a bushel; November soybeans fell 7 1/4 cents to $4.86 1/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE>  Police Searching for L.A. Shooter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A manhunt spread across the West today as  
authorities searched for the balding suspect who walked into a 
Jewish community center and fired more than 70 bullets from an 
assault-style gun before slipping away and vanishing in 
metropolitan Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive remained a mystery following the attack that wounded  
five people and stirred new unease in a nation struggling with 
seemingly mounting and pointless violence. Among the wounded were 
three young children, one of them critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing said by the suspect before the shooting,''  
Police Chief Bernard Parks said. ``It was indiscriminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect was identified by police as Buford Oneal Furrow, a  
37-year-old white man who was believed to have lived in California 
and Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived four minutes after Tuesday morning's shooting,  
gun smoke still lingering in the lobby of the suburban community 
center, Cmdr. David Kalish said. The gunman had already 
disappeared, leaving behind the wounded: three young boys attending 
day camp, a 16-year-old counselor and a 68-year-old receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow fled in a van and then stole a car, Kalish said.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators followed his trail across the city, from the shell  
casings that littered the center's lobby to the abandoned 
red-and-white van filled with ammunition, bulletproof vests, 
explosives, freeze-dried food and a booklet titled Ranger Handbook. 
The trail led to a green Toyota Corolla he was believed to have 
stolen and then left in front of a hotel a few miles from the 
community center. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers surrounded the hotel, but the search ended after four  
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were so close but still he managed to get away,'' Kalish  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have fanned out across California and Washington  
state. FBI agents visited the Olympia, Wash., home of a man 
believed to be Furrow's father Tuesday night, but refused to answer 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The abandoned van was purchased Saturday from the Tacoma (Wash.)  
Kar Korner, said the manager of the lot, who refused to be 
identified. Kalish identified Furrow as the buyer of the van, which 
had Washington plates. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was sentenced in May to eight months in jail for  
second-degree assault with a deadly weapon, KOMO-TV in Seattle 
reported Tuesday night. He never reported to the King County Jail 
as ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalish said it was unknown whether the center was targeted  
because the students were Jewish, but the Simon Wiesenthal Center 
said a book was found in the van written by the American Nazi 
Party. The Union of American Hebrew Congregations advised its 
synagogues and Jewish schools to tighten security. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence was the latest shooting at workplaces and schools  
across the country, and President Clinton and others spoke out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by  
gun violence,'' Clinton said in Washington. ``It calls on all of us 
not only to give our thoughts and prayers to the victims and their 
families, but intensify our resolve to make America a safer 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most seriously injured was a 5-year-old boy, shot in the  
abdomen and leg. He was in critical condition after six hours of 
surgery and his prognosis for recovery was fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a great desire to live and we supported that effort,''  
said surgeon Clarence Sutton Jr. at Providence Holy Cross Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Two 6-year-old boys and the teen-age counselor were in stable  
condition at hospitals. The receptionist, Isabelle Shalometh, was 
released from a hospital Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The day was marked by tragedy, uncertainty and -- for parents  
whose children escaped unharmed -- elation tempered by anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen children were in the center when the gunman  
burst into the North Valley Jewish Community Center and began 
spraying the lobby with bullets at 10:50 a.m., said Capt. Steve 
Ruda of the Los Angeles Fire Department. The exact make of the gun 
was not immediately released, though Ruda said he believed it was a 
9mm Uzi. 
</P>
<P>
	The toll could have been higher. About 250 children were at the  
center but many were outside playing when the gunman opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Four-year-old Gabrielle Fougner was inside when the firing  
began. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard booming,'' recalled the little girl dressed in blue  
shorts and a yellow T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Fougner, her 39-year-old father, found his daughter in a  
nearby park, where she and other children were taken from the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we first came, she told us a bad man came in and was  
shooting,'' he said. ``You hear about stuff in the news. Could this 
happen to me or could this happen to my children? Out here is exact 
proof, yes, it could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While SWAT teams were swarming around the community center and  
news and police helicopters buzzed overhead, about 20 small 
children were led from the building hand in hand and taken to a 
Jewish temple nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents rushed to the center and jammed against police lines  
trying to find out if their children were all right. Some parents 
wept and hugged one another, waiting while authorities made sure of 
everyone's identity. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Macales prayed and recited psalms as he rushed to check  
on his children, ages 2 and 3. ``My feeling about it is it's 
another case of someone acting out in rage,'' he said. ``I don't 
want to believe this is an act of anti-Semitism here in 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As police searched for the assailant, fear gripped some in the  
neighborhood, a community of mostly middle-class, single-family 
homes in the San Fernando Valley suburbs 30 miles northwest of 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was barricaded in my house all day,'' said Nancie Crannell,  
who lives a block from the center with her husband. ``I stayed away 
from the window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Escalante saw the shooting as a sign of the times.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's sick people everywhere now,'' said the 34-year-old,  
who lives three blocks away with his two children, age 10 and 13. 
``We're not safe anywhere.''

<HEADLINE> Clematis, a Many-Splendored Vine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- For Father's Day my son, a middle-aged  
gardener himself, gave me a clematis I appreciated not only for its 
beauty but for his confidence that I could make it grow. 
</P>
<P>
	I've been lucky before with clematis, a sometimes difficult  
vine, but each new plant presents a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this June's gift, I have had success with two clematises,  
both large-flowered, which intertwine on a split rail fence. One, a 
Barbara Jackman, blooms early in summer with bluish purple flowers 
and creamy white stamens. The other, a Henryi, also early blooming, 
displays creamy white flowers with dark stamens. 
</P>
<P>
	The new arrival, called Niobe, came potted and about to bloom,  
so I waited to see what the flowers would look like before I 
planted it along the same fence. 
</P>
<P>
	They turned out glorious -- a deep ruby red with yellow stamens.  
You could think of them, if you want, as creating a floral Old 
Glory motif together with the blue and white flowers already 
established there. That is, if the plant prospers; I'll have to 
wait until next year to find out. 
</P>
<P>
	The name Niobe is not a happy omen. If you recall, she was the  
prideful queen in classical mythology who bragged that she had many 
more children than a goddess who had only two. They were then all 
slain and she was turned to stone. Makes you wonder what people 
want to commemorate when they choose the nonbotanical names of 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyway, by the time my new clematis had flowered in its pot and  
I was ready to plant it, we were in the middle of a July heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
	The best times for planting clematis are early spring and fall,  
but plants from pots can be set out throughout the summer if kept 
well-watered, so I dug a hole and planted it. At this time of the 
year, my site is in shade until midday, which was a help. Clematis 
needs only four or five hours of sunlight a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the foot of the fence is shadier than the rest, and thus  
cooler, a condition that clematis likes. 
</P>
<P>
	Its vines climb up the fence and into the sunlight. The soil  
where you plant should be rich and well drained. My grounds tend 
towards the acid, so I put some lime in the hole to sweeten it. 
That had worked well before for my other clematises. 
</P>
<P>
	The reputation for difficulty that clematis has acquired  
probably stems mainly from the need to make sure the original 
planting conditions, especially the shady base, are right. A summer 
mulch helps to retain moisture. In cold weather, north of 
Washington, it's wise to mulch before a heavy frost. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest buzz on clematis has large-petaled blooms like mine  
going out of fashion in favor of varieties with smaller flowers. 
The larger ones supposedly are prone to disease. Also, some people 
think they're too showy. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, anyone who has gardened awhile knows that flower fashions  
come and go. My large-petaled Barbara Jackman and Henryi have been 
blooming early each summer for more than 20 years without trace of 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	And I'm not embarrassed to say I revel in their spectacular  
beauty, or showiness, and hope to continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, there's a clematis for every taste and with various  
blooming seasons. A catalog I'm looking at right now, Greer 
Gardens, 1280 Goodpasture Island Road, Eugene, Ore. 97401-1794 
(telephone 800-548-0111), features 39 large varieties and 28 of the 
smaller kind. 
</P>
<P>
	My son started a small-petaled, fall-blooming one, Paniculata,  
this year at the bottom of a stone fence where it will climb among 
the crevices and, if all goes well, cover the site with pure white 
fragrant flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from use as a climber on fences, walls, arches, posts,  
trees -- or onto other vines, like roses -- clematis, especially the 
small kind, makes a good ground cover. In one season, it can 
blanket the desired area with its green foliage and you get bonuses 
of blossoms here and there. 
</P>
<P>
	With clematis, the larger the flowers the fewer the number of  
blooms. It's up to you whether you want profusion or show or both. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Jewish Center Security Tightened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Security was tightened at Jewish community centers and schools  
around the country today following the shootings that wounded 
youngsters at a similar center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Buford O'Neal Furrow, identified as the suspect in the  
shootings, surrendered today in Las Vegas, Nev., the Union of 
American Hebrew Congregations had advised its synagogues and Jewish 
schools across the country to take steps following Tuesday's 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sacramento, Calif., where the FBI is investigating arson  
attacks that caused more than $1 million in damage to three 
synagogues, the Shalom School combined its classes into one and 
locked the classroom door Tuesday, said parent Stuart Nussbaum. 
Police stationed a patrol car outside, and the school also hired an 
extra security guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just very scary,'' Bloom said. ``It (the shooting) brings  
home the harsh reality that you can be shot at any moment. When 
things happen to the Jewish community anywhere in the world, as a 
Jew it makes your hair stand on end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the shooting at the North Valley Jewish Community Center  
near Los Angeles, security also was heightened at centers in 
Denver; New Orleans; the Boston area; the District of Columbia; and 
communities in New York, Maryland and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We brought in an off-duty police officer,'' said Bernie  
Karshmer, associate director of the Jewish Community Center in 
Denver. ``We'll have him at the preschool, and we'll have off-duty 
police here for the next three days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver police stepped up patrols of the area Tuesday and said  
the patrols would continue indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just decided to do that on our own,'' said police Lt. Eric  
Rubin. ``We're taking reasonable precautions at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once an hour in Washington, D.C., police officers stop by the  
Jewish Community Center, which houses a day-care center, a summer 
camp and a gym. A center in nearby Rockville, Md. was taking 
similar precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	Security in Massachusetts was stepped up at all 13 locations of  
the Jewish Community Centers of Greater Boston, said Alan Mann, 
executive vice president. Doors were locked and guards were posted, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we heard about the incident in Los Angeles we  
convened a staff crisis team to review what we wanted to do,'' Mann 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anti-Defamation League in San Francisco sponsored seminars  
on security for religious groups.

<P>
	Tight security runs counter to the way religious people operate,  
said Jonathan Bernstein, director of the league's Central Pacific 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to open their institutions to anyone who wants to  
come in,'' Bernstein said.

<HEADLINE>  Jewish Center Security Tightened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Security was tightened at Jewish community centers and schools  
around the country today following the shootings that wounded 
youngsters at a similar center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Buford O'Neal Furrow, identified as the suspect in the  
shootings, surrendered today in Las Vegas, Nev., the Union of 
American Hebrew Congregations had advised its synagogues and Jewish 
schools across the country to take steps following Tuesday's 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sacramento, Calif., where the FBI is investigating arson  
attacks that caused more than $1 million in damage to three 
synagogues, the Shalom School combined its classes into one and 
locked the classroom door Tuesday, said parent Stuart Nussbaum. 
Police stationed a patrol car outside, and the school also hired an 
extra security guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just very scary,'' Bloom said. ``It (the shooting) brings

<HEADLINE> Planes Face Insulation Replacement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. airlines will have to replace the  
insulation in nearly 700 airplanes over the next four years because 
it badly fails an anti-flame test that is being developed, the 
Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The airworthiness directive, however, will not require the  
sweeping insulation replacement that the agency had discussed back 
in October, shortly after a Swissair plane crashed off Nova Scotia 
following a report of smoke in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials said the agency backed off the plan, which would  
have ordered the replacement of insulation in nearly every U.S. 
commercial airplane, because recent research showed that most 
existing insulation would pass or only narrowly fail the new flame 
test. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the more limited order will apply to 699 U.S. airplanes  
insulated with the questionable product, metalized Mylar. They were 
built by the former McDonnell Douglas Corp., now owned by the 
Boeing Co., and include the MD-80, MD-88, MD-90, DC-10 and the 
MD-11. That is the type of Swissair plane that crashed last 
September, killing all 229 aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed order, airlines will have four years to  
replace metalized Mylar with products that pass the new flame test. 
The order will take effect after a 45-day comment period and time 
for revisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The carriers primarily affected are American Airlines,  
Continental, Delta and TWA, although Alaska Airlines, FedEx, Reno 
Air and US Airways fly some planes covered by the order. 
</P>
<P>
	Insulation is used in airplanes to keep passengers warm and to  
dampen engine noise and the sound of rushing air. It is often 
installed in sheets, much like attic insulation. In 1997, McDonnell 
Douglas told airlines they should consider replacing metalized 
Mylar because of it might be flammable. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Swissair crash, experiments the FAA has conducted in  
an effort to create a new test and flame retardancy standard for 
aircraft insulation have confirmed the manufacturer's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't just fail the test; it fails it by a wide margin,''  
Beth Erickson, director of the FAA's aircraft certification 
service, said in an interview. ``If there is a low-level ignition 
source, like an (electrical) arc, it will catch on fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some other insulations do not pass the new test, ``they  
miss it by a much narrower margin. Therefore, they don't pose a 
safety threat,'' Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the agency had caved in to pressure from the  
airlines, which balked at the expense of a wholesale replacement, 
Erickson said: ``No, the science helped drive us to the decisions 
that we were making.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed replacement will cost $255 million; a wholesale  
change would have run into the billions. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson said another concern was that replacing insulation that  
was considered a minor safety threat might create problems within 
an airplane, since insulation is often threaded behind wires and 
other potential ignition sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very thing that can cause the problem is damaged wiring,''  
she said. ``You don't want to do something that creates that 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the Swissair crash remains under investigation. The  
pilots of the New York-to-Geneva flight reported smoke in the 
cockpit 16 minutes before their MD-11 crashed into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, investigators have examined the aircraft's in-flight  
entertainment system -- a huge power consumer -- and other wiring 
around the cockpit and electrical bay, which sits below and just 
behind the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swissair plane was insulated with metalized Mylar, also  
generating questions about whether that may have helped spread an 
electrical fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Existing insulation is tested over an open flame or by throwing  
a lighted Q-Tip on it to see if it will burn. Under the new test, 
known by some in the aviation community as the ``Garvey Test'' 
because FAA Administrator Jane Garvey promised to create a new test 
standard, insulation is exposed to an open flame and an overhead 
heat source. 
</P>
<P>
	Any resulting fire cannot spread more than two inches from the  
open flame and must extinguish itself when the flame is removed. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said it plans to formally require the new test  
through its normal rule-making process. Erickson also said the FAA 
will likely order that new airplanes be built only with insulation 
that passes the new test.

<HEADLINE>  Pentagon Honors Steven Spielberg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Filmmaker Steven Spielberg is adding a few  
more awards to his growing collection: the military's highest 
civilian honor for his World War II epic, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' 
and a humanitarian award from the Smithsonian Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in the Army now,'' Spielberg joked as Defense Secretary  
William Cohen helped pin the Medal for Distinguished Public Service 
on his chest at a special Pentagon ceremony on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg told an audience that included top military leaders  
that his goal in making the movie was to ``remember unsparingly the 
sacrifices of my father's generation'' while trying to help his 
children's generation understand the importance of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg's father was a crew member in B-25 bombers in the war.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that today's youth have a tendency to live in the  
present and work for the future but to be totally ignorant of the 
past,'' said Spielberg, who is 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen called Spielberg's blockbuster, a graphic re-enactment of  
the Allies' invasion of Europe on D-Day, June 6, 1944, an 
``emotional catharsis'' for all who saw it, particularly World War 
II veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	```Ryan,' I must be quick to point out, is not a recruitment  
promotional for the Pentagon,'' Cohen said. ``It speaks to us, 
however, about the importance of values, discipline, determination 
and sacrifice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen joked that Spielberg had won ``nearly as many awards as we  
have forces deployed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Private Ryan'' won five 1999 Academy Awards: for directing and  
four other categories. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Spielberg: ``I feel that in my experience as a filmmaker,  
lightning has only struck twice in a way that has filled me up with 
such pride. One of those times was 'Schindler's List' and the other 
time was 'Saving Private Ryan.''' Spielberg won an Academy Award 
for his Holocaust film, ``Schindler's List,'' in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The award honored Spielberg for making ``a historic contribution  
to the national consciousness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other recent recipients of the award include former German  
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and former 
Sens. Bob Dole, R-Kan., and John Glenn, D-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg is a big Democratic contributor. He gave $381,023 to  
the Democratic National Committee in 1995-96, $1,000 to President 
Clinton's re-election campaign in 1995 and $1,000 to Vice President 
Al Gore this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Spielberg received the James Smithson Anniversary Medal  
in honor of both his film making and of his charitable work at a 
ceremony at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of 
Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
	He was honored for creating two foundations for strengthening  
Jewish life and preserving memories of the Holocaust, and another 
to help children with chronic illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony took place at the Smithsonian Institution's  
National Museum of Natural History. The medal has been awarded in 
the past to oceanographer Jacques Cousteau and Sir Edmund Hillary, 
the pioneer in climbing Mount Everest. 
</P>
<P>
	The medal was created in 1965 on the 200th anniversary of the  
birth of Smithson, whose will provided funds for the establishment 
of the Smithsonian Institution.

<HEADLINE> Alcoa Offers $5.6B for Reynolds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Alcoa Inc., the world's largest aluminum  
company, went public with an offer to buy No. 3 Reynolds Metals Co. 
for $5.6 billion in cash and stock just hours after three foreign 
aluminum rivals announced a deal that would catapult them to the 
No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa and Reynolds would have a combined revenue of about $21  
billion, rivaling the new marriage of Alusuisse-Lonza (Algroup) of 
Switzerland, Pechiney of France and Alcan Aluminium of Canada, 
which have combined revenue of $21.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In disclosing the offer Wednesday, Alcoa said it had been  
pursuing Reynolds since March 22 and was trying to get its rival to 
negotiate a deal. It asked for an answer by Monday or it would 
consider other options for closing a deal, presumably including 
taking a hostile offer directly to Reynolds' shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds, based in Richmond, Va., said in a terse statement that  
its board would consider the offer Sunday and that it would have no 
further comment until after the close of business Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But shareholders were betting on a bigger bid, sending Reynolds  
shares above the $65-a-share offer from Alcoa, in part because some 
analysts have a significantly higher value of Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	The flurry of activity in the rather staid aluminum industry was  
not surprising in a world that is increasingly made up of 
mega-companies in such industries as oil and automobiles, said 
Ilker Baybars, senior deputy dean at the Carnegie Mellon Graduate 
Business School in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Such combinations are aimed at keeping the surviving companies  
competitive by cutting costs, through reducing the work force, and 
in improving productivity. No plans for job cuts were immediately 
announced by Alcoa. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of Alcan and the Swiss and French aluminum  
makers is coming about because ``they're really nervous about 
losing their share to the U.S. in global markets,'' Baybars said. 
He said Pittsburgh-based Alcoa simply wants to hold on to its No. 1 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they acquire Reynolds they will maintain that,'' Baybars  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A combination of Alcoa and Reynolds would unite companies that  
make the basic building blocks for products ranging from 
automobiles, appliances and airplanes to beer and soft-drink cans. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa had $15.3 billion in revenue last year. With operations in  
31 countries, it is the world's largest producer of alumina, the 
principal ingredient in aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds, with $5.9 billion in revenue last year, has operations  
in 24 countries and is best known for Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil. 
But it also sells consumer products such as plastic wrap and wax 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts said Alcoa's offer -- as well as the European  
merger that would come in the form of a share-swap arrangement -- 
could face significant regulatory hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa first approached Reynolds in March but made its offer  
public on Wednesday in a ``Dear Jerry'' letter to Reynolds' chief 
executive, Jeremiah J. Sheehan, from Alcoa's CEO, Alain J.P. Belda. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusual tactic came just as analysts were absorbing the  
announcement of a three-way deal joining Alcoa's European rivals in 
a pact that would have placed the trio as an undisputed world 
leader in aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the beginning of June you stated publicly Reynolds'  
intention to `look at significant growth that can be achieved 
through merger and acquisition activity,''' Belda wrote Sheehan. 
``You further indicated your belief that our industry `is moving 
toward global consolidation' in which Reynolds plans to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think those views are entirely congruent with our prior  
proposal and with our continued desire to negotiate a combination 
of our two companies using Alcoa common shares as the principal 
currency of exchange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa offered $65 in cash for about half of Reynolds' shares and  
the equivalent value in Alcoa shares for the rest of the stock. 
Belda indicated a willingness to negotiate an all-stock deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The $65 offer represented a 16 percent premium over Reynolds'  
closing price Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time trading ended Wednesday on the New York Stock  
Exchange, Reynolds was up 16.8 percent, or by $9.37 1/2, at $65.25 a 
share as one of the most active issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said with Reynolds' stock already exceeding the offer,  
traders likely were betting there would be a sweetened deal, either 
negotiated or through a hostile bid by Alcoa. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa spokeswoman Bonita Cersosimo said the company would not  
discuss anything beyond its news release. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to wait to see how this process unfolds,'' she  
said. ``Above all else we want this to be a friendly negotiation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa rose 4.4 percent to close with a gain of $2.93 3/4 at $69.37 1/2  
a share on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE>  Police Searching for L.A. Shooter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A manhunt spread across the West today as  
authorities searched for the balding suspect who walked into a 
Jewish community center and fired more than 70 bullets from an 
assault-style gun before slipping away and vanishing in 
metropolitan Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive remained a mystery following the attack that wounded  
five people and stirred new unease in a nation struggling with 
seemingly mounting and pointless violence. Among the wounded were 
three young children, one of them critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing said by the suspect before the shooting,''  
Police Chief Bernard Parks said. ``It was indiscriminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect was identified by police as Buford Oneal Furrow, a  
37-year-old white man who was believed to have lived in California 
and Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived four minutes after Tuesday morning's shooting,  
gun smoke still lingering in the lobby of the suburban community 
center, Cmdr. David Kalish said. The gunman had already 
disappeared, leaving behind the wounded: three young boys attending 
day camp, a 16-year-old counselor and a 68-year-old receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow fled in a van and then stole a car, Kalish said.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators followed his trail across the city, from the shell  
casings that littered the center's lobby to the abandoned 
red-and-white van filled with ammunition, bulletproof vests, 
explosives, freeze-dried food and a booklet titled Ranger Handbook. 
The trail led to a green Toyota Corolla he was believed to have 
stolen and then left in front of a hotel a few miles from the 
community center. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers surrounded the hotel, but the search ended after four  
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were so close but still he managed to get away,'' Kalish  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have fanned out across California and Washington  
state. FBI agents visited the Olympia, Wash., home of a man 
believed to be Furrow's father Tuesday night, but refused to answer 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The abandoned van was purchased Saturday from the Tacoma (Wash.)  
Kar Korner, said the manager of the lot, who refused to be 
identified. Kalish identified Furrow as the buyer of the van, which 
had Washington plates. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was sentenced in May to eight months in jail for  
second-degree assault with a deadly weapon, KOMO-TV in Seattle 
reported Tuesday night. He never reported to the King County Jail 
as ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalish said it was unknown whether the center was targeted  
because the students were Jewish, but the Simon Wiesenthal Center 
said a book was found in the van written by the American Nazi 
Party. The Union of American Hebrew Congregations advised its 
synagogues and Jewish schools to tighten security. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence was the latest shooting at workplaces and schools  
across the country, and President Clinton and others spoke out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by  
gun violence,'' Clinton said in Washington. ``It calls on all of us 
not only to give our thoughts and prayers to the victims and their 
families, but intensify our resolve to make America a safer 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most seriously injured was a 5-year-old boy, shot in the  
abdomen and leg. He was in critical condition after six hours of 
surgery and his prognosis for recovery was fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a great desire to live and we supported that effort,''  
said surgeon Clarence Sutton Jr. at Providence Holy Cross Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Two 6-year-old boys and the teen-age counselor were in stable  
condition at hospitals. The receptionist, Isabelle Shalometh, was 
released from a hospital Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The day was marked by tragedy, uncertainty and -- for parents  
whose children escaped unharmed -- elation tempered by anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen children were in the center when the gunman  
burst into the North Valley Jewish Community Center and began 
spraying the lobby with bullets at 10:50 a.m., said Capt. Steve 
Ruda of the Los Angeles Fire Department. The exact make of the gun 
was not immediately released, though Ruda said he believed it was a 
9mm Uzi. 
</P>
<P>
	The toll could have been higher. About 250 children were at the  
center but many were outside playing when the gunman opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Four-year-old Gabrielle Fougner was inside when the firing  
began. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard booming,'' recalled the little girl dressed in blue  
shorts and a yellow T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Fougner, her 39-year-old father, found his daughter in a  
nearby park, where she and other children were taken from the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we first came, she told us a bad man came in and was  
shooting,'' he said. ``You hear about stuff in the news. Could this 
happen to me or could this happen to my children? Out here is exact 
proof, yes, it could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While SWAT teams were swarming around the community center and  
news and police helicopters buzzed overhead, about 20 small 
children were led from the building hand in hand and taken to a 
Jewish temple nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents rushed to the center and jammed against police lines  
trying to find out if their children were all right. Some parents 
wept and hugged one another, waiting while authorities made sure of 
everyone's identity. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Macales prayed and recited psalms as he rushed to check  
on his children, ages 2 and 3. ``My feeling about it is it's 
another case of someone acting out in rage,'' he said. ``I don't 
want to believe this is an act of anti-Semitism here in 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As police searched for the assailant, fear gripped some in the  
neighborhood, a community of mostly middle-class, single-family 
homes in the San Fernando Valley suburbs 30 miles northwest of 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was barricaded in my house all day,'' said Nancie Crannell,  
who lives a block from the center with her husband. ``I stayed away 
from the window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Escalante saw the shooting as a sign of the times.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's sick people everywhere now,'' said the 34-year-old,  
who lives three blocks away with his two children, age 10 and 13. 
``We're not safe anywhere.''

<HEADLINE>  Pentagon Honors Steven Spielberg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Filmmaker Steven Spielberg is adding a few  
more awards to his growing collection: the military's highest 
civilian honor for his World War II epic, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' 
and a humanitarian award from the Smithsonian Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in the Army now,'' Spielberg joked as Defense Secretary  
William Cohen helped pin the Medal for Distinguished Public Service 
on his chest at a special Pentagon ceremony on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg told an audience that included top military leaders  
that his goal in making the movie was to ``remember unsparingly the 
sacrifices of my father's generation'' while trying to help his 
children's generation understand the importance of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg's father was a crew member in B-25 bombers in the war.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that today's youth have a tendency to live in the  
present and work for the future but to be totally ignorant of the 
past,'' said Spielberg, who is 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen called Spielberg's blockbuster, a graphic re-enactment of  
the Allies' invasion of Europe on D-Day, June 6, 1944, an 
``emotional catharsis'' for all who saw it, particularly World War 
II veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	```Ryan,' I must be quick to point out, is not a recruitment  
promotional for the Pentagon,'' Cohen said. ``It speaks to us, 
however, about the importance of values, discipline, determination 
and sacrifice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen joked that Spielberg had won ``nearly as many awards as we  
have forces deployed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Private Ryan'' won five 1999 Academy Awards: for directing and  
four other categories. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Spielberg: ``I feel that in my experience as a filmmaker,  
lightning has only struck twice in a way that has filled me up with 
such pride. One of those times was 'Schindler's List' and the other 
time was 'Saving Private Ryan.''' Spielberg won an Academy Award 
for his Holocaust film, ``Schindler's List,'' in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The award honored Spielberg for making ``a historic contribution  
to the national consciousness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other recent recipients of the award include former German  
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and former 
Sens. Bob Dole, R-Kan., and John Glenn, D-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg is a big Democratic contributor. He gave $381,023 to  
the Democratic National Committee in 1995-96, $1,000 to President 
Clinton's re-election campaign in 1995 and $1,000 to Vice President 
Al Gore this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Spielberg received the James Smithson Anniversary Medal  
in honor of both his film making and of his charitable work at a 
ceremony at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of 
Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
	He was honored for creating two foundations for strengthening  
Jewish life and preserving memories of the Holocaust, and another 
to help children with chronic illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony took place at the Smithsonian Institution's  
National Museum of Natural History. The medal has been awarded in 
the past to oceanographer Jacques Cousteau and Sir Edmund Hillary, 
the pioneer in climbing Mount Everest. 
</P>
<P>
	The medal was created in 1965 on the 200th anniversary of the  
birth of Smithson, whose will provided funds for the establishment 
of the Smithsonian Institution.

<HEADLINE> INS: Legal Immigration Rate Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States granted legal permanent  
residence to 660,477 foreigners last year, marking the lowest level 
of legal immigration in a decade as the federal immigration service 
struggled to deal with a growing backlog of green card 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures for fiscal 1998, announced Wednesday by the  
Immigration and Naturalization Service, reflected a 17 percent drop 
from 1997 and a 28 percent drop from the year before that. 
</P>
<P>
	INS estimated it would have granted legal permanent residence to  
as many as 140,000 additional people last year had it been able to 
keep pace with its caseload. The backlog currently stands at 
890,000 -- a sharp increase from its backlog of 121,000 applications 
in fiscal 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 figure ``doesn't reflect a drop in demand. It's  
actually a reflection of the growth in the adjustment of status 
backlog,'' said INS spokeswoman Eyleen Schmidt. With the rising 
backlog, processing times have soared from an average of four 
months in 1994 to as much as three years now. 
</P>
<P>
	``The `S' in INS does stand for service. They may want to  
remember that occasionally,'' said Matt Tallmer, spokesman for the 
American Immigration Lawyers Association. ``Their backlog is just 
atrocious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legal immigration figure is only a partial snapshot of  
overall immigration rates. Last year, 637,000 people were granted 
citizenship. The citizenship backlog, for which INS has been 
roundly denounced on and off Capitol Hill, now stands at 1.7 
million cases. 
</P>
<P>
	INS' priority is to address the citizenship backlog first before  
tackling the delay in green card adjudications, Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the rising green card backlog owes to Congress' decision  
in the mid-1990s to allow illegal immigrants eligible for legal 
permanent residency to pay a fine and file their paperwork at INS 
offices within the United States. Before, they had to leave the 
country and apply at U.S. consulates abroad, which are operated by 
the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The since-ended program, known as 245(i), ``appears to be the  
chief reason for INS' inability to issue green cards expeditiously 
enough,'' said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for 
Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors reduced legal 
immigration rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress placed an enormous burden on the INS at the same time  
as citizenship applications increased dramatically,'' Krikorian 
added. ``Some people are going to point to this as another sign of 
the INS' dysfunction but in fact this is really a consequence of 
Congress' decision, not INS'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly three-quarters of the green cards granted last year went  
to relatives of U.S. citizens, as expected under a federal 
immigration policy that places highest priority on the 
reunification of families. Another 77,517 green cards were granted 
for business reasons, while refugees and asylees accounted for 
nearly 55,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
	One-fifth of the legal immigrants admitted last year came from  
Mexico. Immigrants from North America accounted for 38 percent of 
the total, followed by 33 percent from Asia, and 14 percent from 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	California, New York, Florida, Texas, New Jersey and Illinois  
were the top destinations for the new immigrants -- as has been the 
case since 1971, INS said.

<HEADLINE> IBM PC Offers Built-In Digital Modem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM is introducing personal computers with  
built-in digital modems, another major step in a sudden scramble to 
make high-speed Internet access commonplace in the home. 
</P>
<P>
	The new internal modems, made by Texas Instruments, are being  
offered as an optional feature with IBM's Aptiva line of computers, 
boosting the price by about $100, IBM said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from that added expense, a built-in modem would likely  
make it easier and cheaper for people to switch from a dial-up 
Internet connection to the speedy, ``always-on'' technology known 
as DSL, or digital subscriber line. 
</P>
<P>
	While dial-up and DSL both transmit over a regular copper phone  
wire, DSL is 50-to-100 times faster than a standard connection 
using even the fastest non-digital modem. 
</P>
<P>
	``To download a graphic-rich Internet page with audio using a  
(standard) modem, it'll take 1 1/2-to-2 minutes. With DSL at lower 
speed, it's about 15 seconds,'' said Marc Cetto, a marketing 
executive with Texas Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	Another advantage of DSL over dial-up is that a person can use  
the phone and the Internet connection at the same time with only 
one phone line. 
</P>
<P>
	A person who signs up for DSL generally pays hundreds of dollars  
in equipment and installation fees and a monthly service charge of 
$30 and up, depending on the speed. 
</P>
<P>
	To provide DSL service, a phone company usually needs to splice  
a phone wire outside a person's home and run the portion of the 
wire intended for the DSL connection into the desired room. 
</P>
<P>
	The service provider then connects the phone jack to the  
computer with an external modem and opens up the computer to 
install a special communications card. 
</P>
<P>
	With a DSL-ready computer, the phone wire would still need to be  
spliced, but there's no need for an external modem and no need to 
install special equipment in the PC. 
</P>
<P>
	The new DSL-equipped Aptivas, which are only available direct  
from IBM, represent the first broad rollout of an internal digital 
modem by a PC maker. Compaq Computer has equipped two of its 
Presario models with a DSL modem, while Dell Computer can equip its 
machines to work with a DSL service offered by U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, DSL service was still unavailable in most of the  
country as local telephone companies avoided the expense of 
upgrading their systems. 
</P>
<P>
	But with AT&AMP;T leading a sudden charge to sell consumers  
high-speed Internet access and phone service over cable TV wires -- 
committing billions to cable system upgrades -- the telephone 
companies began scrambling to deploy DSL. 
</P>
<P>
	Numbering less than 50,000 at the beginning of the year, DSL  
subscribers are expected to reach more than 800,000 and maybe 1 
million by the end of 1999, according to Texas Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	And even though DSL service is fairly new throughout the  
country, prices are already falling sharply with numerous rivals 
leasing the local phone monopoly's lines to sell the service. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, U S West cut its monthly DSL fee to $30, which doesn't  
include the $20 or so a subscriber would also have to pay for 
Internet access through a company like America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, in conjunction with the rollout of its DSL-ready  
Aptivas, IBM announced a marketing initiative in the San Francisco 
area with Pacific Bell, the local phone company serving California. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers in the San Francisco area who buy an 800E model priced  
at $948 or a 902E priced at $1,398 can sign up for a year of DSL 
service for $39 a month, excluding the monthly Internet charge. For 
the first six weeks of the promotion, Pacific Bell is waiving the 
$198 set-up and equipment charge.

<HEADLINE> Frank Robinson Has Prostate Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hall of Famer Frank Robinson was released  
from USC-Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital on 
Wednesday, two days after undergoing surgery to remove a cancerous 
prostate gland. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing well, that's why he was released only two days  
after the surgery,'' hospital spokesman Paul Dingsdale said. ``They 
expect a full recovery. I understand he was in good spirits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The operation, called a radical prostatectomy, was performed by  
Dr. Donald Skinner, chairman of urology at USC. According to 
Skinner, Robinson's prostate cancer was discovered as a result of 
an abnormal PSA blood test found during a routine physical 
examination earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who turns 64 later this month, hit .294 with 586 home  
runs in a 21-year big-league career, which ended in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who played most of his career with the Cincinnati Reds  
and Baltimore Orioles, was the National League MVP while playing 
for Cincinnati in 1961, and the AL MVP with Baltimore five years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital said he plans to return as an analyst for Fox  
Sports on Aug. 28.

<HEADLINE> Teams Using All Available Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In this summer of blowout baseball, with team earned run  
averages hovering at the second-highest figure this century, usable 
pitchers are in short supply. Resourceful managers are searching 
for available arms wherever they can find them -- even on aging 
third basemen with 3,000 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice this week, position players showed up on the mound, sent  
out as sacrificial lambs to finish off fiascos. For Matt Franco of 
the Mets, it was the second outing this season; for Wade Boggs of 
the Devil Rays, it was the second of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is that nobody got hurt. That, however, was purely  
by accident. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Franco's 75-mph fastballs nearly hit Mark Grudzielanek of  
the Dodgers in the head. Franco was so shaken by the episode that 
he felt obliged to call the Los Angeles clubhouse after the game to 
apologize. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they were guessing,'' he said, ``because I was  
guessing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famer Tom Seaver, now broadcasting Mets games, was  
outraged by the affair, calling it a travesty that displayed a lack 
of respect for the game. Manager Bobby Valentine couldn't see what 
all the fuss was about, saying he had only one pitcher left and he 
wasn't going to use him in a lost cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco came away from his adventure allowing one run -- on a  
bases-loaded walk. At least he was well-rested. He hadn't pitched 
since July 2 in another Mets rout. 
</P>
<P>
	That paled by the amount of rest Boggs had between assignments.  
He tried out his knuckleball for one scoreless inning in 1997 with 
the New York Yankees, then put it in mothballs until Tuesday night 
when the Orioles were en route to a 17-1 victory over Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a feeling about the fifth inning,'' he said. ``My palms  
started getting sweaty and Bobby Witt kept saying, `You're in this 
game, dude.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after getting his 3,000th hit, Boggs trudged out to  
the mound, pitching out of a bases-loaded jam in the eighth inning 
and sticking around to work the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Franco, he gave up one run and nobody got hurt, not even  
him. It was a little dicey in the ninth inning, though, when he 
faced slugger Albert Belle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I was thinking about when Albert came up was,  
don't hit it back to me,'' Boggs said. ``I can take it at 90 feet, 
but 60 feet is a little close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franco and Boggs were the latest position players pressed into  
mound duty this season, where the team ERA stands at 4.75. Earlier, 
catcher Keith Osik of the Pirates threw an inning against Houston 
and third baseman Gary Gaetti of the Cubs worked one inning against 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies scored twice on Gaetti, who threw one shutout  
inning each of the last two years for St. Louis. Osik went through 
a tougher ordeal. He was lit up for four runs, all of them earned, 
and now is laboring under the burden of a 36.00 ERA. Compared to 
that, Franco's 13.50 is acceptable, and Boggs' 6.75 and Gaetti's 
6.00 are absolutely brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the best part-time pitcher in history was a guy who  
started out in that role, but found more productive work elsewhere. 
Even after Babe Ruth became baseball's most feared slugger, he made 
cameo mound appearances for the Yankees, winning five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth is the only pitcher who had over 700 home runs but Boggs is  
just the latest 3,000-hit man to make it to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	At one time or another during their Hall of Fame careers, Cap  
Anson, Honus Wagner, Tris Speaker, Stan Musial and Ty Cobb, all 
members of that exclusive club, took turns pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner was the best of them, appearing in one game in 1900 and  
another in 1902. He allowed seven hits in eight innings with six 
walks and six strikeouts. What's more, he didn't give up any runs, 
leaving him with the best earned run average in history -- 0.00.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Issues Peacekeeper Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the  
Geneva Conventions governing international combat, the United 
Nations has announced a set of rules holding U.N. peacekeepers to 
the same laws that govern soldiers' actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued an executive order that  
essentially puts on paper the principles U.N. force commanders have 
used for five decades -- that the Geneva Conventions' rules for 
combatants apply to U.N. peacekeepers involved in active fighting. 
They too must protect civilians, give humane treatment to 
prisoners, restrict their use of weapons and face prosecution in 
their homelands if they violate any of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations laid out the rules Tuesday. They will become  
effective Thursday, when the 50th anniversary of the Geneva 
Conventions will be commemorated. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. document gained momentum in the early 1990s, when U.N.  
peacekeepers in Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia were increasingly drawn 
into conflicts in which they not only acted in self-defense but 
used force to do their jobs -- sometimes excessively. 
</P>
<P>
	During the U.N. mission in Somalia, for example, a handful of  
peacekeepers from Canada, Italy and Belgium were accused of 
committing atrocities against Somalis, including dangling a boy 
over an open fire and force-feeding pork to a Muslim Somali boy 
accused of stealing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to reaffirm on the 50th anniversary of the  
Geneva Conventions that the U.N. itself and U.N. soldiers are 
subject to the same rules as everyone else,'' said Reed Brody, 
advocacy director of Human Rights Watch in New York, who welcomed 
Annan's order. 
</P>
<P>
	As an international organization and not a state, the United  
Nations cannot sign onto the Geneva Conventions, making Annan's 
order the binding substitute. 
</P>
<P>
	The order only covers U.N. military operations and Security  
Council-authorized enforcement missions in which the United Nations 
commands the force, a senior U.N. official told reporters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't apply, for example, to the Security Council-endorsed  
peacekeeping mission in Kosovo because NATO -- not the United 
Nations -- commands the military personnel, the official said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The official acknowledged the United Nations had no way to  
compel national courts to prosecute the cases, but said the future 
International Criminal Court might have jurisdiction over 
peacekeepers who commit war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Nordic and Latin American countries voiced philosophical  
problems with the document because it essentially equates U.N. 
peacekeepers with warriors in terms of their mutual rules of 
engagement, the U.N. official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a cover letter, Annan acknowledged the controversy but said  
the order's ``promulgation and dissemination in times of peace will 
diminish the risk of violation in times of war.''

<HEADLINE> Banker Convicted in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Macquarie Bank executive director Simon  
Gautier Hannes was found guilty Wednesday of Australia's biggest 
insider trading crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannes showed no emotion as the jury forewoman declared him  
guilty of using confidential information to make 2 million 
Australian dollars ($1.3 million) from the 1996 takeover of 
Australian transport company TNT Ltd. by Dutch company Koninklijke 
PTT Nederland NV. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, after a two-month trial, the jury found Hannes, 39,  
guilty of two other breaches of the Financial Transaction Reports 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannes had entered pleas of innocent to all three charges.  
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution said Hannes used confidential information and  
the alias Mark Booth to invest in TNT call options ahead of the 
Dutch company's share offer in October 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Macquarie Bank, an Australian investment bank, was advising TNT  
on the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Cecily Backhouse revoked Hannes' bail until sentencing on  
Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian Securities and Investments Commission said he was  
the fourth person convicted of insider trading but the first to 
plead innocent and go to trial.

<HEADLINE> College Cataloging Delany Material </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Librarians at St. Augustine's College have  
started the massive task of cataloging materials donated to the 
school from the estate of Raleigh's famous centenarian sisters, 
Sadie and Bessie Delany. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea that the collection would be as rich as it is,''  
said Linda Simmons-Henry, the library director at St. Augustine's. 
``This is a collection of a 100-year period of an African-American 
family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Delanys' best-selling 1993 novel, ``Having Our Say,''  
chronicled the two sisters' lives, which began in the 1880s on St. 
Augustine's campus, where they were raised with their eight 
brothers and sisters. Their father, Bishop Henry Beard Delany, the 
principal of the college, was the first black elected Episcopal 
priest in America. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters went on to write ``The Delany Sisters' Book of  
Everyday Wisdom'' in 1994. Bessie Delany died in 1995 at age 104. 
Sadie went on to write ``On My Own, Life without Bessie'' in 1997 
before her death in January at age 109.

<HEADLINE> Utah gasoline prices hit record high </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Gasoline prices have reached a record high  
in Utah, and shortages in California are blamed. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price for a gallon of self-serve, unleaded regular  
gasoline in the Salt Lake City area on Tuesday was $1.35 a gallon, 
said Rolayne Fairclough, Utah spokeswoman for the American 
Automobile Association. The previous record was $1.33, set in 
October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Two major oil refineries on the West Coast exploded earlier this  
year and were knocked out of production. Problems also have 
occurred on some of the pipelines going into California. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been nothing but problems on the West Coast, and  
they have been going on all summer long,'' said Lee Peacock of the 
Utah Petroleum Association. 
</P>
<P>
	California refineries typically supply most of the gas along the  
West Coast and into Nevada and southern Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``when gasoline supplies get tight in California, we'll see  
gas from Utah flowing as far south as Las Vegas,'' said Derrick 
Regal of BP Amoco's refinery in Salt Lake City. ``That is what is 
happening right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other factors include the usual increase in prices during the  
summer, when drive more, Fairclough said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And with our strong economy, people will take off on summer  
trips or a weekend drive no matter what the price of gasoline,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacock suggested Utah gasoline prices could be at or near their  
peak for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are now getting in those last-minute summer trips, so  
we could see demand starting to slack off,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lycos Nixes 'Jews for Jesus' Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- After receiving complaints from some in  
the Jewish community, a major internet search engine says it will 
not renew an advertisement from Jews for Jesus, The Boston Globe 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos Inc. of Waltham said it received complaints about the ad  
from several Jewish people who took offense at the ad's appearance 
on their screens after typing in the word ``Jewish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jews for Jesus paid $1,700 for the ad, which started running  
July 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad, which promotes a book on the group's religious  
philosophy, read: 
</P>
<P>
	``The end of the world is no time to finally realize Jesus is  
the Messiah. (It's all in the book.) Click here for a free copy!'' 
</P>
<P>
	When users clicked, a Web page for Jews for Jesus appeared.  
</P>
<P>
	The page originally also referenced Lycos, but was changed after  
complaints were received and at Lycos's prompting. Lycos's general 
counsel, Jeffrey Snider, said the company did not want to give 
users the impression they endorsed Jews for Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	Started in the 1970s, Jews for Jesus practices Judaism, yet  
regards Jesus as the Messiah. It has 70,000 followers nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Snider said the ad's contract, which expires in several days,  
was not renewed because ``controversial advertising is bad for 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added the company does not want Jews to boycott Lycos.  
</P>
<P>
	The ad was opposed by the Anti-Defamation League's Boston  
office. Diane Kolb, associate director, said she believes the 
message is misleading and blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jews can't be for Jesus,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lycos officials did not say how many complaints they had  
received over the advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jews for Jesus officials said they were disappointed their  
message was restricted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Web is supposed to be a marketplace for all kinds of  
ideas, and people can click on them or pass them by,'' said Susan 
Perlman, spokeswoman for Jews for Jesus.

<HEADLINE> Customs Changing Search Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dogged by investigations and lawsuits alleging  
abusive searches, the Customs Service said today that it will 
obtain the approval of a federal magistrate when it wants to hold a 
passenger for more than four hours who is suspected of smuggling 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	That change -- the latest policy change involving checking  
airline passengers for drugs -- would take effect Oct. 1, Customs 
Commissioner Raymond Kelly told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, Customs can now detain passengers for any period of  
time without having to go to a federal judge for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the policy change, Customs would be required to make a  
case before a federal judge showing that it has ``reasonable 
suspicion'' to keep the passenger in custody. Customs would have to 
go to the magistrate after a person has been held for four hours or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	If the judge deems that there isn't reasonable suspicion to hold  
the passenger, he or she is released, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the judge determines there is reasonable suspicion, then  
Customs can continue to hold a passenger, and, following 
appropriate procedures, can subject them to more advanced body 
searches, such as a medically supervised X-ray at a hospital or a 
monitored bowel movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs officers use searches to try to catch smugglers who hide  
cocaine or heroin inside their clothes or swallow packets of drugs. 
The searches usually begin with a pat-down and, with reasonable 
suspicion, can proceed to a strip search, X-ray or monitored bowel 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is facing numerous lawsuits over body searches, first  
reported by The Associated Press last December, alleging that 
people were singled out because of their race and gender. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 50,892 of the 71.5 million international air travelers who  
passed through Customs in 1998 were subjected to some level of body 
search, most of them simple pat-downs, Customs officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs also said that in May it began to collect, for the first  
time, uniform data on the race, gender, age and citizenship of 
people detained for a personal search. In the past, that 
information wasn't reported in a consistent manner. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs, which has taken a number of steps to respond to  
criticism over its body search procedures, also said it will help 
passengers who have been detained but weren't found to have 
smuggled drugs if their travel plans are disrupted. Customs said it 
would help such people arrange for airline, hotel or transportation 
and pick up the tab.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Suspect Has Hate Group Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The man who surrendered in connection with the shooting at a  
Jewish community center in Los Angeles has ties to hate groups in 
the Northwest and had been ordered by a court to continue taking 
prescription medication. 
</P>
<P>
	A man who identified himself as Buford O. Furrow turned himself  
in today to the FBI in Las Vegas, Nev., FBI spokeswoman Julie 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	A source said he confessed and told investigators ``he wanted  
this to be a wake-up call to America to kill Jews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow is listed in a database maintained by the Southern  
Poverty Law Center of people connected with radical groups, said 
Mark Potok, a researcher with the center based in Montgomery, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Potok said Furrow was a member of Aryan Nations in 1995, and  
said he has a photo of Furrow in a Nazi uniform, taken that year at 
the Aryan Nations Compound in Hayden Lake, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	A van believed driven by Furrow contained a book, ``War Cycles,  
Peace Cycles,'' written by Richard Kelly Hoskins, whom Potok called 
``one of the principal ideologues of Christian Identity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Identity is a religious group that considers white  
people the true Israelites and superior to Jews and nonwhites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Identity is a post-millennial religion,'' Potok said. ``That  
means that hard-line Identity adherents believe that in order for 
Christ to return to Earth, the globe must be swept clean of satanic 
forces -- meaning Jews, homosexuals and a whole laundry list of 
other enemies. So it's a belligerent religion. It's a religion that 
demands that its followers take up the gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Rudolph, the man accused in the Birmingham, Ala., abortion  
clinic and Atlanta Olympic bombings, also is believed to be an 
Identity member, Potok said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times reported today that Furrow tried last year to  
commit himself at the Fairfax Psychiatric Hospital in Kirkland, a 
Seattle suburb, according to Dr. Tim Rogge, the hospital's former 
medical director. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rogge said, at one point Furrow pulled a knife on  
several staff members. 
</P>
<P>
	King County court records in Seattle show that Furrow pleaded  
guilty on April 26 this year to a second-degree assault with a 
knife. He was sentenced to eight months in jail, and 12 months 
community supervision. He got credit for time already served and 
was released in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow also was barred from buying firearms, and the court  
ordered Furrow to continue taking certain prescribed medicine, said 
Veltry Johnson, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections 
in Olympia, Wash. Johnson wouldn't identify the type of drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said Rogge didn't know what psychiatric problems  
Furrow may have had. He said it was likely Furrow was ``looking for 
some safe place where he could get some kind of help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spokesman-Review of Spokane, Wash., reported today that  
Furrow once lived with Debbie Mathews, widow of Robert J. Mathews, 
founder of another hate group, the Order. Mathews was killed in 
1984 when his hideout caught fire during a shootout with federal 
agents on Washington's Whidbey Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (Ms. Mathews) dumped him a year or so ago, and I  
haven't seen him since,'' Metaline Falls, Wash., town marshal Rick 
Reiber told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	No one answered the telephone this morning when The Associated  
Press called the Metaline Falls home of Debra Mathews. 
</P>
<P>
	After Mathews' death, 22 other Order members were convicted or  
pleaded guilty after being indicted on racketeering charges. They 
were accused of robberies that netted more than $4 million, as well 
as at least one hate crime, the 1984 murder of Alan Berg, a Jewish 
talk-radio host in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents spoke to Furrow's parents near Olympia, Wash., on  
Tuesday after interviewing neighbors Janet and Tim Tyrolt, Mrs. 
Tyrolt said. She said she recognized Furrow from his mug shot on 
television news. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she met Furrow two or three months ago at their  
mailboxes along a rural highway north of Olympia, and they both 
joked about how dangerous it was to dash across the road to check 
the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, ``he actually stopped the traffic for me,'' Mrs.  
Tyrolt said. ``It was really nice.''

<HEADLINE> R.I. Boy Scouts Issue Gay Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A local chapter of the Boy Scouts of  
America has acknowledged that a Scout can remain a Scout even if 
he's gay, as long as he isn't open about it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Narragansett Council of the Scouts issued a written  
statement late Tuesday in response to controversy over a 
16-year-old Eagle Scout who has threatened legal action, claiming 
he was discriminated against because he is a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement, similar to the military's ``don't ask, don't  
tell'' policy, reaffirmed the group's position that being gay is 
``inconsistent with'' the oath all Scouts must take in which they 
vow to be ``morally straight'' and ``clean in thought, word and 
deed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the statement suggested that Scouts who are covertly gay  
won't be pushed out, by specifying that the organization ``does not 
accept those who openly self-identify as homosexuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds to me like the Boy Scouts are in retreat,'' said  
Mary Bonauto, an attorney with the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and 
Defenders in Boston. ``They acknowledge the sexual orientation of 
their members is none of their business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chapter said the statement had been approved by and written  
in consultation with the Scouts' national organization, which on 
Wednesday referred calls back to Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagle Scout, who has not been identified by name, says he  
was denied a job answering phones at a Rhode Island Scout camp 
after he admitted to the camp director that he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey Supreme Court recently ruled that the Boy Scouts'  
ban on gays is illegal under the state's anti-discrimination laws. 
The Boy Scouts are appealing that decision to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Evan Wolfson, a New York attorney who represented a gay Scout in  
the New Jersey case, said the written policy in Rhode Island is the 
first time he is aware of that the Boy Scouts have put something in 
writing on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no true national policy that the members have  
adopted,'' he said. ``In past court cases they've defended the 
policy as a flat ban ... and they've made references to 'don't ask, 
don't tell.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He said a `don't ask, don't tell policy' is ``inconsistent with  
the principles of scouting, such as being open and truthful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfson said the policy also could undermine the longtime legal  
argument of the Scouts that they have been consistent in their ban 
on homosexuals.

<HEADLINE> GOP Tax Cut Plan Pushed in Illinois </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELGIN, Ill. (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert waved dollar  
bills at a crowd of auto parts workers Wednesday and pledged to put 
cash in their pockets in his opening bid to win public support for 
the $792 billion tax-cut plan Republicans pushed through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is that this Congress, both the House and  
Senate, believe the American people ought to have a little bit more 
money in their pocket, so that they can decide how to spend it, 
rather than the federal government,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	His words were greeted with applause from many of the 150  
blue-collar and management employees gathered inside the ITW 
Shakeproof plant in this northwest Chicago suburb, part of 
Hastert's congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody'd be stupid not to want a tax break,'' said Betty  
Sykes, a shipping supervisor planning to retire soon, after 32 
years at the plant. ``We're taxed to death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate approved the GOP tax package last week by a  
largely partisan vote. Party leaders won't send the measure to the 
White House until after lawmakers return from their August recess 
for fear that President Clinton could veto it and dominate the 
public-relations war in Congress' absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they have dispatched members to their districts, armed  
with suggested talking points and instructions to spread the 
message. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really this is the beginning of the debate in Washington,''  
Hastert told the crowd. ``Back here it's common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He warned the workers not to believe Clinton, who argues the  
government surplus Republicans want to tap is needed to pay for 
Medicare, farm programs and other spending critical to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulling four $1 bills from his pocket, Hastert said they  
represented the federal surplus over the next decade. Then he 
peeled one from the rest and said it represented the portion 
Republicans want to return to taxpayers. The rest can cover the 
government's debt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has indicated he does not want a confrontation with  
Republicans over spending this fall, and after the event, Hastert 
said ``we're ready to sit down and talk with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with ``Nightly Business Report,'' Clinton said  
Wednesday there was room to negotiate a tax cut only after the 
budget priorities he has laid out have been addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My position is send me a Medicare proposal; let's figure out  
what we've got to spend on other things, and what we've got to do 
to pay the debt down, and let's give the rest back to the 
taxpayers,'' Clinton said. ``Then I will be very flexible about how 
we do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP bill includes a 1 percent reduction in all income-tax  
rates, an easing of the tax paid by many married couples, a capital 
gains tax cut, elimination of the inheritance tax on large estates 
and a slew of tax breaks for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does the president really believe that you should be punished  
for hard work?'' Hastert said. ``Does he really believe that you 
should be punished for getting married?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message seemed to strike a chord with the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he worried the tax cut could jeopardize federal  
government programs down the line, 29-year plant veteran Gary 
Miller replied: ``That's later. We can deal with the problems 
later.''

	Utah Tornado Kills 1, Injures 100  
</P>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A rare tornado swept through downtown Salt  
Lake City today, tossing trucks and trees around and shredding 
tents set up for a convention. At least one person was killed and 
more than 100 were injured. Power lines were ripped down, windows 
blown out and shards of glass were everywhere. The tornado also 
damaged the roofs of the Delta Center, home of the Utah Jazz, and 
the Salt Palace Convention Center, which was hosting an outdoor 
retailers show.

	Man Surrenders in L.A. Shooting  
</P>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The white supremacist wanted in the shooting of  
five people at a Los Angeles Jewish community center turned himself 
in to the FBI today, telling authorities ``You're looking for me -- 
I killed the kids in Los Angeles.'' Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., 37, 
mistakenly thought he had killed some children. Los Angeles County 
Deputy District Attorney Craig Hum said he planned to file a 
warrant charging Furrow with five counts of attempted murder, which 
allows authorities in Las Vegas to hold him for extradition. A 
5-year-old boy was in critical condition today. Three of the 
shooting victims were in stable condition and one was released from 
the hospital.

	Gov't Grants Disaster Declarations  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- All of Connecticut, most of Maryland and parts  
of three other states were declared drought disaster areas today, 
allowing farmers who have lost crops to qualify for low-interest 
loans. Six counties in New York, five counties in Virginia and one 
in New Mexico received disaster declarations from the Agriculture 
Department. The loans are limited to farmers who have lost at least 
30 percent of their crops and can't get commercial credit. All of 
New Jersey and West Virginia and 34 New York counties were declared 
disaster areas previously.

	Clinton Gives Clemency to Activists  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton offered today to commute the  
sentences of 16 members of a Puerto Rican independence group if 
they sign agreements renouncing the use of violence. Their group 
staged some 130 bomb attacks on political and military targets in 
the United States from 1974 to 1983. An administration official 
said that the prisoners were not involved in any deaths. Clinton's 
action was in response to a campaign by human rights advocates who 
have argued that members of FALN were punished too harshly.

	Pill Treats Deadly Brain Tumors  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patients who fail therapy for a particularly  
deadly brain tumor are about to get an option that may extend their 
life a few more months. The government today approved the first new 
chemotherapy for brain tumors in 20 years. Temodar, known 
chemically as temozolomide, is an oral form of chemotherapy for 
adults with anaplastic astrocytomas. In a study, 12 of 54 patients 
-- a fairly impressive 22 percent -- had their tumors significantly 
shrink or temporarily disappear, the Food and Drug Administration 
said.

	Cos. To Bankroll Family-Friendly TV  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eleven major advertisers said today they will  
pay to have writers develop family-friendly shows for consideration 
by the WB network. The advertisers, including Procter &AMP; Gamble, 
General Motors, IBM and Sears, say they are finding fewer 
prime-time programs during which they feel comfortable selling 
their products. The advertisers won't say how much money they are 
committing. But it generally costs between $60,000 and $90,000 to 
come up with a script, and they've agreed to bankroll at least 
eight. WB will decide which scripts, if any, go into production.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM is introducing personal computers with  
built-in digital modems. The internal modems, made by Texas 
Instruments, are being offered as an optional feature with IBM's 
Aptiva line of computers, boosting the price by about $100, IBM 
said today. A built-in modem would likely make it easier and 
cheaper for people to switch from a dial-up Internet connection to

<HEADLINE> Governors Plan Summit With Senators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Governors seeking a closer partnership with  
federal lawmakers wrapped up their summer meeting here by inviting 
the U.S. senators to join them at a summit next winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said the gathering, to be held February 2000 in  
Washington, would be the first time in recent history that the 
state executives would meet with federal lawmakers to discuss the 
balance of power. Governors also would meet with their individual 
U.S. House delegations on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt, a Republican, made the announcement  
Tuesday as he took over as chairman of the National Governors 
Association. He said he hoped the meeting would ``reopen, nurture 
and enhance'' the relationship between state and federal leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``As states, we have a very serious responsibility to protect  
the people as a counterbalance to the federal government,'' Leavitt 
said in a conference call. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as education was the focus during Delaware Gov. Thomas  
Carper's one-year term as NGA chairman, it appears federalism might 
get the same kind of attention under Leavitt. That is also a major 
interest of the new vice chairman; Gov. Parris Glendening of 
Maryland has written two books on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt compared the current balance to that of a mainframe  
computer, in which most decisions are made from a centralized 
source in Washington. He proposed state governments instead should 
resemble a network of personal computers, with national 
coordination but local control. 
</P>
<P>
	The NGA agenda for next year's meetings will include discussions  
on how to simplify sales taxes, improve environmental management 
and create public-private partnerships, as well as continued 
efforts to infuse technology into classrooms. That was the theme of 
the St. Louis NGA conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt admitted governors and senators likely wouldn't work out  
their differences overnight, but he said the meeting's symbolism 
alone would have immense benefits.

<HEADLINE> New Pill Treats Deadly Brain Tumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patients who fail therapy for a particularly  
deadly brain tumor are about to get a new option that may extend 
their life a few more months. The government on Wednesday approved 
the first new chemotherapy for brain tumors in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Temodar, known chemically as temozolomide, is an oral form of  
chemotherapy for adults with anaplastic astrocytomas, giving 
patients the ability to be treated by taking pills at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Temodar is not a wonder drug, ... not the cure drug that we're  
looking for,'' cautioned Dr. Alred Yung, oncology chairman at M.D. 
Anderson Cancer Center, who helped test the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's better than what we have had,'' because patients can  
take Temodar at home with fewer side effects than many 
alternatives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 18,000 brain tumors are diagnosed in the United States  
each year. Anaplastic astrocytomas are one of the worst kinds, 
accounting for 2,000 to 3,000 new cases a year. They are rapidly 
growing tumors that are hard to treat, and patients typically live 
two to three years after diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	When initial surgery, radiation or chemotherapy failed, these  
patients have had few options, Yung said. 
</P>
<P>
	Temodar is one of a new class of cancer drugs, and can pass  
through the blood-brain barrier fairly easily. So Schering tested 
it against anaplastic astrocytomas in patients who had relapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve of 54 patients -- a fairly impressive 22 percent -- had  
their tumors significantly shrink or temporarily disappear, the 
Food and Drug Administration said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was tiny and did not compare Temodar to older  
chemotherapies, so it's hard to say just how effective it is vs. 
alternatives. But Yung said he believed that was a better response 
than doctors get from other, older drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Even for those people Temodar helped, it's not a cure, he  
stressed. But the median duration of Temodar's effect was 12.5 
months -- meaning half of patients began relapsing sooner but half 
lasted longer. For those longer-term survivors, Yung said patients 
can continue taking Temodar until it seems to no longer work. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Yung's patients, 59-year-old Larry Sager, has seen his  
tumor stop growing for a full 1 1/2 years -- after surgery, radiation 
and a type of surgically implanted chemotherapy patch all failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for'' Temodar, Sager said  
Wednesday. ``When I asked him (the doctor) my options, he said not 
to do anything, and then I'd have two months. That wasn't for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other than slight constipation the five days a month that he  
takes Temodar, ``I had no side effects whatsoever,'' Sager said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some patients can experience mild nausea and vomiting, headaches  
and immune suppression. But manufacturer Schering-Plough Corp. said 
side effects were severe in less than 10 percent of patients, and 
the FDA said most patients had their immune system recover without 
needing treatment delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Temodar, ``as a lower toxicity drug, is of paramount importance  
to these patients,'' said Naomi Berkowitz, executive director of 
the American Brain Tumor Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Temodar will be available next month, Schering said. Dosage  
varies according to patients' size, but company figures suggest the 
average treatment will cost about $1,500 a month wholesale.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Gets 60 Years for Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A suspect in the disappearance of Madalyn  
Murray O'Hair was sentenced Wednesday to 60 years in prison for 
skimming more than $50,000 from her family's atheist organization. 
</P>
<P>
	David Waters, a three-time felon, had been on probation for that  
charge since 1995. He landed back in court after federal 
authorities found 119 rounds of handgun ammunition in his Austin 
apartment in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew what he was facing if he messed up. He went ahead and  
messed up and the judge gave an appropriate punishment,'' said 
Assistant District Attorney Gregg Cox, who asked for a life 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters, 52, also faces sentencing on federal firearms charges on  
Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities suspect Waters orchestrated the 1995  
disappearance of Ms. O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and adopted 
daughter Robin Murray O'Hair. No charges have been filed in that 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters' attorney, Patrick Ganne, accused federal authorities of  
trying to punish Waters for Ms. O'Hair's slaying without having to 
bring him to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. O' Hair and her two adult children vanished from San  
Antonio along with $500,000 in gold coins authorities questioned 
whether they were victims of foul play or had merely run off with 
their organization's money. Others suggested that Ms. O'Hair, who 
was 77 and ailing, had gone off to die quietly so Christians 
wouldn't pray over her. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has shown that she's dead and there is every indication  
that she tried to make her escape and get away and transferred 
money to other countries,'' Ganne said. ``We don't know what 
happened.''

<HEADLINE> Federal Regulators Nix Tent Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- Federal and state regulations aimed at  
improving housing for migrant farm workers have clashed in 
Washington state, closing camps and leaving seasonal cherry pickers 
scattered along riverbanks or sleeping in cars. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, a state program allowed the estimated 16,000 workers  
who pour into central Washington each summer to pitch tents on 
growers' lands if running water, sanitation and refrigeration were 
provided. In 1998, 25 such camps provided shelter for about 2,000 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Labor effectively shut down the program  
this year, threatening the state with large fines and saying the 
effort did not meet minimum federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials closed some illegal camps and paid for motel  
rooms for some workers. Other workers were left to compete with 
tourists for sites at campgrounds, sleep in their cars or camp 
along rivers without any facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., has introduced a bill to exempt farm  
worker housing from requirements of the federal Migrant and 
Seasonal Worker Protection Act, providing the housing is already 
regulated by other state or federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington state worked hard to develop a reasonable plan that  
addresses the housing needs of migrant workers,'' Hastings said 
Monday. He said the state's own laws and inspectors would ensure 
the camps were safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Farm Bureau and the Washington Growers League  
support Hastings' measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many farmers want to provide places for their workers to stay,  
if the program is reasonable, affordable and offers some protection 
against being sued by outside groups,'' said Jon Warling, the farm 
bureau's vice president for legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	But the measure is not popular with farm-worker housing  
advocates, who previously opposed the state's tent plan. State 
United Farm Workers officials say the bill would further relegate 
farm workers to second-class status. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastings said hearings on the bill will begin after Congress  
returns from its August recess.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Introduce Layden As GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Improving the chemistry between the general  
manager and the coach was the key reason why the New York Knicks 
hired Scott Layden. 
</P>
<P>
	That was Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts'  
oft-repeated explanation Wednesday as the team introduced Layden as 
its new general manager while also formally announcing coach Jeff 
Van Gundy's contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went after Scott Layden when I learned that he might have  
some interest in this job because I thought that the chemistry 
between these two would be very powerful and strong in a positive 
direction,'' Checketts said. ``I think today starts a new era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layden started that era as low-key as possible, giving few  
answers of much substance as he steered away from controversies 
past and present surrounding the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts selected Layden over Ed Tapscott, the Knicks' player  
personnel director who had been performing the general manager's 
duties on an interim basis since the end of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Tapscott was considered to be aligned with former general  
manager Ernie Grunfeld, who was demoted last April when the Knicks 
were in danger of missing the playoffs and a rift developed between 
him and Van Gundy. 
</P>
<P>
	``His association with Ernie had very little to do with this  
decision,'' Checketts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts said race had nothing to do with choosing Layden, who  
is white, over Tapscott, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about race or ethnic origin, it's not about  
sending messages,'' Checketts said, ``it's about making the right 
decision for this organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layden, who spent 18 years with the Utah Jazz, will also have  
the title of executive vice president. Van Gundy, who has survived 
four mostly tumultuous seasons as coach of the Knicks, got a 
multiyear contract extension lasting at least through the 2002-03 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep having these press conferences to say I'm still here,''  
Van Gundy said, ``and here I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts said he interviewed other candidates, all of whom were  
``all too willing to give their opinions'' on Knicks personnel and 
the way the offense was run last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden will be Van Gundy's boss and will have final say on  
personnel moves, although everything will be bounced off Checketts. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden diplomatically refused to discuss any specifics related  
to the Knicks, be it Latrell Sprewell's history, Patrick Ewing's 
reduced role or the possibility that Charles Oakley might be 
reacquired. The first question he was asked dealt with the widely 
perceived notion that the Knicks need a top-notch point guard to 
replace Charlie Ward as the starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden would not say whether he'd maintain some of the  
philosophical standards he employed in Utah, such as refusing as a 
matter of principle to illegally stash players on the injured list, 
as most NBA teams do. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden also refused to give his take on the Knicks'  
turmoil-filled 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My focus is to look forward, and I don't know the details of  
what went on,'' Layden said. ``It'd be foolish from my perspective 
to dwell on the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said he expected to take the same roster to training  
camp in October while also disclosing that he's ``leaning'' toward 
moving Sprewell into the starting lineup on a permanent basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell seethed last season as Van Gundy kept him in a sixth  
man role until the Eastern Conference finals. Sprewell will be 
entering the final season of his contract, and could choose to play 
it out and become a free agent if he is returned to a reserve role. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts said the Knicks are eager to sign Sprewell to a  
contract extension that will keep him in New York well into the 
next decade.

<HEADLINE> Columbia Short Circuit Slows Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The short circuit aboard space  
shuttle Columbia has been traced to a damaged wire and is holding 
up work on Endeavour, scheduled to lift off next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, technicians discovered the source of the short  
circuit that occurred five seconds into Columbia's launch on July 
23. The half-second short knocked out the primary computers for two 
of the three main engines. Backup computers took over. 
</P>
<P>
	It turns out that an electrical wire in the cargo bay had its  
insulation stripped away in one spot by a rough screw. NASA 
suspects a worker may have inadvertently pressed on the wire during 
preparations for a previous launch, agency spokesman Joel Wells 
said Wednesday. Contact between the wire and screw caused the 
short. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has ordered additional lab analysis of Columbia's wiring to  
make sure there's nothing wrong with the wiring in Endeavour, 
scheduled to lift off Sept. 16 on a radar-mapping mission of Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia's launch, the first in NASA history to be commanded by  
a woman, Eileen Collins, also was marred by a fuel leak. 
</P>
<P>
	A nail-size plug in the right main engine came loose and banged  
against the nozzle moments before liftoff; three 
hydrogen-circulating tubes were ruptured. Endeavour has newer 
engines, none of which have this plug.

<HEADLINE> Security High at Jewish Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In the halls of Jewish community centers and schools around the  
nation Wednesday, security guards and teachers watched for signs of 
trouble and strangers while police cars circled outside. 
</P>
<P>
	One day after a white supremacist opened fire on a group of  
children in the lobby of a community center near Los Angeles, many 
Jewish leaders were worried about copycat crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't feel like an isolated incident, it feels like  
somehow a little bit of a wave,'' said Rabbi Shea Hecht of the 
National Committee for the Furtherance of Jewish Education in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's an organized thing, but I think it's the  
copycat syndrome, where one says, `Why don't I do it, why don't I 
act on my hate?''' Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Coleman of Akiba-Schechter Jewish Day School in Chicago  
said Tuesday's attack appeared similar to a string of shootings in 
the Midwest last month. The shooter, a white supremacist, targeted 
blacks, Jews and Asians, and killed two people before turning the 
gun on himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Five people were injured in Tuesday's attack at the North Valley  
Jewish Community Center, including a 5-year-old boy who remained in 
critical condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., 37, turned himself in Wednesday in Las  
Vegas and told authorities he wanted the attack to be a ``wake-up 
call to America to kill Jews,'' said an FBI source, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish leaders said most of their community centers and schools  
step up security when major crimes, particularly anti-Semitic 
attacks, occur. 
</P>
<P>
	David Sorkin, executive director of two Jewish Community Centers  
in suburban Detroit, said his centers last increased security 
precautions about a year ago after a bombing in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things happen to the Jewish community anywhere in the  
world, as a Jew, it makes your hair stand on end,'' said Rabbi Brad 
Bloom of Temple B'nai Israel in Sacramento, Calif., one of three 
synagogues damaged by arsonists in June. 
</P>
<P>
	In Columbus, Ohio, two police officers stood watch over a tennis  
match at the Maccabi Youth Games. The five-day, four-city 
Olympic-style event involves about 700 young Jewish athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was also tight at the Jewish Community Center of  
Cleveland, with a police car at the front door and another one 
circling the center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any reason to think anything will happen, but we  
have to be cautious,'' said Bob Cahen, the center's executive vice 
president.

<HEADLINE> Webb Goes for Another Triumph  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOBURN, England (AP) -- Karrie Webb, who just added a major to  
her growing list of victories, goes for another triumph in the 
Women's British Open, a tournament she has dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Australian, fresh off a two-stroke victory in  
the du Maurier Classic, has won the British twice in the last four 
years and goes into the opening round Thursday with some of her 
toughest foes absent. 
</P>
<P>
	Juli Inkster, who trails Webb's $1.25 million at the top of the  
LPGA money charts, isn't here. Neither are Meg Mallon and Se Ri 
Pak, who have each won two tournaments this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest dangers to Webb appear to be England's Laura Davies,  
who let a late lead slip away in the du Maurier, and defending 
champion Sherri Steinhauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Davies won the WPGA Championship of Europe last weekend, while  
Steinhauer squandered a two-stroke lead going into the final round 
of the LPGA Challenge at Sutton, Mass., and saw the title go to 
Mardi Lunn of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Davies strongly believes that the Women's British Open should be  
classed as a major. Although she triumphed back in 1986, that was 
long before the tournament started to attract the leading American 
players and she hasn't won since. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the one, the ultimate,'' Davies said. ``For me I would  
trade in the other 56 tournament victories for this one. It's the 
British Open, there's not more you can say about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably why I can't win it. I want to win it too  
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although disappointed with last week's final-round slump,  
Steinhauer won the JAL Big Apple Classic last month and is pleased 
with her form. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year's win gave me a lot of confidence and I have been  
having a very good season this year,'' she said. ``Since the summer 
months I have been very, very happy with how I played, while at the 
beginning of the season I was rusty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Women's British Open returns to the Duke's Course at Woburn  
after visits to Sunningdale and Royal Lytham, and that will suit 
Webb, who won here in 1995 at age 20 before she joined the U.S. 
Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	When she went to Sunningdale two years later, she won by eight  
strokes in a tournament-record 19-under 269, five better than the 
previous mark by Jane Geddes. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb goes into this tournament as a top 10 finisher in 17 of 18  
events this season, topped by the du Maurier, the final major of 
the LPGA season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Six wins to the beginning of August is something I never  
really expected to happen,'' Webb said. ``I was hoping to have a 
good year but this is definitely above my expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A winner of the Australian Ladies Masters in February, a victory  
here would mean she would have triumphed in four different 
countries so far this season, with visits to Bermuda and Japan 
still to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Another big rival could be another former winner here, Emilee  
Klein, who won in 1996 at 22 but hasn't won an LPGA event since.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Colt Heyward Adjusts to Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- He's long past the anger and depression.  
</P>
<P>
	It's been almost a year since Craig Heyward's NFL career came to  
an end because of a rare tumor in his right eye. And even as his 
former Indianapolis Colts teammates are preparing for the 1999 
season, Heyward has moved on to life without football. 
</P>
<P>
	The best news is, he has one.  
</P>
<P>
	The tumor, called a chordoma, has been operated on twice and  
bombarded with radiation. Only tiny remnants are left, and they 
appear to be dormant. He still is blind in his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with training camps in full swing, Heyward doesn't feel the  
game tugging at him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't miss it. It's too damn hot. And the hotter it gets,  
the less I miss it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went through a funk -- 'Why me? Why me?' -- a little  
depression, stuff like that. I stayed in the house, didn't go 
outside, slept, didn't do anything,'' he told The Indianapolis Star 
by telephone from his home in suburban Atlanta. ``But then we 
started to go to church and, slowly but surely, it's lifted my 
spirits up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played 11 years,'' he said. ``Most athletes don't play that  
long in the NFL. I'm at peace with it. I've come to terms with 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After starting his third consecutive game at fullback for the  
Colts last Nov. 1 at New England, Heyward woke up the next morning 
unable to see out of his right eye. A battery of tests revealed the 
chordoma, a rare, slow-growing tumor that began at the base of his 
skull, extended behind his right eye, and was spreading into his 
brain and sinuses. It also encased his optic nerve and his right 
carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a cruel, ironic twist for a player whose nickname was  
``Ironhead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Troy Payner, an Indianapolis neurosurgeon, was able to  
remove all of the tumor except the portion that surrounded the 
carotid artery. When he regained enough strength, Heyward headed to 
Boston, where he underwent the radiation treatment five days a week 
for two months, through mid-May. The result was as good as could be 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no evidence that the tumor is growing,'' Payner said.  
``But we will follow up with periodic MRI scans. I think he will 
look forward to a long and happy life, but his tumor does have to 
be followed. He can't ignore it. But my advice to him is to live 
his life as if he's going to live a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heyward went through treatment for alcoholism in 1993. Then he  
addressed a career-long weight problem with visits to a weight-loss 
center at Duke University in 1994. In the process, he rehabilitated 
his career, topping 1,000 yards for the first time with Atlanta in 
1995. He was released by the Rams after the 1997 season and signed 
with the Colts, his fifth team in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of think everything happens for a reason and you don't  
know the reason as soon as it happens,'' his wife, Charlotte, said. 
``Slowly but surely, you figure things out. One of the reasons the 
tumor was discovered is he has been so resilient and he has 
overcome so many different things. 
</P>
<P>
	``Football has to end one way or another. This might've actually  
been easier than being cut because he was overweight or because of 
his age. We have a lot of friends who can't deal with being out of 
football because they feel it's not their time. With Craig, there's 
more to life than football and he's just concerned with getting 
healthy. It's made him a lot stronger, and it's made ... our faith 
in God a lot stronger.''

	If confirmed, the allegations would be a setback for a  
department that settled a multimillion-dollar civil rights lawsuit 
earlier this year and is trying to overcome a reputation for 
treating minority farmers unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints involve three of the Farm Service Agency's county  
offices in Arkansas and two in Georgia. A team from USDA's civil 
rights office was in Georgia last week, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosalind Gray, director of the civil rights office, said the  
department would ``take appropriate action'' when the 
investigations are completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Those cases were among a number of complaints of racial  
discrimination that the department received in distributing the 
disaster aid. Many of the complainants, however, declined to 
cooperate with investigators, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	She provided no details about the Arkansas and Georgia cases.  
</P>
<P>
	John Boyd Jr., president of the National Black Farmers  
Association, said he has received complaints recently from 
producers who say they were told by department officials that they 
didn't need disaster grants or loans because they were benefiting 
from the settlement. But he said he was unaware of the Arkansas and 
Georgia cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm Service Agency officials in the two states declined to  
comment on the investigations except to say they were aware of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency distributed $2 billion in disaster aid this summer  
for weather-related losses that farmers had suffered in 1998 and 
previous years. Congress is likely to provide additional money for 
losses this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, a federal judge approved the settlement of a  
class-action lawsuit alleging that USDA had regularly denied black 
farmers loans and other assistance because of their race. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has pledged to root out  
discrimination in the department and said the settlement put a 
``painful chapter of history'' behind the department. Employees 
have undergone training on the department's anti-discrimination 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Some farmers have declined to participate in the settlement,  
saying it was inadequate, and allege that the department hasn't 
disciplined many of the department's local officials who are 
responsible for the discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, about 120 people, including many farmers, marched  
around the Agriculture Department's headquarters, accompanied by 
two mules and chanting slogans such as ``No Justice, No Peace'' and 
``Stop Stealing our Land.'' Later, 14 of the farmers met with Gray 
for 1 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same system is in place,'' said Boyd, referring to  
department staff. ``Nobody has been held accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray said some department employees have been fired or  
disciplined, but she declined to identify them or say how many were 
involved. The Farm Service Agency has 2,400 county offices around 
the country managing the department's farm programs.

<HEADLINE> Albanians Want Access to Serb Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians demanding access to  
a Serb-controlled area again confronted NATO peacekeepers today at 
a bridge north of the capital, and several were injured 
accidentally. Others were reportedly beaten by Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a U.N. refugee agency official criticized some ethnic  
Albanians for what he called ``disgusting'' revenge attacks on 
Kosovo's Serbs -- including murders, assaults and forced removals. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kosovska Mitrovica, north of Pristina, Capt. Bernard Bonneau  
of the French NATO contingent said a 9-year-old boy suffered a cut 
in his hand and a young girl sustained a deep cut in her leg after 
being caught under barbed wire inadvertently dragged by a NATO 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other ethnic Albanians were beaten overnight in the  
Serb-controlled part of the divided city after Serbs forced their 
way into Albanian apartments and told inhabitants to leave, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three and 13 others in the group were taken to a French  
military base after the incident, said Bonneau. No arrests have 
been made, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	French peacekeepers shut the bridge separating the Serb from the  
Albanian side of Kosovska Mitrovica again late Tuesday, when 
hundreds of Albanians gathered there to protest the beatings. 
During a demonstration earlier this week, the French put barbed 
wire across the span to keep ethnic Albanians demanding access to 
homes in the Serb-dominated section of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	New barbed wire was put up today after a French armored vehicle  
inadvertently dragged the existing barrier into the demonstrators, 
causing the injuries. Kosovska Mitrovica is about 20 miles north of 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	The bridge is a symbol of the ethnic hatreds that complicate  
attempts by NATO and the United Nations to establish order in the 
wake of the vicious Serb crackdown on Kosovo's Albanians and the 
NATO bombing campaign that forced a Kosovo settlement with 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pristina, Ron Redmond, spokesman for the U.N. High  
Commissioner for Refugees, said the agency ``strongly condemned'' 
the ethnic violence, which he said appeared to be ``systematic'' 
and ``organized'' in nature. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged ethnic Albanian leaders to use their influence to stop  
``thugs,'' who he said ``employ some of the same disgusting tactics 
that were used against the ethnic Albanians themselves just a few 
months ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesman Maj. Jan Joosten reported one woman shot to death  
and her 4-year-old child injured in eastern Kosovo, an area 
patrolled by U.S. and Russian troops. Dozens of ethnic Albanians 
were arrested for weapons violations or arson attacks, Joosten 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 35,000 NATO-led peacekeepers and an international  
police force are trying to control rampant crime and instability in 
Kosovo, where murders, arson and looting often motivated by ethnic 
hatred occur daily. Some of the crime is blamed on gangs seeking to 
exploit the postwar disorder, but revenge attacks by ethnic 
Albanians on a dwindling Serb minority also are occurring. Most of 
the province's 200,000 Serbs have fled. 
</P>
<P>
	According to statistics provided by the UNHCR, fewer than 2,000  
Serbs remain in Pristina, compared to a pre-war population of at 
least 27,000. Many of those remaining are elderly or infirm people, 
dependent on help from relief agencies to survive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is highly unlikely that these people were involved in the  
persecution of Albanians, but that doesn't seem to matter to the 
thugs terrorizing them,'' Redmond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on information gathered during interviews with Serbs and  
compiled from NATO and other agencies' reports, Redmond said ethnic 
Albanian gangs often give the Serbs a written warning to leave 
their houses, then follow with a verbal warning. If the Serbs 
refuse to leave they are then assaulted or killed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO troops were working to prevent Serbs from leaving, but it  
was impossible to protect everyone individually, Joosten said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The final decision to leave lies with the people themselves,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Boston Professor Won't Leave Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, Mass. (AP) -- Professor Mary Daly, a self-described  
radical feminist theologian, is refusing to vacate her Boston 
College office, flouting an order from administrators who insist 
she has retired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jesuit institution claims the tenured professor agreed to  
retire in January when told she had to admit male students to her 
seminars, which the 70-year-old had refused to do. Daly says she 
never signed any retirement agreement, and merely took a leave of 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	The university gave her until Tuesday to remove her belongings  
from her office. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a retired faculty member,'' said Jack Dunn, a university  
spokesman. ``We need her office for the new faculty member who's 
coming in to teach in September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said she planned to return to her office today.  
</P>
<P>
	Known for works such as ``Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical  
Feminism'' and ``Outercourse,'' Daly has long been a controversial 
figure at Boston College. She claims administrators pushed her out 
when threatened with a lawsuit by a male student. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Daly took the university to court, but a judge ruled in  
a preliminary injunction that she was not automatically entitled to 
teach at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision did not address whether she can legally refuse to  
teach men, although the judge did say that a school can set its own 
polices -- including insisting that all courses be open to both 
sexes. 
</P>
<P>
	The case now proceeds as a contract dispute and is scheduled for  
trial next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	But until the court issue is resolved, Daly is ``entitled to all  
the administrative support of a tenured faculty member, including 
an office and voice mail,'' said her lawyer, Gretchen Van Ness.

<HEADLINE> Mets 12, Padres 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Edgardo Alfonzo homered and tied a career high  
with five RBIs Wednesday night as the New York Mets beat the San 
Diego Padres 12-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo, who went 2-for-4, hit a two-run double off Sterling  
Hitchcock in a four-run fifth as the Mets overcame a 5-2 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Piazza broke out of an 0-for-9 slump with an RBI single  
that scored Alfonzo to tie it at 5. Piazza went 3-for-4 with three 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	After Benny Agbayani singled, Shawon Dunston drove home Piazza  
with a single to give the Mets their first lead. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, which has won two straight following a three-game  
losing streak, remained one-half game behind Atlanta in the NL 
East. The Mets rallied from a 3-0 deficit to defeat San Diego on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn left in the fifth inning with a  
sore left knee he aggravated sliding into third base. Gwynn, who 
singled in the first for his 3,007th career hit to tie Al Kaline 
for 20th on the career list, is listed as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Mahomes (6-0) gave up one hit in 2 1-3 scoreless innings.  
Hitchcock (11-9) allowed six runs and 10 hits in 4 2-3 innings as 
San Diego lost its fifth straight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets broke the game open with a six-run seventh. Robin  
Ventura led off with his 26th homer. The Mets loaded the bases with 
two outs against Carlos Almanzar before Alfonzo walked on four 
pitches to force in Roger Cedeno, who had singled. John Olerud 
followed with a two-run single, and Piazza capped the inning with a 
single to right to score two more runs. 
</P>
<P>
	New York starter Octavio Dotel put the Mets in hole in the first  
when he threw 40 pitches and the Padres took advantage of four 
walks by loading the bases twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Damian Jackson led off with a walk, stole second and scored on  
Tony Gwynn's infield single to give the Padres the lead. Phil 
Nevin's sacrifice fly scored Gwynn to make it 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets came back in their half to tie it at 2. Henderson led  
off with a single to left, moved to second on a balk by Hitchcock 
and scored on Alfonzo's 17th homer, which matched his career high. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The start of the game was delayed 1 hour, 22 minutes  
because of rain. ... Before the game, the Mets claimed RHP Jeff Tam 
off waivers from Cleveland and optioned RHP Dan Murray to Triple-A 
Norfolk. ... Disabled closer John Franco will have the sprained 
tendon on his left middle finger examined by Dr. Andrew Weiland at 
the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Co. Faulted for Deadly Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- An Allentown chemical company was at fault  
for a deadly explosion that killed five people and leveled an 
industrial plant, a federal safety agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Concept Sciences Inc. was cited for 20 alleged violations  
including 11 willful violations which carry a proposed penalty of 
more than $600,000, the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration said. If OHSA's rules had been followed before the 
Feb. 19 explosion, ``it is more than likely this catastrophe would 
have been avoided,'' OSHA spokeswoman Kate Dugan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion caused the walls of the 25-foot high building to  
buckle and collapse inward, dumping tons of concrete and steel on 
the workers inside and leaving nearly $5 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast happened in a 2,500-gallon fiberglass reinforced  
charge tank containing about 750 pounds of the hazardous chemical 
hydroxylamine, a volatile chemical used by semiconductor makers and 
pharmaceutical companies, the six-month OSHA investigation 
concluded. The tank was used in the distillation process. 
</P>
<P>
	``The explosion had the equivalent of 750 pounds of TNT,'' Dugan  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	OSHA could not determine what ignited the tank, since the  
building was destroyed by the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Concept Sciences has 15 days to contest the citation or appeal  
before an administrative law judge. A spokeswoman said they were 
informed today of the OSHA findings and proposed penalties but had 
no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 willful violations cited by OSHA included failure to  
compile safety information about hazardous chemicals; inadequate 
procedures for dealing with chemical disasters; and failure to 
train employees about hazards of dangerous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't do a process hazard analysis or determine 'what  
could happen' and worse, they didn't train their employees about 
what could happen,'' Dugan said.

<HEADLINE> Drought Takes Toll in Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW LISBON, N.J. (AP) -- From the 100-foot tower in New Jersey's  
Pinelands, Sean Morgart can spot trouble 10 miles away -- and the 
Forest Fire Service employee has seen plenty during this dry, hot 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it comes up in a dark cloud with a lot of turmoil in the  
plume,'' he said of smoke in the million-acre region, ``you know 
you're in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the drought of 1999 has devastated Eastern farms --  
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman today made Connecticut farmers 
eligible for emergency loans, after doing the same Tuesday for New 
Jersey and parts of New York and Pennsylvania -- the dry spell also 
is taking a severe toll in woodlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Forest fires are easier to ignite, burn hotter once they get  
started and are harder to extinguish. Three times as many wildfires 
as normal have been reported in New Jersey this year, and other 
states are facing similar threats. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Massachusetts, 5,000 acres have burned since April; in a  
typical year, 3,000 acres burn. 
</P>
<P>
	--New Hampshire officials have counted more than 1,245 wildfires  
this spring and summer, compared with 550 in a normal year. 
</P>
<P>
	--West Virginia has recorded more than 100 forest fires this  
summer, instead of the usual three or four. And autumn -- when dry, 
fallen leaves pose the biggest danger of fire -- is still ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Even places that have escaped major forest fires have had small  
underground fires that burn into the forest floor, where root 
systems are starved for water. Firefighters must continually check 
back on blazes that appear to have been extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
	``They follow the root systems and sometimes burn horizontally  
under the ground for days -- sometimes weeks -- before they resurface 
again,'' said Jim Downie, a forest ranger with the Maine Department 
of Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fires can start with burning cigarette butts thrown from  
automobiles, lightning strikes, campfires, arson -- even tall grass 
ignited by an automobile's overheated catalytic converter. 
</P>
<P>
	While few of this summer's fires have caused significant  
property damage and no deaths have been reported, they are 
decimating trees and shrubs that -- in some places -- will never 
recover, according to botanist Bruce Stein of The Nature 
Conservancy, an Arlington, Va.-based group. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem in an extreme drought is that you can have fires  
that burn hotter than normal,'' Stein said. ``Where the forest 
might be adapted for low-intensity fires, a hotter-than-average 
fire can be more destructive than normal fires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey and other states have imposed drought emergency  
restrictions, including a ban on outdoor fires. They hope that's 
enough, especially come fall, when the danger increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so dry, anything can light a fire,'' Morgart said. ``The  
only thing left to do is to close the woods entirely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered rain fell on parts of the Northeast on Tuesday -- not  
nearly enough for Don Warne, a farmer with 600 parched acres near 
Romulus, in central New York's Finger Lakes region. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of towering over his head, his corn stalks now barely  
reach his waist. The corn itself is no more than half its usual 
size, some as small as his finger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The corn is cooked,'' Warne, 52, said with resignation, adding  
that he expects no better than half his usual yield and losses of 
up to $30,000.

<HEADLINE> Former N.J. Mayor Gets House Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A former mayor was sentenced to six months  
of house arrest for illegally receiving $20,833 in salary from a 
previous job after he took office. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold W. Webster, 68, could have faced up to 16 months in  
prison. A federal judge granted a request for no incarceration from 
Webster's lawyer, who noted that the former mayor is blind and 
suffers from a heart condition and diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Webster was sentenced to house arrest and three years  
of probation. U.S. District Judge Alfred Wolin also ordered him to 
repay all the money and assessed a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster was sworn in as mayor earlier than scheduled and a  
school computer kept sending him checks for his work as 
superintendent because it didn't have the new date in its system, 
Webster's lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster is the second official of the Camden school district,  
which has 20,000 students, to admit wrongdoing in less than two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Former school board president Elaine Bey served five months in  
prison after pleading guilty to embezzling more than $24,000 in 
school funds for personal use, including liquor and adult movie 
rentals.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo To Sell Securities Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's debt-ridden Daewoo Group  
bowed to pressure from its creditor banks Wednesday and agreed to 
sell its most profitable subsidiary -- the Daewoo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of South Korea's largest securities company was a key  
demand of Daewoo creditors. Daewoo had previously resisted on the 
grounds that it needed a cash pipeline from the business to support 
its automaking operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to sell Daewoo Securities came as creditor banks  
were forging a rescue program to keep the country's second-largest 
conglomerate afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo also agreed to sell its 46-percent stake in Seoul  
Investment Trust Co., a small financing firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo has said it will sell or spin off most of its 40  
subsidiaries and restructure itself around its core businesses of 
car manufacturing and trade. 
</P>
<P>
	But it had wanted to keep Daewoo Securities, which serves as a  
key financing vehicle for the rest of the conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Creditor banks argued that Daewoo could not quickly relieve its  
cash strains without selling the profitable subsidiary by the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	While agreeing to spin off the firm, Daewoo declined to set a  
deadline. Such a deadline would deprive Daewoo of a chance to get a 
proper price, Daewoo spokesman Jang Sae-chan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo's last-minute refusal to set the deadline for selling the  
business delayed an announcement planned for Wednesday of a 
detailed restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been rescheduled for Monday, said Daewoo's main creditor,  
Korea First Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo is struggling under the weight of $46.5 billion in debt.  
It barely avoided becoming the country's largest ever bankruptcy 
when creditors agreed to roll over short-term debts for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Desperate for cash, it is asking General Motors Corp. to buy  
part of its flagship automaker Daewoo Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of President Kim Dae-jung believes that slimming  
down the country's bloated, family-controlled conglomerates, known 
as chaebol, is the key to rebuilding foreign confidence in the 
South Korean economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Such reform was a key condition of the record $58 billion  
bailout package South Korea took from the International Monetary 
Fund in late 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But chaebol have been accused of dragging their feet in spinning  
off their sprawling assets. A typical Korean chaebol controls 40 to 
60 companies that make such diverse goods as ships, computer chips, 
garments and food. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, creditor banks of Samsung, South Korea's No. 3  
conglomerate, threatened to suspend fresh credit and start calling 
in its $37 billion debt unless it moved swiftly to sell its 
debt-ridden Samsung Motors Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung and Daewoo had tentatively agreed to swap their  
carmaking and home appliance subsidiaries as part of a government 
drive to reduce redundant facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than six months of talks broke down after they failed  
to narrow their differences over how to resolve Samsung's $3.3 
billion in debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung owner and chairman Lee Kun-hee had offered personal  
stock worth an estimated $2.3 billion to pay off part of the debt. 
But creditors said that was not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker applied for court protection from creditors on  
June 30.

<HEADLINE> GOP Tax Bill Helps Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They pale in size compared with tax cuts for  
individuals, but tax relief items for businesses from railroads to 
arrowhead-makers were tucked into the $792 billion package 
Republicans pushed through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly $72 billion of the total cuts over 10 years would  
benefit businesses directly, and many stand a good chance of 
eventually becoming law even if President Clinton vetoes this 
version of the bill as he has promised. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you've gotten into the bill, you can go back up to the  
Hill and say: 'This is noncontroversial because it's been passed by 
either the House or Senate.' You've gotten a foot in the water,'' 
said Evan Liddiard, a partner at the KPMG accounting firm's 
national tax office. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the breaks are big and complicated, such as a $24  
billion change in the arcane world of international taxes to allow 
U.S.-based companies a new global way to calculate credits for 
interest expenses incurred while operating in foreign countries. 
General Motors Corp. led the lobbying effort for that. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are simple and much smaller: A provision with negligible  
cost inserted by Rep. Dave Camp, a Republican whose Michigan 
district is prime hunting territory, would allow makers of 
specialty big-game arrowheads to pay a lower excise tax because 
they would no longer be defined as ``essential components'' of 
standard arrows. 
</P>
<P>
	For business lobbyists, the changes merely rectify unfair or  
onerous portions of the tax code, even if they benefit primarily 
single industries or just one company. ``It redresses many 
inequities of the current tax law that needlessly restrict small 
business growth, stability and job creation,'' said Nelson Litterst 
of the National Federation of Independent Business. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some Republicans recoiled at the numerous provisions aimed  
at specific interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years -- and this bill is no exception -- we have ... put  
tax loopholes for special interests ahead of tax relief for working 
families,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who nonetheless voted 
for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheer size of the tax cut, the largest since 1981, ensured  
that lobbyists stood a good chance of getting their provisions 
included. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroads and inland waterway barge companies, for example,  
objected to laws forcing them to continue paying a 
4.3-cents-a-gallon fuel excise tax to help reduce the federal 
budget deficit -- a deficit that no longer exists. Excise taxes, 
they argued, normally are earmarked for a specific purpose, and 
this tax no longer has one. 
</P>
<P>
	The money, GOP sponsors said in a letter to colleagues, could be  
used by the companies themselves to ``improve our nation's railways 
and reduce transportation and shipping costs for agriculture and 
businesses.'' The Republican bill would repeal the tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, defense contractors led by Lockheed Martin won  
passage of a provision allowing them to deduct from U.S. taxes all 
their earnings from foreign sales. That item, costing $1.1 billion, 
is intended, like many others in the international tax section of 
the bill, to help U.S. companies compete against European rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were designed to put American companies on a more equal  
footing,'' said Martin Regalia, chief economist at the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce. ``They do have the option to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other items were aimed at struggling industries, such as  
independent crude oil producers, who would gain the ability to 
deduct five-year net past losses on a single year's income tax 
return. That change, costing $246 million, is similar to one made 
for farmers last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still more provisions appeared tailored to specific companies.  
Enron Corp., for example, obtained an exemption from U.S. income 
taxes for oil and gas pumped through a pipeline that begins and 
ends in two countries but moves through a third. The exemption, 
costing $126 million and also affecting electricity, would be for 
what runs through that third country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enron could run a pipeline through a third country and not  
have that income taxed in the U.S.,'' the company said in a ``tax 
issues briefing'' document for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the spectrum, one $30 million break would  
repeal the 10 percent excise tax imposed on fishing tackle boxes 
but not on similar ``utility'' boxes often sold as cheaper 
substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	This item was supported by the Illinois congressional  
delegation, led by House Speaker Dennis Hastert, on behalf of the 
Plano Molding Co. of Plano, Ill. Company officials say they've lost 
anglers' business to the utility boxes since the tax was imposed in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think the purpose of the tax is to put us out of  
business, and that's what is happening,'' said George Mannina, a 
Washington lawyer for Plano. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Hastert's influence, Mannina said fellow Illinois  
Republican Rep. Jerry Weller, a member of the tax-writing Ways and 
Means Committee, actually took the lead, and Plano officials didn't 
invoke the speaker's name in making their pitch to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought our substance was so strong that we didn't need the  
political oomph,'' Mannina said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Met With Funeral Home Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush, who filed an affidavit  
swearing he had no conversations with officials of a funeral home 
business about a state probe, spoke briefly with the company 
chairman last year but not about the case, Bush's spokeswoman said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner, stands by his  
affidavit, said his spokeswoman Linda Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Miller, a spokesman for the funeral home company, described  
the 1998 encounter as a brief, ``jocular'' one that didn't concern 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's sworn statement was filed to try to dismiss a  
subpoena for Bush to give a deposition in a whistle-blower lawsuit 
brought by Eliza May, the fired executive director of the Texas 
Funeral Service Commission. Ms. May led the agency's investigation 
into Houston-based Service Corp. International. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said in his July 20 affidavit, ``I have had no  
conversations with SCI officials, agents, or representatives 
concerning the investigation or any dispute arising from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On April 15, 1998, Bush and Robert Waltrip, SCI founder and  
chairman, had an ``off-the-cuff'' exchange at the Capitol lasting a 
few seconds, Ms. Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange occurred, said SCI spokesman Bill Miller, when  
Waltrip and SCI lobbyist Johnnie B. Rogers came to the governor's 
office to hand-deliver a copy of a letter regarding the 
investigation to Joe Allbaugh, then Bush's chief of staff and now 
his presidential campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was addressed to the head of the Funeral Service  
Commission and complained of tactics being used by commission 
staff, Miller said. He said Waltrip and Rogers were waiting to give 
a copy of the letter to Allbaugh when Bush walked out, on his way 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek magazine, in its Aug. 16 edition, reported that,  
according to Rogers, Bush said when he spotted Waltrip, ``Hey 
Bobby, are those people still messing with you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Waltrip responded that they were, the magazine reported,  
Rogers said the governor turned to him and said, ``Hey, Johnnie B. 
Are you taking care of him?'' Rogers said he replied, ``I'm doing 
my best, governor,'' according to the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said that is Rogers' recollection of the exchange. Rogers  
didn't immediately return a telephone call from The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a jocular exchange between Waltrip and Bush. It  
didn't evidence anything,'' Miller said. ``It was just an 
acknowledgment of presence. It wasn't anything about the 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards said Bush doesn't recall exactly what was said, but  
that he didn't discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush had a very brief, off-the-cuff exchange in  
passing with Mr. Waltrip that day. Literally, he was on his way out 
the door,'' Ms. Edwards said. ``The exchange lasted less than 20 
seconds. ... He did not discuss the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May's suit alleges that SCI, whose political action  
committee gave Bush $35,000 in 1996 and 1997, worked with Bush's 
staff to interfere with the investigation. The defendants are the 
funeral commission, SCI and Waltrip. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said in his affidavit that he had no personal knowledge of  
relevant facts of the investigation and ``never asked anyone to 
take a role or to become involved in any way'' in it. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has said the dispute is between Ms. May and the  
state, and believes its inclusion in the suit is a publicity stunt. 
Miller said: ``We didn't interfere with any investigation.''

<HEADLINE> Former Presidents Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Twenty-five years to the week after he was  
thrust into the presidency by Watergate, Gerald Ford returned to 
the White House on Wednesday to be praised as the steady hand that 
helped America heal. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents Clinton and Ford strode side-by-side into the East  
Room, where Ford and seven other people received the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steady, trustworthy, Gerald Ford ended a long national  
nightmare,'' Clinton said, referring to the Watergate scandal and 
President Nixon's resignation on Aug. 9, 1974. Ford then became 
president, and served out what would have been Nixon's second term. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he left the White House after 895 days, America was  
stronger, calmer and more self confident,'' Clinton said. ``America 
was, in other words, more like President Ford himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The medal is the nation's highest civilian honor. Clinton  
awarded it to former President Carter in Atlanta on Monday, making 
George Bush the only living former president who has not received 
the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Established by President Truman as a wartime honor, the medal  
was reintroduced by President Kennedy as way to honor civilian 
service. Clinton has awarded the medal to civil rights leaders, 
philanthropists, entertainers and statesmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``In honoring them we honor also the values and principles of  
our nation's founding and our nation's future,'' Clinton said of 
Wednesday's honorees. The recipients did not speak inside the White 
House, but Ford paused outside to reflect on the events of a 
quarter-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't avoid those reminiscences. It was a monumental  
day,'' he said. ``It was a unique situation as far as the country 
is concerned and I hope it never happens again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Ford, the honorees were:  
</P>
<P>
	--Lloyd M. Bentsen, Clinton's first Treasury secretary who served  
22 years in the Senate and six years in the House. He was the 
Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	--Edgar M. Bronfman Sr., president of the World Jewish Congress.  
He has ``worked to ensure basic rights for Jews around the world 
and to fight anti-Semitism and has spearheaded the effort to 
retrieve the assets of Holocaust victims and their families,'' 
according to the White House tribute. 
</P>
<P>
	--Evy Dubrow, an advocate for more than 50 years of laws to  
improve domestic labor conditions. ``She has been influential in 
numerous causes, including broadening laws against discrimination 
and protecting American industry from unfair foreign competition,'' 
the tribute said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sister M. Isolina Ferre, founder of community service centers,  
clinics and programs to empower the poor in Puerto Rico, New York 
and Appalachia. She gained international recognition in the late 
1950s and 1960s for her mediation efforts with youth gangs in 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	--Oliver White Hill, civil rights lawyer. He is best known for  
litigating one of the school desegregation cases that became the 
landmark Brown vs. Board of Education case. 
</P>
<P>
	--Max Kampelman, lawyer, diplomat and negotiator in Democratic  
and Republican administrations. ``In those roles, he emphasized 
human rights in East-West diplomacy and prepared the foundation for 
long-term arms reductions between the United States and the Soviet 
Union,'' the tribute said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Edgar Wayburn, five-time president and a member of the board of  
directors of the Sierra Club for almost 40 years.

<HEADLINE> Community Center a Horror Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Isabelle Shalometh was at the reception  
counter when the gunman strode into the Jewish community center and 
wordlessly started pulling the trigger on his semiautomatic weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Shalometh, 68, dove behind the counter as bullets shredded a  
stack of papers on a desk, grazed her back and arm and hammered 
into the walls. 
</P>
<P>
	``She saw him coming at her -- and he just started firing,''  
Shalometh's daughter, Lucille Shalometh Goldin, told the Daily News 
of Los Angeles. ``She knew enough to get down and crawl into the 
back office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shalometh, who has worked at the North Valley Jewish Community  
Center in suburban Granada Hills for almost 20 years, was one of 
five people wounded in the attack Tuesday. She wasn't seriously 
hurt, but a 5-year-old boy hit by more than one slug remained in 
critical condition early today after hours of surgery. Also wounded 
were two 6-year-old boys who had started summer camp at the center 
this week, and a 16-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman, identified by police as Buford Furrow, 37, slipped  
away from a huge manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene outside the center in the suburban San Fernando Valley  
was disturbingly familiar: frightened parents huddled nervously 
behind yellow police tape, waiting to find out if their children 
survived a gunman's rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Good news was shouted from parent to parent across the neatly  
cropped yards of the normally quiet, middle-class neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's OK! He's OK!'' one mother yelled when she learned the  
fate of her son. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents and staff at the center counted their blessings that  
many of the older children were away on field trips during the 
mid-morning rampage. They marveled that more people weren't hurt by 
an estimated 70 bullets sprayed indiscriminately around the center 
by the man who finished shooting and walked away, just four minutes 
ahead of the police. 
</P>
<P>
	In seconds, a setting of swimming lessons, art classes and  
summer fun turned into a scene filled with random horror. Police 
said bullet holes were at the same level at the little desks used 
by children. 
</P>
<P>
	Maintenance man Victor Reolas was in a classroom when he heard a  
noise he thought was an explosion in the kitchen. ``Then I realized 
it was shooting,'' Reolas told the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Reolas ran into another room where he found several terrified  
children lying on the floor, including an injured boy he carried 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Program director Elaine Wynstock was walking back from an errand  
to buy day-old bread for the homeless when she saw a center worker 
lying protectively on a wounded teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was bleeding pretty bad. He said, `Don't go in, just drop  
down,''' Wynstock said. ``The police came and they told us to run 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frantic parents heard the news on TV or were summoned from work  
by friends who had heard. They gathered behind a police line, 
waiting to hear their children's names announced by a firefighter 
with a bullhorn. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the children were evacuated to a neighboring temple that  
shares a building with an Episcopal church. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen frightened preschoolers and teachers took refuge next  
door to the Jewish center in the Rinaldi Convalescent Hospital, 
said administrator David Hibarger. 
</P>
<P>
	The staff fed them grilled cheese sandwiches and orange juice,  
said Hibarger, who reported: ``They're sitting on the floor and one 
of the counselors is playing the piano.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Macofsky, 41, said she drove to the center in a panic  
after learning of the shooting. As it turned out, her son Michael, 
11, was away, touring the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles with 
other older children when the shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to cry when I saw him,'' she said. ``But I held back  
and just hugged him tightly.''

<HEADLINE> Seahawks' Top Choice Agrees to Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHENEY, Wash. (AP) -- The Seattle Seahawks agreed to terms with  
their first-round draft choice, Lamar King, and unrestricted free 
agent wide receiver Michael Jackson on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	King, a 6-foot-3, 294-pounder from Saginaw (Mich.) Valley State,  
was the 22nd player selected in the April draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-4, 195-pound Jackson has played in the NFL for eight  
seasons -- five with the Cleveland Browns and three with the 
Baltimore Ravens. He had 38 receptions for 477 yards and no 
touchdowns with the Ravens last season. 
</P>
<P>
	King reportedly agreed to a five-year contract for $5.075  
million, with a $3.6 million signing bonus. He wanted a four-year 
deal, but went for a longer contract because he got a larger 
signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an agreement,'' Seahawks general manager and coach  
Mike Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, will begin practicing with the Seahawks after he signs  
his contract, Holmgren said. He is projected as the backup to 
starting defensive right end Phillip Daniels this season, but 
Holmgren said he's put himself far behind the other players by 
reporting late to training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, 30, gives the Seahawks another tall receiver. They  
signed 6-4 wide receiver Sean Dawkins as an unrestricted free agent 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	In his eight years of pro ball, Cleveland's 1991 sixth-round  
draft choice from Southern Mississippi has played in 114 games, 
with 92 starts. He has 353 receptions for 5,393 yards and 46 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Ravens in 1996, he made 76 catches for 1,201 yards and  
14 touchdowns.

<HEADLINE>  Police Searching for L.A. Shooter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The hunt for the balding man accused of  
wounding five people at a Jewish community center spread across the 
West today amid reports the suspect had ties to white supremacist 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center today, staff, parents and children slowly trickled  
back to summer programs under the gaze of armed security guards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good because my father's here,'' said Abby Dreyfuss,  
10, who arrived hand-in-hand with her father, Jonathan. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman gave the slip to police who arrived a the center  
within four minutes of the shootings Tuesday. He allegedly 
carjacked a Toyota at gunpoint about 20 minutes later -- leaving 
behind a van full of ammunition, survival paraphernalia, and a book 
some link to white supremacist thought -- then dumped the car at a 
motel and disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt about it that this is now a hate crime,''  
said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they were looking for Buford Oneal Furrow, 37, of  
Washington state as a suspect in both the shootings and the 
carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern Poverty Law Center, which maintains a database of  
white supremacists, has information that Furrow belonged to Aryan 
Nations in 1995, including a photo, said Mark Potok of the 
Montgomery, Ala.-based center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a picture of him, Furrow, in a Nazi outfit,'' Potok  
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow lived at times in Metaline Falls, Wash., once a haven for  
the supremacist group the Order, The Spokesman-Review reported in 
Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as a security guard at a white supremacist meeting in  
the 1990s and had a relationship with Debbie Mathews, widow of 
Order founder Robert J. Mathews, the paper said. Mathews was killed 
in 1984 when his hideout caught fire during a shootout with federal 
agents on Whidbey Island in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	Police so far have declined to call the shootings at the North  
Valley Jewish Community in suburban Granada Hills a hate crime, but 
have said the choice of targets makes that a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacker strode into the community center's lobby and opened  
fire with a semiautomatic gun resembling an Uzi, peppering the 
building with some 70 shots. A center maintenance worker threw his 
body over an injured teen, while teachers and other workers led 
children to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing said by the suspect before the shooting,''  
Police Chief Bernard Parks said. ``It was indiscriminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wounded include a 5-year-old boy who was hit in the abdomen  
and leg. He was in critical condition today after undergoing six 
hours of surgery and was given a fair chance of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hurt were center receptionist, 68-year-old Isabelle  
Shalometh, two 6-year-old boys and a 16-year-old girl who was a 
counselor at the center's summer camp that began Monday. The boys 
and the counselor were in stable condition today and Mrs. 
Shalometh, grazed on the arm and back as she dove for cover, was 
released from the hospital Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence was the latest shooting at workplaces and schools  
across the country, and brought immediate calls for stricter gun 
control and measures to protect children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by  
gun violence,'' President Clinton said in Washington. ``It calls on 
all of us not only to give our thoughts and prayers to the victims 
and their families, but intensify our resolve to make America a 
safer place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The organization that runs the community center posted armed  
guards at its several other operations in the region, and security 
was stepped up at children's programs in other states, said Nina 
Lieberman Giladi, an associate vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	She said children, including her son who saw two bleeding  
victims, wanted to get together with the other children to reassure 
themselves they were safe. She said her son ``just wanted to talk. 
He wanted to talk about his friends, talk about what happened, talk 
about why this man did this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report of the carjacking and discovery of the abandoned van  
came within 20 minutes and 4 miles of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the red-and-white van, officers found large amounts of  
ammunition in metal boxes, magazines for an assault rifle, a 
booklet titled Ranger Handbook and freeze-dried food. Various news 
reports have said there was a copy of the book ``War Cycles, Peace 
Cycles'' by Richard Kelly Hoskins, which the Southern Poverty Law 
Center says is a staple of hate group literature. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours later, the carjacked Toyota was found parked outside  
a motel in Chatsworth, another suburb in the San Fernando Valley, 
but hours of cautious searching by SWAT teams failed to turn up the 
gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	Police refused to say how the search was being conducted today,  
but said it involved the FBI and spread to Washington state and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The abandoned van was purchased Saturday from the Tacoma (Wash.)  
Kar Korner, said the manager of the lot, who refused to be 
identified. Cmdr. Dave Kalish, a Los Angeles police spokesman, 
identified Furrow as the buyer of the van, which had Washington 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents visited an Olympia, Wash., home believed to be that  
of Furrow's father Tuesday night. The FBI refused to comment on the 
visit and nobody in the house would speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was sentenced this spring to eight months in jail for  
second-degree assault with a deadly weapon, KOMO-TV in Seattle 
reported Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times reported that late last year Furrow tried to  
commit himself at the Fairfax Psychiatric Hospital in Kirkland, a 
Seattle suburb, but got in trouble when he pulled a knife on 
staffers and eventually pleaded guilty to second-degree assault.

<HEADLINE> Researcher Makes Cheaper Fuel Cell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A researcher says he has made an experimental fuel cell that  
runs on natural gas instead of pure hydrogen -- a step that could 
lead to cheaper production of low-pollution power sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings of the Northwestern University research team led by  
Scott Barnett are reported in today's edition of the science 
journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Department of Energy experts had mixed reactions to the study.  
One was skeptical that the experiment, done in a controlled 
laboratory setting, could be applied to daily use. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel cells are an alternative power source for cars, power  
plants and individual buildings. In a fuel cell, gas and oxygen 
react chemically to produce electricity, water, heat -- and 
virtually no pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
	Utilities and auto makers are pouring millions of dollars into  
researching fuel cells as pollution concerns rise. But while the 
technology is ready, it is still too expensive for practical use. 
</P>
<P>
	One type of fuel cell that shows promise in power plants is the  
solid-oxide cell. It runs best on pure hydrogen, which is usually 
converted from a natural gas like methane before being injected 
into the cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel cells powerful enough for power plants run at high  
temperatures and can easily convert the natural gas into hydrogen 
by recycling their own heat and steam. Smaller fuel cells -- perhaps 
big enough to power a single home -- don't produce enough steam to 
do that and need costly external converters. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutting out the conversion step would make the smaller fuel  
cells cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you could eliminate that extra hardware and just put  
natural gas into your fuel cell, you'd be that much closer to 
making this a commercial reality,'' Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous experiments, cells cracked and became caked with  
carbon at higher temperatures, and at lower temperatures, the cells 
did not produce much electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett was able to make a fuel cell in a lab work at a lower  
temperature by using cerium oxide. Cerium oxide, also found in 
catalytic converters, makes the methane react quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The success at a lower temperature is significant, said John  
Turner, a senior scientist at the Energy Department's National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory. Lower temperatures put less strain on 
the components, meaning cheaper parts could be used, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But another DOE expert said Barnett's experiment was too limited  
to determine whether the process would be simpler. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has not done it on a large enough scale under realistic  
operating conditions to draw the conclusions he's drawing,'' said 
Michael Krumpelt, manager of the fuel cell program at the Argonne 
National Laboratory outside Chicago.

<HEADLINE> For a Fit Brain, Drive With Mittens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Ever try driving with mittens on? Sniffing  
vanilla or peppermint first thing in the morning? Brushing your 
teeth or eating with the ``wrong'' hand? Choosing potatoes at the 
grocery with your eyes closed? 
</P>
<P>
	No, it's not a Dr. Seuss story. A Duke University scientist and  
a New York writer say the brain needs novelty and multisensory 
experiences to stay sharp. They propose those activities as part of 
their brain fitness regimen, which they call ``neurobics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Lawrence C. Katz and Manning Rubin lay it out in ``Keep Your  
Brain Alive,'' throwing in 83 exercises to get the brain's cerebral 
cortex and hippocampus off the couch and out the door. The book has 
gone into a fourth printing since it hit bookstores April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz and Rubin said daily life has the potential to be a  
``neurobic brain gym,'' satisfying their program's two daily 
prerequisites: Experience the unexpected and enlist all the senses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not about tricks, or about coming up with a few things  
that will help you remember a list of names, but how to live a life 
that is brain-healthy,'' said Katz, a Duke neurobiology professor 
who runs a brain research lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Some exercises are simple: taking a different way to work,  
switching seats at meals and shopping at a farmers' market. Others 
might make people wonder about your sanity: turning your desk 
calendar and clock upside down, wearing earplugs to breakfast, 
getting into your car and starting it with eyes closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Neurobics, a synthesis of recent brain research findings and  
Katz's own research at Duke, wakes up the brain's ``attentional 
circuits'' to start the flow of growth-promoting molecules called 
neurotrophins, according to their book. 
</P>
<P>
	Neurotrophins create new circuits that improve memory and  
creative and logical thinking. The brain produces neurotrophins 
when stimulated by novelty and experiences that engage the emotions 
and two or more senses, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doing daily activities in a slightly different way can have a  
very positive effect,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz, on the cusp of middle age at 42, said he and Rubin, who is  
close to 60, were inspired to write the book after watching Katz's 
young children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's remarkable how much more they rely on all their senses,''  
he said. ``They use touch and hearing, smell and taste to learn 
about the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adults tend to abstract things,'' Katz said. ``You look at  
something and figure you know everything you need to know. ... 
That's a kind of impoverished way of looking at the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neurobics can be practiced at the beginning and end of the day,  
while commuting, at work and during meals and leisure time. Katz 
said the book's 83 exercises are just a start. There is a Web site 
(www.keepyourbrainalive.com) where people can share other neurobic 
exercises they have discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	For people reaching advanced age, the exercises can reduce the  
inevitable decline in brain processing that occurs, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you age, you want to have a healthy body, and you want to  
have a brain that won't stop you from doing a lot of things,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallmarks of people who age well always have been a willingness  
to break routines and attempt the new -- the very same cornerstones 
of neurobics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They decide to hike the Appalachian Trail at 75, or take up a  
new hobby or language,'' said Katz. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're always living a life where they're taking on new  
mental challenges, or not falling into the routine of watching TV 
every day: woodworking or gardening, volunteering at Habitat for 
Humanity. It's non-routine and very good for the brain.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Pippen Wants To Go to L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scottie Pippen has asked to be traded to the Los  
Angeles Lakers, a television station reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	KRIV-TV, citing sources which it did not identify other than to  
say they were close to the Houston Rockets forward, said that 
Pippen recently asked coach Rudy Tomjanovich to be traded to the 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Sexton, Pippen's agent, declined comment, telling KRIV he  
would neither confirm nor deny the story. Tomjanovich did not 
address the issue either, citing club policy that prohibits team 
officials from commenting on trade speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers also had nothing to say about any proposed deal that  
would reunite Pippen with Phil Jackson, the new Los Angeles coach 
who previously coached Pippen and the Chicago Bulls to six NBA 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess you'd have to talk to Houston about that,'' Lakers  
spokesman John Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black would not comment as to whether the teams were discussing  
a trade involving the seven-time NBA All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen joined the Rockets prior to last season when the Rockets  
pulled off a sign-and-trade deal with the Bulls. Pippen signed a 
five-year contract worth $67.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Pippen said he wanted to come back with the Rockets.  
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, a 12-year veteran, averaged 14.5 points, 6.5 rebounds  
and 5.9 assists a game this past season.

<HEADLINE>  Police Searching for L.A. Shooter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The hunt for the balding man accused of  
wounding five people at a Jewish community center spread across the 
West today amid reports the suspect had ties to white supremacist 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center today, staff, parents and children slowly trickled  
back to summer programs under the gaze of armed security guards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good because my father's here,'' said Abby Dreyfuss,  
10, who arrived hand-in-hand with her father, Jonathan. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman gave the slip to police who arrived a the center  
within four minutes of the shootings Tuesday. He allegedly 
carjacked a Toyota at gunpoint about 20 minutes later -- leaving 
behind a van full of ammunition, survival paraphernalia, and a book 
some link to white supremacist thought -- then dumped the car at a 
motel and disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt about it that this is now a hate crime,''  
said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they were looking for Buford Oneal Furrow, 37, of  
Washington state as a suspect in both the shootings and the 
carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern Poverty Law Center, which maintains a database of  
white supremacists, has information that Furrow belonged to Aryan 
Nations in 1995, including a photo, said Mark Potok of the 
Montgomery, Ala.-based center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a picture of him, Furrow, in a Nazi outfit,'' Potok  
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow lived at times in Metaline Falls, Wash., once a haven for  
the supremacist group the Order, The Spokesman-Review reported in 
Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as a security guard at a white supremacist meeting in  
the 1990s and had a relationship with Debbie Mathews, widow of 
Order founder Robert J. Mathews, the paper said. Mathews was killed 
in 1984 when his hideout caught fire during a shootout with federal 
agents on Whidbey Island in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	Police so far have declined to call the shootings at the North  
Valley Jewish Community in suburban Granada Hills a hate crime, but 
have said the choice of targets makes that a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacker strode into the community center's lobby and opened  
fire with a semiautomatic gun resembling an Uzi, peppering the 
building with some 70 shots. A center maintenance worker threw his 
body over an injured teen, while teachers and other workers led 
children to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing said by the suspect before the shooting,''  
Police Chief Bernard Parks said. ``It was indiscriminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wounded include a 5-year-old boy who was hit in the abdomen  
and leg. He was in critical condition today after undergoing six 
hours of surgery and was given a fair chance of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hurt were center receptionist, 68-year-old Isabelle  
Shalometh, two 6-year-old boys and a 16-year-old girl who was a 
counselor at the center's summer camp that began Monday. The boys 
and the counselor were in stable condition today and Mrs. 
Shalometh, grazed on the arm and back as she dove for cover, was 
released from the hospital Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence was the latest shooting at workplaces and schools  
across the country, and brought immediate calls for stricter gun 
control and measures to protect children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by  
gun violence,'' President Clinton said in Washington. ``It calls on 
all of us not only to give our thoughts and prayers to the victims 
and their families, but intensify our resolve to make America a 
safer place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The organization that runs the community center posted armed  
guards at its several other operations in the region, and security 
was stepped up at children's programs in other states, said Nina 
Lieberman Giladi, an associate vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	She said children, including her son who saw two bleeding  
victims, wanted to get together with the other children to reassure 
themselves they were safe. She said her son ``just wanted to talk. 
He wanted to talk about his friends, talk about what happened, talk 
about why this man did this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report of the carjacking and discovery of the abandoned van  
came within 20 minutes and 4 miles of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the red-and-white van, officers found large amounts of  
ammunition in metal boxes, magazines for an assault rifle, a 
booklet titled Ranger Handbook and freeze-dried food. Various news 
reports have said there was a copy of the book ``War Cycles, Peace 
Cycles'' by Richard Kelly Hoskins, which the Southern Poverty Law 
Center says is a staple of hate group literature. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours later, the carjacked Toyota was found parked outside  
a motel in Chatsworth, another suburb in the San Fernando Valley, 
but hours of cautious searching by SWAT teams failed to turn up the 
gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	Police refused to say how the search was being conducted today,  
but said it involved the FBI and spread to Washington state and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The abandoned van was purchased Saturday from the Tacoma (Wash.)  
Kar Korner, said the manager of the lot, who refused to be 
identified. Cmdr. Dave Kalish, a Los Angeles police spokesman, 
identified Furrow as the buyer of the van, which had Washington 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents visited an Olympia, Wash., home believed to be that  
of Furrow's father Tuesday night. The FBI refused to comment on the 
visit and nobody in the house would speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was sentenced this spring to eight months in jail for  
second-degree assault with a deadly weapon, KOMO-TV in Seattle 
reported Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times reported that late last year Furrow tried to  
commit himself at the Fairfax Psychiatric Hospital in Kirkland, a 
Seattle suburb, but got in trouble when he pulled a knife on 
staffers and eventually pleaded guilty to second-degree assault.

<HEADLINE> Navajo Nation Sues Tobacco Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Mirroring successful claims made by numerous  
states, the nation's largest Indian tribe sued the tobacco industry 
on Wednesday to recover the cost of caring for sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	A 135-page complaint filed in Navajo court alleges tobacco  
companies deceived Navajo Nation consumers, illegally targeted 
minors and burdened their healthcare system. 
</P>
<P>
	The claim seeks unspecified damages from eight tobacco  
companies, including Phillip Morris and R.J. Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about protecting our Navajo youth from a campaign  
targeted toward them,'' said Levon Henry, attorney general for the 
Navajo Nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Phillip Morris and Reynolds said they had not seen  
the lawsuit Wednesday and wouldn't comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice as many American Indians smoke in comparison to other  
groups, according to the surgeon general. The figures are worse for 
the Navajo. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, 29 percent of Navajo high school students said they  
smoked on a regular basis. The number increased to 47.5 percent in 
1997, said Louis Denetsosie, a lawyer representing the Navajo 
Nation.

<P>
	65 years ago: Cecil B. DeMille's ``Cleopatra'' starred Claudette  
Colbert. 
</P>
<P>
	60 years ago: ``The Wizard of Oz'' premiered in Hollywood. The  
film starred Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr and Jack Haley. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	Spoken one year ago:  
</P>

<HEADLINE> No Surgery Yet for Larry Walker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- He scored about as well as expected on his  
latest magnetic resonance imaging exam, which means Colorado 
Rockies outfielder Larry Walker can wait until the end of the 
season for surgery on his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's left knee has been bothering him since July 25, when  
the Rockies opened a four-game series against Houston. He came out 
of Sunday's game after the third inning. He wasn't in the lineup 
for the second consecutive game Tuesday and he won't play today. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker hopes to get back on the field Friday, when the Rockies  
play the Montreal Expos at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Team physician Wayne Gersoff read the MRI and agreed with the  
original findings of team trainer Tom Probst. Walker has wear and 
tear, or fraying, in the meniscus cartilage of his left knee. He's 
not going on the disabled list and may undergo postseason surgery 
to clean out the loose cartilage but that is still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't throw up an alarm at this point,'' said Probst.  
``It comes down to whether or not he can tolerate the discomfort 
enough to play, but it's not a situation where we need to shut him 
down right now and perform surgery.''

<HEADLINE> Umpires Seek Injunction To Save Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball umpires have asked the National Labor  
Relations Board to seek an injunction in federal court to save the 
jobs of 22 umps baseball plans to let go next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Silverman, the New York regional director of the NLRB, said  
Wednesday his office received a one-line request from the union on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires filed an unfair labor practice charge against the  
American and National leagues last week. If Silverman's office 
decides to issue a complaint, he then would have the option of 
requesting that NLRB general counsel Fred Feinstein ask the 
agency's five-person board for permission to seek the injunction. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar process, Silverman won an injunction against  
baseball owners four years ago that caused players to ended their 
strike after 7 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really have no idea how long this will take,'' umpires union  
president Jerry Crawford said Wednesday. ``What I do know is that 
this is an ongoing process where lawyers are involved with 
different arguments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman does not expect to decide the case until next month.  
Baseball has accepted the resignations of 22 umpires, effective 
Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Most labor lawyers think it is highly unlikely the NLRB would  
seek an injunction, even if it does issue a complaint. That's 
because a key issue in injunction law is irreparable harm. 
</P>
<P>
	If the umpires eventually prevail in their charge, any damages  
could be remedied with an order to rehire the umpires with back 
pay, the lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just hoping to get 22 fellows who might be out of a job  
back into a job,'' Crawford said. ``I sent a letter to all the 
union members yesterday. I basically said that what I'm looking for 
is some unity and some support for the 22 members involved here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fearful that baseball would lock them out after their labor  
contract expires Dec. 31, umpires announced July 14 that they would 
quit en masse to try to force an early start to negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strategy backfired when 27 of the 68 umpires either  
refused to resign or withdrew their resignations. Baseball then 
hired 25 new umpires from the minors and accepted the 22 
resignations.

<HEADLINE> Parents React To Shooting News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- Jamie Jernigan first heard the  
news at work: A man with an automatic weapon had burst into a 
Jewish community center and shot five people, including three boys 
at day camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, picking up her young son Mackenzie from a day care  
center and school at a synagogue, she was overcome with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't her son's school. It wasn't even her city.  
</P>
<P>
	``It just hits so close to home. My son's only 2 and one of the  
boys who was shot was only 5. It just shows that it can happen 
anywhere, to any child,'' she said, fighting back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting at the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Los  
Angeles on Tuesday was the latest at workplaces and schools across 
the nation. They have teachers and parents worrying how to make any 
place safe enough for children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Union of American Hebrew Congregations on Tuesday advised  
its synagogues and Jewish schools to tighten security, and police 
in at least two Southern California counties increased patrols at 
schools and community centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis announced California agencies will form a task  
force to advise churches and child care centers on improving 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congregation Emanu El Clare Cherry School, a non-secular,  
private school in this community of 180,000 about 60 miles east of 
Los Angeles, locked its doors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told the children this was like an earthquake or fire  
drill. But instead of going outside, we told the children we were 
doing an inside drill because sometimes you have to stay inside the 
building,'' said the school's director, Roni Stein. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of parents called the school concerned about security,  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearby Redlands, counselors at the Teen Center tried to ease  
fears with group discussions, said Paul O'Neill, the center's 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	Krinshanda Watts, 14, said most of the time she greets visitors  
to the center with a smile and a handshake. But Tuesday, she was 
keeping an eye on people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I saw somebody I didn't know, I was like `Who's  
that? Who's that?''' she said. ``You just never know about people 
these days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back at Emanu El Clare, April Wursten was struggling with how to  
explain the shooting to her sons, ages 11 and 9. While she and her 
husband had discussed previous school shootings with her older son, 
she had never brought up the issue with her younger son. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll put my arms around him and tell him sometimes  
rotten people do rotten things, and then let him ask questions. 
It's something I'd hoped I wouldn't have to discuss with him yet,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Carla Herring, whose 7-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son  
attend the school, the job was more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``I put my children in private school because I didn't want them  
to have to deal with gangs, drugs and crime,'' she said. ``Now, I 
have to tell them that even in a private school, a great private 
school, they aren't safe.''

<HEADLINE> History To Repeat at Woodstock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHEL, N.Y. (AP) -- The heady idealism of Woodstock rose from  
the mud of this upstate hamlet 30 years ago, only to crash in the 
flames of July's anniversary concert. 
</P>
<P>
	But now some veteran artists from the original 1969 show are  
returning to give peace another chance. 
</P>
<P>
	David Crosby, Richie Havens and seven other '60s stalwarts will  
strum and sing on Max Yasgur's old farm on Aug. 15, this time as 
part of a nostalgia-tinged reunion. The modest one-day festival 
kicks off in the shadow of the far larger official Woodstock '99 
festival held in Rome, N.Y. in July. But given that Woodstock '99 
ended notoriously with fires and rioting, some veteran performers 
feel they can set a few things right. 
</P>
<P>
	``All over the world people know about Woodstock. It's just too  
bad it reflects this other stuff,'' said Rick Danko, the former 
bassist with The Band. Danko will return to Bethel with his old 
Band-mate, Garth Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything is going to restore it to something that isn't  
advocating violence and stupidity, that will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, maybe.  
</P>
<P>
	``A Day in the Garden'' looks to be a far cry from the  
counterculture mega-event that drew 400,000 people here for three 
days in August 1969. Many of the concert's top draws are dead (Jimi 
Hendrix, Janis Joplin) or disbanded (The Who, Grateful Dead). Nor 
will this show be heavy on hype and youth-oriented acts, as were 
the official Woodstock anniversary concerts held in Saugerties in 
1994 and Rome this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Day in the Garden'' figures to be more like your parents'  
Woodstock, with gray-haired acts whose names might draw blank 
stares from latter-day Woodstock moshers. Others in the lineup are 
Johnny Winter, Melanie, Country Joe McDonald and Arlo Guthrie. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the artists have remained friendly over the decades, and  
the concert has the feel of old buddies getting together. Some of 
the artists, like Guthrie and Crosby, are even performing with 
their kids this time around. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be a little nostalgic, obviously,'' Guthrie  
said. ``There's a lot of aspects of this to me personally that mean 
more than just going to another gig.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guthrie fondly recalled 1969 as the year he was married and  
appeared in a movie based on his signature song, ``Alice's 
Restaurant.'' And, of course, it was the year the 22-year-old with 
a cloud of dark scraggly hair played at Woodstock for a huge crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was absolutely devastating to me. I don't know how I  
breathed,'' Guthrie said. ``It was totally bizarre to see that many 
people in that place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danko remembered flying in a helicopter for the first time and  
being stunned during its descent by the sheer mass of people 
sitting on the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
	While Danko never again set foot on the field 80 miles northwest  
of New York City, Guthrie and some other veterans have come back. 
Those visits often resulted in impromptu anniversary performances 
for the tie-dyed masses who annually converged on the site. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference this time is that the rolling field now has a  
'90s makeover complete with groomed grass and a perimeter fence. 
This concert is a regulated event, with advance tickets selling for 
$19.69 (get it?) each. 
</P>
<P>
	A local businessman, Alan Gerry, recently bought the land and is  
developing it into a year-round entertainment attraction to tap 
into Woodstock's cultural cachet. 
</P>
<P>
	The upgraded site made its debut last August with a three-day  
concert featuring a few Woodstock alums like Pete Townshend along 
with contemporary acts such as the Goo Dolls. That concert was also 
called ``A Day in the Garden,'' a lyrical reference to the Joni 
Mitchell's song, ``Woodstock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promoters said they drew 76,000 people over three days last  
August, with the largest crowd drawn to the contemporary acts on 
the last day. There is no early word on ticket sales for this 
year's one-day show, although it has piqued the interest of at 
least some former flower children. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say you can't go home again, but this is going to be like  
getting a Western Union from home,'' said Duke Devlin, a reveler at 
the original show who has worked at each successive concert. 
</P>
<P>
	While long-term development plans for the site are being worked  
out, it still plays host to musical events. Teen pop queen Britney 
Spears played a show in July, and Reba McEntire headlines a country 
lineup Aug. 14.

<HEADLINE> Southwest Airlines CEO Has Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Herb Kelleher, the flamboyant, chain-smoking  
leader of low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines, has prostate cancer, 
the company disclosed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher, 68, the co-founder and longtime chief executive and  
chairman, will begin eight weeks of radiation treatment today at 
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher joked his way through a half-hour conference call with  
reporters, downplaying his ``mundane, routine'' case of prostate 
cancer and saying the illness would not interfere with his ability 
to run the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Some stockholders have complained about Kelleher's smoking and  
questioned whether the company has an adequate succession plan for 
the man who helped found the airline in 1971. Kelleher dismissed 
the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't intend to make any changes in my lifestyle, and  
certainly there will be no changes in the business of Southwest 
Airlines as a consequence,'' he said, adding that the only impact 
will be a curtailed travel schedule while he commutes to Houston 
each weekday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also dismissed the succession worries. ``There is no need to  
update any succession plan because our board discusses that issue 
on a regular basis,'' said Kelleher, whose contract runs through 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancer was discovered at an early stage during a routine  
annual prostate examination, and is in a mild stage of development, 
said Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach, director of the prostate cancer 
program at M.D. Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Kelleher is expected ``to lead a fully active and  
productive life just as if he had never had prostate cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher co-founded Southwest Airlines in 1971. He was named  
chairman in 1978 and assumed titles of president and CEO in 1981. 
His flamboyant leadership and high-flying spirit have been 
considered the keys to Southwest's success. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's disclosure comes just months after a shareholder  
raised concerns about Kelleher's longevity, complaining about his 
penchant for cigarettes, Wild Turkey liquor and frequently flying 
aboard an airline that routinely offers fat- and salt-laden 
peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal put forward by the shareholder would have made  
Kelleher, who is also president, choose between running either the 
board or day-to-day operations. The proposal never made it for a 
vote at the company's annual meeting in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher has always had a tongue-in-cheek style that has created  
a casual corporate culture at an airline known for high customer 
satisfaction. Fortune magazine named it the country's most admired 
airline, and this year, the best place to work in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas-based Southwest is the nation's fourth-largest carrier in  
terms of customer boardings. It operates more than 2,450 flights a 
day and has more than 28,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, its stock dipped 12 1/2 cents to $16.37 1/2 a share in  
midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Cos. To Bankroll Family-Friendly TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eleven major advertisers who say there aren't  
enough wholesome television programs are putting their money behind 
a small effort to change things. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertisers, including Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., General Motors,  
IBM and Sears, said Wednesday they will pay to have writers develop 
family-friendly scripts for consideration by the WB network. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into a season where broadcasters plan to push the  
envelope with bawdy language and sex references in an attempt to 
lure young viewers, the advertisers say there are fewer prime-time 
programs where they feel comfortable selling products. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to encourage responsible entertainment, and the  
programming that is available between the hours of 8 and 10 p.m. is 
not as family-friendly as we would like it to be,'' said Kaki 
Hinton, director of advertising services at the drug and consumer 
products maker Warner-Lambert Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertisers won't say how much money they are committing.  
But it generally costs between $60,000 and $90,000 to come up with 
a script, and they've agreed to bankroll at least eight. The WB 
will supervise the development and decide which scripts, if any, 
will go into production. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertisers approached all of the broadcast networks with  
their concerns, but the WB came up with the most specific idea, 
said Andrea Alstrup, vice president of advertising at Johnson &AMP; 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The group says it wants a better balance of programming. ``We're  
not saying the other stuff should go away,'' said Gretchen Briscoe, 
a spokeswoman for Procter &AMP; Gamble, ``we're just saying we need 
more options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Hollywood's creative people recoil from the idea of  
family-friendly shows, conceded Jordan Levin, executive vice 
president of programming for the WB. Such firm support from a group 
of advertisers will make more writers interested, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB's highest-rated show is ``7th Heaven,'' about a minister  
raising a family. But the network's stock in trade is 
teen-oriented, sex-obsessed dramas like ``Dawson's Creek,'' whose 
success has encouraged other networks to go after young viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	While ``7th Heaven'' draws many teen viewers, most television  
executives say family-oriented shows usually appeal to older 
viewers that the bulk of advertisers don't desire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confused as a viewer as to what the advertisers really  
want,'' said Dorothy Swanson, founder of Viewers for Quality 
Television. 
</P>
<P>
	Although networks frequently take their cues from major  
advertisers about what programs are acceptable, Swanson said she 
was concerned that the WB may be giving away too much of its 
authority as programmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Alstrup said the advertisers ``don't plan to become production  
arms for the networks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech, AT&AMP;T, Nationwide Insurance, Pfizer and Wendy's  
International are also contributing to the scripts. 
</P>
<P>
	For the WB, the deal gives financial help to what is often the  
least cost-effective functions of a network. Networks routinely pay 
millions of dollars to write and produce prospective shows that 
never get on the air or are quickly canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin said he expected one or two of the scripts will make it on  
the air, although not until next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertisers are coming up with other ways to advance their  
agenda, including sponsoring a page in TV Guide each week to steer 
viewers to family programming.

<HEADLINE> Main Tokyo Stock Index Rises / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The main Tokyo stock index rose slightly Wednesday  
in thin trading during the peak of Japan's summer holiday season. 
The dollar edged lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained a scant 9.07  
points, or 0.05 percent, to 17,211.16 at the end of the afternoon 
session. On Tuesday, the average closed up 11.64 points, or 0.07 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 114.70 yen at 5 p.m. (4 a.m. EDT)  
Wednesday, down 0.18 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below 
its late New York level of 114.81 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In the stock market, traders said strong June machinery orders  
reinforced the view the that the Japanese economy is strengthening, 
and many expected the Nikkei to trade in the same territory for the 
rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is firm market support at the 17,000 mark,'' said  
Yoshiyuki Higashi, an investment information manager at Taiheiyo 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Economic Planning Agency said Tuesday that core  
machinery orders in June were up 6.3 percent from May after 
seasonal adjustments, far above forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Machinery orders are a leading indicator of capital investment  
trends. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, trading was scant, with many participants retreated to  
the sidelines as Japan headed into the peak of the summer holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 325.39 million shares, while retreating shares 
outnumbered advancers 616 to 521, with 153 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 52.55 points  
to close at 10,655.15 on Tuesday. The technology-rich Nasdaq 
composite index fell 28.87 points to 2,490.11. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 3.61 points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,420.64. 
The TOPIX closed down 0.28 point, or 0.02 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, traders said the dollar inched down during  
the day after Japanese institutional investors adjusted positions 
during the vacation lull. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market's attention was fixed on a news  
conference by Ichiro Ozawa, leader of Japan's Liberal Party. But it 
was postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozawa has threatened to break away from the alliance with the  
Liberal Democratic Party over a dispute regarding a proposed 
reduction in seats in the lower house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Although analysts have said Ozawa's departure would have little  
impact on policy, the end of the eight-month-old coalition could 
shake confidence in Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's administration. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 122.99 yen, down  
from 123.30 late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond dropped to 1.8300 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.8950 
percent, driving its price to 99.74 yen from 99.19 yen.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Suspect Tied to Neo-Nazis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	METALINE FALLS, Wash. (AP) -- The man who surrendered Wednesday  
in the shootings of five people at a Jewish Community Center in Los 
Angeles has a painfully familiar history: a low-profile loner with 
racist views and a nasty temper. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who remember Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., 37, say he was a  
lonely, bespectacled overweight boy teased by his classmates. After 
high school, he couldn't make it through an Army boot camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he got involved with neo-Nazi groups near this timber  
town in eastern Washington and had a long relationship with the 
widow of a hate-group founder killed in a shootout with police. 
</P>
<P>
	After the relationship ended last year, Furrow tried to commit  
himself to a private mental hospital in the Seattle suburbs, 
telling the staff at Fairfax Psychiatric Hospital ``he was thinking 
about suicide and shooting people'' at a mall north of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I feel like I could just lose it and kill people,''  
Furrow was quoted as saying in papers filed by King County 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged last Nov. 2 with second-degree assault, accused  
of attacking a Fairfax nurse with a knife after he apparently 
changed his mind about committing himself and demanded his car keys 
back. Deputies found a 9mm handgun and ammunition and four knives 
in the vehicle. He pleaded guilty, served about five months in 
jail, and was released May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was described as a quiet guy by those who had contact  
with him here and in a rural area at the south end of Puget Sound, 
where he grew up. His father, also named Buford O. Furrow, retired 
in 1977 as a chief master sergeant in the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents were ``wonderful people,'' said junior-high  
schoolmate Loni Merrill. She said Furrow used to get teased about 
his allergy medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a loner, a kind of bookish guy -- what they'd call a  
nerd these days. But he was always nice to me,'' Ms. Merrill said 
Wednesday. ``He wasn't somebody that stood out. He was somebody who 
nobody knew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow graduated from high school in 1979 and joined the Army in  
August 1980. He lasted two months -- he didn't make it through boot 
camp, a Pentagon source said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Years later, Furrow didn't make much of an impression in  
Metaline Falls, a town of 230 people in the Selkirk Mountain 
foothills near the Idaho border. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow apparently had addresses in Rosamond, Calif., near Los  
Angeles, in 1993 and 1994, but locals say he lived here for several 
years with Debbie Mathews, whose husband, Robert J. Mathews, 
founded the neo-Nazi group The Order, a violent offshoot of the 
Aryan Nations. Mathews was killed in 1984 when his hideout caught 
fire during a shootout with federal agents on Whidbey Island in 
Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler said he believes he married  
Furrow and Mathews around 1996, though the union was not recorded 
with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview Wednesday from his compound at Hayden  
Lake, Idaho, Butler said Furrow may have attended services at his 
Church of Jesus Christ Christian/Aryan Nations a few times several 
years ago, but he did not know him well. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what might have motivated Tuesday's shootings, Butler  
replied: ``The war against the white race. There's a war of 
extermination against the white male.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who answered the phone at the number listed for Debbie  
Mathews hung up on two Associated Press reporters Wednesday. There 
was no sign of her on her property, which has several ``No 
Trespassing'' signs. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Aryan Nations member Floyd Cochran said he met Furrow at  
the group's northern Idaho compound in 1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had basic conversations about Jews running the world,''  
Cochran said in a telephone interview from his home in Moshannon, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow ``was not any more violent than other people there,''  
said Cochran, who now lectures in opposition to hate groups. ``He 
had a fascination with guns, but at the Aryan Nations if you didn't 
have a fascination with guns you might get shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Furrow also ``was fascinated with where did the money  
from The Order go,'' adding: ``That might explain his fascination 
with Debbie Mathews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Robert Mathews' death, 22 Order members were jailed on  
racketeering charges, accused in the 1984 murder of Denver radio 
talk-show host Alan Berg and of robberies that netted more than $4 
million -- one-third of which was never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Cochran said Furrow also had dated Jeannie Yarbrough, whose  
husband was among those imprisoned, and that he'd heard Furrow used 
to dig in Yarbrough's yard, apparently looking for the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Reynolds of the Southern Poverty Law Center in  
Montgomery, Ala., which tracks hate groups and has a file on 
Furrow, said Furrow apparently followed the beliefs of the 
so-called Phineas Priesthood, which is opposed to interracial 
marriage and the charging of interest by banks. That loose-knit 
group also has been linked to 1996 Spokane-area bombings and bank 
robberies, and to recent fires at synagogues in Sacramento, Calif., 
Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow left Metaline Falls last year after being laid off from  
his mechanic job in nearby Colville for lack of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (Ms. Mathews) dumped him a year or so ago, and I  
haven't seen him since,'' the town marshal, Rick Reiber, told The 
Spokesman-Review newspaper in Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow returned to the west side of the state, for a time living  
in a trailer near Lynnwood north of Seattle, The Seattle Times 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came his clash at the mental hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	After being released from jail in May, Furrow headed south to  
his parents' home near the state capital of Olympia. The house -- 
visited by the FBI after the shootings -- is tucked into lush woods 
in a rural area where blackberries and purple fireweed flowers line 
the roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Janet Tyrolt said she last saw Furrow about a week ago.  
</P>
<P>
	They only spoke once -- when they met at their mailboxes and  
joked about how dangerous it was to dash across the road to check 
the mail. Afterwards, ``he actually stopped the traffic for me,'' 
Ms. Tyrolt said. ``It was really nice.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Caucasus Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANSALTA, Russia (AP) -- Russia launched a new offensive today  
against Islamic rebels who are fighting for a Muslim-controlled 
state in the Caucasus mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials maintained they would only need a few more  
days to eliminate the rebels who invaded the southern Russian 
republic of Dagestan on Saturday, seizing several villages and 
clashing with Russian troops. 
</P>
<P>
	By today, the rebels claimed to have entrenched themselves in  
Dagestan's Botlikh region. They said they still controlled parts of 
the Tsumadinsky region, to the south. 
</P>
<P>
	But the commander of Russia's Interior Ministry troops,  
Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov, said Russian soldiers had taken full 
control of the Tsumadinsky region and were eliminating remaining 
rebels there. He said the rebel fighters in the Botlikh region's 
villages were surrounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia launched a new combat operation in Botlikh, Ovchinnikov  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels, who on Tuesday proclaimed an independent state under  
Islamic control in Dagestan, showed no sign of backing down. 
</P>
<P>
	A council of Muslim leaders, or Shura, named Shamil Basayev to  
lead their proclaimed state. Basayev is a Chechen fighter who 
played a key role in deadly attacks against Russia during the 
1994-96 war in Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Basayev, speaking in the rebel stronghold of Ansalta, told an  
Associated Press reporter that all villages in Botlikh except for 
the main city of Botlikh itself were under rebel control. 
</P>
<P>
	He claimed his fighters had shot down seven Russian helicopters  
and one plane. Russia has said it has lost only two helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will fight until the full victory of Islam in the world,''  
Basayev said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had given control of the rebel army to Khattab, a  
Jordanian who has become one of the most prominent warlords in 
Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of Khattab and Basayev would appear to verify  
Russian government claims that the rebels are members of the 
Wahhabi sect of Muslims. The sect supports independence for 
Russia's mostly Muslim regions in the Caucasus. 
</P>
<P>
	Khattab, who uses only that single name, has long been said to  
be a Wahhabi. Basayev considers the group his allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian authorities raised their estimates of the size of the  
rebel contingent today, saying it included at least 1,200 people. 
Earlier reports had put the rebels at 300 to 600 gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Khattab, however, told The AP the rebels were 3,000 strong.  
</P>
<P>
	Ovchinnikov said that 10 Interior Ministry troops had been  
killed and 27 wounded during the five-day campaign. Dagestan's 
Interior Ministry said 44 militants were killed and 80 were wounded 
in fighting Tuesday. There was no way to confirm the figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign is the largest challenge to Russian authority since  
the war with Chechnya, which gained de facto independence for that 
republic. Chechen gunmen have made frequent cross-border attacks 
into Dagestan and other regions since. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Basayev and authorities in Chechnya denied that the  
fighters in Dagestan were connected in any way to the Chechen 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Wary of repeating mistakes made during that war, Russia has been  
proceeding cautiously, amassing troops and launching attacks mostly 
from the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia was also enlisting the help of some 300 volunteers, who  
boarded buses today with an assortment of personal firearms to join 
the battle against the rebels. The volunteers were responding to a 
plea by local authorities to help put down the insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the ITAR-Tass news agency, 6,000 refugees have fled  
the fighting so far.

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Taiwan in $2.5 Billion Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Boeing Co. signed a $2.5 billion contract  
to supply Taiwan's China Airlines with 13 airplanes on Wednesday, a 
day after losing a deal to sell the airline additional $1.5 billion 
in 777 jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The order to sell 13 747-400 cargo jets is Boeing's largest-ever  
order for the freighters, said Boeing's Asia president Fred Howard. 
The package includes options for four more cargo planes and two 
747-400 passenger models worth $1 billion more. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a year of nose-diving orders, Boeing is still smarting  
from its loss to rival Airbus Industrie in a bid to sell China 
Airlines a dozen Boeing 777 jets for $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus, the European airplane maker, will sign contracts with  
China Airlines for seven A340 jetliners worth about $2 billion, 
with an option to buy four A330s and another A340. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard said Seattle-based Boeing was disappointed at losing the  
passenger jet deal. The loss triggered accusations in Boeing's home 
state that Taiwan was snubbing Boeing to retaliate against U.S. 
government policies seen as unfavorable to the island. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course we would have liked to have gotten the other  
portion, but we respect their decision and will continue to work 
with our good friends and partners,'' Howard said.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Ricans Applaud Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rico's governor applauded  
President Clinton's offer Wednesday to grant clemency to 16 members 
of an independence group involved in bomb attacks. But their fellow 
activists were angered by conditions imposed by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe (Clinton) did this in the most prudent and just  
manner possible,'' pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello said after the 
White House stunned this U.S. territory with the clemency 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossello has long opposed clemency for the prisoners -- seen by  
many here as political prisoners -- as long as they refused to 
renounce violence or profess remorse for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
	A Clinton administration official said the members of the Armed  
Forces of National Liberation, known as FALN for its initials in 
Spanish, would be freed from prison or have fines lifted if they 
agreed to renounce violence, refrain from meeting with other 
independence leaders and obey stringent guidelines barring them 
from using weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of supporters gathered on the steps of San Juan's  
Catholic Cathedral Wednesday evening, preparing to celebrate news 
of pardons. The mood was dampened, however, when an activist read 
out Clinton's conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an injustice,'' said Clarissa Lopez, daughter of Oscar  
Lopez, who was one of two prisoners who under the clemency would 
still have to serve some time. Three others in the group would have 
their fines lifted while 11 would be immediately freed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lolita Lebron -- an independence activist who participated in a  
1954 shooting attack on the U.S. House of Representatives -- said 
she was ``offended'' by the demand that Puerto Ricans give up armed 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are shameful demands,'' said Lebron, who in 1979 was  
granted clemency for the shooting attack by President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has insulted the dignity of the Puerto Rican  
nation and those who fight for its liberty,'' Lebron said. 
</P>
<P>
	The short-lived release of Antonio Camacho Negron, a member of  
the Macheteros guerrilla group, in February 1998, showed why some 
prisoners may reject the terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho Negron was paroled after serving 10 years for the 1983  
robbery of a Wells Fargo armored truck in West Hartford, Conn., to 
fund guerrilla attacks. But after missing interviews with his 
parole officer and meeting with other independence activists in 
violation of his parole rules, Camacho Negron was returned to 
prison by federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Anibal Acevedo Vila, a leader of Puerto Rico's pro-commonwealth  
party, said he was ``surprised'' by the conditions attached to the 
clemency offer, but called offer ``a step forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the commonwealth status quo, the 3.8 million islanders are  
U.S. citizens. They serve in the military and receive billions from 
Washington -- but pay no federal taxes, cannot vote for president 
and have only a non-voting delegate in Congress.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the second straight year, Jim Druckenmiller is the San  
Francisco 49ers' No. 2 quarterback in camp. Once again he's 
fighting to hold onto the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller is in competition with Jeff Garcia and Steve  
Stenstrom for the opportunity to back up Steve Young. All three 
will see action Thursday night, when the 49ers play host to the San 
Diego Chargers (0-1) in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller, a former first-round pick who is starting his  
third season in San Francisco, will follow Young. Garcia, signed as 
a free agent after starring in the CFL, and Stenstrom, a former 
Stanford star who played last season for the Chicago Bears, will 
finish up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have a healthy competition,'' coach Steve Mariucci  
said. ``All three are capable of being the backup. We're going to 
have to give them all a fair shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said he and his staff will closely monitor the  
performance of all three but in particular Druckenmiller because he 
will be the first one off the bench and will spend at least some 
time with the front-line units. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for him to show us that he knows the system and  
that he's made strides from last year,'' Mariucci said. ``That he's 
a capable guy and can move the club. It's going to be a heck of a 
test because the San Diego Chargers have the best the defense in 
the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller lost a training camp battle for the No. 2 job to  
Ty Detmer last year. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Falcons    	
</P>
<P>
	All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson, who missed the first two  
weeks of training camp because of a contract dispute, finally 
agreed to a new deal with the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson and his agent, Jim Sims, reached the agreement after a  
meeting at a Greenville hotel with Falcons coach Dan Reeves and 
general manager Harold Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract were not immediately available. The sides  
had basically agreed on a five-year contract worth $28 million to 
$30 million but stumbled over the signing bonus, guaranteed money 
and the structure of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who set a franchise record with 1,846 yards rushing  
and an NFL mark with 410 carries as the Falcons advanced to the 
Super Bowl last season, was expected to join the team for practice 
Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons play their first exhibition game Friday night  
against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Colts    	
</P>
<P>
	The Indianapolis Colts signed veteran quarterback Steve Walsh  
and released quarterback Stoney Case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts are the sixth NFL team for Walsh, who was drafted by  
Dallas in the 1989 supplemental draft, traded to New Orleans in 
1990 and later played for Chicago, St. Louis and Tampa Bay. The 
6-foot-3, 215-pounder signed a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked real good in the workout yesterday, better than I  
anticipated,'' coach Jim Mora said of Walsh, who had his first 
training camp practice Wednesday. ``I'm familiar with Steve. ... 
He's won, he's taken teams to the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Case had played four seasons in Arizona and appeared of four  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh has played in only 65 games during his NFL career with 38  
starts. He completed 9-of-19 passes in five games for Tampa Bay 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Bills    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie fullback Shawn Bryson is gone for the season with a torn  
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryson was hurt Tuesday afternoon when he cut and went down  
without being hit. Teammates said they heard a popping sound when 
Bryson went down. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Wade Phillips said Wednesday that Bryson, a third-round  
pick from Tennessee, will undergo surgery on the knee and will be 
placed on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough situation. That's why it is such a tough game,''  
Phillips said. ``Some people begrudge them and they talk about the 
money these guys make, but they can get hurt at any time, 
certainly, and it effects your job.''

<HEADLINE> Lycos Nixes 'Jews for Jesus' Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Lycos Inc., the popular Web destination,  
said it will not renew an advertisement from Jews for Jesus because 
of complaints from some in the Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos Inc. said it received complaints about the ad from several  
Jewish people who took offense when the ad popped up on their 
screens as they searched for Web sites containing the word 
``Jewish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jews for Jesus paid $1,700 for the ad, which started running  
July 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad, which promotes a book on the group's religious  
philosophy, read: ``The end of the world is no time to finally 
realize Jesus is the Messiah. (It's all in the book.) Click here 
for a free copy!'' 
</P>
<P>
	When users clicked, a Web page for Jews for Jesus appeared.  
</P>
<P>
	The page originally also referenced Lycos, but was changed after  
complaints were received and at Lycos' prompting. Jeffrey Snider, 
Lycos' general counsel, said the company did not want to give users 
the impression it endorsed Jews for Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	Started in the 1970s, Jews for Jesus practices Judaism, yet  
regards Jesus as the Messiah. It has 70,000 followers nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Snider told The Boston Globe that the ad's contract, which  
expires in several days, was not renewed because ``controversial 
advertising is bad for business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added the company does not want Jews to boycott Lycos.  
</P>
<P>
	The ad was opposed by the Anti-Defamation League's Boston  
office. Diane Kolb, associate director, said she believes the 
message is misleading and blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jews can't be for Jesus,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lycos officials did not say how many complaints they had  
received. 
</P>
<P>
	Jews for Jesus officials said they were disappointed their  
message was restricted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Web is supposed to be a marketplace for all kinds of  
ideas, and people can click on them or pass them by,'' said Susan 
Perlman, spokeswoman for Jews for Jesus.

	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Intidab beat Artax by 1 1/2 lengths  
Wednesday in winning the $150,000 A Phenomenon Handicap for older 
horses at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	With Robbie Davis in the saddle, Intidab went six furlongs in  
1:09 in besting a field of seven horses aged 3 and up. 
</P>

	Artax was 2 3/4 lengths ahead of the favorite, Yes It's True. Good  
and Tough was fourth, followed by Run Johnny, Mint and Kashatreya. 
</P>
<P>
	Intibad, a 6-year-old, earned $90,000 for Shadwell Stable with  
his second victory in six starts since being shipped to the United 
States from the United Arab Emirates where he competed previously. 
</P>
<P>
	Intidab returned $22.80, $14.40 and $4.50. Artax paid $10.20 and

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose Wednesday morning as gains on  
Wall Street buoyed sentiment in Tokyo. The dollar rose further 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 130.27  
points, or 0.76 percent, to 17,341.43 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Wednesday, the average closed up 9.07 points, or 0.05 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.64 yen in late-morning trading, up 0.94  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York 
level of 115.35 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices opened higher as investor sentiment  
was bolstered by rises in New York and Chicago, where futures 
prices advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shares have been boosted by the overnight rise in New York and  
the yen's relative stability around the mid-115 yen level,'' said 
Hidenori Karaki, general manager at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 132.65 points  
to 10,787.80 at Wednesday's close. The technology-laden Nasdaq 
Composite Index climbed 74.87 to 2,564.98. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 12.54 points, or 0.88 percent, to 1,433.18. 
The TOPIX closed down 3.61 points, or 0.25 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, Japanese institutional investors covered  
short, or oversold, dollar-positions ahead of a long weekend for 
Japan's ``Obon'' holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little impact on the market from a Finance Ministry  
announcement that Japan's current account surplus expanded in June 
to 1.427 trillion yen ($12.4 billion), up 0.7 percent on year, 
traders said. June's rise came after four straight months of 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry also said that the surplus contracted in the first  
half of 1999, the first decline over a six-month period since 1996. 
For the January-June period the surplus was 6.3 trillion yen ($54.8 
billion), down 14.9 percent from a year-earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.22 yen, up from  
122.99 late Wednesday in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Underwood Won't Play With Vikings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood's short and strange  
stay with the Minnesota Vikings is over. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-round draft pick who went AWOL after his first pro  
practice on Aug. 2 flew to Minneapolis on Tuesday night to meet 
with coach Dennis Green. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings issued a short statement this morning that read:  
``Dimitrius told Coach Green that he has no desire to play football 
and has decided not to play for the Vikings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team added: ``There will be no further discussion by the  
Vikings until certain other issues are resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those are most likely the financial implications of the team and  
Underwood parting ways. He could be waived, suspended or placed on 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's agent, Chris Domann, didn't immediately return a  
phone call to his office this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old rookie had decided after a phone conversation  
with former Green Bay Packer and minister Reggie White on Monday 
that he wanted to try to balance faith and football and that he 
hoped Green would have him back. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood flew to Minneapolis on Tuesday and was met by Vikings  
scout Jeff Robinson and team chaplain Keith Johnson. Underwood and 
Domann met with Green and others in a conference that lasted past 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Green insisted Underwood's strange case and its  
salary cap ramifications won't alter the organization's risk-taking 
philosophy, a principle that reaped huge rewards in wide receiver 
Randy Moss last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't second-guess yourself,'' Green said. ``We have  
always been involved in second chances. That's part of our way we 
do business. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we're not going to change how we do business and how we  
look at things because of one time. We believe in what we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, the 29th pick in the NFL draft out of Michigan State,  
where he missed his senior season with an ankle injury, left the 
Vikings without explanation one day after signing a five-year, $5.3 
million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	He hitched an 80-mile ride to the Minneapolis-St. Paul  
International Airport and apologetically told his agent the next 
day that he'd had to tend to a family crisis and was on his way 
back to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	But he didn't return and didn't call anybody.  
</P>
<P>
	A reporter from the Star Tribune of Minneapolis finally tracked  
him down over the weekend in a Philadelphia hotel lobby, where 
Underwood said he'd been torn between his faith in God and a career 
in professional football. 
</P>
<P>
	After speaking at length with White, the NFL's career sacks  
leader who retired from the Packers this winter, Underwood said 
he'd decided to return to the Vikings and ask for Green's 
forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, White told The Associated Press that, while he  
preferred to keep his conversation with Underwood private, he felt 
the troubled rookie needed to get in touch with Green ``and explain 
what he was going through because one thing he's done is left Denny 
hanging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Vikings began exploring ways to part company with  
Underwood. 
</P>
<P>
	If he is waived and claimed by another team, his new team would  
be responsible for his $475,000 base salary for 1999. But the 
Vikings would take the salary cap hit for Underwood's entire 
$1,725,000 partially deferred signing bonus this season, rather 
than a prorated one-fifth slice of it. 
</P>
<P>
	If Underwood weren't picked up by another team, the Vikings' cap  
number this year would be only $345,000, the 20 percent cut of his 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The team could keep Underwood on the active roster and fine him  
up to $5,000 for each day he was absent from camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood got about $543,000 of his bonus wired to his bank in  
Milwaukee, but the team had all but about $27,000 of it frozen upon 
his disappearance.

	Tornado Hits Salt Lake City  
</P>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Without warning, a tornado hit the  
downtown area today, damaging buildings and injuring dozens of 
people. The downtown area looked like a disaster zone with trucks 
overturned, power lines down, windows blown out, shards of glass 
everywhere. Police and firefighters attended to dozens of injured. 
Helicopters were landing to ferry injured to hospitals. The black 
funnel uprooted trees and temporary buildings set up for a 
retailers convention. It damaged the roof of the Delta Center, home 
of the Utah Jazz, and a nearby hotel where windows were blown out.

	Shooting Suspect Gives Up  
</P>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The white supremacist accused of wounding five  
people at a Jewish community center in suburban Los Angeles 
surrendered today, telling authorities he wanted his act to be ``a 
wake-up call to America to kill Jews.'' Authorities said Buford 
O'Neal Furrow, 37, also would be charged in the slaying of a postal 
worker not far from the Jewish center. The man who identified 
himself as Furrow, who had walked into an FBI office to give 
himself up, told authorities he took two cabs for the 275-mile trip 
from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.

today's total eclipse had its longest run: 2 minutes and 23 
seconds. Over Turkey, Iran and Iraq, the highly predictable yet 
overwhelming celestial event was unblemished. Everywhere in its 
swath, from the North Atlantic to Europe and Asia, the eclipse 
turned day to night, plunging temperatures within seconds. Millions

Pakistan today to reinstitute a 1991 agreement aimed at avoiding 
clashes between military aircraft of the two countries. The 
agreement forbids aircraft from flying within 10 kilometers of each 
other's border without advance notification. The appeal came after 
the second aerial clash in two days between the South Asian rivals.

	Fed Finds Strong U.S. Economy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy is still growing strongly  
with labor shortages reported nationwide, the Federal Reserve said 
today in a new report that highlighted concerns that the economy 
may be growing too rapidly. That could lead to the Fed raising 
interest rates for the second time this year. The Fed's survey of 
economic conditions around the country found only scattered signs 
of mounting wage pressures and little evidence of rising inflation 
in general. But the Fed survey did note developments that could 
lead to increased inflationary pressures.

<HEADLINE> Economic Boom Sparks Brick Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUTHERVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Water isn't the only thing that's scarce  
these days. Try finding a truckload of bricks. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong economy and a push toward high-end building materials  
has factories throughout the region working around the clock to 
supply contractors and landscapers with bricks. The problem is 
severe: Orders placed last year have yet to be filled, and bricks 
that are still raw material in the ground are already spoken for. 
</P>
<P>
	Factories in Pennsylvania and Ohio are rushing to alleviate the  
brick drought, which extends as far as Texas, Florida and the 
Carolinas, according to the National Association of Home Builders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bricks are worse than water right now,'' said Glenn Kubany,  
sales manager at of Potomac Valley Brick and Supply Co. in 
Rockville. ``For all intents and purposes, this country is out of 
brick until next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the building boom is causing other shortages, too.  
Eighty-six percent of the builders who responded to the June survey 
by the homebuilders' association say they have had difficulty 
getting drywall and Sheetrock. Twenty-two percent said getting 
brick is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, at least in part, was caused by the masonry  
industry itself, say manufacturers and suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Brick was falling out of favor with builders and homebuyers, who  
opted for less expensive materials such as siding and faux stucco. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry fought back with an aggressive marketing campaign  
to make the residential segment of its business more like its 
highly successful commercial side. Radio and TV spots touted brick 
as the upscale, low-maintenance, energy-efficient siding of choice. 
The economy improved and homebuyers opted to spend the extra money 
for brick. 
</P>
<P>
	Now buyers of new homes aren't asking for a brick-front house --  
they want the whole thing wrapped in brick. That requires about 
40,000 bricks, or an entire rail car load. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good problem to have, but by the time this is all over,  
we're probably going to lose people who had to switch materials,'' 
said George Litz, owner of L&AMP;L Supply Corp. in Lutherville. 
</P>
<P>
	Litz, who supplied brick for Oriole Park at Camden Yards and the  
Baltimore Ravens' PSINet Stadium, said the drought is the worst he 
has seen in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stock 5 million bricks, and pretty much all of it is  
sold,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Glen-Gery Corp. in Reading, Pa., 10 brick plants are turning  
out 3 million bricks a day, but it's not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The same is true at Belden Brick Co., based in Canton, Ohio.  
Belden has nine plants, including Redland Brick Inc., in 
Williamsport, Md. The Redland plant, formerly known as Cushwa 
Brick, is closed, its workers on strike since early last month. 
``That's throwing everybody in a tizzy,'' said Betty Woerner of 
Maisel Brothers Inc., a Glen Burnie materials provider. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, officials at the Williamsport plant began hiring  
replacements for the striking workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our backlog is three times higher than our inventory,'' said  
President Robert Belden. ``This is a bubble that's reaching the 
bursting point, and I don't see any relief.''

<HEADLINE> Selig Can Say No to 'Andro' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A friend came up with a novel idea to get America's reluctant  
Ryder Cup heroes off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
	Just win, babies.  
</P>
<P>
	It's that simple. David Duval, Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara  
could get the ball rolling by helping the U.S. team crush Europe in 
late September, then do it again in the 2001 and 2003 matches. That 
modest win streak should be enough to convince their countrymen to 
turn their patriotic fervor toward some other pricey little piece 
of hardware we don't currently own, like the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, it would involve sacrifice. It might mean hiring  
somebody else to wind the Rolex watches and order off the menu to 
free up more practice time. A few guys might even have to give up 
Nintendo. But judging by the heat they brought on themselves 
recently with mumbled threats of a boycott, five years of honest 
laboring (in silence) might not be such a bad tradeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Jim Awtrey, chief executive of the PGA of America,  
emerged from an hour-long meeting between the top U.S. players and 
Ryder Cup officials and said, ``The players right now are focused 
on the Ryder Cup, winning the Ryder Cup, and there is no issue 
between the PGA of America and players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that statement flew in the face of remarks Duval has been  
making for weeks, and something Woods said only a few hours 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to see us receive whatever the amount is -- 200,  
300, 400, 500,000 dollars, whatever it is -- and I think we should 
be able to keep the money and do whatever we see fit,'' Woods said. 
``Personally, I would donate all of it to charity. But I think it's 
up to the other person's discretion what they would do with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is some irony in all this grumbling. For years now, the  
Ryder Cup has been passing itself off as a high-minded competition 
pitting our millionaires against theirs. But what Tiger and the 
rest of play-for-pay crowd should know is that in its humble 
origins nearly 80 years ago, it was just another bald-faced scheme 
to get Americans more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	At the turn of the century, as country clubs sprang up across  
the United States, status-conscious members insisted on hiring pros 
from the old country. Their thinking was no doubt influenced by a 
desire for authenticity; golf, after all, was born over there. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that those hiring patterns continued over here  
long after it was clear the little white ball was going its own 
way, whether the golfer cursing after it used the Queen's English 
or not. And that rubbed officials at the nascent PGA of America the 
wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1921, a competition of us-vs.-them was begun to change the  
perception our homegrown pros were second-rate. So uneasy were most 
Americans about their chances that one of the competition's biggest 
backers, railroad baron Walter Ross, refused at the last minute to 
spring for a trophy. It turns out his fears were well justified. 
The British prevailed 9-3, then thumped the Americans even more 
handily at five years later. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole thing might have died there except that Samuel Ryder,  
an English seed merchant who came to the game late and brought with 
him a convert's zeal, offered a gold trophy to the winner. Like 
Ross' impetuous withdrawal before him, it was a decision Ryder 
would regret. The Americans won the first official Cup match, 
9 1/2-2 1/2, in 1927, then won 23 of the subsequent 32 meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	But since 1979, when the original Great Britain-Ireland side was  
expanded to include players from the Continent, Europe has walked 
away with the Cup five of the last seven times, including the last 
match two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, just as their countryman say they want the Cup back  
more than ever, Duval and a few prominent members of American 
golf's inner circle are saying they want it less. Exactly how much 
less remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players are satisfied that we're going to take a look at  
all this, and then we'll see in the next few weeks at what we can 
do and how soon,'' Awtrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	No specifics were aired -- not publicly, anyway -- but you can bet  
a buyout is already in the works. The players, if they're smart, 
will go ahead and send off the checks to the charity they support, 
a nice gesture to be sure, but a nice tax write-off as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe bragging rights was too poor a prize to keep fat-cat  
golfers interested even this long. But for all those years past, it 
must have been some feeling to be able to yell, ``Our players are 
better,'' and know that someone can hear you on that other side of 
that huge water hazard known as the Atlantic.

<HEADLINE> Judge Orders FBI Mole at ADM to Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A federal judge has ordered an FBI mole who  
helped uncover price fixing at the food processor Archer Daniels 
Midland Co. to pay back $1.17 million in salary and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from his role helping the investigation, Mark Whitacre is  
serving a 9-year sentence for embezzling $9 million from ADM. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Michael McCuskey ruled on Aug. 5 that because Whitacre  
didn't faithfully perform his job with the Decatur-based company, 
ADM was entitled to the salary and benefits it paid him over a 
four-year period. The amount is part of a $6.3 million judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre and two other senior ADM executives were sentenced last  
month in what persecutors called one of the largest antitrust 
conspiracies ever brought to court. 
</P>
<P>
	They were charged with conspiring with competitors in Japan and  
Korea to fix the $600 million world market in lysine, a 
soybean-based feed additive that promotes growth in hogs and 
poultry. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996 the company pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges.  
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre was sentenced to 30 months in the price-fixing case.  
</P>
<P>
	Because Whitacre is in prison and has multimillion-dollar  
judgments against him, the new ruling will likely have little 
effect on him. But Whitacre's attorney said it could have an 
adverse effect on corporate whistleblowers in the future. ``It 
opens the door,'' Bill T. Walker told the Chicago Tribune in 
comments published Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre, the former head of ADM's bioproducts division, set the  
FBI investigation in motion by telling top executives that Japanese 
rivals were trying to sabotage the company's lysine operation. 
</P>
<P>
	But ADM called in federal investigators, who found no trace of  
sabotage. Whitacre then told the government about a global 
price-fixing conspiracy and wore a wire as an undercover informant 
at ADM.

<HEADLINE> Fed: Economy Continues To Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy is growing strongly and widespread  
inflation pressures are not evident even though every region of the 
country is complaining about shortages of qualified workers, the 
Federal Reserve says. 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest survey of business conditions, the Fed was even  
able to find some encouraging developments in the battered 
manufacturing sector, which has been hard-hit by the global 
currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports from the Fed's 12 regional banks, known as the  
``beige book'' for the color of its cover, will be used by Fed 
policy makers when they meet Aug. 24 to review interest rate 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	While financial markets took heart from the Fed's lack of alarm  
about inflation, private economists said the report did not change 
their conviction that the central bank will raise interest rates 
once again at that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message from this report is that the economy is doing very  
well with inflation tame, but it is bumping up against capacity 
constraints,'' said Mark Zandi, economist at Regional Financial 
Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``Fed officials are laying the 
groundwork for another rate hike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists noted the numerous warnings the beige book  
included about labor shortages, low inventory stockpiles for 
retailers and supply constraints. They said all of this supported 
their view that the Fed will raise interest rates by another 
quarter-point later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to hike rates, there is sufficient justification  
to do it,'' said Cynthia Latta, economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. 
``If they didn't hike rates that might alarm financial markets more 
because they would become worried that the Fed is letting down its 
guard against inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed raised its target for the federal funds rate, the  
interest that banks charge each other, for the first time in two 
years on June 30, nudging it up by a quarter point to 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations of another rate increase have increased since  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress last month 
the central bank would move ``promptly and forcefully'' at the 
first signs of price pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed report, released Wednesday, said that the economy  
continued to show strength in late July and early August as 
consumer spending and housing construction remained strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Widespread labor shortages persist in virtually every  
district, but there have been only scattered reports of 
acceleration in wages,'' the Fed survey said. ``There are some 
reports of accelerating prices -- largely related to home 
construction -- but there is no evidence of any broad-based pickup 
in consumer price inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even manufacturing exhibited signs of shaking off the effects of  
the Asian currency crisis, which has cut sharply into exports and 
opened many U.S. manufacturers to increased competition from lower 
priced imports, the Fed reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston, Cleveland, Dallas and San Francisco Fed districts  
noted strong demand for computer and telecommunications equipment 
while Cleveland and Chicago reported orders for heavy trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that ``manufacturers in the West -- Dallas and  
San Francisco -- report some pickup in exports to Asia'' but as of 
yet the export rebound was not widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed report said that housing construction was continuing at  
a vigorous pace in most districts although there were signs that a 
lack of available building materials and skilled workers was 
limiting growth in many areas. 
</P>
<P>
	While hot and dry weather was causing crop damage in the eastern  
part of the country, the Fed said that crops were generally in good 
shape in other areas.

<HEADLINE> Procter &AMP; Gamble Buying Pet Food Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. is jumping into the  
lucrative pet nutrition business by buying pet food maker Iams Co. 
for $2.05 billion in cash, P&AMP;G's biggest purchase ever. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G officials said today they intend to expand Iams' pet food  
sales in foreign markets. Iams' international sales now represent 
about 30 percent of the company's total revenues, even though 
two-thirds of the global pet nutrition market exists outside of 
North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The global pet food market is estimated at $25 billion. The  
premium segment now is 10 percent of the market but is the 
fastest-growing segment, and Iams is a leader in that category, P&AMP;G 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G will also assume $250 million in debt. The deal is subject  
to U.S. and international regulatory approvals but should be 
completed within the next several weeks, P&AMP;G said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati-based P&AMP;G makes a variety of consumer products,  
including Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, and had 1998 sales of 
$38.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The privately held Iams sells Eukanaba and Iams premium dog and  
cat foods, dry and canned varieties, in 77 countries. It had 1998 
sales of more than $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G appointed Jeff Ansell, who has been vice president for the  
baby care business in North America, as president of Iams Co. Clay 
Mathile, chairman and owner of Iams, will continue to play a key 
role in managing the business, P&AMP;G said. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G said in June that acquisitions will be part of the company's  
strategy for increasing its worldwide business. Entering the global 
pet health and nutrition business with Iams is a first step, it 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of P&AMP;G were down $1 to $92.75 in late morning trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Government Eyes Regulating Funerals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Willie and Juanita Roach's final resting place  
was purchased more than 40 years ago at a local cemetery where they 
are to be buried in the same plot. 
</P>
<P>
	But on a recent visit to the cemetery to place flowers on a  
relative's grave, the couple were surprised to learn they owed an 
extra $5,000 for their plot. What's more, they were told they had 
to buy an expensive vault if they still wanted to be buried there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have entertained cremation even though we've already got a  
marker down,'' says an exasperated Mrs. Roach of Westminster, S.C. 
Adding confusion to the matter: Willie Roach's mother personally 
knew the cemetery owner when she bought the burial site in 1956. 
The site these days is owned by a national chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roaches aren't alone in their complaints.  
</P>
<P>
	The advent of casket stores, customers' access to Internet sales  
of coffins and keen competition in the cemetery and funeral 
industries have prompted the government to consider expanding a 
15-year-old rule governing funerals. Public comments on the matter 
were due Wednesday at the Federal Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates say rampant consolidation in the industry and  
more aggressive selling tactics warrant further regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have cemeteries telling people they have to buy a marker or  
vault from them'' to be buried on the grounds, says Lisa Carlson, 
author of ``Caring for the Dead'' and executive director of the 
Funeral and Memorial Societies of America. ``That kind of 
manipulative stuff should be outlawed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cemetery owners disagree. Historically, cemeteries sell their  
goods and services before a death, says Robert Fells, general 
counsel for the International Cemetery and Funeral Association. 
Because of that, cemeteries must make all price information 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you don't have the problem, you don't need to extend the  
law,'' Fells said. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral rule currently requires funeral homes to disclose  
prices for goods and services and prohibits them from forcing 
consumers to buy bundles of services. Funeral directors also cannot 
misrepresent local cemetery requirements, such as telling people 
they must have a body embalmed. 
</P>
<P>
	But today, people can buy caskets -- even heavy monument markers  
-- online. They can shop at coffin retailers or buy vaults, 
monuments and caskets at cemeteries. The rule does not cover these 
other providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some officials also say the trend of large chains buying up  
local cemeteries and funeral homes may be shifting the old ways of 
doing business. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, they're changing procedures and conduct,''  
Chris Riggall, spokesman for Georgia's Secretary of State's Office, 
which oversees for-profit cemeteries. ``Frankly, when you have a 
company that may be 2,000 miles away, they don't have the same type 
of service priorities that the local folks may have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Increased corporate ownership of cemeteries has caused a ``sea  
change'' in the way services are marketed, says Steven Sklar, 
director of the Maryland's Office of Cemetery Oversight. 
Salespeople seek out customers, using telemarketing and other 
tactics, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't just sit there and wait for people to come in,''  
says Sklar, whose position was created two years ago and who now 
handles 900 consumer inquiries a year. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a survey by the AARP, formerly the American  
Association of Retired Persons, 43 percent of Americans over the 
age of 50 have been solicited about purchasing their funeral and 39 
percent have been solicited about buying burials before death. 
</P>
<P>
	The AARP, which favors expanding the rule, hired a polling  
company to survey 627 people age 50 and older across America in 
September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, also  
is studying the issue and is expected to report by fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Cemetery owners say there has never been a conclusive finding  
that cemeteries engage in fraudulent business practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The funeral rule was created because there were widespread  
problems with the way funeral directors were dealing with the 
public,'' said E. Glen Porter III, who operates a cemetery in New 
Berlin, Wis. ``They didn't find the same problems and abuses'' with 
cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Hemeyer, a spokesman for the Houston-based Service  
Corporation International, which operates 3,824 funeral service 
locations, 520 cemeteries and 198 crematoriums, says the cemetery 
industry is regulated enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer complaints about cemeteries usually deal with  
maintenance or interment mistakes -- matters that have nothing to do 
with the funeral rule, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	But the National Funeral Directors Association wants to see the  
rule strengthened so that it covers those who provide funeral 
services or goods, not just those who offer both. Funeral 
directors, like Beacham McDougald, who runs McDougald Funeral Homes 
in Laurinburg, N.C., argue that they need a level playing field. 
</P>
<P>
	After one family completed arrangements with McDougald's funeral  
home, a cemetery told the family it could not accept a vault on its 
grounds that had been provided by an ``out-of-town'' funeral home. 
The cemetery offered its own vault, at nearly double the cost, 
according to McDougald. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even realize they didn't have to abide by the  
rules,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Have Another Bench Clearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Five days after a brawl at Seattle, the  
New York Yankees found themselves in another bench-clearing 
incident Wednesday night against the Oakland Athletics -- but this 
time no punches were thrown. 
</P>
<P>
	Both dugouts emptied in the first inning after Oakland's Tony  
Phillips, trying to score from second on a single by Randy Velarde, 
barreled into New York catcher Jorge Posada. 
</P>
<P>
	Posada held on to tag Phillips out, and then punched the air  
with his fist. It was unclear whether Posada was celebrating the 
out or gesturing toward Phillips, who immediately began arguing 
with the catcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Although both benches emptied, most players left the field  
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	New York pitcher Jason Grimsley began serving a three-game  
suspension Wednesday for his part in inciting the brawl last week 
against the Mariners.

<HEADLINE> Browns' McCutcheon Thrills Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Most of Daylon McCutcheon's childhood  
memories of his father come courtesy of NFL films. 
</P>
<P>
	He was still learning to walk when his dad, Lawrence, was  
slashing through defenses as an All-Pro running back for the Los 
Angeles Rams in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just seen his highlights,'' said McCutcheon, a rookie  
cornerback for the Cleveland Browns. ``I was so young, I don't 
remember anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence McCutcheon, on the other hand, has already seen his son  
excel on the football field -- in person. 
</P>
<P>
	With his father watching from the stands Monday night,  
McCutcheon, a third-round draft pick for Cleveland, made two 
interceptions in his first pro game as the Browns defeated the 
Dallas Cowboys 20-17 at the Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was really special,'' McCutcheon said. ``I'm a West Coast  
guy, so I know my family isn't going to be able to come out here 
and watch a lot of the games. So he came at the last minute and I 
was really excited he was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence McCutcheon wasn't always there for his son.  
</P>
<P>
	A four-time Pro Bowler with the Rams, Denver Broncos and Buffalo  
Bills, McCutcheon and his wife separated when Daylon was a toddler. 
</P>
<P>
	Father and son had little contact over the years and only began  
to patch up their relationship when the younger McCutcheon was a 
highly recruited star running back at Bishop Amat High School in La 
Puente, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're real tight now,'' Daylon McCutcheon said Wednesday.  
``The past is the past, and that's how I looked at everything. 
We've gotten a lot closer, gotten to know each other and things are 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So was McCutcheon's first game with the Browns.  
</P>
<P>
	With the score tied 17-all and Dallas driving for a go-ahead  
score in the fourth quarter, McCutcheon perfectly timed his break 
to step in front of wideout MarTay Jenkins to pick off a pass by 
Cowboys quarterback Mike Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kept throwing underneath, and I was just like, the next  
time they throw underneath, I'm going to break,'' McCutcheon said. 
``And I got a really good break on the ball, the receiver stumbled 
and I was able to catch it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In overtime, McCutcheon benefited from a solid pass rush, a  
tipped ball and a bad decision by Quinn to get his second 
interception. It set up the game-winning field goal as the new 
Browns returned from a three-year exile to win their first game 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in the right place at the right time,'' Browns coach  
Chris Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucky or not, McCutcheon made two big plays, something he's been  
doing since he first strapped on shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great start for me,'' he said. ``That's how you want  
to start things off, with a bang and keep it rolling. But you have 
to stay consistent. If you get two picks in your first game, and 
after that you don't make any plays, then it doesn't mean 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 5-foot-8, McCutcheon's size was questioned by the rest of the  
league as April's draft approached. A third-team AP All-American at 
Southern Cal, he expected to get taken in the first round but slid 
all the way to the third, falling to the Browns with the 62nd pick 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
	McCutcheon knows if he was 5-foot-10 or taller, his stock would  
have been higher. So would his bank account. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Browns loved McCutcheon's athleticism, and were excited  
to see his name still available in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has done an excellent job for us,'' Palmer said. ``He's a  
guy we're counting on to play inside in the nickel. Everybody goes 
by height, but he's a guy who all you do is put him on the field 
and he makes plays.''

<HEADLINE> Columbia Short Circuit Slows Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The short circuit aboard space  
shuttle Columbia has been traced to a damaged wire and is holding 
up work on Endeavour. 
</P>
<P>
	Endeavour is scheduled to lift off Sept. 16 on a radar-mapping  
mission of Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, technicians discovered the source of the short  
circuit that occurred five seconds into Columbia's launch on July 
23. The half-second short knocked out the primary computers for two 
of the three main engines. Backup computers took over. 
</P>
<P>
	It turns out that an electrical wire in the cargo bay had its  
insulation stripped away in one spot by a rough screw. NASA 
suspects a worker may have inadvertently pressed on the wire during 
preparations for a previous launch, agency spokesman Joel Wells 
said Wednesday. Contact between the wire and screw caused the 
short. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has ordered additional lab analysis of Columbia's wiring to  
make sure there's nothing wrong with the wiring in Endeavour. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia's launch, the first in NASA history to be commanded by  
a woman, Eileen Collins, also was marred by a fuel leak. 
</P>
<P>
	A nail-size plug in the right main engine came loose and banged  
against the nozzle moments before liftoff; three 
hydrogen-circulating tubes were ruptured. Endeavour has newer 
engines, none of which have this plug.

<HEADLINE> Man Loses, Regains House Over $300 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARTMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- For three months, a 78-year-old piano  
teacher lived with the fact that he had lost his home of 25 years 
because he failed to make his final mortgage payment of $324.57. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward J. Brown had neglected to make the payment -- and then  
ignored several bank notices that he left unopened -- because he 
believed carrying a small mortgage would prevent him from being 
sued if anyone were injured on his property. 
</P>
<P>
	After the bank sent a final, eviction letter, the three-bedroom  
ranch that Brown lived in on Algonquin Drive in this seaside 
community about 50 miles south of Boston was sold at auction in 
April for $60,000 -- nearly $30,000 less than it had been appraised 
for. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Donna Sowa said Brown did not understand the gravity of  
an unpaid mortgage bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Sowa, who represented Brown in his effort to regain his home,  
also said it is a common fallacy among older property owners that 
keeping a mortgage can protect a homeowner from liability. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown got his house back recently after Citizens Bank said the  
eviction was an oversight. The bank's mortgage company, it said, 
should have contacted the bank sooner to let it know there was a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were responsible for the circumstances,'' said Arlene  
Fortunato, a spokeswoman for Citizens Bank. ``We followed all the 
legally correct procedures, but we routinely forgive payments of 
that amount and higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunato said the bank tried to reach Brown through phone calls  
and letters from February 1998 until the auction three months 
later. It made at least one visit to Brown's home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brown said he was never told that his ownership of the  
1,131-square-foot bungalow he built in 1973 was endangered or that 
a public auction was to be held on his own front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had come over and told me I had to pay, I would have  
done it,'' said Brown. ``I'm always around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he reasoned that, after 25 years of mortgage payments,  
how could $324.57 be such a big deal? 
</P>
<P>
	To return the home to Brown, Citizens decided to purchase it  
back from Arnold Nadeau on July 21 for a little more than he paid 
at the auction, Fortunato said. The bank also paid some back taxes 
for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Sowa said it was relief that Brown got his house back. ``It was  
a real happy ending,'' she said Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, a former professional pianist, once studied with one of  
Leonard Bernstein's teachers, Heinrich Gebhard. After retiring from 
the music world in the 1960s, he worked as a purchasing agent for a 
local electronics firm for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Never married, Brown lives on Social Security and teaches piano  
to a few students each week. He loves to read, play the piano and 
meet friends for coffee every morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he can continue to do all that, living in his own home.

<HEADLINE> Indians See Second-Quarter Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Higher ticket prices and more broadcasting,  
advertising and promotion revenue helped drive earnings and revenue 
higher in the second quarter for the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Indians Baseball Co. Inc., the general partner of  
the partnership that owns the team, said Wednesday the club earned 
$2.9 million, or 46 cents a share, on revenue of $67.7 million in 
the quarter that ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't possible to make a direct comparison of the team's  
profits to the second quarter of 1998 because the club was 
privately owned through June 8, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians went public the following day by selling $60 million  
worth of stock at an initial price of $15 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Indians said the ownership group led by Richard  
Jacobs earned $418,000 from April 1, 1998 through June 8, 1998. The 
publicly held company made $1.8 million during the rest of June. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue in the second quarter of 1998 totaled $59.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	``The improvements in the second quarter reflect our ability to  
grow revenues from local sources directly under our control,'' 
Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, who holds majority interest and control of the Indians,  
is trying to sell the team and shareholders will likely have to 
give up their stock if a deal is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians stock closed at $18.87 Wednesday on the Nasdaq stock  
exchange, up 31 cents.

<HEADLINE> Concussion Scares Dolphins' Thomas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- All-Pro linebacker Zach Thomas, recovering  
from a concussion, eased his way back into workouts Wednesday but 
remains concerned about seeing ``flashes'' when he returns to 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Dolphins' leading tackler missed a week of work while  
dealing with the concussion's effects, which left him tired and 
sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is it messes with your mind,'' said Thomas, who  
was held out of contact drills. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was hurt Aug. 1 while tackling rookie running back Cecil  
Collins near the end of Miami's first intrasquad scrimmage. He 
tried to ignore the effects, but left a workout three days later 
after complaining of dizziness. 
</P>
<P>
	Most frightening, he said, were the little bursts of light every  
time he'd hit somebody or take on a blocker. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was frustrating,'' Thomas said. ``I'd take on a block and  
I'd see it again -- a little flash. Then I'd get everything back for 
the next play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Headaches and dizziness are common effects after a concussion,  
Dolphins trainer Kevin O'Neill said. But he has no explanation for 
the flashes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They aren't something that everybody has,'' O'Neill said.  
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has been the Dolphins' leading tackler in each of his  
three NFL seasons. He became All-Pro last year, recording 160 
tackles to anchor a defense that allowed the fewest points in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas signed a five-year, $22.5 million contract in February,  
and vowed not to let the money affect his production. But the 
concussion has sapped his energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been a little lightheaded and have some aches,'' Thomas  
said. ``It takes time after a concussion. Your head, it runs 
everything. Something like this will mess with you, make you 
lackadaisical. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been tired all week and I haven't done a thing. It's all  
mental. But it's getting better. I don't want to make a big thing 
out of this. I'm not missing any games yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time Thomas has been knocked woozy. But he  
said the other occasions usually came in a game and he had a few 
days to recover. With the Dolphins still in two-a-day workouts, 
there has been little time off. 
</P>
<P>
	When sitting out practice, Thomas rode a stationary bike or  
watched from the sideline. He's getting antsy for contact again, 
but faces a dilemma about when to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like I'm part of the team when I'm standing  
around,'' he said. ``You don't want to be out too long, but you 
don't want to come back too early and be out even longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Thomas progresses quickly enough, coach Jimmy Johnson did not  
rule out playing him in Friday night's exhibition opener against 
New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll determine that Friday night, how much action we'll give  
him,'' Johnson said. ``Zach's going to be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing is sure to change once Thomas returns to action. After  
reading studies about how much a mouthpiece can help prevent 
concussions, he's committed to wearing one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't worn one since high school,'' he said. ``In college,  
I'd have it hanging from my facemask. If the ref told me to put it 
in, I'd put it in my mouth for one play.''

<HEADLINE> Holdsclaw Likely To Be in Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Chamique Holdsclaw, who has followed her brilliant college  
career with an outstanding rookie season as a pro, is likely to 
find herself playing in Sydney next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw is expected to be chosen for the U.S. national women's  
basketball team that will be announced Saturday. Those players are 
slated to become the Olympic team that will compete in the 2000 
Games in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Five players already have been chosen for the team by USA  
Basketball: Lisa Leslie, Nikki McCray, Ruthie Bolton-Holifield, 
Dawn Staley and Katie Smith. Jennifer Azzi also had been selected, 
but she withdrew in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to seven others will be named to the team, which will train  
and play a series of exhibition games over the next several months 
in preparation for the Olympics. Nell Fortner, the U.S. national 
coach and formerly the coach at Purdue, will coach the Olympic 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie, McCray, Bolton-Holifield and Staley were on the 1996  
Olympic team that won all 60 of its exhibition and Olympic games en 
route to the gold medal. All three are now playing in the WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post, quoting what it identified as a  
knowledgeable source, said in Wednesday's edition that Holdsclaw 
had been picked for the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of USA Basketball refused to comment on the Post  
report. But Holdsclaw long has been considered an Olympic team 
prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, one of the most dynamic players ever in the women's  
game, is in her first season with the WNBA's Washington Mystics 
after leading Tennessee to three NCAA championships. She was twice 
the national player of the year and was a first-team All-America 
selection three times. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Holdsclaw was the youngest member of the U.S. team  
that won the world championships and was its fourth-leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Mystics, Holdsclaw is the league's No. 5 scorer with an  
18.2 average and has a high of 24 points. She's also averaging 
eight rebounds and 2.5 assists and was voted a starter for the East 
team in the all-star game.

<HEADLINE>  Police Searching for L.A. Shooter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A manhunt spread across the West today as  
authorities searched for the balding suspect who walked into a 
Jewish community center and fired more than 70 bullets from an 
assault-style gun before slipping away and vanishing in 
metropolitan Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the motive was unknown, but there were indications  
that hate may have been the reason for the attack that wounded five 
people and stirred new unease over gun violence. Among the wounded 
were three young children, one of them critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing said by the suspect before the shooting,''  
Police Chief Bernard Parks said. ``It was indiscriminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect was identified by police as Buford Oneal Furrow, a  
37-year-old white man who was believed to have lived in California 
and Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Furrow had no known links to center staff or  
children and it was unknown whether it was targeted because the 
students were Jewish. But the Simon Wiesenthal Center said a book 
was found in the van written by the American Nazi Party. The Union 
of American Hebrew Congregations advised its synagogues and Jewish 
schools to tighten security. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington state, The Spokesman-Review of Spokane said Furrow  
had a relationship with Debbie Mathews, widow of Robert J. Mathews, 
founder of the hate group called the Order. Mathews was killed in 
1984 when his hideout caught fire during a shootout with federal 
agents on Whidbey Island in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said he lived with Ms. Mathews for a time. It  
quoted Metaline Falls town marshal Rick Reiber as saying he 
understood they had been married around 1996 and later split up. 
The newspaper said records could not be found to confirm a 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	After Robert Mathews' death, 22 Order members were convicted or  
pleaded guilty after being indicted on racketeering charges. They 
were accused of robberies that netted more than $4 million, as well 
as other crimes, including the June 1984 murder of Alan Berg, a 
Jewish talk-radio host in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived four minutes after Tuesday morning's shooting,  
gun smoke still lingering in the lobby of the suburban community 
center, Cmdr. David Kalish said. The gunman had already 
disappeared, leaving behind the wounded: three young boys attending 
day camp, a 16-year-old counselor and a 68-year-old receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow fled in a van and then stole a car, Kalish said.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators followed his trail across the city, from the shell  
casings that littered the center's lobby to the abandoned 
red-and-white van filled with ammunition, bulletproof vests, 
explosives, freeze-dried food and a booklet titled Ranger Handbook. 
The trail led to a green Toyota Corolla he was believed to have 
stolen and then left in front of a hotel a few miles from the 
community center. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers surrounded the hotel, but the search ended after four  
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were so close but still he managed to get away,'' Kalish  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have fanned out across California and Washington  
state. FBI agents visited the Olympia, Wash., home of a man 
believed to be Furrow's father Tuesday night, but refused to answer 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The abandoned van was purchased Saturday from the Tacoma (Wash.)  
Kar Korner, said the manager of the lot, who refused to be 
identified. Kalish identified Furrow as the buyer of the van, which 
had Washington plates. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was sentenced in May to eight months in jail for  
second-degree assault with a deadly weapon, KOMO-TV in Seattle 
reported Tuesday night. He never reported to the King County Jail 
as ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence was the latest shooting at workplaces and schools  
across the country, and President Clinton and others spoke out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by  
gun violence,'' Clinton said in Washington. ``It calls on all of us 
not only to give our thoughts and prayers to the victims and their 
families, but intensify our resolve to make America a safer 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most seriously injured was a 5-year-old boy, shot in the  
abdomen and leg. He underwent six hours of surgery was listed in 
critical condition today. Doctors said his prognosis for recovery 
was fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a great desire to live and we supported that effort,''  
said surgeon Clarence Sutton Jr. at Providence Holy Cross Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Two 6-year-old boys and the teen-age counselor were in stable  
condition at hospitals. The receptionist, Isabelle Shalometh, was 
released from a hospital Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The day was marked by tragedy, uncertainty and -- for parents  
whose children escaped unharmed -- elation tempered by anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen children were inside the North Valley Jewish  
Community Center when the gunman burst in and began spraying the 
lobby with bullets at 10:50 a.m., said Capt. Steve Ruda of the Los 
Angeles Fire Department. The exact make of the gun was not 
immediately released, though Ruda said he believed it was a 9 mm 
Uzi. 
</P>
<P>
	The toll could have been higher. About 250 children were at the  
center but many were outside playing when the gunman opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Four-year-old Gabrielle Fougner was inside when the firing  
began. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard booming,'' recalled the little girl dressed in blue  
shorts and a yellow T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Fougner, her 39-year-old father, found his daughter in a  
nearby park, where she and other children were taken from the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we first came, she told us a bad man came in and was  
shooting,'' he said. ``You hear about stuff in the news. Could this 
happen to me or could this happen to my children? Out here is exact 
proof, yes, it could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While SWAT teams were swarming around the community center and  
news and police helicopters buzzed overhead, about 20 small 
children were led from the building hand in hand and taken to a 
Jewish temple nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents rushed to the center and jammed against police lines  
trying to find out if their children were all right. Some parents 
wept and hugged one another, waiting while authorities made sure of 
everyone's identity. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Macales prayed and recited psalms as he rushed to check  
on his children, ages 2 and 3. ``My feeling about it is it's 
another case of someone acting out in rage,'' he said. ``I don't 
want to believe this is an act of anti-Semitism here in 1999.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Crenshaw Blows Up Over Ryder Cup Pay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Ben Crenshaw lashed out Wednesday at two  
unnamed players on his Ryder Cup team, saying ``it burns the hell 
out of me to listen to some of their viewpoints'' about being paid 
to play for their country. 
</P>
<P>
	In an emotional outburst that added fire to a controversy the  
players and the PGA had tried to diffuse a day earlier, the Ryder 
Cup captain said the players should stop worrying about whether 
they are paid for the event and concentrate on proudly representing 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are sick of issues like this in the sports world,''  
Crenshaw said. ``When you can't just show up and play for your 
country, I don't know. If that's not reward enough, then my heart 
bleeds for the game of golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw declined to name the players, but David Duval certainly  
seemed on his mind when he referred later to one player who was 
complaining ``and hasn't even played in it before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara have all said players should  
get money for the Ryder Cup. Duval and Woods both referred earlier 
to the event as an exhibition, and Crenshaw took exception that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether some players like it or not, there are some people who  
came before them that mean a hell of a lot to this game,'' Crenshaw 
said. ``It burns the hell out of me to listen to some of their 
viewpoints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw, who at times had trouble keeping his anger under  
control, indicated a meeting Tuesday with likely Ryder Cup players 
and PGA officials didn't go as well as both sides had claimed a day 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	During the meeting, a few players reportedly pressed their  
demand for either payment for representing their country or 
charitable contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm personally disappointed in a couple of people in that  
meeting,'' Crenshaw said. ``I mean that. They know who they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said Tuesday that players, who now receive a $5,000  
stipend, should get money and be allowed to either keep it or give 
it to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to see us receive whatever the amount is, whether  
it's $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, $500,000, whatever it is, and I 
think we should be able to keep the money and do whatever we see 
fit,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw said players should simply be honored to represent  
their country, as players before them have done since the Ryder Cup 
began officially in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing for your country, I can't imagine anything more than  
that,'' he said. ``It's an honor in itself. It's a duty, a duty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw, a historian of the game who played in four Ryder Cups  
himself, brought up names of such players as Arnold Palmer, Byron 
Nelson, Ben Hogan and Henry Cotton as examples of players who have 
represented their countries with pride and without payment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like Arnold Palmer said the other day: `I'm just a  
patriotic old guy,''' Crenshaw said. ``That's the side of the fence 
I'm on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PGA officials and the players in Tuesday's meeting came out  
saying things like ``everyone is on the same page'' and that talks 
would be held on possible charitable contributions in the names of 
players in the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw, though, wasn't so happy, although he said the uproar  
shouldn't affect the team in the Sept. 24-26 matches at The Country 
Club in Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody will be on the same page,'' Crenshaw said. ``But I  
just want the future players to look at the Ryder Cup how it has 
been for so many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Crenshaw said, it's the tradition and history of the  
competition that means so much and should take precedence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every fine player worth their salt has given their heart and  
soul to the Ryder Cup,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> IBM Helps Airlines With E-Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A collaboration between IBM and the airline  
industry could make ticketless air travel much more convenient for 
passengers and air carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	At some domestic airlines, up to half of all passengers now use  
electronic tickets. Ticketless travel saves the airlines money they 
would otherwise spend handling paper tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike paper tickets, airlines cannot honor each other's  
electronic tickets unless they establish costly links between their 
e-ticket systems. 
</P>
<P>
	International Business Machines Corp. and the International Air  
Transport Association announced today that they are developing a 
computer system that would link all airlines that offer ticketless 
travel beginning next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at IBM Corp. and travel experts said the system could  
help passengers who must fly more than one carrier -- for example, 
to reach smaller cities served only by commuter airlines or to link 
with foreign carriers on international trips. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to have multiple carriers on your itinerary, you  
most likely won't be able to do that with e-ticketing'' with the 
current technology, Patti Jones, an air transport executive with 
IBM said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the system also would help ticketless passengers who  
must change airlines because of flight cancelations. Currently, 
most have to get a printed ticket from their carrier to present to 
the second airline. 
</P>
<P>
	No airlines have yet signed up for the IBM system, but the air  
transport group believes it will be an easy sell, because it will 
be much cheaper for airlines than establishing individual links 
with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the economics of the solution are quite powerful.  
We're comfortable we'll get a large critical mass of carriers or we 
wouldn't be building it,'' said Louis Daigle, a marketing director 
for the air transport association. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM and air transport officials declined to discuss how much it  
would cost to develop and run the system or how much they would 
charge airlines for the service.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Grimsley Won't Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- New York Yankees pitcher Jason Grimsley  
dropped his appeal of a three-game suspension stemming from a brawl 
last week at Seattle and began serving the penalty Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimsley was suspended for throwing at and then hitting Edgar  
Martinez of the Mariners on consecutive pitches after Alex 
Rodriguez had homered. One inning later, Seattle's Frankie 
Rodriguez hit Chuck Knoblauch with a pitch, touching off a brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimsley had appealed his suspension on Tuesday, and was  
available in the bullpen as the Yankees played the Oakland 
Athletics that day. He was not used. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees activated reliever Jeff Nelson off the disabled list  
Wednesday before their game against the A's and have an off-day 
Thursday, making Grimsley expendable.

<HEADLINE> Three-Way Aluminum Merger Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Three huge metal companies announced  
today that they were to merge in a deal to create the world's 
largest aluminum company. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will see Zurich-based Alusuisse-Lonza (Algroup),  
Pechiney of France and Alcan Aluminium of Canada join together, 
passing U.S. firm Alcoa as the world leader in aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies are expected to have combined sales revenues  
of $21.6 billion per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company will provisionally be called  
Alcan-Pechiney-Algroup, or A.P.A., and will be directed from New 
York but registered in Montreal. Alcan boss Jacques Bougie will be 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement issued in Zurich said the merger would come in the  
form of a share swap arrangement, with Alcan shareholders receiving 
44 percent of shares in the new company; Pechiney, 29 percent; and 
Algroup, 27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Algroup CEO Sergio Marchionne told reporters he expected to see  
a 5 percent cut in overall staff numbers -- about 4,550 of the 
companies' combined staff of 91,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said the new company expected to achieve $600  
million in yearly savings within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Pechiney chairman Jean-Pierre Rodier said the companies had  
preliminary contact with European Union competition authorities, 
and he expected a decision during the last quarter of this year on 
whether to approve the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am highly confident that we'll go through this process in  
due time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pechiney shares rose 9.9 percent in early trading on the Paris  
Bourse after the company said it will pay its shareholders a 
dividend of $550 million, or $6.77 per share, if the deal succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Algroup shares on the Zurich Stock Exchange fell 3.5 percent on  
profit-taking following the stock's 3.7 percent rise Tuesday. There 
was also disappointment with the company's first-half 1999 results, 
which showed a 4 percent drop in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The news of the merger came the day after the three companies  
announced they were in ``advanced discussions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Algroup pulled out of a planned merger with German  
industrial concern Viag following bitter disagreements over share 
swap arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal-based Alcan is the world's second largest producer of  
aluminum. It recorded sales of $7.8 billion last year and has a 
worldwide capacity of 1.6 million tons of primary aluminum per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pechiney, based in Paris, is the world's fourth-largest producer  
but the top producer in Europe. It operates in 60 countries, has a 
capacity of 1 million tons of aluminum per year and had sales of 
$10.9 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Algroup, the smallest of the three, nearly went broke in the  
1980s after a series of disastrous forays into the United States 
but recorded sales last year $6.4 billion. Last year it produced 
150,000 tons of aluminum, but in previous years that figure has 
been as high as 800,000 tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- After this year, the Masters will be the  
only major championship with a sudden-death playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA of America announced Wednesday it will go to a  
three-hole, cumulative score playoff starting with the 2000 PGA 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new playoff system will provide a fair test,'' PGA  
president Will Mann said. ``All golfers involved in a playoff will 
have the opportunity to post the best score, eliminating the 
element of luck that can occur in a sudden-death playoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, it was the PGA Championship in which a sudden-death  
playoff first determined a winner in a major championship -- Lanny 
Wadkins in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Open uses a four-hole playoff, while the U.S. Open  
uses an 18-hole stroke play event the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect the Masters to change any time soon -- if it all.  
There is barely enough sunlight to get in 18 holes on Sunday; the 
only sudden-death playoffs have not gone past the second extra 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RYDER MUSINGS:* Ben Crenshaw isn't sharing any secrets on which  
two players he might spend his captain's picks, but he did make one 
thing clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a few players on the hot seat, so to speak,'' he  
said. ``They need to step up this week. All those fellows know 
what's at stake this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lehman is 11th in the standings, but likely secures a spot  
if he stays put. The pressure is more squarely on players like Fred 
Couples, Lee Janzen, John Huston and Bob Estes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said early on, one choice may be fairly obvious to me, and  
the other might keep me up at night,'' Crenshaw said. ``I'm looking 
for that player who can play Brookline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is European captain Mark James, and he's not about to let age  
or experience stand in the way. That could be good news for 
19-year-old Sergio Garcia, bad news for Nick Faldo. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, who won the Irish Open, finished second at Loch Lomond  
and was third in the Nelson Classic, is currently 12th with two 
tournaments left. He would become the youngest Ryder Cup player in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never exclude any player from the side on the strength  
of age,'' James said. 
</P>
<P>
	And what of Faldo?  
</P>
<P>
	He has played in more Ryder Cups (11), played more matches (43)  
and won more points (24) than anyone in history. He also hasn't won 
in two years. And Europe could have its most inexperienced teams in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, experience can be helpful,'' James said. ``But I've  
said all along, experience is probably overrated. I'm looking for 
players who will play well under pressure. Faldo certainly does 
come into category, so a Faldo playing well would be a huge asset 
to the side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, James also noted that ``he hasn't been playing very  
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PGA TO WISCONSIN?:* Every PGA Championship venue from now  
through 2010 is taken except for 2007. That could change soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Awtrey, chief of the PGA of America, said Wednesday that  
Whistling Straits in Wisconsin has been offered the PGA 
Championship in 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	``As to what that final decision by (course owner) Herb Kohler  
is going to be, I don't know at this time,'' Awtrey said. ``We have 
issued that opportunity for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time -- and only other time -- the PGA Championship was  
played in Wisconsin was 1933, when Gene Sarazen defeated Willie 
Goggin at Blue Mound Country Club in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MICKELSON STREAK:* Phil Mickelson's top priority is winning the  
PGA Championship, his last chance this year to win a first major. 
But his goals won't end after Medinah. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson has won at least one PGA Tour event every year since  
1993, the longest streak on tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of credibility to a guy who can win every year  
on tour,'' Mickelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The longest Mickelson has gone without winning during the streak  
was two years ago at Bay Hill, the third week in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The next three weeks represent his best chance to run his streak  
to seven in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	He will play the International next week, a tournament he has  
won twice and was runner-up last year. After that is the NEC 
Invitational at Firestone, another place where Mickelson has won 
and usually contends. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really one of my favorite stretches,'' Mickelson said.  
</P>
<P>
	If he doesn't win, Mickelson said he may consider adding one  
more tournament after the Ryder Cup to give himself another chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Els currently is tied with Mickelson at six straight years  
after winning in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DISTINGUISHED SERVICE:* Bill Dickey, founder of the National  
Minority Junior Golf Scholarship Association, was honored Wednesday 
with the PGA Distinguished Service Award for those who promote the 
values and ideals of the PGA of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickey launched the East-West Golf Classic in 1983 and used the  
proceeds to create his scholarship association, which has awarded 
nearly $900,000 to nearly 600 college students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Dickey has been a moving force in opening doors for young  
golfers,'' PGA president Will Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Past recipients include presidents Gerald Ford and George Bush  
and players like Gene Sarazen, Byron Nelson and Arnold Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara will be the only Ryder  
Cup players missing from a U.S. practice round at The Country Club 
the day after the NEC Invitational. Both had prior commitments. 
Both intend to play the course well in advance of the Sept. 24-26 
matches. ... David Duval threw out the first pitch at Wrigley Field 
on Monday, the third time he has done that in a major league park. 
... Phil Mickelson, one of the more outspoken critics of how the 
British Open was set up, had this to say about Carnoustie: ``I may 
schedule a trip back there to see how it really plays.'' ... David 
Pawlowski, a caddie at Medinah the past five years, received the 
Chip Beck-Evans Scholarship on Wednesday. ... For the second 
straight major since winning the U.S. Open, Payne Stewart wore a 
Ryder Cup hat during the practice rounds.

<HEADLINE> James Galway Has Busy Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Flutist James Galway is having a busy summer.  
</P>
<P>
	He toured with the Three Irish Tenors in July ``because I was  
going to be in America anyway for Mostly Mozart's `Live From 
Lincoln Center.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Performances in London and Vienna were on his schedule for  
August. 
</P>
<P>
	``In September, we'll stay at home. If it rains, we can go to  
Italy or take a plane to Ireland -- where it will also be raining,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the week before the Three Irish Tenors tour, Galway did  
something unusual: ``I had dinner with my wife in the garden every 
night, sat and talked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided I'm going to cut down. It's ridiculous at my age to  
be running around like I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galway, 59, and wife Jeanne live in Meggen, Switzerland, a  
village near Lucerne. ``I'm trying to get Meggen's spelling changed 
to the Irish way, but the Swiss are very dogmatic,'' he joked 
during a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
	His ``Tango del Fuego,'' which he calls ``a very good Latin  
American record,'' was released in February. ``James Galway: 60 
Years, 60 Flute Masterpieces,'' an eight-volume box set, is due out 
in September from RCA Victor. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's more to come.  
</P>
<P>
	``Un-Break My Heart'' will be released in October. His wife,  
also a flutist, plays on the title tune, which is a Toni Braxton 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Galway has also recorded an album conducting the London Mozart  
Players. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you get older, you're more clear about what you're doing,''  
Galway said. ``But it certainly doesn't become easier. Even doing 
the Three Irish Tenors thing, with music that's crossover, requires 
a tremendous amount of virtuosity to stand up and do it every night 
perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galway turns 60 on Dec. 8. He doesn't want a big celebration. On  
Dec. 5, he will play at a benefit in London for Flute Wise, a 
charity that provides flute lessons and buys instruments for 
children. He plans to rent a restaurant for a birthday dinner with 
``piles of old friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 8, he will dine his wife.  
</P>
<P>
	A tour of Three Flute Players has been proposed, with Galway,  
Herbie Mann and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull representing the worlds 
of classical, jazz and rock music.

	``With the right format, Three Flute Players might work,''  
Galway said. ``We'd have to make a record first and have a PBS 
special. Nobody just gets up and does a thing these days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galway has made some crossover recordings into pop music. But  
when he gives a concert, it's classical, even the encores. Except 
for ``Danny Boy,'' which he considers like a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	```Pop' is a funny word these days,'' he said. ``People think of  
Bach's `B Minor Suite' as pop because everybody knows it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galway was recently named principal guest conductor of the  
London Mozart Players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like everything I do. Everything that engages my mind is  
interesting,'' he said. ``You get to learn scores. I don't know 
anybody playing flute in an orchestra who learned a score just for 
kicks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he conducts a certain composer, ``You wonder why he's  
written that,'' he said. ``You get into reading about it. You find 
other worlds exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the books he reads send him in new directions.  
</P>
<P>
	After reading ``Hannibal'' by Thomas Harris, Galway bought and  
read three books mentioned in the novel. ``Otherwise you're just 
vegetating as a flute player, wondering `What am I going to do 
between now and the show?'''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stocks Push Dollar Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar made broad gains Wednesday following  
an upward surge in U.S. stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0657, down  
from $1.0708 late Tuesday. The dollar also was quoted at 115.35 
Japanese yen, up from 114.81. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of the broad U.S. market indexes rose sharply Wednesday,  
with the Dow Jones industrial average closing up 1.2 percent and 
the Nasdaq composite index rising 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar appears to be in a corrective mode after a brief  
selloff over the past week, said Riccardo Gomes, head of foreign 
exchange at Republic National Bank in New York. ``The dollar grew 
stronger as U.S. asset markets stabilized,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional gains against the yen and the euro were likely muted  
by ongoing political turmoil in the Far East, where China and 
Taiwan have yet to settle their differences, and news that 
Germany's economic recovery has slowed, Gomes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5029 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4957, and 1.4871 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4992. The British 
pound fell to $1.6108 from $1.6145. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8349  
German marks, up from 1.8275; 6.1538 French francs, up from 6.1275.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Campaigns Shaping Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- With his soybean machine chugging away --  
separating good proteins from the bad at 91,000 revolutions per 
minute -- Mark Reuber caught a glimpse of Lamar Alexander's 
reflection in the stainless steel centrifuge. 
</P>
<P>
	``This centrifuge is like the campaign here in Iowa,'' Reuber  
said out of earshot of the Republican presidential candidate 
touring a food research plant Wednesday that Reuber manages. ``It 
separates the heavies from the lightweights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that might be the fate of Alexander and a few other GOP  
candidates who are at risk of being cast aside in the 2000 
presidential campaign -- too light for the field of ``heavies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Low in the polls and desperate for money, Alexander laid off  
staff and focused his energies on Iowa weeks ago. He has campaigned 
almost nonstop for six years, but struggles in the shadow of 
front-runner George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle is deficit-spending his way  
through Iowa, fighting to overcome his history as the butt of 
political jokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan is running for president a third time, but has yet  
to recapture the edgy excitement that made him a threat to the GOP 
establishment in 1992 and 1996. Money is not as crucial to 
Buchanan's campaign because he is used to running them on the 
cheap. He has considered bolting to the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Former American Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole is also a  
troubled GOP candidate, but to a lesser degree. She is drawing 
fawning crowds of women to campaign stops, but the jury is still 
out on whether she can turn the fan club into a political 
organization. Her poll ratings ebbed after a quick start, and she 
is no longer the obvious alternative to Bush for moderate 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Quayle, Alexander and Dole have potential as  
candidates, but sooner or later they have to show more than 
potential,'' said GOP consultant Mike Murphy, who advised Alexander 
in the 1996 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The first test of political strength will be an informal  
pay-to-vote poll conducted by the state party here Saturday. Bush 
and millionaire rival Steve Forbes are expected to finish first and 
second, or otherwise risk damage to their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Their rivals with less money and momentum need a break to get  
off the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander has gambled his entire campaign on the results,  
setting a third- or fourth-place finish as his goal. Anything less 
would likely end his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a chance to move the debate from money and media to (the  
farm crisis), kids and standards,'' he told reporters after the 
Iowa State University tour. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted he would campaign deep into 2000, but said the  
assessment is based ``on what I expect to happen Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle addressed a crowd of 50 in nearby Boone, promising tax  
cuts, an emphasis on values and help for family farmers. A mixture 
of supporters and the simply curious, the crowd repeatedly 
applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet several residents said he didn't stand much of a chance.  
``It's too bad,'' said June Brown. ``I'd like to see him get more 
money and do better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle has lower expectations for the straw vote, and long-term  
plans to prove doubters wrong. ``It might get rocky, but my 
response to people is, we're here. Get over it. We're not going 
anywhere,'' said Quayle's campaign manager, Kyle McSlarrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan watched over feasting sows on a central Iowa farm  
Wednesday, stopping to tell reporters he would do well Saturday. He 
dismissed questions about the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole aides said she has no intention of pulling out of the race,  
not after raising more money in the second quarter than every GOP 
candidate other than Bush. They also expect her to expand a base of 
women donors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other candidates' wells are running dry,'' spokesman Ari  
Fleischer said. ``Elizabeth Dole is building new wells.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At some point, however, the centrifuge of primary politics will  
prevail and -- like separating the soybeans -- leave one candidate 
standing out from the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	And it won't be pretty.  
</P>
<P>
	``These are very high achievers so it takes a while to sink  
in,'' Republican operative Rich Galen said. ``You see it in their 
eyes, the pain of realizing they'll never make the grade.''

<HEADLINE>  Salt Lake City Tornado Injures 100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A rare tornado swept through downtown on  
Wednesday, tossing trucks and trees around and shredding tents set 
up for a convention. At least one person was killed and more than 
100 were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It couldn't have picked a worse place,'' said National Weather  
Service meteorologist David Hogan. ``The chance of it hitting a 
city right smack where it did today is pretty slim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power lines were ripped down, roofs torn off, windows blown out  
and shards of glass were everywhere. Helicopters landed in the 
streets to ferry the injured to hospitals and all major roads 
leading downtown were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The fatality was the first recorded tornado-related death in the  
history of a state that averages two tornadoes a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt flew over the mile-long path of destruction  
before declaring a state of emergency. Mayor DeeDee Corradini said 
121 homes were damaged, 34 of which were uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
	The black funnel cloud also damaged the roofs of the Delta  
Center, home of the Utah Jazz basketball team, and the Salt Palace 
Convention Center, which was hosting an outdoor retailers show. 
</P>
<P>
	The streets were littered with shredded tents set up for the  
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Stock of Toronto, a sales representative for a  
rock-climbing company, said he saw the roof of the Delta Center 
lift up when the tornado passed over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It peeled it right back, just like an orange peel,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dan Groff of San Diego, attending the convention, said he saw  
several ``critically injured people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I helped one guy who had a beam fall on him. ... It just  
crushed him,'' Groff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Ellenwood, an employee of an audio-visual company who had  
been setting up a sound system for the convention, and other 
workers raced for a place to hide when the twister came. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, 'This is it. We're going to die,''' said Daren  
Loyola, who was working with Ellenwood. ``I thought about my wife 
and my daughter. I tried to run, but the wind was so strong that I 
felt like I was going nowhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Allen Crandy, 38, of Las Vegas was killed when  
he was struck in the head with flying debris. Crandy worked for 
Renaissance Management and was an exhibitor at one of the outdoor 
retailer tents. 
</P>
<P>
	Alicia McGregor, spokeswoman for the Utah Comprehensive  
Emergency Management, said 50 people were hospitalized, 12 with 
moderate injuries and two in critical condition. Between 100 and 
150 more treated for minor injuries at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds gathered on street corners to watch the twister over the  
Mormon church's Salt Lake Temple, which was not damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	A severe thunderstorm watch was issued at 12:48 p.m.; the  
twister touched down about seven minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw what was going on,'' said David Toronto, a  
meteorologist for the National Weather Service. ``But to look at it 
and say there's a tornado and it's going to hit downtown -- we 
didn't have that information because of the rapid development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan said the tornado was classified as a low-end F2, which has  
winds of between 110 mph and 150 mph. ``We're thinking maybe closer 
to 100 mph.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we get a `Wizard of Oz' mentality that they occur in  
the middle of nowhere,'' said Tim Shy, a meteorology researcher at 
the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been enough counter examples here recently as  
Oklahoma City, Nashville and downtown Miami got hit in the last few 
years,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Agreement Close on Olympic Bands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- An agreement is close that would end  
two months of bitter arguments and allow U.S. marching bands to 
perform in the opening ceremony at the Sydney Olympics, organizers 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	All that stands in the way is money.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games and the  
American-based World Projects Corporation said they agree on a 
revised makeup of the band but differ by some $260,000 on how much 
the move will cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The SOCOG board decided in June to expel the 1,300 American and  
200 Japanese students in the 2,000-member band originally envisaged 
by ceremonies director Ric Birch. The change followed a public 
backlash over the lack of Australians in the band. 
</P>
<P>
	The American students refused a compromise offer by SOCOG to  
play at other less-important venues, pushing the matter to court. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Australians in the new band would increase by 400,  
to about 900, meaning several hundred Americans would have to be 
dropped to make way for them and musicians from another 17 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG wants the number of countries represented in the band to  
increase from three to 20, with Australians making up the largest 
number. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG president Michael Knight said Wednesday that $520,000 will  
be offered to WPC to set up a band that had fewer Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	But SOCOG said that World Projects is asking for $780,000. If  
the two sides cannot agree by Monday, the dispute will go to the 
New South Wales Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``World Projects and SOCOG agree on the composition of the band,  
we're down to an argument about money,'' Knight said. ``They've put 
their figure on the table, we've put a lower figure on the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG said the amount it was offering covered the cost to WPC of  
the extra rehearsals, instruments and recruitment for the enlarged 
band and legal costs incurred in the drawn-out negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG vice president John Coates said World Projects principal  
Bill Lutt had assured SOCOG there would be a lot of Americans who 
would decide to drop out after the troubles of the last couple of 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've reached agreement with Bill Lutt that he can make that  
cut -- it's his call and he said it's possible,'' Coates said. 
</P>
<P>
	The marching band will perform a seven-minute routine during the  
cultural component of the opening ceremony on Sept. 15, 2000, then 
play as the athletes enter the arena.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Wants 2008 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Having suffered defections and a drug scandal,  
Cuban sports officials called the Pan Am Games in Canada ``the 
worst in history'' and vowed Wednesday to restore their pride by 
aiming to host the 2008 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the Cuban Olympic Committee, Jose Ramon  
Fernandez, said in a televised discussion that Cuba soon would 
begin work on the bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
	He praised Cuba's sports culture and its record of hosting  
events, such as the 1991 Pan Am Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 2 1/2-hour conversation about the Pan Am Games at Winnipeg,  
Manitoba, sports officials denounced ``maneuvers'' they said hurt 
Cuban athletes, such as unfair judging, schedule changes, lack of 
security and harassment by athletic scouts who encouraged 
defections. 
</P>
<P>
	During the July 23-Aug. 8 events, 13 Cubans defected, including  
11 athletes, said Humberto Rodriguez, president of the Cuban Sports 
Institute. Reports during the Pan Am Games indicated that nine 
members of the Cuban delegation defected. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials condemned a Winnipeg newspaper's contest which  
challenged readers to guess the number of Cubans who would defect, 
with the winner to receive a vacation trip to the communist island. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans reiterated their support for high jumper Javier  
Sotomayor, who was stripped of his gold medal after testing 
positive for cocaine, and said the nation planned to build its own 
top-of-the-line, drug-testing facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Alberto Juantorena, vice president of the Cuban Sports  
Institute, called the Winnipeg events ``the worst games in 
history.'' The panel complained of everything from official 
delegates having to buy tickets to a lack of sufficient bathrooms 
and meager food supplies.

<P>
	Sean Penn, born on Aug. 17, 1960, is one of the stars of Woody  
Allen's new film, ``Sweet and Lowdown.'' The film, which also stars 
Uma Thurman, will be shown out of competition at this year's Venice 
Film Festival on Sept. 5. 

</P>
<P>
	Filming is scheduled to get under way this month in Longview,

NAACP Image Awards. Bassett, who was born on Aug. 16, 1958, won for 
her performance in ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Country singer Kenny Rogers says he got his street smarts  
growing up in a housing project in Houston. ``As a child, this is 
where the foundation for me and my family was laid. It was a 
wonderful experience to be in a place like this,'' said Rogers as 
he toured the newly renovated Allen Parkway Village. ``It's a very 
real part of my history.'' Rogers, who was born on Aug. 21, 1938,

<HEADLINE> Reno Urges Money To Stop Recidivism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Admitting the justice system is failing at  
stopping repeat offenders, Attorney General Janet Reno on Tuesday 
suggested creating new ``re-entry courts'' to oversee the release 
of inmates and their return to society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless we bring them back to our communities with a chance of  
success the criminal justice system is going to fail again,'' Reno 
told the American Bar Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno suggested the re-entry courts could be modeled on the  
special local drug courts that were established during her tenure 
as a Miami prosecutor -- a concept that has spread to several other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Those courts have focused on providing rehabilitative programs  
to treat defendants and giving judges the authority to establish 
criteria and incentives for avoiding prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``You say somebody else can do that,'' Reno told the ABA.  
``Ladies and gentlemen, there is something magic about a judge.... 
That black robe can make a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some people may question the cost of such programs, Reno  
pointed to the costs that repeat criminals generate to both their 
victims and to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do we afford what we have now, with people recycling  
through the system again and again and again?'' she asked. ``It 
makes no sense to send somebody to prison for an armed robbery and 
have them come out in four years ... without the problem being 
addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has long advocated greater efforts at rehabilitation to  
prevent repeat offenders. If a former inmate has no job and no high 
school diploma, she told the assembled lawyers, ``Guess what? 
They're going to be doing it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No wonder people don't have confidence in the system,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Travis, director of the Justice Department's research  
group, said the population in state prisons now totals 1.2 million, 
four times what it was in 1980. And with more prisoners being 
released, parole violations also are on the rise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the growth now in state prisons is not because of  
people committing new crimes, but parolees being returned to 
prison,'' Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Re-entry courts could better manage parolees and reduce the  
criminal behavior that would send them back behind bars, he 
suggested. Judges would see parolees much more frequently and have 
more hands-on control, using coercion and support to keep them out 
of trouble, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea draws inspiration from ``problem-solving courts'' such  
as those for family violence and drug offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much more interactive between judge and offender,''  
Travis said, adding that judges can hold people accountable in ways 
that a parole officer with a caseload of 500 people cannot. 
</P>
<P>
	``People react differently if they have to explain their  
behavior to a judge in a courtroom than they would explaining their 
behavior over the phone to a parole officer,'' Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, the Justice Department plans to ask the states for  
suggestions on how to best implement re-entry courts. Many states 
are interested in the program and Nevada will begin having judges 
oversee the release of prisoners in October, Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Justice Department official, speaking on the condition  
of anonymity, said Reno also has ``expressed strong interest'' in 
also exploring the use of re-entry courts on the federal level.

<HEADLINE> 2 More Bruins Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two more UCLA football players were suspended  
for the team's first two games of the season for allegedly 
obtaining and using disabled parking placards unlawfully, the 
school announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior running back Keith Brown and senior safety Eric Whitfield  
will sit out the Boise State game Sept. 4 at the Rose Bowl and the 
game at Ohio State on Sept. 11 for ``breaking team rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They will join nine of their teammates, seven of whom pleaded no  
contest to criminal charges in the matter last month and two who 
are to be arraigned Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Brown nor Whitfield had been charged as of Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Given the evidence developed by the UCLA Police Department  
during its investigation, we feel it is appropriate to suspend the 
two student-athletes for the first two games of the season,'' 
athletic director Peter Dalis said. ``This is consistent with the 
manner the other students with similar violations have been 
disciplined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As with the other players, the school said, Brown and Whitfield  
will be required to assist in educational programs designed to help 
raise awareness about the rights and needs of people with 
disabilities. They could also face additional university sanctions.

<HEADLINE>  Alleged L.A. Gunman Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The white supremacist wanted in the shooting of  
five people at a Los Angeles Jewish community center fled to Las 
Vegas in taxis, walked into an FBI office and confessed Wednesday, 
saying he wanted his act to be ``a wake-up call to America to kill 
Jews,'' authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., 37, also will be charged in the  
slaying of a postal worker who was shot Tuesday near the community 
center, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles police and federal agents poured into Las Vegas to  
question Furrow. He has ties to hate groups in the Northwest and 
had tried to commit himself to a psychiatric hospital last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly had the wherewithal to create a greater tragedy  
than the one we had,'' Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los  
Angeles, said Furrow's comments upon surrendering proved that the 
attack was a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``To these kinds of demented and warped minds, having a few  
hours under the sun where the whole world is paying attention to 
you is really tantalizing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow told authorities he took two cabs for the 275-mile trip  
from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, one to the California-Nevada line, 
the other the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	After surrendering, he told investigators ``he wanted this to be  
a wake-up call to America to kill Jews,'' an FBI source said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said Furrow walked unarmed into the office and said:  
``You're looking for me -- I killed the kids in Los Angeles.'' 
Furrow assumed he had killed some children, according to the 
source. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton on Wednesday said ``what we have heard about  
the suspect and his motives is deeply disturbing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only hope that this latest incident will intensify our  
resolve to make America a safer place, a place of healing across 
the lines that divide us,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles County prosecutor Craig Hum said he would file a  
warrant charging Furrow with five counts of attempted murder, which 
would allow authorities in Las Vegas to hold him for extradition. 
Authorities planned to take Furrow to Los Angeles aboard a U.S. 
Customs Blackhawk helicopter, but it was unclear when. 
</P>
<P>
	Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los  
Angeles, said it was uncertain whether federal civil rights charges 
also might be brought against Furrow. Federal civil rights statutes 
are so narrowly defined that the shooting might not be considered a 
hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrozek said federal prosecutors would also file charges against  
Furrow in the slaying of Joseph Ileto, 39, a postal worker who was 
killed about an hour after the center shootings Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ileto had just delivered mail to a home and was returning to his  
truck when he was shot several times. There was no indication of a 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Early indications are the community center gunman acted alone,  
Parks said, although investigators are looking into possible links 
to any groups or other individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacker strode into the community center's lobby and opened  
fire with a semiautomatic gun, peppering the building with 70 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman evaded police, who arrived at the center within four  
minutes of the shootings. Furrow allegedly hijacked a Toyota at 
gunpoint about 20 minutes later -- leaving behind a van full of 
ammunition, survival paraphernalia and a book linked to white 
supremacist thought -- then dumped the car at a motel and 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	He left Los Angeles on Tuesday evening, spending the night at a  
Las Vegas hotel, police Sgt. John Pasquariello said. Before the 
surrender, the hunt for Furrow had spread across the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was a member of the Aryan Nations in 1995, said Mark  
Potok, a researcher with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which 
maintains a database of white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a picture of him, Furrow, in a Nazi outfit,'' Potok  
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow lived at times in Metaline Falls, Wash., once a haven for  
the supremacist group The Order and had a relationship with Debbie 
Mathews, widow of Order founder Robert J. Mathews. Mathews was 
killed in 1984 when his hideout caught fire during a shootout with 
federal agents on Whidbey Island in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year Furrow tried to commit himself at the Fairfax  
Psychiatric Hospital in the Seattle suburbs, but got in trouble 
when he pulled a knife on a nurse. He eventually pleaded guilty to 
second-degree assault, served about five months in jail and was 
released on May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The wounded from the community center included a 5-year-old boy  
who was hit in the abdomen and leg. He was in critical condition 
Wednesday after undergoing six hours of surgery and was given a 
fair chance of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hurt were the center receptionist, 68-year-old Isabelle  
Shalometh; two 6-year-old boys and a 16-year-old counselor at the 
center's summer camp. The counselor and one of the boys were in 
good condition Wednesday, and the other boy was in fair condition; 
Mrs. Shalometh was released from the hospital Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center Wednesday, staff, parents and children slowly  
trickled back to summer programs under the gaze of armed security 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Eliad, a parent who was bringing his 4-year-old daughter  
back, said: ``Nobody's going to scare us away.''

<HEADLINE>  Spielberg Honored by Pentagon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who won five  
Academy Awards for his gritty ``Saving Private Ryan,'' collected 
the military's highest civilian honor Wednesday at a special 
Pentagon ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the gathering his goal in making the movie was to  
``remember unsparingly the sacrifices of my father's generation'' 
while trying to help his children's generation understand the 
importance of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that today's youth have a tendency to live in the  
present and work for the future but to be totally ignorant of the 
past,'' said Spielberg, who is 52. 
</P>
<P>
	His World War epic won 1999 Academy Awards for directing and  
four other categories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in the Army now,'' Spielberg joked as Defense Secretary  
William Cohen helped pin the Medal for Distinguished Public Service 
on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen called Spielberg's blockbuster, a graphic reenactment of  
the Allies' invasion of Europe on D-Day, June 6, 1944, an 
``emotional catharsis'' for all who saw it, particularly World War 
II veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	```Ryan,' I must be quick to point out, is not a recruitment  
promotional for the Pentagon,'' Cohen said. ``It speaks to us, 
however, about the importance of values, discipline, determination 
and sacrifice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Spielberg: ``I feel that in my experience as a filmmaker,  
lightning has only struck twice in a way that has filled me up with 
such pride. One of those times was 'Schindlers List' and the other 
time was 'Saving Private Ryan.''' Spielberg won an Academy Award 
for ``Schindler's List'' in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the ceremony that he was trying to pursue an ``active  
remembrance'' of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very easy, as we move into the next thousand years, to  
forget the last thousand. It's very easy to forget the last 10,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony, in a room near Cohen's office, was attended by  
Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, other 
military brass and invited guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen noted that Spielberg's father had served on B-25 bombers  
in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The award honored Spielberg for making ``a historic contribution  
to the national consciousness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other recent recipients of the award include former German  
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and former 
Sens. Bob Dole, R-Kan., and John Glenn, D-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg, a big Democratic contributor, gave $381,023 to the  
Democratic National Committee in 1995-96, $1,000 to President 
Clinton's re-election campaign in 1995 and $1,000 to Vice President 
Al Gore this year.

<HEADLINE> Web Sites' Price That Can't Be Beat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Adam Prentice, a Web entrepreneur working out of his home in  
Ottawa, Canada, has hit on the perfect price for the 1,000 products 
listed on his Internet site: Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Called Totallyfreestuff.com, his Web destination links visitors  
to give-aways on hundreds of other sites, ranging from beef jerky 
to bath soap to pantyhose. Yet despite a lack of pricetags, he says 
his business is expected to take in $70,000 in U.S. dollars this 
year, thanks to advertising sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's doing alright,'' said Prentice, 25, who quit his  
technical support job for Compaq Computer Corp. last year to focus 
full-time on his Web venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice has good company: Giving away stuff on the Internet is  
big business. Spurred by intense competition for Web surfers, the 
occasional come-on of a few years ago has exploded into an 
essential commercial strategy -- key to drawing visitors to Internet 
sites, stoking interest in for-fee products and getting online 
businesses off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great time to be a consumer,'' said Carl Steidtmann,  
chief economist at the PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP consulting firm. 
``The price of everything is coming down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind just software and e-mail services. Like winners of a  
giant shopping spree, consumers can find items in Web categories 
stretching from technology to entertainment. Though figures on 
total Internet freebies were not available, a recent search looking 
for ``free'' and ``give-away'' on AltaVista, itself a free search 
service, reveals 1,142,840 Web pages with both words. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch is that some free sites require bargain hunters to  
look at advertisements, give up personal information to marketers, 
or buy related products. 
</P>
<P>
	But the offerings are clearly alluring.  
</P>
<P>
	There are music downloads, pornography and videos. There are  
desktop themes to jazz up any computer screen, animated greeting 
cards and a missing-person people finder. There are even free 
jokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Freemania.net, one of dozens of Web sites that lists only free  
stuff, includes a product called FreeDrive, which gives on-the-go 
computer users storage space on the Internet, easier than 
transporting files in floppy disks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hungry? Troll around a Web site devoted to giveaways, and find  
herbal tea, chocolate, and even gourmet chocolate chip-oatmeal 
cookies ($1 shipping and handling not included). 
</P>
<P>
	Oh yeah, you could be using free Internet access, or even a free  
personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, businesses always have given away items to try to  
stoke demand, especially in the early stages of an industry. Like 
researchers experimenting in a laboratory, companies try different 
formulas to see which work best to make money and build markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very old model of marketing. It goes back to Gillette  
giving away razors in order to sell blades,'' Steidtmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	But while give-aways are typical of young, competitive  
industries, the nature of technology and the Internet has greatly 
escalated this tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	For one, the broad reach of the Internet has vastly eased  
people's ability to get the freebies. It used to be you had to trek 
down the bank to get a free toaster. Now you simply click your way 
to a Web site and wait for the mailman to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
	That pervasiveness is spurring businesspeople such as Prentice  
to try to get bargain-hunters to observe paid advertisements on 
sites or purchase something else during visits. Some businesses, 
like the online magazine Slate, tried charging but later changed 
their minds. After abandoning paid subscriptions in February, the 
Microsoft-owned Web site says it saw monthly visitors nearly 
quintuple to 1 million as it brought in more than $2 million in new 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Still other businesses give away software and services to lure  
visitors to buy a premium version of the freebie. 
</P>
<P>
	EFax.com, for instance, offered a free service last February  
that lets people receive faxes as e-mail attachments, so they can 
open them up on their computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
	But after signing up nearly 1 million people, the company  
recently started selling a premium version of the service, which 
lets people do the reverse -- send an e-mail attachment as a fax. 
The cost is $2.95 a month, plus 5 cents for every 30 seconds of 
faxing. EFax.com vice president of marketing Ron Brown says the 
company so far has signed up 14,000 paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The free service ``is an important part of building revenue for  
our business,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's another reason Web businesses are giving away the store.  
</P>
<P>
	In technology, unlike other industries, prices of parts  
routinely drop. Because computer chips and hard-disk drives cheapen 
every year, for instance, the cost of giving away the PC is less 
than ever, making it a cost-effective marketing tool to sell 
services, such as Internet access. That's why several makers of 
computers were able to join with providers of Internet service this 
summer to offer free PCs to people who agree to buy up to three 
years of Web access for at least $700. 
</P>
<P>
	Conversely, Dell Computer Corp. is offering a year of free  
Internet access to people who buy its $959 desktop computer (not 
including a monitor). 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on the Web, businesses are willing to trade their  
products for what they view as an even more valuable currency: 
personal information about potential customers, from buying habits 
to addresses, that lets sellers precisely pinpoint potential 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Database software running on powerful computers enables  
companies to easily match the traits of millions of consumers with 
products they may like -- and possibly sell the information to third 
parties eager for customer data. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, that's a big catch for consumers -- the willingness to  
subject oneself to advertisements. FreePC gives away computers with 
free online access to select, high-income consumers who agree to 
fill out lengthy questionnaires covering who they are, their 
incomes and shopping habits. ZapMe!, a Silicon Valley company, 
gives schools free computers and Internet access in exchange for 
the right to display a constant stream of on-screen advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	Other freebies seem more like come-ons.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, many trial promotions on the Internet, such as a  
free week's ``membership'' to a pornography site, place the onus on 
consumers to cancel the order before it turns into a for-fee 
subscription. To sign up for the offer, the user needs to enter a 
credit-card number to show he is 18 years or older. But sheer 
inertia can keep bargain-hunters from actually canceling. 
</P>
<P>
	While the ``free era'' is arguably good for savvy businesses, it  
could harm others. 
</P>
<P>
	Encyclopaedia Britannica's sales have fallen by more than 50  
percent since 1990, after Microsoft began giving away its CD-ROM 
encyclopedia, Encarta, to personal computer buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other losers include salespeople, such as investment brokers who  
have seen their commissions whither as more people join the rush to 
trade stocks online at discounted prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Enjoy the bargains while they last. As Web carrots work their  
magic -- the number of wired U.S. households will nearly double to 
67 million in 2003 from 35 million today, predicts Jupiter 
Communications -- businesses will start charging for what used to be 
free. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet of tomorrow will continue to contain free things,  
but expect more sites to start charging for the most useful 
information. For example, an everyday leisure seeker might freely 
browse for information on skin diving, but an aficionado may have 
to pay for getting specific information. Some Web sites run by 
newspapers provide today's news for free, but charge for older 
articles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the Internet is more popular, people will know the sites  
and they won't have as much of a need to give away stuff,'' says 
Prentice, the Totallyfreestuff.com owner. 
</P>
<P>
	But it may not be a great loss, he adds. ``It's not like you can  
live off the free items. They just give you a taste of the products 
you like.''

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted of Strangling Sisters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The man whose case led to a new  
Florida law expanding public access to information on convicted 
sexual predators was convicted Wednesday of murdering two young 
sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Steven Ault, 33, was found guilty of first-degree murder  
in the 1996 strangulation deaths of DeAnn Mu'min, 11, and her 
sister, Alicia Jones, 7, after raping the older girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Ault was also convicted on two counts of capital sexual battery,  
kidnapping and aggravated child abuse. He could face the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Ault confessed to the murders after police found the girls'  
bodies amid the clutter of his attic two days after they were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in the trial was whether Ault should be convicted of  
first-degree or second-degree murder. His defense attorney asked 
the jury to convict him of the lesser crime in an effort to spare 
him from the electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors will reconvene Sept. 22 to make a recommendation on  
whether Ault should be executed or sentenced to life in prison 
without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Ault was on supervised community release for a 1988 sex crime  
when he befriended the girls' mother and picked the girls up from 
school one day and promised them candy. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of Ault's case, legislators passed a bill in 1997  
tightening loopholes on public listings of registered sexual 
predators. 
</P>
<P>
	The law provided several new measures, such as a toll-free  
number to find out information on sexual offenders. Photos of 
offenders are provided on request.

	Shooting Suspect Turns Himself In  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The suspect in the shooting at a suburban  
Jewish community center has reportedly turned himself in to 
authorities in Las Vegas. Buford Oneal Furrow allegedly strode into 
the community center's lobby yesterday and opened fire with a 
semiautomatic gun resembling an Uzi, peppering the building with 
some 70 shots. Five people were injured, including three children. 
The gunman gave the slip to police who arrived a the center within 
four minutes of the shootings. He allegedly carjacked a Toyota at 
gunpoint. Police aren't discussing a motive, but Furrow reportedly 
had ties to hate groups.

	Death Upheld for N.J. Girl's Killer  
</P>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court affirmed today the  
murder conviction of Jesse Timmendequas and his death sentence for 
the 1994 rape and slaying of 7-year-old Megan Kanka. The court 
rejected arguments by defense attorneys that Timmendequas' 1997 
trial was tainted by local publicity since it was only a few miles 
from the murder scene. The murder prompted a state and national 
movement to enact ``Megan's Laws'' to keep track of convicted sex 
offenders after their release from prison and to provide community 
notifications on the whereabouts of the most dangerous ones.

	Court: UPS Avoided Taxes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A court has ruled that the United Parcel  
Service owes millions of dollars in back federal taxes that the 
package carrier avoided by creating a subsidiary located in 
Bermuda. The court said that Atlanta-based UPS is liable for taxes, 
penalties and interest for the income of Overseas Partners, a 
subsidiary created to provide ``excess value'' insurance for 
certain packages costing several times the normal market value. The 
ruling directly covers penalties and interest on $67 million in 
taxes from 1983 and 1984, a total estimated at $300 million. UPS 
said it ``believes there are grounds for appeal.''

	Airline Bomb-Screening Lapses Cited  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A published report says bomb detection machines  
installed at the nation's major airports are being underutilized by 
many airlines. The CTX 5000 machines are intended to scan the 
baggage of people identified as high security risks by a 
passenger-screening process. It can process 225 bags an hour, but a 
government audit found some airlines run as few as four bags an 
hour through the $1 million machines, the Chicago Tribune reported 
in today's editions. The FAA's wants airlines to run 2 percent to 
20 percent of all checked baggage, but nationally, the CTX 5000s 
now screen less than 1 percent.

	Russia Launches Caucasus Offensive

	ANSALTA, Russia (AP) -- Russia launched a new offensive today  
against Islamic rebels who are fighting for a Muslim-controlled 
state in the Caucasus mountains. The rebels invaded the southern 
Russian republic of Dagestan on Saturday, seizing several villages 
and clashing with Russian troops. Russia claimed it would need only 
a few days to ``eliminate the rebels.'' The Russian government says 
the rebels are members of the Wahhabi sect of Muslims. The sect 
supports independence for Russia's mostly Muslim regions in the 
Caucasus.

	Underwood Won't Play With Vikings  
</P>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood's short, strange stay  
with the Vikings ended today when he told Minnesota coach Dennis 
Green he ``has no desire to play football.'' Underwood, the team's 
first-round pick, left training camp last week because he was 
unsure whether he wanted to play in the NFL or devote his life to 
the ministry. He returned to camp after speaking with former NFL 
star Reggie White, who is now a minister, but told the team last 
night his heart wasn't into playing. The Vikings could either 
release or suspend him, but he won't get any of his $5.3 million 
contract.

<HEADLINE> Anderson, Falcons Agree to Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson, who  
missed the first two weeks of training camp because of a contract 
dispute, agreed to a new deal with the Atlanta Falcons after nearly 
four hours of talks Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson and his agent, Jim Sims, reached the agreement after a  
meeting at a Greenville hotel with Falcons coach Dan Reeves and 
general manager Harold Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's agreed on and done,'' Reeves said after Anderson arrived  
at the Furman University campus for the first time at 5:30 p.m. 
EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who set a franchise record with 1,846 yards rushing  
last season as the Falcons advanced to the Super Bowl, was expected 
to join the team for practice Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract were not immediately available. The two  
sides had basically agreed on a five-year contract worth $28 
million to $30 million but stumbled over the signing bonus, 
guaranteed money and the structure of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	A news conference was scheduled for 6:45 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
	Anderson and Sims arrived in a stretch limousine for their first  
face-to-face meeting with the Falcons since training camp began 
July 29. Reeves and Richardson pulled up to the hotel shortly 
afterwards in a green Buick. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who has final say in contract matters, sat in on the  
talks for over an hour before leaving the hotel. ``We've had a good 
meeting, but I've got to go to practice,'' the coach said. ``I'm 
late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Falcons practiced at nearby Furman, Richardson  
remained behind to continue the talks with Anderson and Sims. 
Finally, shortly after 5 p.m., a weary-looking Anderson emerged 
from the meeting room. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working toward getting things done,'' he said.  
``Hopefully, we'll have a definitive result tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson and Sims crawled back into their limo and followed  
Richardson's car to the Furman campus through rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson emerged from the vehicle at the player dormitories and  
pumped his arms in the air just as three of his offensive linemen -- 
Ephraim Salaam, Calvin Collins and Bob Whitfield -- pulled into the 
parking lot on a golf cart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, big money!'' Collins yelled.  
</P>
<P>
	Anderson embraced all three before jumping on the golf cart and  
riding away with them to his new room. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Anderson said he was confident a contract  
could be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a deal could be done today,'' he said in an interview  
with WHTA-FM in Atlanta. ``I'm trying to remain here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By this afternoon, he said, ``me and Dan will be dancing and  
smiling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, he was right. Now, the Falcons can focus their  
energies on preparing for the Sept. 12 season opener against 
Minnesota, the team they shocked in the NFC championship game to 
reach the first Super Bowl in Atlanta's 33-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts not being in training camp,'' Anderson said after  
agreeing to a new contract. ``But I have plenty of time to get 
ready before the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons play their first exhibition game Friday night  
against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, set to make $2.6 million in the final year of his  
current contract, refused to report to training camp without a new 
deal. He has accumulated at least $70,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims had raised the possibility of asking for a trade if  
Wednesday's talks didn't produce an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't get it done, I think from that point on we'll  
really have to push the trade option,'' Sims said Tuesday night. 
``He's not retiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves flatly rejected the idea of trading Anderson to another  
team, and the two sides finally worked out their differences.

<HEADLINE>  Alleged L.A. Gunman Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The white supremacist wanted in the shooting of  
five people at a Los Angeles Jewish community center fled to Las 
Vegas in taxis, walked into an FBI office and confessed Wednesday, 
saying he wanted his act to be ``a wake-up call to America to kill 
Jews,'' authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., 37, also will be charged in the  
slaying of a postal worker who was shot Tuesday near the community 
center, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles police and federal agents poured into Las Vegas to  
question Furrow. He has ties to hate groups in the Northwest and 
had tried to commit himself to a psychiatric hospital last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly had the wherewithal to create a greater tragedy  
than the one we had,'' Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los  
Angeles, said Furrow's comments upon surrendering proved that the 
attack was a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``To these kinds of demented and warped minds, having a few  
hours under the sun where the whole world is paying attention to 
you is really tantalizing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow told authorities he took two cabs for the 275-mile trip  
from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, one to the California-Nevada line, 
the other the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	After surrendering, he told investigators ``he wanted this to be  
a wake-up call to America to kill Jews,'' an FBI source said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said Furrow walked unarmed into the office and said:  
``You're looking for me -- I killed the kids in Los Angeles.'' 
Furrow assumed he had killed some children, according to the 
source. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton on Wednesday said ``what we have heard about  
the suspect and his motives is deeply disturbing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only hope that this latest incident will intensify our  
resolve to make America a safer place, a place of healing across 
the lines that divide us,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles County prosecutor Craig Hum said he would file a  
warrant charging Furrow with five counts of attempted murder, which 
would allow authorities in Las Vegas to hold him for extradition. 
Authorities planned to take Furrow to Los Angeles aboard a U.S. 
Customs Blackhawk helicopter, but it was unclear when. 
</P>
<P>
	Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los  
Angeles, said it was uncertain whether federal civil rights charges 
also might be brought against Furrow. Federal civil rights statutes 
are so narrowly defined that the shooting might not be considered a 
hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrozek said federal prosecutors would also file charges against  
Furrow in the slaying of Joseph Ileto, 39, a postal worker who was 
killed about an hour after the center shootings Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ileto had just delivered mail to a home and was returning to his  
truck when he was shot several times. There was no indication of a 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Early indications are the community center gunman acted alone,  
Parks said, although investigators are looking into possible links 
to any groups or other individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacker strode into the community center's lobby and opened  
fire with a semiautomatic gun, peppering the building with 70 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman evaded police, who arrived at the center within four  
minutes of the shootings. Furrow allegedly hijacked a Toyota at 
gunpoint about 20 minutes later -- leaving behind a van full of 
ammunition, survival paraphernalia and a book linked to white 
supremacist thought -- then dumped the car at a motel and 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	He left Los Angeles on Tuesday evening, spending the night at a  
Las Vegas hotel, police Sgt. John Pasquariello said. Before the 
surrender, the hunt for Furrow had spread across the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was a member of the Aryan Nations in 1995, said Mark  
Potok, a researcher with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which 
maintains a database of white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a picture of him, Furrow, in a Nazi outfit,'' Potok  
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow lived at times in Metaline Falls, Wash., once a haven for  
the supremacist group The Order and had a relationship with Debbie 
Mathews, widow of Order founder Robert J. Mathews. Mathews was 
killed in 1984 when his hideout caught fire during a shootout with 
federal agents on Whidbey Island in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year Furrow tried to commit himself at the Fairfax  
Psychiatric Hospital in the Seattle suburbs, but got in trouble 
when he pulled a knife on a nurse. He eventually pleaded guilty to 
second-degree assault, served about five months in jail and was 
released on May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The wounded from the community center included a 5-year-old boy  
who was hit in the abdomen and leg. He was in critical condition 
Wednesday after undergoing six hours of surgery and was given a 
fair chance of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hurt were the center receptionist, 68-year-old Isabelle  
Shalometh; two 6-year-old boys and a 16-year-old counselor at the 
center's summer camp. The counselor and one of the boys were in 
good condition Wednesday, and the other boy was in fair condition; 
Mrs. Shalometh was released from the hospital Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center Wednesday, staff, parents and children slowly  
trickled back to summer programs under the gaze of armed security 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Eliad, a parent who was bringing his 4-year-old daughter  
back, said: ``Nobody's going to scare us away.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Men Worst Behaved at Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sandbox etiquette appears to be alive and well in  
the workplace -- and the big boys are still throwing most of the 
sand, a new study concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	The study says rude behavior is on the rise in the workplace,  
and men are the ones to blame. Although men and women are targets 
of disrespect and rudeness in equal numbers, researchers say men 
instigate the incidents 70 percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to make organizations aware of this,'' said study  
co-author Christine M. Pearson, a management professor at the 
University of North Carolina business school. ``You can calculate 
the costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearson pointed to several broad societal forces as possible  
reasons for all the ill will: downsizing, the growing pressure to 
``do more with less'' and technology -- which allows workers to 
``zap people anonymously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve percent of the people who experience rude behavior quit  
their jobs to avoid the perpetrator, the researchers found. 
Fifty-two percent reported losing work time worrying and 22 percent 
deliberately decreased their work effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, ``Workplace Incivility: The Target's Eye View,'' was  
presented Tuesday at the Academy of Management's annual convention. 
The authors interviewed and surveyed 1,400 workers and generated a 
list of suggestions to improve the workplace culture. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of those interviewed, 78 percent, said incivility  
has worsened in the past 10 years. The authors also found that rude 
people are three times more likely to be in higher positions than 
their targets. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Pearson said, men are seven times more likely be rude or  
insensitive to underlings than to superiors. 
</P>
<P>
	Women are equally rude to superiors and subordinates, the study  
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Fay Taylor, 49, a marketing director in Chicago, said she is not  
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``Men are more like bulls in a china shop when they are trying  
to get a job done,'' Taylor said. ``Women tend to couch things more 
carefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she added, ``If a woman is going to be rude, she's going to  
be rude. She'll butt in at the highest levels and the lowest 
levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Dutton, a University of Michigan professor who wasn't  
involved in the study, said its most important finding was ``to 
make concrete the costs of these small acts of disrespect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For companies and managers, experts recommend a quick response  
to disrespectful acts, setting parameters for behavior, training 
and feedback. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all still kids,'' Taylor said. ``If we can get away with  
it, we will.''

Academy Awards for his gritty ``Saving Private Ryan,'' collected 
the military's highest civilian honor Wednesday at a special 
Pentagon ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the gathering his goal in making the movie was to  
``remember unsparingly the sacrifices of my father's generation'' 
while trying to help his children's generation understand the 
importance of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that today's youth have a tendency to live in the  
present and work for the future but to be totally ignorant of the 
past,'' said Spielberg, who is 52. 
</P>
<P>
	His World War epic won 1999 Academy Awards for directing and  
four other categories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in the Army now,'' Spielberg joked as Defense Secretary  
William Cohen helped pin the Medal for Distinguished Public Service 
on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen called Spielberg's blockbuster, a graphic reenactment of  
the Allies' invasion of Europe on D-Day, June 6, 1944, an 
``emotional catharsis'' for all who saw it, particularly World War 
II veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	```Ryan,' I must be quick to point out, is not a recruitment  
promotional for the Pentagon,'' Cohen said. ``It speaks to us, 
however, about the importance of values, discipline, determination 
and sacrifice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Spielberg: ``I feel that in my experience as a filmmaker,  
lightning has only struck twice in a way that has filled me up with 
such pride. One of those times was 'Schindlers List' and the other 
time was 'Saving Private Ryan.''' Spielberg won an Academy Award 
for ``Schindler's List'' in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the ceremony that he was trying to pursue an ``active  
remembrance'' of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very easy, as we move into the next thousand years, to  
forget the last thousand. It's very easy to forget the last 10,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony, in a room near Cohen's office, was attended by  
Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, other 
military brass and invited guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen noted that Spielberg's father had served on B-25 bombers  
in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The award honored Spielberg for making ``a historic contribution  
to the national consciousness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other recent recipients of the award include former German  
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and former 
Sens. Bob Dole, R-Kan., and John Glenn, D-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg, a big Democratic contributor, gave $381,023 to the  
Democratic National Committee in 1995-96, $1,000 to President 
Clinton's re-election campaign in 1995 and $1,000 to Vice President 
Al Gore this year.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Delays Retailer Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Mother Nature obliterated the largest  
convention of outdoor retailers as a freak tornado tore through the 
city, shredding a display pavilion and postponing the show's 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
	The Outdoor Retailers Summer Market was scheduled to open  
Thursday, but show director Dieter Tremp said there will be at 
least a one-day delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Tremp asked exhibitors whose booths remained intact to help  
those who suffered damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think about the gathering aspect rather than the selling  
aspect,'' he told exhibitors. ``Be prepared to offer your support 
to others tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado kicked up at about 12:45 p.m. and swirled northeast  
through the heart of the city, gouging a trail of rubble, uprooting 
trees, blowing out windows, and knocking over tractor-trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was killed and more than 100 injured.  
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday was meant to be setup day for the 2,500 booths. Some  
850 exhibitors and 17,000 visitors were expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tornado wiped out between 15 percent and 20 percent of  
the exhibits, mostly in a tent-covered pavilion designated for the 
smaller exhibitors. 
</P>
<P>
	It will likely be three days before exhibitors can get into the  
devastated pavilion, Tremp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Simmons, spokesman for show organizers, said exhibitors who  
could least afford the loss were in the pavilion hit the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bank owns it all,'' Simmons said.  
</P>
<P>
	Buyers place orders for their spring products at the show, the  
largest for the $4.5 billion outdoor retail industry, Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
	The show was expected to generate between $15 million and $18  
million for the city, said Richard E. Davis, president and CEO of 
the Salt Lake Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Conventioneers and others staying at the Wyndham Hotel were  
displaced when the tornado blew out windows and forced evacuation. 
Davis said other hotels found space to accommodate those left 
without a room. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Salt Lake City, this is unprecedented. We've never had  
anything like this,'' Davis said.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Arena Damaged by Tornado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A freak tornado that hit downtown Salt  
Lake on Wednesday left the Delta Center with holes in the roof and 
broken windows on the exterior. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19,911-seat arena, home of the NBA's Utah Jazz and the  
WNBA's Utah Starzz, was one of the first buildings damaged when the 
twister struck about 12:45 p.m. MDT. 
</P>
<P>
	No immediate damage estimate was available, nor did officials  
determine if there was major structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Friday night's WNBA game between the Starzz and the  
Phoenix Mercury was moved to the Dee Events Center on the Weber 
State campus in Ogden, 33 miles north of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be premature to say when we'll have another event at  
the Delta Center,'' said Evan Silverman, a spokesman for the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	Amateur video showed power transformers exploding as the twister  
struck the Delta Center. A witness, Robert Stock of Toronto, 
described the roof coming off ``like an orange peel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roof appeared to be damaged in long strips, mostly on the  
southwest side of the building. Large vinyl sheets hung over the 
side, flapping in the breeze about 20 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	``The roof is badly damaged,'' Silverman said. ``There are  
patchy holes in it, not one huge hole. There are spots in the 
southwest corner where you can see the sky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Center vice president Brent Allenbach said the other  
significant damage was several shattered window panels on the 
arena's north side. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of glass hanging there. Crews are taking it down  
from the most hazardous areas,'' Allenbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	The building shook when the twister hit. With rain falling into  
the arena, employees scrambled to cover the basketball floor with a 
large plastic sheet and protective plywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some Delta Center maintenance workers risked their safety to  
cover the floor before we really knew what was going on,'' 
Silverman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jumbotron scoreboard that hangs above the court was lowered  
to a few feet above the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was only a precaution,'' Allenbach said. ``I don't see it  
happening, but if it were to come down at least it wouldn't fall 
very far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the arena's lower parking lot and an adjacent employee  
parking lot, virtually every vehicle had its windows blown out. 
Many vehicles also were dented by flying debris. 
</P>
<P>
	``Including my new truck,'' Allenbach said.

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Pay for Indian Suit Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taxpayers will have to pay more than $624,000  
because the Interior Department failed to produce documents 
promptly in a lawsuit concerning the troubled Indian trust fund, a 
judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said the payment is to cover  
``all expenses and reasonable attorney fees'' incurred by Indian 
plaintiffs who were blocked for two years from getting government 
records detailing trust fund mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth said he was dismayed that taxpayers ``will be forced to  
pay for the misconduct of their government's officials and 
attorneys.'' If he could, he would have made individual attorneys 
liable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is a reasonable decision,'' said Interior  
Department spokesman Tim Ahearn. The government previously had 
offered to pay $476,700. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's action Tuesday does not address the merits of the  
class-action lawsuit brought by the Indians. The suit, which 
Lamberth could decide within weeks, asks that the court take over 
the trouble-plagued $550 million trust fund, overhaul its 
error-filled accounting system and make restitution to Indians who 
lost money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department admits it cannot accurately document the  
$550 million fund that belongs to individual Indians from land 
holdings, royalty payments and other assets dating back 
generations. Officials have testified that they are working to fix 
the accounting system. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate $2.5 million in the fund belongs to Indian tribes but  
is not part of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The award of legal fees stems from a two-year period in which  
lawyers for the Indians were blocked repeatedly from obtaining 
documents on five accounts belonging to the leading plaintiffs in 
the case. The legal fees and other expenses, covering work from 
November 1996 to January of this year, total $624,643.50 to be 
awarded to seven attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is gratifying that the judge is holding the government  
accountable,'' said Jim McCarthy, spokesman for plaintiff group. 
``The Department of Interior's tactics of delay and denial and 
cover-up against American Indians will no longer be tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department was ordered in late 1996 to turn over  
statements, checks and other documents concerning trust-fund 
accounts held by five Indians who are lead plaintiffs in the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers and officials ``almost immediately disobeyed  
(the order) and successfully covered up their disobedience through 
semantics and strained, unilateral, self-serving interpretations of 
their own duties,'' wrote Lamberth in assessing the legal fees, 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Lamberth found Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and  
then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in contempt because they 
failed to produce documents sought by the Indians in connection 
with the suit. He accused Interior officials of foot-dragging and 
making ``outright false statements'' to keep from turning over the 
records.

<HEADLINE> Killer Had Book on Serial Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- The man charged in the decapitation  
slaying of a Yosemite National park naturalist was carrying a novel 
about a serial killer when he was first questioned, according to 
court records. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel handyman Cary Stayner, who reportedly told FBI  
investigators he killed the naturalist and three female tourists, 
has pleaded innocent in the killing of naturalist Joie Ruth 
Armstrong. No charges have been filed in the case of Carole Sund, 
her daughter Juli and family friend Silvina Pelosso. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner was carrying a paperback copy of ``Black Lightning'' in  
his backpack when he was questioned on July 22, the day after 
Armstrong's body was found, according to the court records. He was 
arrested two days later, at a nudist camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 best seller by John Saul describes a series of killings  
in Seattle, with images of women being slashed with knives and 
power saws. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents also searched Stayner's vehicle and his room at the Cedar  
Lodge where he lived and worked, but their findings have not been 
made public.

<HEADLINE> Frenchman Explains British Open Loss  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Jean Van de Velde is already finished with  
what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
	``What can I say to people who tell me you should have done  
this, you should have done that? 
</P>
<P>
	Here the Frenchman paused.  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I will answer them, `Well, I haven't seen you on the tee  
of the 72nd hole three shots ahead. So if you ever get that chance, 
I'm going to give you a quarter and you give me a phone call.' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's maybe one thing I can tell them.''  
</P>
<P>
	For the better part of an hour Wednesday, the man who should  
have been the British Open champion sat down and explained why he 
wasn't. Van de Velde kept his socks and shoes on. Other than that, 
very little about him has changed since he commandeered center 
stage for one of golf's greatest dramas ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``People recognize me and a lot of them say, `Thanks a lot for  
what I saw. It was great. I had a good time in front of my TV. Next 
time it will be you.' 
</P>
<P>
	``And so,'' he said, ``it makes you feel good.''  
</P>
<P>
	Good? Plenty of emotions come to mind recalling the tragicomedy  
in which Van de Velde hacked his way up and down the 18th hole at 
Carnoustie last month. But good is nowhere within 10 places of the 
top of that list. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, the longer Van de Velde deftly handled questions, the  
more it seemed that this was the right man to have fallen into the 
wrong situation. Instead of being crushed by the triple-bogey 7 
that pushed him into a four-hole playoff eventually won by Scotsman 
Paul Lawrie, Van de Velde appears to have been buoyed by the 
experience. Strengthened, even. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't watch a replay of the last hole until Tuesday, when he  
taped a television interview. It turned out to be anything but the 
numbing show he expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty funny,'' Van de Velde said. ``I mean, my face  
was pretty funny, especially after I hit that drive. It went so far 
right I didn't even know where the ball was (until) someone told 
me. And when I looked at my face, I was still smiling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The temptation is to think that the humor is just a mask, a way  
of hiding the hurt that clings to memories as sharp as the one Van 
de Velde awakes to each morning. In that case, think again. 
</P>
<P>
	He admits he barely slept the first two nights after Carnoustie.  
But once Van de Velde settled back into the familiar rhythms of 
day-to-day life -- taking his daughter to school, sharing a bottle 
of wine with his wife, hitting golf balls on the range alongside 
fellow pros who barely knew how to approach him -- he found the 
laughter flowed easily enough once again. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, maybe it's in my temperament. I don't know. Not that  
I intend to forget things very quickly, but that's it. You don't 
live in the past. I walked out of there with my head and chin 
pretty straight. And that's all I could do. It wasn't enough that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if I ever arrive three shots ahead in a major,'' and here  
Van de Velde, a natural comic, fixed his audience, ``I guess if 
that happened about 10 times, I might make one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the chuckles died out, it began dawning on just about  
everyone in the room that he wasn't kidding. Not entirely, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, there's one thing that week taught me -- that I'm  
capable of doing it. I'm capable of competing with the best players 
in the world, and that is something that no one's going to take 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like putting your name down on the trophy. It's  
something that you have to experience and that you know afterward. 
I knew somehow I could do it and I proved it to myself. Now it's 
going to be a matter of doing it again. I'd like it to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And why not?  
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde believes he learned more about himself through that  
singular, spectacular failure than a lifetime of close calls. He 
had a chance to win the British Open by playing not to lose, by 
pretending the brutal, water-lined 18th was a par-5 instead of a 
par-4. Instead, with his caddie keeping silent and doubt gnawing at 
his elbow -- Van De Velde went at it the only way his nature would 
allow. 
</P>
<P>
	The next time he finds himself in that situation -- and Van de  
Velde is certain there will be a next time -- doubt will not be part 
of the equation. That, he also believes, will make all the 
difference in the world.

<HEADLINE> Catfish Hunter Regains Consciousness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter was conscious and  
responding to doctors' commands Wednesday, three days after the 
Hall of Fame pitcher suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease fell down 
concrete steps at home and hit his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, 53, who pitched in the majors 15 years and earned five  
World Series rings, remained in critical condition in Pitt County 
Memorial Hospital's intensive care unit, hooked to a ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Hunter, diagnosed last year with amyotrophic  
lateral sclerosis -- a gradual, irreversible deterioration of the 
muscles -- bruised his brain in the accident. He likely will require 
rehabilitation because he already was weakened by ALS. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it would be premature to even think about that,'' said Dr.  
Paul Cunningham, a trauma physician and professor of surgery at the 
East Carolina University School of University. 
</P>
<P>
	``His prognosis is still somewhat guarded. We're being hopeful  
as we can be, but we're taking things one day at a time,'' said 
Cunningham. He said no surgery was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital spokesman Doug Boyd said Hunter regained consciousness  
Wednesday after being unconscious much of the previous day. He 
began responding to commands -- ``wiggle your toes and that sort of 
thing,'' Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter's wife, Helen, and other relatives, gathered in the  
hospital ICU, declined to talk to the media. ``The family is very 
private right now,'' Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter left Hertford, N.C., to play for the Kansas City  
Athletics in 1965 and moved with the club to Oakland in 1968. He 
became the first multimillionaire baseball player when he signed 
with the Yankees in 1974. Beginning in 1971, Hunter strung together 
five straight 20-victory seasons and won the Cy Young Award in 
1974. He retired from the Yankees in 1979 after winning 224 games, 
including a perfect game in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	A diabetic who required insulin injections three times a day,  
Hunter announced last fall he had ALS, a neurological disease that 
interferes with signals the brain sends to muscles, causing the 
muscles to degenerate over time. There is no cure for the disease, 
which is commonly known by the name of the Yankees slugger who died 
from it in 1941 at age 37. 
</P>
<P>
	ALS has robbed Hunter of use of his right arm and diminished his  
upper-body strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter's minister, the Rev. Keith Vaughan of The Hertford  
Baptist Church, said that churchgoers pray for the sick at their 
regular Wednesday night prayer services. ``And he will be right at 
the top of the list tonight,'' Vaughan said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said people in Hertford, a tight-knit community in  
northeastern North Carolina, are concerned about Hunter's 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have been calling here (the church) all day long,'' he  
said. ``The main thing is people are doing exactly what Helen asked 
and are praying for Jimmy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hunter issued a statement Wednesday expressing gratitude to  
her husbands friends and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outpouring of love and support for us and for Jimmy is a  
tremendous encouragement to us,'' she said. ``Many people have 
asked what they can do. The greatest thing you can do for us at 
this time is to pray for Jimmy and all the thousands who suffer 
from ALS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter fell Sunday while climbing steps to his home after saying  
goodbye to a friend. He was taken first to an Edenton hospital, 
then transferred early Monday to the Greenville hospital, which 
serves the East Carolina medical school. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had some bad knocks before, but this is the worst,'' said  
Tommy Harrell, who lives next door to the Hunters. ``The only thing 
people can do right now is pray for him.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall on Rate Hike Fears / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Wednesday, allowing long-term  
borrowing costs to ease from a nearly two-year high set the prior 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/16  
point, or $4.38 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, settled at 6.21 percent -- down slightly 
from Tuesday's 21-month high of 6.24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
rose 1/16 to 5/32 point, and intermediate maturities were unchanged 
to 9/32 point higher, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds were bolstered by a strong auction of $12 billion in  
10-year notes by the Treasury Department, as well as by a Federal 
Reserve report saying wage pressures did not seem to be 
accelerating or causing inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Wednesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
were 4.90 percent with a discount of 4.77 percent, down 0.04 
percentage point from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields were 5.09 percent while the discount was 4.89  
percent, also down 0.04 percentage point. One-year yields were 5.18 
percent with a discount of 4.92 percent, down 0.03 percentage point 
from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged at 4.94 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 21/32 to 114 15/32. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.76 percent from 5.72 percent on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Hiker Arraigned on Murder Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- A camper rescued from Carlsbad Caverns  
National Park says he killed a companion to end his suffering after 
the two became lost in the desert and ran out of water, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Raffi Kodikian of Boston was charged with murder in the death of  
David Coughlin of Millis, Mass., Sheriff M.A. ``Chunky'' Click said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cause of death is stab wounds to the chest -- two stab  
wounds in the left side of the chest,'' said Tim Stepetic of the 
state Office of the Medical Investigator. 
</P>

	Kodikian, freed on $50,000 bond, was found by rescuers Sunday in  
a lean-to about two miles from the park visitors center, apparently 
suffering from dehydration and exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Coughlin, both 26, had arrived at the park Aug. 4 and  
obtained a two-day camping permit, Click said. 
</P>
<P>
	Park ranger Lance Mattson asked where his companion was, and  
Kodikian said he'd killed him to put him out of his misery, Click 
said. Coughlin's body was found buried in a shallow grave nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical examiners were still testing Coughlin's body to  
determine the extent of dehydration. Even those tests may not 
determine whether Coughlin was dying before he was killed, Stepetic 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin was heading west to attend the University of California  
at Santa Barbara, where he wanted to pursue a master's degree in 
environmental science. Kodikian went along for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were best friends for ages. They were very, very close,''  
said Sandy Hobson, a co-worker of Coughlin's. ``We were thrilled 
Raffi was going to go with him so he wouldn't have to drive 
alone.''

<HEADLINE> Woodstock Confirms Rap, Rock Wedding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If Woodstock '99 proved anything musically, it  
was how eagerly young fans have embraced the marriage between rap 
and hard rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Korn, Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Insane Clown Posse and Rage Against  
the Machine were the festival's breakout stars, and all combine 
clangorous guitars with the stutter-step beats of hip-hop. 
</P>
<P>
	During a down period for rock 'n' roll, these acts are selling  
discs: 1.7 million for Limp Bizkit's ``Significant Other'' in less 
than two months, 1.5 million for Kid Rock's ``Devil Without a 
Cause,'' according to Soundscan. Judging by the malevolent mood in 
the mosh pit, they've also restored a sense of danger to rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the only real surprise is how long it took for this  
hybrid to exert its muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	The raging, cathartic noise of heavy rock 'n' roll has been a  
staple of the musical diet of teen-age boys for four decades. 
Angry, hard-hitting rap has also been popular among many teen-agers 
during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``When rock first started, it was done with piano by Little  
Richard and Chuck Berry, and white kids loved it,'' said rapper and 
rocker Ice T. ``Rock came back again in the form of hip-hop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ice T shocked many music fans in the early 1990s when he started  
a parallel career with the hard rock band Body Count. It brought 
him more aggravation than sales, particularly when he was dropped 
by Time Warner because of the controversy over his song, ``Cop 
Killer.'' Body Count is still alive, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hip-hop in its truest form is rock 'n' roll,'' said Ice T.  
``What do we do say when we do hip-hop? We rock the mike, rock the 
house. Run-DMC, they were the kings of rock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Run-DMC broke down walls between rock and rap by collaborating  
with Aerosmith on a remake of ``Walk This Way.'' Red Hot Chili 
Peppers and the Beastie Boys also bridged the genres, but they were 
isolated successes rather than a movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's hot acts listened to both styles. The two members of  
Insane Clown Posse were big N.W.A. fans as teen-agers in Detroit. 
Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst listened to so much rap as a youngster 
that he was mocked by friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``They grew up with rap,'' said John Scher, Woodstock concert  
promoter. ``It was not unlike the important rock stars of the 1960s 
and 1970s, who grew up listening to rhythm 'n' blues and were 
tremendously influenced by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Limp Bizkit includes a rap-style DJ, former House of Pain member  
DJ Lethal, in its lineup. ``Significant Other'' features production 
by DJ Premier from Gangstarr, and a cameo by Method Man of the 
Wu-Tang Clan. 
</P>
<P>
	The band, from Jacksonville, Fla., became an MTV favorite  
through its voice-shredding cover of George Michael's ``Faith.'' 
Limp Bizkit also benefited from an early association with Korn, 
with whom it shares an intense, angry sound. Woodstock teetered on 
the edge of chaos when some fans took Limp Bizkit's song, ``Break 
Things,'' as a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
	Proud of its sound and contemptuous of imitators, Korn titled  
its latest album, ``Follow the Leader.'' The band's roots are in 
the fertile rock proving-ground of Orange County in California. Its 
singer, Jonathon Davis, is a star in the making. 
</P>
<P>
	Rage Against the Machine has been around longer, and isn't quite  
as visceral in its approach. Fiercely committed to leftist 
politics, Rage headlined a benefit concert earlier this year to 
raise money for Mumia Abu-Jamal, a former radio reporter on death 
row for the 1981 killing of a Philadelphia police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	While these are basically rock bands that use rap, Kid Rock and  
Insane Clown Posse are rap artists who use rock. While musically 
intense, they are also more comical: The Clowns dress in Kiss-like 
makeup and squirt soda pop on their audience during shows, and Kid 
Rock is a Howard Stern favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Insane Clown Posse doesn't even try to get on the radio. Since  
one of its new songs repeats an expletive 93 times, radio won't 
bother with them. 
</P>
<P>
	For followers of music history, these new acts follow a familiar  
pattern of white artists succeeding with a style invented in black 
communities. Ice T said he's a fan, and doesn't begrudge anyone 
success following a path he's been down before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think that black people accept the fact that in  
America, whatever you do, somebody white will do it and be 
bigger,'' he said. ``That's just part of being black.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White audiences are more likely to accept Korn and Limp Bizkit  
``because it makes them feel like they have a chance to do it, 
too,'' Ice T said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the musical integration embodied by the hot new bands  
doesn't necessarily extend to the audiences. Ice T is performing 
with Body Count on the Vans Warped package tour, with many 
like-minded rock bands, and he sees only an occasional black face 
in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodstock '99's audience, too, was almost exclusively white.  
</P>
<P>
	Ice T also performs on rap tours with overwhelmingly black  
audiences. He blames promoters who, through advertising and booking 
policies, make it much less likely that racially mixed audiences 
will come together. 
</P>
<P>
	Ice T said he wouldn't care if he was doing a show ``and a space  
ship with Martians showed up, as long as people were having fun.''

<HEADLINE> Jerry Springer Candidacy Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The idea of Jerry Springer on the Capitol's  
``senators only'' elevators may make some in Washington nervous, 
but organized labor in Ohio is rolling out a welcome mat for the 
television talkmeister. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of a Springer candidacy for the state's Senate  
nomination came up at the Ohio AFL-CIO's most recent board meeting, 
and it was a one-sided, pro-Springer discussion, according to Dan 
Martin, United Steelworkers state political director, who was a 
participant. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do we have to lose?'' said Martin. ``I'd like to see him  
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State AFL-CIO President William Burga said he doesn't know where  
Springer stands on a lot of the issues, but ``it's very possible, 
in my opinion, that he could win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he would stir this party up and get people thinking that  
they could participate, they could run, too,'' Burga said from 
Columbus, Ohio. ``I think it's good that Springer's stirring the 
pot up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of a Springer candidacy was first floated by an  
old friend in Cincinnati, Hamilton County Democratic Party Chairman 
Tim Burke. If Springer decides to run, he would face first-term 
Republican Sen. Mike DeWine, 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of a Springer candidacy was greeted with dismay by  
Democrats in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle said ``I think he is a  
joke,'' and suggested Springer would be unwelcome in the Democratic 
caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	On NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' White House Chief of Staff John  
Podesta opined that ``The one thing I could say maybe for Jerry 
Springer's run for the Senate, is maybe (his show will) get off the 
air. That probably would be good for the media environment in 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, said Wednesday that he would not  
appear on the same campaign stage with a candidate Springer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would want nothing to do with him,'' Strickland said. ``He  
hurts people. He abuses damaged, vulnerable people for his own 
purpose. I think what he does with his TV show is despicable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said his labor friends in Cincinnati remember Springer as  
a pro-labor Democrat during terms as councilman and mayor, and 
serious, though unsuccessful, candidate for governor.

<HEADLINE> States Stick to Their Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gun-control advocates have another  
tragedy to cite in their push for stricter regulations, but 
lawmakers in several states with strong traditions of gun ownership 
say they are unlikely to crack down. 
</P>
<P>
	``The safe, personal possession of firearms is a highly honored  
tradition here and so far, there is not a highly compelling need 
for gun-control laws,'' Rep. Bill Fuller, chairman of Alabama's 
House Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's third major multiple shooting within two weeks came  
Tuesday when a man walked into a Jewish community center in Los 
Angeles and fired more than 70 bullets from a semiautomatic weapon, 
wounding three children and two adults. The suspect, white 
supremacist Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., surrendered a day later. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow, 37, also will be charged in the slaying of a postal  
worker who was shot Tuesday near the community center, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't immediately clear where Furrow obtained the weapon.  
California gun buyers must pass a background check with a 10-day 
waiting period, and convicted felons like Furrow are barred from 
possessing firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton immediately urged the nation to ``intensify  
our resolve to make America a safer place,'' and White House 
spokesman Barry Toiv repeated the call Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been a number of incidents involving guns this year  
that just point to the obvious need for sensible gun legislation,'' 
Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the April school massacre in Littleton, Colo., Congress  
weighed new federal gun control measures that among other things 
would have required safety devices on handguns and background 
checks on all gun show sales. The legislation has been embroiled in 
a fierce partisan battle, fueled in part by strong lobbying by 
pro-gun groups. 
</P>
<P>
	State legislatures also get an earful from gun lobbyists.  
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana state Rep. Kyle Green said he hoped the recent  
shootings would change the minds of legislators who continued to 
oppose tighter gun control after the Colorado shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	But Green, a Democrat, is not optimistic. Louisiana recently  
passed a bill exempting gun manufacturers from lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not bet the bank on the Legislature reversing courses  
and taking actions to protect kids over the profits of gun 
manufacturers,'' Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	While a few states, including California, have imposed tighter  
controls on gun ownership, most states have done nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona state Sen. Randall Gnant said the only people he hears  
from on gun control are National Rifle Association members and 
others who want no controls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think this Legislature, given the state's Wild  
West history, is going to be inclined to take this issue on,'' said 
Gnant, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	California Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat in a state with a  
Democratic-dominated Legislature, said after the Jewish community 
center shooting that he would sign additional ``responsible'' 
gun-control measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis last month signed laws restricting gun purchases to one a  
month and tightening a ban on assault weapons by closing a loophole 
that let manufacturers get around the law by renaming their 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Wednesday that Davis will likely sign legislation  
that would restrict cheaply made guns known as Saturday night 
specials and require trigger locks and warning labels on all guns 
sold in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just signed two major gun-control bills and he's made a  
commitment to sign two others which together will clearly give 
California the most stringent gun control laws in the country, even 
more so than federal laws,'' said Garry South, Davis' top political 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Utah, state legislators have rejected Gov. Mike Leavitt's  
call for a special session to tighten the state's liberal gun laws. 
Gun ownership is considered a birthright in Utah, where any adult 
with a clean record can get a permit to carry a concealed just 
about anywhere, even to school or church. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a special law signed by Leavitt in March to declare the  
2002 Winter Olympics would be a gun-free event. Even that drew 
tough opposition from legislators, who finally relented under 
pressure from the governor and Olympic officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wisconsin, where Republicans control the Assembly and  
Democrats dominate the Senate, legislative leaders also doubted the 
Los Angeles shootings would affect that state's gun-control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will likely be some opportunists who try to exploit the  
latest tragedy to push their anti-gun agenda, but since we have 
some of the strictest laws in the nation already, I think those 
efforts will be unsuccessful,'' said Steve Baas, spokesman for 
Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Senate President Fred Risser said: ``Wisconsin is a  
state with a lot of gun lovers. Even the weakest measures to pass 
stricter gun control have failed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Republican Gov. Jeb Bush said tougher sentences for gun  
violence -- not new gun laws -- are the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that will have a longer term effect on gun violence  
than any other political idea I've heard out there,'' Bush said.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. LB Ramseur Kicked Off Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Middle linebacker Chris Ramseur was  
kicked off the Tennessee football team on Wednesday by coach 
Phillip Fulmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramseur, who was to have begun his junior season this week, left  
school last spring for what were termed personal reasons. Fulmer 
said at the time he could regain his eligibility by meeting certain 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer said Wednesday that Ramseur was dismissed for violating  
team rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very disappointed in Chris because a lot of people were  
working to help him during a time he needed support,'' Fulmer said. 
``He did not live up to personal standards set by this program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Ramseur can regain his eligibility for the purposes of  
transferring to another school if he resolves certain academic 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramseur was expected to battle for playing time at middle  
linebacker. He had 42 tackles last year as the backup to Al Wilson, 
and returned a fumble for a touchdown against Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer also announced the senior defensive back Gerald Griffin  
of Murfreesboro is not among the 105 players reporting for the 
start of practice. He said Griffin is working to regain his 
eligibility and admission to the university. If Griffin does that, 
he can report to the team when classes begin on Aug. 25.

<HEADLINE> Nostalgia Networks: When Old Is New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One recent afternoon in Manhattan, the  
boundaries fell -- both between television networks and TV-viewing 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Brady Bunch'' theme played in the background. The jalopy  
from ``The Beverly Hillbillies'' sat just outside. WKRP's Johnny 
Fever found himself in an animated discussion with Mayberry's own 
Barney Fife. ``Maude'' met ``Three's Company'' -- Edith Bunker's 
cousin chatting quietly with Jack Tripper. 
</P>
<P>
	What was this all about? Just an industry ``upfront'' -- one of  
those fetes where networks show off new fall shows for advertisers. 
But this was for Nickelodeon's Nick at Nite and TV Land, and all 
that was new was actually old -- even the stars on hand to greet 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	That old quote about the past being another country -- ``they do  
things differently there'' -- is anathema for this group of the 
nostalgia faithful. To the folks at Nick at Nite and TV Land, the 
past isn't another country. It's home. 
</P>
<P>
	But the innocent 1970s sexuality of ``Three's Company,'' the  
just-folks charm of ``The Andy Griffith Show'' and the good-natured 
grousing of ``Maude'' and ``The Jeffersons'' (all of which have 
surfaced again like video Brigadoons) have something deeper to say 
-- about the comfort that baby boomers and, now, Gen-Xers, find in 
the programming of their childhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nick at Nite programming block (``preserving our television  
heritage'') and its younger sibling, the TV Land nostalgia channel, 
are shrewdly tooled and packaged to evoke memories of living-room 
tube watching. 
</P>
<P>
	These shows have already been successful with many of these same  
viewers; surely they will be again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every single show is a hit,'' the network's president, Herb  
Scannell, is able to boast to advertisers. And TV Land general 
manager Larry Jones talks of ``the safe, familiar haven that our 
shows provide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here's the odd thing, though: In an ironic, cynical age, this  
stuff isn't presented as irony or cynicism. Sure, there's a 
wink-nudge aspect to it, but it's sincere. 
</P>
<P>
	The network's execs clearly love the stuff (they had the time of  
their lives vamping around with WKRP's Loni Anderson and Howard 
Hesseman) and they know we love it, too. If some of it is dated and 
a bit like a 35-year-old heading straight for the baby-food aisle, 
so what? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my childhood,'' said Alya Grinshpun of Ogilvy and Mather,  
one of many guests at the recent upfront who were under 35. Her 
colleague, Adrienne DeSanto, agreed: ``It's something you can rely 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advertisers are in tune with such sentiment: StarKist is  
resurrecting Charlie the Tuna after a decade's absence; Charmin's 
Mr. Whipple has returned for a few more squeezes; and the Jolly 
Green Giant is on his way back to the air. 
</P>
<P>
	At Nick at Nite and TV Land, they offer Andy Griffith and  
``Three's Company'' marathons. They air old commercials and call 
'em ``Retromercials.'' And a TV Land Saturday morning lineup called 
``Retrovision'' takes aim straight at the Count Chocula set. It's 
resurrecting such 1970s fare as ``H.R. Pufnstuff,'' the animated 
``Star Trek'' and a really weird cartoon version of ``Happy Days'' 
that sends Richie, Malph and the Fonz into a time machine and back 
to a stereotype-saturated ancient Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all available now -- all eras, all the time, 23,000 hours'  
worth in Nickelodeon's vaults alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so much product, so much preservation, that things  
exist simultaneously in time and space like never before,'' says 
actor John Ritter, Jack Tripper of ``Three's Company.'' He didn't 
expect it to survive two seasons, much less two decades. That seems 
to be the consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never dreamed how long this would last,'' says Don Knotts,  
a 1960s staple as jumpy Deputy Barney Fife in ``The Andy Griffith 
Show'' and jumpier landlord Mr. Furley in ``Three's Company'' 
(1977-1984). 
</P>
<P>
	It's television as sense memory -- what Robert Thompson, director  
of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse 
University, calls ``the aesthetic of the anesthetic.'' This is our 
common ground, even if it's more Samantha and Darrin than Socrates 
and Da Vinci. 
</P>
<P>
	But what happens down the road? Already, as Gen-Xers join  
boomers on demographic center stage, shows from the 1970s and early 
1980s are joining those from the 1950s and 1960s as nostalgia 
staples. 
</P>
<P>
	If the latest generation of TV watchers comes of age with ``I  
Love Lucy'' and ``Petticoat Junction'' reruns, is there enough 
stuff being created in the post-''Webster'' era to fill TV Land's 
2015 fall schedule? Or could the incessant tumbling into 
Pleasantville someday backfire on the nostalgia network? 
</P>
<P>
	Probably not. We'll always have ``Seinfeld'' and ``Frasier'' and  
``Friends,'' not to mention ``The Fresh Prince of Bel Air'' and 
``Head of the Class.'' And if things get really lean, there's 
always ``Growing Pains'' and ``Saved by the Bell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the quality, whatever the era that belches it forth,  
we'll always have our yesterdays. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`SNOOPS' IS SHOOTING: Production has begun in Los Angeles on  
``Snoops,'' a new series from David E. Kelley, the prolific creator 
of ``The Practice,'' ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Chicago Hope,'' ABC has 
announced. The program, which ABC will air Sundays, takes an 
amusing look at a sexy ensemble of unconventional L.A. private 
eyes. Glenn Hall (Gina Gershon), the city's most savvy and 
seductive private eye, doesn't let a little thing like the Bill of 
Rights bog her down. Glenn's newest recruit is Dana Plant (Paula 
Marshall), a by-the-book police detective looking to escape the 
Santa Monica Police Department and a failed love affair with her 
boss. ``Snoops'' premieres Sept. 26. Kelley is executive producer.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 126.96 in Late Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks extended their gains today as a battered  
market revived, due in part to a strong earnings report from 
networking company Cisco Systems and calming words from the Federal 
Reserve on the growth of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 126.96 points at 10,782.11. The gains followed through on a 
rebound that began Tuesday afternoon, when the Dow and other 
indicators struggled back from steep losses to end modestly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher today. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 17.71 at 1,299.14, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was up 60.84 at 2,550.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market was ripe for a minor rally following a  
slump that has left every major market index well below the lofty 
records reached in mid-July. But most Wall Street players believe 
the market will have trouble sustaining gains at least until Aug. 
24, when Fed policy-makers hold their next meeting to set interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a nervous market and will continue to be for a  
while,'' said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. 
in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed offered some reassurance this afternoon, saying its  
latest economic survey turned up little evidence of rising 
inflation in general. But the Fed survey, dubbed the ``beige 
book,'' did note developments that could lead to increased 
inflationary pressures, most notably widespread labor shortages and 
scattered reports of higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed, which raised rates slightly on June 30, has clearly  
signaled its willingness to raise short-term interest rates for a 
second time this year, hoping to prevent inflation from creeping 
into the robust U.S. economy.

<HEADLINE> Dow Surges 132.65 to 10,787.80 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks made their broadest, sharpest gains of  
August as the Federal Reserve offered calming words Wednesday on 
the growth of the U.S. economy and Cisco Systems provided proof of 
strong corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 132.65 points, or by 1.2  
percent, to close at 10,787.80. The blue-chips gained momentum over 
the course of the session, breaking a recent pattern of starting 
strong only to sputter late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 rose 20.50 to 1,301.93, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 
74.87 to 2,564.98, its biggest point gain since June 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market was ripe for a minor rally following a  
slump that has left every major market index well below the lofty 
records reached in mid-July. But most Wall Street players said the 
advance was fragile. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a nervous market and will continue to be for a  
while,'' said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. 
in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Many believe the market will have trouble sustaining gains at  
least until Aug. 24, when Fed policy-makers hold their next meeting 
to set interest rates. Wednesday, the Fed offered some reassurance, 
saying its latest economic survey turned up little evidence of 
rising inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Fed survey, dubbed the ``beige book,'' did note  
developments that could lead to increased inflationary pressures, 
most notably widespread labor shortages and scattered reports of 
higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed, which raised rates slightly on June 30, has clearly  
signaled its willingness to raise short-term interest rates for a 
second time this year, hoping to prevent inflation from creeping 
into the robust U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of economic news for people to look at in  
advance of the next meeting,'' Berman said. ``Under different 
circumstances, the beige book might not attract a lot of attention, 
but investors are looking for guidance on what exactly the Fed 
plans to do.''

	Growing fears of a third rate hike this fall have hurt stocks  
and bonds alike. Plummeting bond prices in recent days have pushed 
up the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond closer to 6.25 percent, 
leaving long-term borrowing costs at the highest level in nearly 
two years. But bonds rallied after the Fed's report was released 
and on a strong auction response to the sale of 10-year Treasury 
notes, and yields slipped to 6.21 percent from 6.24 percent on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For some investors, rising bond yields have presented an  
attractive alternative to returns on volatile stocks. Other stock 
investors are unsettled that an uptrend in interest rates will cut

Tuesday, after markets closed, the company reported fourth-quarter 
earnings that beat analysts' estimates, rounding out a fiscal year 
in which revenues grew 43 percent and operating profits improved 35 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online rose 7 3/8 to 92 3/8 after company executives held an  
upbeat conference call with analysts and major investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Kaltbaum, chief technical analyst at J.W. Genesis said the  
strength of those shares hinted at renewed leadership by 
well-established technology companies.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Backs Defense Bill Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration and Congress are  
moving toward a showdown over reorganizing the Energy Department, 
with a widely popular defense bill a possible casualty. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told reporters Wednesday he  
probably will recommend that President Clinton veto the $289 
billion defense authorization bill because he said it would put the 
nuclear weapons programs under a powerful new agency over which he 
would have modest control. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson hedged somewhat on the veto issue, knowing that the  
White House has yet to take a final position. The defense bill has 
widespread political support and among other things would give a 
hefty pay boost to the military and provide new spending for 
military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	A veto could open the administration to sharp criticism from  
Republicans who have argued the Pentagon is spread too thin and 
that a pay increase for the military is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Department reorganization is all but certain as a fallout  
over months of controversy about charges of lax security and 
Chinese espionage at the department's nuclear weapons labs -- much 
of the spying going back 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Richardson said the proposal approved as part of the defense  
bill by House and Senate conferees just before the summer recess 
``clearly goes too far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would most likely recommend to the president that he veto  
the bill,'' said Richardson. Congress is expected to send the bill 
to the president shortly after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision as crafted in negotiations between the House and  
Senate would create a new nuclear weapons agency within the 
department that would largely set its on budget, make its own 
personnel decisions and be insulated from most of the rest of the 
department. Richardson argues it would be largely beyond the reach 
of the energy secretary as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's supporters argue that department meddling in  
nuclear weapons programs is what caused the security problems that 
led to China obtaining nuclear secrets from the weapons labs, 
including information about one of the country's most sophisticated 
warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	``The changes in this bill are long overdue,'' said Rep. Mac  
Thornberry, R-Texas, who crafted much of the weapons agency 
language. ``Over the last 10 years alone there have been nearly 20 
reports critical of the department's management of the nuclear 
weapons complex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he accepts ``the concept'' of a semi-autonomous  
nuclear weapons agency and would go along with a version approved 
by the Senate. But he said the structure in the defense legislation 
``undermines the secretary's authority'' and ``blurs the lines of 
responsibility'' in areas of security, counter-intelligence and 
health, safety and environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department reorganization would be the most  
wide-reaching overhaul of the department since it was create in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	On other subjects during a hour-long meeting with reporters,  
Richardson said: 
</P>
<P>
	--He will announce within days disciplinary action against a  
number of individuals stemming from the mishandling of the 
espionage investigation at the Los Alamos weapons laboratory. He 
has said in the past some individuals will be fired, but was less 
clear on that today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we're looking at very serious disciplinary action,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	--He is determined to pursue a broad investigation and make as  
much information public as possible about the exposure of workers 
to highly dangerous plutonium at a government uranium reprocessing 
plant in Paducah, Ky., and make certain restitution is made to 
those who suffered illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also said he wants to investigate whether the  
civilian contractors operating the facility during the Cold War 
years misled workers and the government as to health risks. 
</P>
<P>
	--He has met resistance ``from all sides'' on his plans to  
require polygraph tests on thousands of nuclear weapons laboratory 
workers, but is determined to pursue ``narrowly focused'' tests. 
``I don't think anybody should be afraid of that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Postpones Bat Specifications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The NCAA, hoping to make metal baseball bats  
perform more like wood, will conduct further tests before adopting 
bat specifications for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The association's executive committee last week received a  
report from a research panel appointed in March to review non-wood 
bats and baseballs. The committee, however, has decided not to 
implement the panel's recommendations for at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a frustrating experience for the executive  
committee and the membership,'' said Charles Wethington, Kentucky 
president and NCAA executive committee chairman. ``But we have a 
good testing machine in place now, we have good recommendations 
from an independent group of scientists, and we very soon will have 
a protocol in place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many college teams last season went to smaller aluminum bats,  
one of the recommendations by the panel, to increase safety and to 
reverse a trend of much higher scoring than with wood bats, which 
broke easily. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't brought closure to this issue in the manner the  
membership wants. But we are too close now to rush a decision about 
an implementation date,'' Wethington said. ``This delay until 
mid-September will give us adequate time to conduct additional 
testing to set the right input speeds and establish the right 
standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early bats were heavy and only the strongest players could  
generate much speed in their swing. But in recent years, 
manufacturers have refined their products to make them lighter and 
capable of producing power from a larger area of the bat. A 
well-hit ball off an aluminum bat can reach speeds of more than 100 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A record 62 home runs were hit in last year's College World  
Series and the tournament ended with Southern Cal's 21-14 victory 
over Arizona State. In this year's 14-game College World Series, 
with the smaller bats in use, the number of homers dropped to 35, 
and the 164 total runs were the fewest since 1994. In the title 
game, Miami beat Florida State 6-5, with each team hitting just one 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA panel endorsed specifications recommended last year by  
the association's Baseball Rules Committee, including the reduction 
in maximum diameter from 2 3/4 inches to 2 5/8 inches and in the 
difference between the length of a bat and its weight from five 
units to three units. That is, a 34-inch bat could weigh no less 
than 31 ounces, not including the grip. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel wants college bats to simulate the velocity of a  
batted ball using a ``Major League Baseball quality, 34-inch, solid 
wood bat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also recommended testing speeds for baseballs and bat  
swings be increased from 70 mph to 80 mph to better approximate 
game conditions; additional testing to determine if a standard 
should be developed on how tight a regulation NCAA baseball should 
be wound; and testing on whether a bat begins to perform better the 
more it is used.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Lauds Bicyclist Armstrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lance Armstrong, who conquered cancer to win  
the prestigious Tour de France bicycle race, says he'll spend his 
time now trying to help cancer victims and preparing for the next 
running of the grueling event. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Armstrong accepted congratulations from an array of  
Washingtonians, from President Clinton at the White House to a band 
of bicycle messengers who waited for him on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong posed for photographs in the Oval Office with the  
president, then appeared with Vice President Al Gore in the 
Roosevelt Room at a ceremony to honor cancer survivors and call 
attention to successes of cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore hailed the cyclist as an inspiration to cancer survivors  
everywhere and asked the Office of Personnel Management to explore 
offering federal workers time off for cancer screening. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the idea was based on a program offered to Boston city  
workers under which they can take a half-day paid leave each year 
to get checked out for cancer. ``Prevention and early attention can 
save lives,'' the vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking questions at the National Press Club's crowded  
auditorium, Armstrong said the hardest day physically on the tour 
was its first leg over the steep grades and sizzling heat of the 
Pyrenees Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentally, he said, the toughest 24 hours came when he was  
accused -- falsely, he insists -- of taking drugs to enhance his 
strength and endurance after his cancer battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said that after a lifetime of good health -- ``not even  
a broken bone'' -- and years of successful competition, his cancer 
became the supreme endurance test of his life. His testicular 
cancer invaded his bones and brain and was fought with aggressive 
chemotherapy and three operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The attitude of a cancer survivor like himself, he said, is,  
``You've been to hell and back, and you want a vacation for the 
rest of your life. But nobody gives you that. You have to go on 
because you are living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said for him ``going on'' means continuing the work of  
building and expanding the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which he set 
up to promote cancer research and help cancer victims and 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he intends to compete in the next year's Tour de France  
and will keep training until then. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you show up at the Tour de France overweight or out of  
shape,'' he said, ``it doesn't make any difference (what kind of 
bike) you're riding -- you won't win.''

<HEADLINE> Religion Linked to Good Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH (AP) -- Seniors who attend church or synagogue regularly  
might possess the secret of longevity. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report linking good health with religion, Duke  
University researchers say seniors with regular church or synagogue 
attendance are not only healthier but also more likely to live 
longer than the non-religious. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers, studying nearly 4,000 North Carolinians over 64  
years old, found that the death rate of the faithful was 28 percent 
less than those who didn't attend services regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies in recent years focusing on the spiritual dimension of  
health have yet to show that religious attendance or spirituality 
cause physical wholeness. But a mounting body of evidence 
associates the religious with better mental health, lower blood 
pressure and other health improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step, says the study's lead author, Dr. Harold Koenig,  
is to identify the behavioral and biological mechanisms linking 
religion to disease prevention and good health. 
</P>
<P>
	``These studies do not show that if they are going to church for  
health reasons, their health will improve,'' Koenig said. ``But if 
people go to church for religious reasons, they have better health 
and survive longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The findings released in the July-August medical sciences  
edition of the Journal of Gerontology examined 3,968 adults in five 
North Carolina counties from 1986-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers interviewed participants each year about church  
attendance, their health, social support and alcohol and tobacco 
use. The subjects, mostly Christians and Jews, were categorized 
according to whether they attended religious meetings once weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1992, 1,177 participants had died.  
</P>
<P>
	Analyses showed 46 percent fewer of the church attendees died  
during the period than nonchurchgoers. But the rate dropped to 28 
percent when the differing ages, health and social factors and 
smoking and alcohol use within the sample were taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
	The respective mortality risks are comparable to those  
experienced by smokers versus nonsmokers, Koenig said. The risk 
decline was 35 percent in women and 17 percent in men, according to 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health,  
is not the first to tie religious practice to a lower risk of 
dying. A California study of 5,300 people over 28 years generated 
similar findings, but the survey sample ranged from 21 to 65 years 
of age. And the sample's mortality was 15 percent, compared with 
about 30 percent for the Duke study. 
</P>
<P>
	The health benefits of church attendance may be related to the  
increased social support found in religious groups, Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other members are committed to you, praying for you,'' he  
said. ``You get sick and don't show up for church, and people call 
you and ask why you weren't there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Church attendance also may prompt the faithful to be more  
conscientious about taking medication. A deep religious faith, 
while not synonymous with attending church, also helps people cope 
with tragedy and may relieve stress, Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Kasl, an epidemiology professor at the Yale University  
medical school, called the Duke study ``an important contribution'' 
to firming up the church-good health association. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have many of these kind of studies,'' said Kasl.

<HEADLINE> New Bergman Film Described As Scary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The Ingmar Bergman film that starts  
production next week is being described as scary and shocking -- but 
that doesn't mean Sweden's titan of seriousness is going the 
slasher-movie route. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie ``Troloesa'' (Faithless) is a thriller, ``but not a  
thriller with murders -- although you could say a soul is 
murdered,'' director Liv Ullmann told a news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The script was written by Bergman. Ms. Ullmann, a Norwegian  
twice nominated for Oscars as an actress, said the script is based 
an experience Bergman struggled to write about for many years -- 
but, in good thriller tradition, she didn't give away many details. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie, in which Erland Josephsson plays Bergman, is set  
mostly in Bergman's workroom. It has flashbacks into the past, as 
Bergman wrestles ``with remorse over what he did to the woman he 
loved,'' according to Ms. Ullmann. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ullmann, who has appeared in many Bergman films, had a  
five-year relationship with him. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Librarians at St. Augustine's College have  
started the massive task of cataloging materials donated to the 
school from the estate of Raleigh's famous centenarian sisters, 
Sadie and Bessie Delany. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea that the collection would be as rich as it is,''  
said Linda Simmons-Henry, the library director at St. Augustine's. 
``This is a collection of a 100-year period of an African-American 
family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Delanys' best-selling 1993 novel, ``Having Our Say,''  
chronicled the two sisters' lives, which began in the 1880s on St. 
Augustine's campus, where they were raised with their eight 
brothers and sisters. Their father, Bishop Henry Beard Delany, the 
principal of the college, was the first black elected Episcopal 
priest in America. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters went on to write ``The Delany Sisters' Book of  
Everyday Wisdom'' in 1994. Bessie Delany died in 1995 at age 104. 
Sadie went on to write ``On My Own, Life without Bessie'' in 1997 
before her death in January at age 109.

	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended sharply lower  
Wednesday, although shares in Tokyo, the region's largest exchange, 
edged up slightly.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Lauds Bicyclist Armstrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lance Armstrong, who conquered cancer to win  
the prestigious Tour de France bicycle race, says he'll spend his 
time now trying to help cancer victims and preparing for the next 
running of the grueling event. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Armstrong accepted congratulations from an array of  
Washingtonians, from President Clinton at the White House to a band 
of bicycle messengers who waited for him on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong posed for photographs in the Oval Office with the  
president, then appeared with Vice President Al Gore in the 
Roosevelt Room at a ceremony to honor cancer survivors and call 
attention to successes of cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore hailed the cyclist as an inspiration to cancer survivors  
everywhere and asked the Office of Personnel Management to explore 
offering federal workers time off for cancer screening. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the idea was based on a program offered to Boston city  
workers under which they can take a half-day paid leave each year 
to get checked out for cancer. ``Prevention and early attention can 
save lives,'' the vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking questions at the National Press Club's crowded  
auditorium, Armstrong said the hardest day physically on the tour 
was its first leg over the steep grades and sizzling heat of the 
Pyrenees Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentally, he said, the toughest 24 hours came when he was  
accused -- falsely, he insists -- of taking drugs to enhance his 
strength and endurance after his cancer battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said that after a lifetime of good health -- ``not even  
a broken bone'' -- and years of successful competition, his cancer 
became the supreme endurance test of his life. His testicular 
cancer invaded his bones and brain and was fought with aggressive 
chemotherapy and three operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The attitude of a cancer survivor like himself, he said, is,  
``You've been to hell and back, and you want a vacation for the 
rest of your life. But nobody gives you that. You have to go on 
because you are living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said for him ``going on'' means continuing the work of  
building and expanding the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which he set 
up to promote cancer research and help cancer victims and 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he intends to compete in the next year's Tour de France  
and will keep training until then. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you show up at the Tour de France overweight or out of  
shape,'' he said, ``it doesn't make any difference (what kind of 
bike) you're riding -- you won't win.''

<HEADLINE> Africa Pipeline Deal Falls Apart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A last-minute glitch reportedly squashed a deal  
between a consortium of energy companies led by Chevron to build a 
natural gas pipeline in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron's five partners, including Royal Dutch/Shell, refused to  
sign onto the joint venture after Nigeria suddenly demanded to be 
named project leader in place of Chevron, Dow Jones News Service 
reported late Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron said in a statement it signed a political pact with  
Nigeria, Ghana, Benin and Togo, giving the consortium the right to 
develop the pipeline, which could start supplying the region with 
energy in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear Wednesday where that left the project.  
</P>
<P>
	Chevron spokeswoman Jan Golon told Dow Jones the company was  
optimistic the joint-venture problems will be resolved in the next 
several days. Golon did not return a call from The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The pipeline would initially carry 120 million cubic feet of  
natural gas a day from Nigeria for sale into the other nations. 
Construction, which started six years ago, is expected to cost $400 
million, Chevron said. 
</P>
<P>
	The project will supplement the unreliable hydropower in the  
three consuming countries, starting in mid 2002. The initial 
customers will be three power plants in Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
	It also will help Nigeria reach its target of eliminating gas  
flaring by 2003. At present almost 70 percent of natural gas in 
Nigeria is flared -- or burned off -- as a byproduct of oil 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria has the 10th-largest gas reserves in the world,  
estimated at 124 trillion cubic feet in 1996, or 2.6 percent of 
estimated world reserves. Nigeria's gas reserves are three times 
its crude oil reserves, which make up 65 percent of the country's 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Chevron and Shell's Nigerian unit, the consortium  
included national energy companies of the four nations.

<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Jaime Moreno scored the go-ahead  
goal in the 42nd minute and D.C. United sent the New York-New 
Jersey MetroStars their sixth straight loss, 4-1 Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	United (15-7) has won three straight and leads Major League  
Soccer's East Division. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars (5-16), who have the league's worst record,  
scored on Sasa Curcic's penalty kick in the ninth minute, which 
ended their league-record scoreless streak at 375 minutes. They 
have not won a game in regulation since May 15. 
</P>
<P>
	United tied the score in the 21st minute when Carey Talley  
headed in Marco Etcheverry's free kick. 
</P>
<P>
	MetroStars defender Mike Petke was ejected in the 34th minute  
for his second yellow card -- he picked up the ball, kissed it and 
flipped it to referee Michael Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno beat goalkeeper Mike Ammann for a 2-1 lead eight minutes  
later. Ben Olson scored in the 71st and A.J. Wood connected off a 
cross from Talley four minutes later.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Adrian Grenier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``The Adventures of Sebastian Cole'' is taking  
its star, Adrian Grenier, on an adventure of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	The journey began with the hectic 24-day shooting schedule in  
upstate New York. The town was so small -- and so unaccustomed to 
moviemaking -- that the local fire department showed up every time 
the filmmakers used a fog machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Grenier has the title role, a restless teen-ager blessed and  
cursed by his nontraditional family. The film is set in 1983, and 
his character has hit the doldrums of high school. He restlessly 
bides his time reading the ``wrong'' books and underachieving. 
</P>
<P>
	Sebastian wants to get out and find adventure. That's when fate  
steps in. His family is thrown into a tailspin when his stepfather 
Hank (Clark Gregg) announces that he is going to become a woman. 
Sebastian ends up living with Hank, who changes his name to 
Henrietta. 
</P>
<P>
	Grenier said he shares many thoughts and traits with Sebastian,  
particularly the rebellious streak, although he is beginning to 
outgrow it. ``I have to force myself to be bad. It doesn't come as 
naturally as it used to. But I can't forget that side of me, I 
think it's healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After dropping out of college and spending a few years  
concentrating only on ``being a ragamuffin,'' Grenier, 23, said he 
is now taking his career seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	But not too seriously.  
</P>
<P>
	He shares an apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with a high  
school friend, and spent a recent summer evening playing a 50-cent 
kiddie xylophone at the beach on Fire Island. He arrived unshaven 
at a Manhattan hotel for a day of press interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving out of his mother's home and into his own apartment  
helped him discover his domestic side, Grenier said. ``I like to 
read and make dinner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``The place isn't very clean right now, but sometimes  
we get fanatical about cleaning it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Drive Me Crazy,'' starring Grenier and Melissa Joan Hart, is  
scheduled for release in October. 
</P>
<P>
	And while he is trying to build a name for himself in the movie  
industry, Grenier said he won't jump at just any role. 
</P>
<P>
	``After doing `The Adventures of Sebastian Cole,' I know there  
are parts for me to do that are very enjoyable and movies that are 
enjoyable to work on. I needed this job and they gave it to me, but 
because of it, I am more selective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	1. How did you know that acting is the career for you?  
</P>
<P>
	Grenier: Well, I know I don't want to be a Wall Street broker. I  
know I don't want to be a lot of things, but I never dismissed 
acting, so I guess that's how I got into it. 
</P>
<P>
	2. What makes you different from other young actors still  
looking for their big break? 
</P>
<P>
	Grenier: I was lucky. It was fated for me to do this and I don't  
feel guilty about it. Just because I'm getting this recognition 
doesn't mean someone else can't. 
</P>
<P>
	3. You've had an agent since you were a teen-ager. How active  
are you in shaping your career? 
</P>
<P>
	Grenier: I've realized as you get further into the business side  
of acting that you have to seek out scripts and play an active part 
in what you do. You have to start to take control of what happens 
to you. If you lose control, you'll look back and you won't be in a 
good place. 
</P>
<P>
	4. In both ``Sebastian Cole'' and ``Drive Me Crazy,'' you play a  
high school student. Do you want to graduate to more adult parts? 
</P>
<P>
	Grenier: I'll go for a 20-year-old, not too mature. I'll age  
slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Do you see yourself trading the city for a small-town life  
like Sebastian Cole had? 
</P>
<P>
	Grenier: I think it's inbred in me somewhere. I just recently  
started to get to know my father again. He's from Ohio, so I went 
out to Ohio and I liked it. There's this comfortableness there. I 
can see how people not from there want to get in and be a part of 
it.

<HEADLINE> Report: Brewer's Manager Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Phil Garner has been fired after nearly eight  
years as manager of the Milwaukee Brewers, and general manager Sal 
Bando will resign, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and WTMJ-TV 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting coach Jim Lefebvre, the only member of Garner's staff  
with managing experience, is expected to be named interim manager, 
the newspaper reported, citing an unidentified source. 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre managed the Mariners and the Cubs from 1989-93. The  
Brewers, who are off Thursday, start a road trip Friday at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig, whose family controls the team,  
said he had no knowledge of any departures and referred questions 
to his daughter Wendy Selig-Prieb, who succeeded him as club 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Jon Greenberg refused to confirm or deny the  
reports Wednesday night, saying it was too late in the evening to 
discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers went 4-8 on a 12-game homestand that ended Wednesday  
with an 8-5 loss to Colorado, dropping their season record to 
52-60. Milwaukee reached .500 five times this season but failed 
each time to get above the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner told WTMJ-TV and WITI-TV that he hadn't heard anything  
about being fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know a thing,'' he said. ``I just called my wife.  
There's nothing on our messages at home.''

	Shooting Suspect Turns Himself In  
</P>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The suspect in a shooting spree at a Jewish  
community center in suburban Los Angeles turned himself in to the 
FBI here, and authorities say he confessed to the attack. A federal 
prosecutor in Los Angeles says Buford O'Neal Furrow will also be 
charged in the fatal shooting of a postal worker who was shot 
yesterday near the scene of the attack at the community center. 
Furrow, 37, told authorities ``he wanted this to be a wake-up call 
to America to kill Jews.'' Furrow allegedly opened fire yesterday 
at the center with a semiautomatic gun resembling an Uzi, peppering 
the building with some 70 shots. Five people were injured, 
including three children.

	Fed Finds Strong U.S. Economy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy is still growing strongly  
with labor shortages reported nationwide, the Federal Reserve said 
today in a new report that highlighted concerns that the economy 
may be growing too rapidly. That could lead to the Fed raising 
interest rates for the second time this year. The Fed's survey of 
economic conditions around the country found only scattered signs 
of mounting wage pressures and little evidence of rising inflation 
in general. But the Fed survey did note developments that could 
lead to increased inflationary pressures.

	Lawyers Say Drug Maker Misled MDs  
</P>
<P>
	NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- One of the manufacturers of the  
fen-phen diet drug misled doctors about the damage the pills could 
do, putting patients at increased risk for heart and lung ailments, 
a lawyer said today. Plaintiffs' attorney Esther Berezofsky 
comments' came as opening statements got under way in the first 
class-action suit to come to trial against American Home Products, 
manufacturer of half of the fen-phen diet drug combination. Three 
New Jersey women are suing the company on behalf of 94,000 New 
Jerseyans who took the pills. AHP -- which made fenfluramine, the 
``fen'' half of the drug duo, could be forced to pay more than $1 
billion over the next decade if it loses the civil case.

	Customs Changing Search Policy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Customs Service said today that it will  
obtain the approval of a federal magistrate when it wants to hold a 
passenger for more than four hours who is suspected of smuggling 
drugs. The move comes as the agency is dogged by investigations and 
lawsuits alleging abusive searches. The change will take effect 
Oct. 1. Customs can now detain passengers for any period of time 
without having to go to a federal judge for approval. Under the 
change, Customs would be required to make a case before a federal 
judge showing that it has ``reasonable suspicion'' to keep the 
passenger in custody.

	U.S. Seeks South Asia Clashes Ended

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States urgently called on India and  
Pakistan today to reinstitute a 1991 agreement aimed at avoiding 
clashes between military aircraft of the two countries. A key 
provision of the agreement forbids aircraft from flying within 10 
kilometers of each other's border without pre-notification and 
advance notification of such flights. The appeal came after the 
second aerial clash in two days between the South Asian rivals.

his U.S. Senate campaign plans on hold while New York City Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani mulls getting into the race. While bowing to Gov. 
George Pataki's wish to give Giuliani a chance to make up his mind, 
Lazio said he was not withdrawing from the race and did not rule 
out a primary run against the mayor. Pataki asked Lazio to stop 
aside so the Republican party would be united in a race against 
likely Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Ky. School Displays 10 Commandments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MCKEE, Ky. (AP) -- Students returning to classes at Jackson  
County High School hardly paid attention to the new small plaques 
mounted in their classrooms. Maybe the new dress code was on their 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials in this eastern Kentucky school district hope that  
by posting the Ten Commandments in each classroom, they can prevent 
violence and other problems that have plagued schools nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The county school board and superintendent allowed the plaques  
as part of ``an effort to start having good morals in school ... 
because of all the violent issues that have been showing up,'' said 
Betty Bond, principal of the high school. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaques went up Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Schools around the country have considered using the Ten  
Commandments as a symbol of morality amid headline-grabbing 
violence involving students over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that organized prayer  
and Bible readings were not permitted in public schools; in 1980, 
it decided posting the Ten Commandments violated the Constitution's 
ban of government-established religion. 
</P>
<P>
	But in June, the U.S. House passed a measure allowing the Ten  
Commandments to be posted in schools and other government 
buildings. The bill now goes to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Crawford, Jackson County's school district attorney,  
said he is concerned about lawsuits, but believes the plaques in 
the district's five schools are allowed by law because they were 
paid for and posted by local volunteers and not sponsored by the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe posting the Ten Commandments is imposing  
anyone's religious views because the kids are not tested on that, 
the kids are not required to look at it, and the kids are not 
required to read it, and they're not held accountable for that 
knowledge,'' Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonya Adams, principal of Union Chapel Elementary School in  
Russell County, which has had the Ten Commandments posted for 
years, said she's never received any complaints about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in our community would probably be upset if they were  
taken away,'' Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Adams County, Ohio, a group of ministers paid to place Ten  
Commandments tablets outside four high schools to counter ``moral 
decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Vessels, executive director of the American Civil Liberties  
Union of Kentucky, said the ACLU considers the move 
unconstitutional, but would not act unless there is a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ACLU is certainly very concerned about school violence,  
but saying posting the Ten Commandments solves it is incredibly 
simplistic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Hughes, spokesman for the Kentucky School Boards  
Association, said the organization tells districts to follow the 
Supreme Court ruling and not allow the Ten Commandments to be 
posted. He said a lawsuit could cost a district up to hundreds of 
thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	There was virtually no opposition from the community about the  
plaques, and students returning to the high school said little 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a new dress code this year, and I suspect in the  
children's mind that's much more of a trauma than the Ten 
Commandments being placed up because this is a very traditional 
community and really church-oriented,'' Bond said.

<HEADLINE> Researcher Makes Cheaper Fuel Cell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A researcher says he has made an experimental fuel cell that is  
simpler than others because it runs on natural gas instead of pure 
hydrogen. 
</P>
<P>
	If it can be repeated on a large scale, the finding would make  
it cheaper to produce a type of fuel cell that may one day be 
common as a low-pollution power source for buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings of the Northwestern University research team led by  
Scott A. Barnett are reported in Thursday's edition of the science 
journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Department of Energy experts had mixed reactions to the study.  
One was skeptical that the Northwestern experiment, done in a 
controlled laboratory setting, could be applied to daily use. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel cells are an alternative power source for cars, power  
plants and even individual buildings. In a fuel cell, gas and 
oxygen react chemically to produce electricity, water, heat -- and 
virtually no pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
	Utilities and auto makers are pouring millions of dollars into  
researching fuel cells as pollution concerns rise. But while the 
technology is ready, it is still too expensive for practical use. 
</P>
<P>
	One type of fuel cell that shows promise in power plants is the  
solid-oxide cell. It runs best on pure hydrogen, which is usually 
converted from a natural gas like methane before being injected 
into the cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel cells powerful enough for power plants run at high  
temperatures and can easily convert the natural gas into hydrogen 
by recycling their own heat and steam. Smaller fuel cells -- perhaps 
big enough to power a single home -- don't produce enough steam to 
do that and need costly external converters. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutting out the conversion step would make the smaller fuel  
cells cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you could eliminate that extra hardware and just put  
natural gas into your fuel cell, you'd be that much closer to 
making this a commercial reality,'' Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous experiments, cells cracked and became caked with  
carbon at higher temperatures, and at lower temperatures, the cells 
did not produce much electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett was able to make a fuel cell in a lab work at a lower  
temperature by using cerium oxide. Cerium oxide, also found in 
catalytic converters, makes the methane react quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The success at a lower temperature is significant, said John  
Turner, a senior scientist at the Energy Department's National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory. Lower temperatures put less strain on 
the components, meaning cheaper parts could be used, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But another DOE expert said Barnett's experiment was too limited  
to determine whether the process would be simpler. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has not done it on a large enough scale under realistic  
operating conditions to draw the conclusions he's drawing,'' said 
Michael Krumpelt, manager of the fuel cell program at the Argonne 
National Laboratory outside Chicago.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Player Charged With Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina defensive tackle Brian  
Norwood was arrested Wednesday and charged with raping an 
11-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwood, 19, was charged with two counts of first-degree rape,  
three counts of first-degree sex offense of a child, three counts 
of felony crime against nature, and two counts of felony indecent 
liberties with a child. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury indicted Norwood and nine other men on sex charges  
resulting from a series of incidents alleged to have occurred two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond County sheriff's investigators say the 10 men, some of  
them in their 40s, raped the girl several times. 
</P>
<P>
	Following his arrest, Norwood was released after posting a  
$24,000 bond. His first court appearance will be Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Norwood were unsuccessful.  
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina coach Carl Torbush suspended Norwood from the  
team after learning of the situation on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brian Norwood has been suspended from all football-related  
activities until his pending legal situation is fully resolved,'' 
Torbush said. 
</P>
<P>
	A red-shirt freshman, Norwood came to North Carolina a year ago  
as the most highly touted defensive line recruit in the state.

<HEADLINE> Giants' QBs Know Their Roles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Kent Graham and Kerry Collins are trying to  
make the best out of what is an awkward situation at quarterback 
for the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	The company line according to coach Jim Fassel is absolutely  
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham, who led the team to five wins in its final six games  
last season, is the starting quarterback. Collins, whose career hit 
turbulent times the past two seasons in Carolina and New Orleans 
because of driving under the influence, poor play and allegations 
of racism, is the backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the preseason opener at Minnesota on Friday night,  
there also is the constant speculation regarding the job. There is 
a belief that Collins, who was signed to a $16.9 million contract, 
will be the starter sometime this season. You don't pay someone a 
bundle of money to sit on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Both have handled the situation well. They've been asked enough  
times, so they should know what to say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what my job is and I'll treat this like any preseason  
game,'' Graham said Wednesday between practices at the University 
at Albany. ``I'll just try and go out and execute, and not worry 
about any mitigating circumstances. I'll just try and go out and do 
a good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, the fifth pick overall in the 1995 draft, has come to  
the Giants on his best behavior, knowing this might be his last 
shot. He was released by Carolina last year after saying his heart 
wasn't in the game any more, then he signed with New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he was arrested two weeks later on a drunken driving  
charge after a game in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins has worked hard to get his life and career back together  
since signing with New York in February. That led to the release of 
Danny Kanell, the man who led the Giants to the playoffs in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be foolish not to take advantage of this  
opportunity,'' said Collins, who helped Carolina get to the NFC 
championship game in his second season. ``I think I'm in a great 
organization which has given me a chance to really get things back 
on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every time Fassel has been asked, he has not hesitated to say  
Graham is his quarterback. He also has found time to praise the 
strong-armed Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see a level of maturity and self assuredness which is  
paramount in any quarterback,'' Fassel said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both played well in last week's intrasquad scrimmage. Graham hit  
5 of 8 passes for 83 yards and a touchdown. Collins was 5 of 12 for 
107 yards and a TD, including a 60-yard pass play to Joe 
Jurevicius, a fellow Penn State product. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the quarterbacks will go up against the Vikings, an  
early frontrunner to go to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good test,'' Graham said. ``They are very good up  
front and we're going to have to be much sharper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said his goal is to execute well. His main focus will be  
on third down since the Giants use a shotgun formation and 
different protections he has had to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked point blank, Collins doesn't deny he wants to start.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to play,'' the 26-year-old said. ``I don't  
think there is any doubt about that. The situation is what it is. 
I've accepted that. I understand what my role is. 
</P>
<P>
	``My focus is to just try to improve and be comfortable with the  
offense and try to make sure I can run it efficiently, if and when 
the time comes,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Giants trying to rebound from an 8-8 record after  
winning the NFC East the previous year, one has to wonder how 
patient Fassel will be if the team starts off slowly. Counting this 
year, he has two years left on his contract. Winning will be 
paramount. 
</P>
<P>
	That could put the pressure on Graham, a seven-year veteran who  
started his career with the Giants in 1992 as an eighth-round draft 
pick. Released prior to the 1995 season, he spent a year in Detroit 
and two in Arizona prior to signing with the Giants as a free agent 
in February, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He was almost a hero last year in replacing Kanell.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's on the spot, knowing Collins is ready to replace him.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Teen To Be Tried As Adult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- A 15-year-old accused of wounding six of his  
high school classmates during a shooting spree has been ordered to 
stand trial as an adult by a judge who cited the ``severity and 
viciousness'' of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision on Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon came Wednesday, the  
same day students returned to Heritage High School after summer 
break. 
</P>
<P>
	In his decision, Juvenile Court Judge William Schneider noted  
that Solomon referred to the shooting at Columbine High School in 
Littleton, Colo., in a note left under his bed. The Littleton 
shootings left 15 dead, including the two teen-age gunmen, and took 
place exactly one month before the shootings in this suburb 20 
miles east of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the child has attempted to copy a heinous and  
devastating crime through premeditation and deceit makes these 
actions even more egregious and outrageous demonstrations of 
disrespect for the safety and the well-being of our community,'' 
Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The severity and the viciousness of these offenses make the  
public's interest in treating the juvenile as an adult paramount to 
any other interests before the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Had he been tried as a juvenile, Solomon would have faced up to  
five years of supervision, which could have included house arrest 
and probation. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted on all 21 counts he faces, he could be sent to  
prison for 351 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys planned to appeal the ruling to the Georgia  
Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad when we take a sick, mentally ill young kid and throw  
him on the trash heap of the adult prison system,'' lawyer Ed 
Garland said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, his defense lawyers also said they would be open to a  
plea bargain. District Attorney Richard Read would not comment on 
such a deal, saying only ``there needs to be a sentence that is 
just and makes sense to everyone involved, including the 
community,'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Heritage High, Principal Lowell Biddy said the first day was  
``extremely smooth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We just had a normal day,'' Biddy said.

<HEADLINE> Navy May Restore Tie With Tailhook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy is taking tentative steps to restore  
official ties with the Tailhook Association, the naval aviator's 
booster organization whose sordid 1991 Las Vegas convention 
produced a major sex-harassment scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy Secretary Richard Danzig on Tuesday announced that he is  
sending a three-member Navy delegation to this year's Tailhook 
Association convention, scheduled for Aug. 19-20 in Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	He held out the offer of ``possible resumption of support'' for  
the organization in a letter to Tailhook president Lonny K. 
McClung. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you know, the shameful events at the Tailhook convention in  
1991 led to a withdrawal of our support for the Tailhook 
Association,'' Danzig wrote. ``Over the past eight years, however, 
the association has taken a number of constructive steps that 
warrant a review of its status.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Female officers were groped by aviators attending parties during  
a three-day aviator's conference at the Las Vegas Hilton hotel in 
September 1991. The Defense Department inspector general implicated 
117 officers for sexual assault, indecent exposure and other acts, 
and faulted the Navy's leaders for failing to stop the behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode triggered the resignation of Navy Secretary H.  
Lawrence Garrett and the early retirement of Adm. Frank B. Kelso, 
then the chief of naval operations. It also led to lawsuits, 
multiple investigations and changes in the Navy -- including more 
emphasis on ethics and sexual harassment awareness and an opening 
of more aviation opportunities for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy spokesman Cmdr. Brian Cullin said, ``This is a cautionary  
act, not an embrace. ... But it is an action taken based on the 
progress we have seen the Tailhook Association has taken over the 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman also noted ``dramatic changes in the Navy'' since  
the episode, including the introduction of women combat pilots who 
fly aircraft off carriers. ``Our profile has changed,'' Cullin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Navy, there are now 238 women pilots and 103  
women flight officers. The Navy has 50,209 active-duty women and 
327,889 active-duty men. 
</P>
<P>
	Danzig said the Navy delegation that would attend the next  
Tailhook convention would consist of Carolyn Becraft, assistant 
Navy secretary for manpower and reserve affairs; Vice Admiral Mike 
Bowman, commander of U.S. Naval Forces, U.S. Pacific Fleet; and Lt. 
Gen. John Rhodes of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command. 
</P>
<P>
	Danzig commended the organization for taking steps to improve  
its image, including adopting resolutions condemning harassment and 
honoring the ``services and sacrifices of all those who are ... a 
part of carrier-based aviation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To determine whether official support of the association is  
now warranted, I need to assess the extent to which the association 
lives by these principles,'' Danzig said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that in order to earn back the Navy's support, Tailhook  
would have to show that it could focus on ``professional challenges 
and opportunities facing naval aviation,'' support all men and 
women in the carrier aviation community and ``take all reasonable 
steps'' to prevent other episodes of misconduct.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Told: Shed Arrogance, Weight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Fat and arrogant.  
</P>
<P>
	That's the assessment of American major league umpires made by a  
Japanese ump who recently suspended himself for three games for 
blowing a call. 
</P>
<P>
	``Major league umpires are stubborn, and they're spiritually  
strong,'' umpire Toshiyuki Tanaka said. ``For me, it's about 
staying humble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 59-year-old Tanaka, a 35-year umpiring veteran, said he  
respects the pride that major league umps have in their work, but 
believes they have overstepped their bounds in their current labor 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't realize that there are plenty of guys out there who  
can do their job,'' he said. ``Handing in resignations -- that's 
exactly what the league wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a bid to force an early start to negotiating a new contract,  
major league umpires announced last month that they would quit en 
masse on Sept. 2. That plan collapsed after major league baseball 
accepted 22 of the resignations and hired 25 new umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to shedding their arrogance, Tanaka suggests U.S.  
umpires lose some weight as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't move. They're too fat,'' said Tanaka, a muscular  
6-foot-tall man who jogs daily and has little flab, weighing 210 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nation where harmony is valued over conflict, the attitude  
of Japanese umpires like Tanaka stands in stark contrast to the 
American men in blue. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese umpires patiently endure insults from managers that  
major league umps would never tolerate. They wouldn't dare to call 
strikes with the trademark howl of their American cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with their assertive U.S. counterparts, Japanese  
umpires are almost apologetic. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanaka's fateful decision came during a game between the Yomiuri  
Giants and the league-leading Chunichi Dragons on July 22. 
</P>
<P>
	In the bottom of the eighth, Giants slugger Domingo Martinez hit  
a fly ball to right. Dragons outfielder Kazuki Inoue ran in to make 
the catch, his glove touching the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanaka, at first base, thought the ball popped out of Inoue's  
glove onto the grass before he scooped it up, and he awarded 
Martinez a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Pandemonium broke out, with Inoue and Dragons manager Seinichi  
Hoshino protesting vigorously. Even usually reserved TV announcers 
questioned the call, which was replayed over and over in slow 
motion to viewers at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanaka did not reverse his call on the spot, and the Dragons  
went on to win 11-2. But when he later reviewed a videotape of the 
play, the truth was clear, and he voluntarily sat out for three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``An umpire's job is about confidence. But being humble and  
doing your best everyday are just as important to improve your 
skills,'' Tanaka said. ``There's no progress if you can't doubt 
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of humility hasn't won Japanese umpires much respect.  
Batters and catchers here routinely curse what they think is a 
wrongly called strike. At least several times each season, players 
and managers rush out of the dugout to hurl shouts in the umpire's 
face, sometimes pushing him. 
</P>
<P>
	The only American to work as an umpire in Japan on a  
professional level, Mike DiMuro, lasted only a few months in 1997, 
quitting in disgust after being poked in the chest by a batter over 
a strike call. He is one of the minor league umpires who has been 
hired as a replacement in the labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	While Japanese umpires have to put up with abuse, fans and  
players complain that bad calls are on the increase. The 
high-profile Central League, where Tanaka works, even planned a 
special meeting this week to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel a need to uplift umpires' skills because of a series  
of troubles over calls,'' league spokesman Hideo Okoshi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanaka doesn't expect his misjudged call to undermine his  
authority over players. But he is prepared to lose his job at the 
end of the season, and he has already lost a great deal of sleep 
over it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really a thankless job. There's relief when one day  
goes by, but then you have to worry about the next day,'' he said. 
``It's impossible to hit a home run as an umpire.''

<HEADLINE> Colts Sign Walsh As Backup QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts signed veteran  
quarterback Steve Walsh Wednesday and released quarterback Stoney 
Case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts are the sixth NFL team for Walsh, who was drafted by  
Dallas in the 1989 supplemental draft, traded to New Orleans in 
1990 and later played for Chicago, St. Louis and Tampa Bay. The 
6-foot-3, 215-pounder said he signed a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked real good in the workout yesterday, better than I  
anticipated,'' coach Jim Mora said of Walsh, who had his first 
training camp practice Wednesday. ``I'm familiar with Steve. ... 
He's won, he's taken teams to the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Case had played four seasons in Arizona and appeared of four  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh has played in only 65 games during his NFL career with 38  
starts. He completed 9-of-19 passes in five games for Tampa Bay 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took us to the playoffs in 1990,'' said Mora, who was his  
coach in New Orleans. ``He took Chicago to the playoffs in 1994. 
He's smart, he'll pick things up quickly. He won't require a lot of 
reps during the season. ... He'll be able to go in and still play 
and know what he is doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Case was signed to a $2 million contract that included a  
$500,000 signing bonus as an unrestricted free agent on March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were not entirely pleased with the situation behind  
Peyton,'' said Mora, who saw the rookie take every snap last 
season. ``I believe this has upgraded us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Case had been listed as the third quarterback on the team's  
depth chart. He completed 5-of-6 passes in Saturday's 9-6 loss at 
Chicago, accumulating 44 yards. He also had the team's longest run 
of the game, a 16-yard effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stoney did not progress like we hoped, and thought he would,''  
Mora said. ``It was close between him and Kelly Holcomb. ... Kelly 
had a little advantage because he'd been in our system before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mora was uncertain if Walsh would play when the Colts host  
Cincinnati on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be very tough. It would be very limited from the  
standpoint of what plays we would call with him in there,'' Mora 
said. ``It's not an easy offense to learn.''

<HEADLINE> A Key Fight Over Affirmative Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- When new students arrive at the  
University of Michigan in a few weeks, about a quarter of them will 
be minorities -- a freshman class selected through the kind of 
race-based admissions system despised by opponents of affirmative 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Two lawsuits against Michigan seek to eliminate race from the  
admissions process. While similar struggles have played out in 
other states -- California, Texas and Washington -- experts say the 
fight in Michigan could be decisive for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a case that very well may go up to the Supreme Court,''  
said Gary Orfield, a Harvard University professor of education and 
social policy. ``It has every possibility of being truly 
historic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan may become the bellwether because of the novel and  
aggressive nature of its defense: The university has spent $3 
million summoning statistical evidence to prove that racial 
diversity is indispensable to its educational mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of these cases have not involved that kind of organized  
evidence or development,'' Orfield said. ``I think the University 
of Michigan has really turned some of its resources into looking at 
its own racial issues and the consequences of its own politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The studies commissioned by the school show that affirmative  
action doesn't just help minorities gain admission; diversity, the 
school contends, builds better citizens out of all its graduates 
and improves learning. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not simply a policy that some universities have  
adopted because they like it,'' said university President Lee 
Bollinger. ``This is profoundly connected to the sense of what a 
modern education is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trials had been scheduled in the fall, thought a court decision  
Tuesday allowing some minority students to join the lawsuit was 
expected to cause a delay. 
</P>
<P>
	When the plaintiffs in the case applied in 1995 and 1996,  
Michigan used a grid that sorted students by grades and test 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
	The school can afford to be selective. In 1997, it received  
13,000 applications for 3,000 slots in the undergraduate college. 
The law school -- the target of the second lawsuit -- gets more than 
3,000 applications for about 340 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiff Jennifer Gratz applied in 1996 with a 3.8 high school  
grade-point average and a score of 25 out of 36 on the ACT entrance 
exam. The grid suggested Gratz's application be postponed, while 
black, Hispanic and American Indian students in the same range were 
recommended for admission. The school eventually denied her 
application. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan later changed its system, and now grades an applicant's  
record on a 150-point scale. Minority students get 20 points just 
for their race -- equal to raising their grades a full letter on the 
traditional 4-point scale. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1978 Supreme Court ruling, universities may not use  
racial quotas, but they may consider race as a factor when 
selecting students. 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Individual Rights, a Washington-based  
organization guiding the lawsuits, argues that Michigan's 
admissions system is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the Constitution permits them to do is achieve  
intellectual diversity,'' said Terence Pell, senior counsel for the 
group. ``Part of that is appreciating people from different points 
of view. 
</P>
<P>
	``No court has ever said racial diversity by itself is connected  
with the mission of a university.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CIR is known for its handling of the Cheryl Hopwood case, a  
white woman who was denied admission to the University of Texas Law 
School. In 1996, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals barred 
consideration of race in admissions at Texas. The Supreme Court 
declined to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority admissions have since declined, according to a Texas  
report, as they did in California after a voter initiative there 
banned the use of race in admissions. In Washington, where voters 
banned the use of race last fall, minority applications are down 8 
percent at the University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan says it uses race in a way that's fair and legal, and  
contends diversity would be lost if race were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan professor Patricia Gurin analyzed data from about  
10,000 students and concluded that those who were exposed to more 
diversity on campus do better in life and were more likely to work 
and live in integrated settings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Majority and minority individuals whose childhood experiences  
take place in schools and neighborhoods that are largely segregated 
are likely to lead their adult lives in largely segregated ... 
settings,'' Gurin wrote. ``College is a uniquely opportune time to 
disrupt this pattern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alaina Beverly says she's benefited from the policies. A  
22-year-old black law student from Okemos, Beverly said Michigan 
needed affirmative action to get students with a wider range of 
viewpoints and experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think white people are being discriminated against  
with these policies,'' she said. ``I think minorities are getting a 
chance to show their qualifications beyond raw numbers and raw test 
scores.''

<HEADLINE> Plummer Takes Charge of Cardinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- Stronger and far wiser in the ways of  
the west coast offense, Jake Plummer enters his third NFL season at 
ease with the perception that he will be one of the game's next 
great quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be playing quarterback if I didn't want to deal  
with it and have the attention,'' Plummer said as the Arizona 
Cardinals prepared for their preseason opener at Denver Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer figures to play no more than one quarter in that game,  
but he looks forward to the challenge of facing the two-time Super 
Bowl champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wish John Elway was still playing,'' Plummer said,  
``because I wanted to play against him at least once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer is one of Elway's most likely successors. In just his  
second NFL season, Plummer lifted the Cardinals to the playoffs for 
the first time in 16 years and their first playoff victory since 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, he is one of the game's most prolific comeback  
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 26 regular-season games, Plummer has rallied the  
Cardinals to a victory or tie from a fourth-quarter deficit nine 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer and offensive coordinator Marc Trestman are entering  
their second season together. It will make a world of difference, 
Trestman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're probably 70 percent better at this time than we were a  
year ago,'' Trestman said. ``He's been through it. We understand 
each other. There's a comfort level in our relationship and how we 
work together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer admits he was lost a year ago trying to grasp the  
intricacies of Trestman's multi-formation west coast offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a whole different ball game out here this year,'' Plummer  
said. ``I know the plays so I can concentrate on reading the 
defenses. I think that will help with the offense, because we're 
going to move the ball. That's what this offense is all about, move 
the chains and move the chains and wait for the big one to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Never a rocket-armed quarterbacks, Plummer has strengthened  
himself noticeably with off-season work in the weight room. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it puts a little extra zip on the ball,'' Plummer  
said. ``I feel strong. I feel healthy. I'm not as tired as I was 
last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trestman said people forget that Plummer is just 24 years old.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are going to be ups and downs,'' Trestman said. ``Jake  
is still a young player. We knew he was going to be good. We didn't 
know how soon. At the end of last year, he set a high standard for 
himself, and there's still room for improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly, Plummer needs to learn to do less, Trestman said.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I would like to see Jake do is try to take some weight  
off his shoulders and distribute it to some of the other players. 
We've got good players around him. By doing that, he won't put it 
all on himself every moment of each game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the departure of Larry Centers, Lomas Brown and Jamir  
Miller, Plummer is filling a leadership vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's a little more poised,'' said wide receiver Frank  
Sanders. ``He's still confident. He still has the heart and the 
fire to want to win, and he wants to make plays. He's definitely 
shown this team he's in charge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $29.7 million contract he signed last season, including an  
NFL record $15 million signing bonus, seems to have had little 
effect. Plummer is as casual and unassuming as ever. With a fishing 
hat pulled over his head and often a day's growth of beard, he's 
hardly recognizable as he slouches through the pine trees of the 
Northern Arizona University campus. 
</P>
<P>
	On the practice field, though, he is the unmatched star who  
willingly signs autograph after autograph for fans, many of whom 
are wearing jerseys that bear his No. 16. He patiently has signed 
his name day after day for the same young boy who intercepts him 
outside the dining hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, you've only got 20 of them at home,'' he said. ``You  
must really cherish them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coaches just shake their head at Plummer's attitude.  
</P>
<P>
	``His ability to handle the notoriety and the pressure and still  
maintain his focus,'' Trestman said, ``it's unbelievable.''

<HEADLINE> History To Repeat at Woodstock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHEL, N.Y. (AP) -- The heady idealism of Woodstock rose from  
the mud of this upstate hamlet 30 years ago, only to crash in the 
flames of July's anniversary concert. 
</P>
<P>
	But now some veteran artists from the original 1969 show are  
returning to give peace another chance. 
</P>
<P>
	David Crosby, Richie Havens and seven other '60s stalwarts will  
strum and sing on Max Yasgur's old farm on Aug. 15, this time as 
part of a nostalgia-tinged reunion. The modest one-day festival 
kicks off in the shadow of the far larger official Woodstock '99 
festival held in Rome, N.Y. in July. But given that Woodstock '99 
ended notoriously with fires and rioting, some veteran performers 
feel they can set a few things right. 
</P>
<P>
	``All over the world people know about Woodstock. It's just too  
bad it reflects this other stuff,'' said Rick Danko, the former 
bassist with The Band. Danko will return to Bethel with his old 
Band-mate, Garth Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything is going to restore it to something that isn't  
advocating violence and stupidity, that will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, maybe.  
</P>
<P>
	``A Day in the Garden'' looks to be a far cry from the  
counterculture mega-event that drew 400,000 people here for three 
days in August 1969. Many of the concert's top draws are dead (Jimi 
Hendrix, Janis Joplin) or disbanded (The Who, Grateful Dead). Nor 
will this show be heavy on hype and youth-oriented acts, as were 
the official Woodstock anniversary concerts held in Saugerties in 
1994 and Rome this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Day in the Garden'' figures to be more like your parents'  
Woodstock, with gray-haired acts whose names might draw blank 
stares from latter-day Woodstock moshers. Others in the lineup are 
Johnny Winter, Melanie, Country Joe McDonald and Arlo Guthrie. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the artists have remained friendly over the decades, and  
the concert has the feel of old buddies getting together. Some of 
the artists, like Guthrie and Crosby, are even performing with 
their kids this time around. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be a little nostalgic, obviously,'' Guthrie  
said. ``There's a lot of aspects of this to me personally that mean 
more than just going to another gig.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guthrie fondly recalled 1969 as the year he was married and  
appeared in a movie based on his signature song, ``Alice's 
Restaurant.'' And, of course, it was the year the 22-year-old with 
a cloud of dark scraggly hair played at Woodstock for a huge crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was absolutely devastating to me. I don't know how I  
breathed,'' Guthrie said. ``It was totally bizarre to see that many 
people in that place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danko remembered flying in a helicopter for the first time and  
being stunned during its descent by the sheer mass of people 
sitting on the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
	While Danko never again set foot on the field 80 miles northwest  
of New York City, Guthrie and some other veterans have come back. 
Those visits often resulted in impromptu anniversary performances 
for the tie-dyed masses who annually converged on the site. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference this time is that the rolling field now has a  
'90s makeover complete with groomed grass and a perimeter fence. 
This concert is a regulated event, with advance tickets selling for 
$19.69 (get it?) each. 
</P>
<P>
	A local businessman, Alan Gerry, recently bought the land and is  
developing it into a year-round entertainment attraction to tap 
into Woodstock's cultural cachet. 
</P>
<P>
	The upgraded site made its debut last August with a three-day  
concert featuring a few Woodstock alums like Pete Townshend along 
with contemporary acts such as the Goo Dolls. That concert was also 
called ``A Day in the Garden,'' a lyrical reference to the Joni 
Mitchell's song, ``Woodstock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promoters said they drew 76,000 people over three days last  
August, with the largest crowd drawn to the contemporary acts on 
the last day. There is no early word on ticket sales for this 
year's one-day show, although it has piqued the interest of at 
least some former flower children. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say you can't go home again, but this is going to be like  
getting a Western Union from home,'' said Duke Devlin, a reveler at 
the original show who has worked at each successive concert. 
</P>
<P>
	While long-term development plans for the site are being worked  
out, it still plays host to musical events. Teen pop queen Britney 
Spears played a show in July, and Reba McEntire headlines a country 
lineup Aug. 14.

<HEADLINE> Dow Surges 132.65 to 10,787.80 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks made their broadest, sharpest gains of  
August today as the Federal Reserve offered calming words on the 
growth of the U.S. economy and Cisco Systems provided proof of 
strong corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 132.65 points at 10,787.80. The blue-chips gained 
momentum over the course of the session, breaking a recent pattern 
of starting strong only to sputter late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite  
index had its biggest point gain since June 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market was ripe for a minor rally following a  
slump that has left every major market index well below the lofty 
records reached in mid-July. But most Wall Street players said the 
advance was fragile. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a nervous market and will continue to be for a  
while,'' said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. 
in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Many believe the market will have trouble sustaining gains at  
least until Aug. 24, when Fed policy-makers hold their next meeting 
to set interest rates. Today, the Fed offered some reassurance, 
saying its latest economic survey turned up little evidence of 
rising inflation in general. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Fed survey, dubbed the ``beige book,'' did note  
developments that could lead to increased inflationary pressures, 
most notably widespread labor shortages and scattered reports of 
higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed, which raised rates slightly on June 30, has clearly  
signaled its willingness to raise short-term interest rates for a 
second time this year, hoping to prevent inflation from creeping 
into the robust U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of economic news for people to look at in  
advance of the next meeting,'' Berman said. ``Under different 
circumstances, the beige book might not attract a lot of attention, 
but investors are looking for guidance on what exactly the Fed 
plans to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Growing fears of a third rate hike this fall have hurt stocks  
and bonds alike. Plummeting bond prices have pushed up the yield on 
the 30-year Treasury bond closer to 6.25 percent, leaving long-term 
borrowing costs at the highest level in nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
	For some investors, rising bond yields have presented an  
attractive alternative to returns on volatile stocks. Other stock 
investors are unsettled that an uptrend in interest rates will cut 
into corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco helped spark buying today. Late Tuesday, the company  
reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts' estimates, 
rounding out a fiscal year in which revenues grew 43 percent and 
operating profits improved 35 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Kaltbaum, chief technical analyst at J.W. Genesis said  
Cisco's strength was an encouraging sign of renewed leadership by 
well-established technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
	A wave of deals in the aluminum industry also moved the market.  
Early today, Alusuisse-Lonza (Algroup) of Switzerland, Pechiney of 
France and Alcan Aluminium of Canada said they would merge, passing 
U.S.-based Alcoa as the world leader in aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alcoa had a surprise of its own, going public with an offer  
to buy No. 3 Reynolds Metal Co. for $5.6 billion in cash and stock. 
Reynolds soared, and Alcoa, a Dow component, rose for much of the 
day, then slipped slightly at the close. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Alcan and Pechiney rose, although Algroup shares  
slipped on the Zurich stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The market for new stocks was mixed today. Shares of video  
rental chain Blockbuster were priced at 15 and barely budged. 
</P>
<P>
	But Red Hat, a seller of Linux software, saw its shares soar  
from an offering price of 14 to top 50. 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
rose 20.50 to 1,301.93, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 74.33 
to 2,564.44. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,865 up, 1,171 down and 526 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 782.80 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
831.64 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 6.85 to 610.22, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 6.60 to 777.37. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.61 to 426.43.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Gets 60 Years for Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A suspect in the disappearance of Madalyn  
Murray O'Hair has been sentenced to 60 years in prison for skimming 
more than $50,000 from her family's atheist organization. 
</P>
<P>
	David Waters, a three-time felon, had been on probation for that  
charge since 1995. He landed back in court after federal 
authorities found 119 rounds of handgun ammunition in his Austin 
apartment in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew what he was facing if he messed up. He went ahead and  
messed up and the judge gave an appropriate punishment,'' said 
Assistant District Attorney Gregg Cox, who asked for a life 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters, 52, who was sentenced Wednesday, also faces sentencing  
on federal firearms charges on Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities suspect Waters orchestrated the 1995  
disappearance of Ms. O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and adopted 
daughter Robin Murray O'Hair. No charges have been filed in that 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters' attorney, Patrick Ganne, accused federal authorities of  
trying to punish Waters for Ms. O'Hair's slaying without having to 
bring him to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. O' Hair and her two adult children vanished from San  
Antonio along with $500,000 in gold coins authorities questioned 
whether they were victims of foul play or had merely run off with 
their organization's money. Others suggested that Ms. O'Hair, who 
was 77 and ailing, had gone off to die quietly so Christians 
wouldn't pray over her. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has shown that she's dead and there is every indication  
that she tried to make her escape and get away and transferred 
money to other countries,'' Ganne said. ``We don't know what 
happened.''

<HEADLINE> Spurs Pick Plan for $175M Arena  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The NBA champion San Antonio Spurs selected a  
proposal Wednesday to build a $175 million taxpayer-funded arena on 
the grounds of the county-owned Freeman Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials had pushed for a $203 million arena complex next  
to the downtown Alamodome, where the Spurs now play. 
</P>
<P>
	But Spurs chairman Peter Holt, after morning meetings with both  
sides, said team investors opted for Bexar County's plan to build 
the arena a few miles east of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Spurs now behind the county offer, efforts will proceed  
toward an election to secure voters' approval for arena funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, who complain their operation is unprofitable in the  
Alamodome and want more luxury suites, have made no commitment 
toward helping to fund the new arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The current plan calls for the project to be paid for with hotel  
and rental-car taxes. The Spurs would manage the arena and get 
naming rights.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Filings Raise Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department used its final  
arguments in the Microsoft trial to present its most comprehensive 
rebuttal yet to claims that the $10 billion sale of the software 
giant's rival, Netscape Communication Corp., undermines the 
government's antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government and 19 states suing Microsoft devoted an  
entire section of their 776-page court filing Tuesday to deflect 
criticisms that Netscape's purchase by America Online Inc. makes 
the antitrust claims moot. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said the sale proved that competition was healthy in  
the high-tech industry, but the government argues that Netscape 
Communication Corp.'s purchase merely illustrates the effects of 
Microsoft's aggressive, predatory tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL's acquisition of Netscape itself evidences the harm to  
Netscape's browser business caused by Microsoft's predatory 
campaign,'' the government said. ``Netscape was acquired because it 
had been damaged by Microsoft's campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is considering  
the case without a jury, will base his verdict on the arguments, 
along with those filed by Microsoft. Earlier in the trial, Jackson 
said he found AOL's alliance with Netscape as possibly ``a very 
significant change in the playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its 450-page filing, Microsoft repeatedly denied it was a  
monopolist and rejected allegations that it ``has engaged in a 
broad pattern of unlawful conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defending itself against a central claim by the government,  
Microsoft argued that it built its Internet browser software into 
Windows -- its dominant computer operating system -- for free, to 
help consumers use the Web more effectively -- not to force out of 
business Netscape, which was selling similar browser software 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft's actions have produced higher quality Web browsing  
software and operating systems at lower cost to consumers, thereby 
contributing to the explosive growth of the Internet,'' the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also said the government failed to prove it blocked  
Netscape from distributing its Internet software from more than 40 
percent of consumers, a condition Jackson had established in an 
earlier ruling. It also argued that the $10 billion Netscape-AOL 
alliance ``provides new avenues for the widespread distribution of 
Netscape's Web browsing software.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The antitrust lawsuit, the company said in a summary of its  
filing, was ``largely a vehicle for Microsoft's competitors to 
attack Microsoft rather than compete in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lengthy filings largely repeat claims made in earlier legal  
documents and over 76 days of courtroom testimony, but Jackson will 
base the first phase of his two-part verdict -- expected later this 
year -- on these arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the foundation for everything,'' said Rich Gray, an  
antitrust lawyer in San Jose, Calif., who has been following the 
trial closely. ``They're critically important. If (the sides) can't 
tell their story forcefully at this stage, then they're in 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase of the judge's ruling is expected to foreshadow  
the eventual second part of his verdict, which probably will come 
early next year unless the sides settle. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's factual findings also are particularly important  
because appellate courts rarely challenge a trial judge's decisions 
on the facts of a case, but typically focus on his application of 
the law. Experts predict the Microsoft case to wind through appeals 
courts for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's factual findings will be ``much more difficult for  
Microsoft to attack on appeal,'' said Robert Taylor, another 
antitrust lawyer in California's Silicon Valley.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department plans to seek  
suggestions for implementing ``re-entry'' courts that would augment 
the parole system by having state judges oversee the return of 
inmates to society. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the American Bar Association in Atlanta on Tuesday,  
Attorney General Janet Reno suggested that re-entry courts could be 
modeled on the special local drug courts that were successful 
during her tenure as a Miami prosecutor -- a concept that has spread 
to several other cities 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said that unless inmates are brought ``back to our  
communities with a chance of success, the criminal justice system 
is going to fail again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many states are interested in the program and Nevada will begin  
having judges oversee the release of prisoners in October, said 
Jeremy Travis, director of the National Institute of Justice, the 
Justice Department's research group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our role would be to watch states experimenting with this idea  
and learning from them,'' Travis said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The population in state prisons now totals 1.2 million, four  
times what it was in 1980, and with more prisoners being released, 
parole violations also are on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the growth now in state prisons is not because of  
people committing new crimes, but parolees being returned to 
prison,'' Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many states have abolished or limited parole in recent years.  
</P>
<P>
	Re-entry courts could better manage parolees and reduce the  
criminal behavior that would send them back behind bars, he 
suggested. Judges would see parolees much more frequently and have 
more hands-on control, using coercion and support to keep them out 
of trouble, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea draws inspiration from ``problem-solving courts'' such  
as those for family violence and drug offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Those courts have focused on providing rehabilitative programs  
to treat defendants and giving judges the authority to establish 
criteria and incentives for avoiding prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much more interactive between judge and offender,''  
Travis said, adding that judges can hold people accountable in ways 
that a parole officer with a caseload of 500 people cannot. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis said judges have the legal authority to put people in  
jail and the moral authority to instruct inmates on being 
law-abiding citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	``People react differently if they have to explain their  
behavior to a judge in a courtroom than they would explaining their 
behavior over the phone to a parole officer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Justice Department official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said Reno has ``expressed strong interest'' in also 
exploring the use of re-entry courts on the federal level.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Democrats Set Delegate Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California Democrats have spelled out  
precisely how many gays, lesbians, disabled people and minorities 
should serve as delegates to the party's national convention, 
drawing criticism from Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	State party officials sent a memo to 2,500 activists last week,  
laying out what they called goals for the how the 434-member 
delegation should look. In August 2000 the delegates will gather in 
Los Angeles to choose the Democratic presidential nominee, and the 
party is eager to showcase its diversity before a television 
audience of millions. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the memo, 26 percent of delegates should be  
Hispanic, 16 percent black, 10 percent disabled, 9 percent 
Asian-Pacific Islander, 5 percent gay, 5 percent lesbian and 1 
percent Indian. Half should be men, and half women, the party said. 
</P>
<P>
	``California has changed, and the California Democratic Party  
has kept up with it,'' said Bob Mulholland, a party spokesman who 
drafted the directive. ``It's certainly a plus to have on national 
TV a delegation that looks like America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic National Committee rules require states to study and  
analyze the Democratic Party electorate and develop goals for their 
delegations that reflect what they find, DNC spokeswoman Jenny 
Backus said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of that is to try and ensure the people who are  
choosing our nominees and going to the national convention reflect 
the kind of citizens who are voting for us,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Backus said California's goals go beyond what the DNC calls for  
and beyond what most other states seek to achieve in their delegate 
composition targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``California's goals reflect the diversity of the state's  
population,'' she said. ``California takes this very seriously, and 
has made it a priority for their delegate-selection plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California Democratic Party officials formulated their goals  
based on the state's population and voter exit polls, Mulholland 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The party's strong affirmative-action push follows a move by the  
state's top Democrat, Gov. Gray Davis, that struck a blow against 
such preferences. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis vetoed a bill last month that would have declared outreach  
programs for minorities and women permissible despite Proposition 
209, a voter-approved ban on preferential treatment by government 
based on race or gender. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland said it was unfair to link or compare the party's  
affirmative action push to the veto by Davis, who will be one of 
the convention delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a political party, and as we build our delegation, we  
ought to have the most diversified delegation,'' Mulholland said. 
``The year 2000 is a unique case -- we're going to get lots of TV 
coverage'' at the nominating convention. 
</P>
<P>
	That image is important, because it will convey inclusiveness to  
voters watching the convention through the news media, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans derided the targets as tokenism.  
</P>
<P>
	The Republican Party has no such mandate for diversity, said  
Stuart DeVeaux, spokesman for the state GOP and a former Republican 
National Committee official. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are an inclusive party,'' DeVeaux said. ``If you're a white  
male and you've done nothing wrong, you're discriminated against by 
the Democratic Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Replied Mulholland: ``Our delegation ... will reflect almost  
every community in California, and that will bode well for 
candidates in fall elections. ... This will be day and night 
compared to the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.''

<HEADLINE> Survivor of Bataan Death March Sues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A survivor of the Bataan Death March has sued  
a Japanese company, saying he was beaten by employees of Mitsui &AMP; 
Co. Ltd. and forced to work as a slave after being captured during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit brought by Lester Tenney, 79, of San Diego is the  
first filed under a new California law that allows victims of slave 
labor to sue multinational corporations in state courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want them to apologize. I want them to say to the world,  
'We're sorry for what we did,''' said Tenney, a retired Arizona 
State University finance professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsui forced American POWs to work in a coal mine considered  
too unsafe for Japanese workers, Tenney said outside the Superior 
Court building where the suit was filed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Each day, Japanese soldiers escorted POWs to the mine near  
Nagasaki, where Mitsui employees beat and tormented the Americans 
as they worked, Tenney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.  
</P>
<P>
	Defendants include Mitsui and several subsidiaries of the  
Tokyo-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsui, one of Japan's largest international trading companies,  
is involved in a wide range of businesses, including mining, 
insurance, shipping and commodities trading. The company reported 
$131 billion in revenue during fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Hira Bayashi, spokesman for Mitsui USA, wouldn't comment. He  
referred calls to the parent company's Tokyo headquarters, which 
was closed for the day by the time the lawsuit was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The California law, which took effect in July, was written to  
apply to foreign companies that profited from slave labor during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenney was taken prisoner in 1942 in the Philippines, where he  
had been deployed with his Illinois National Guard tank battalion. 
He survived the Bataan Death March, a 60-mile trek to a prison camp 
in the Philippines in which some 16,000 American and Filipino 
troops died. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenney escaped to join an Allied guerrilla group before being  
recaptured and shipped with other POWs to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	POWs worked daily without breaks and were given just enough food  
to stay alive. Tenney said his weight dropped from 185 pounds to 
101.

<HEADLINE> Security Tight at Maccabi Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Officers stood watch Wednesday as hundreds  
of young Jewish athletes competed in an Olympic-style event, one of 
many instances around the nation of tightened security after 
Tuesday's shootings near Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	About 700 teen-agers from Canada, Israel, Mexico and 15 U.S.  
cities were in Columbus to take part in the Maccabi Youth Games, a 
five-day, four-city event ending Thursday. Some participants said 
the wounding of youngsters at a Jewish Community Center made them 
nervous even though it was 2,000 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows you that you never know what can happen,'' said  
Hallie Blazar, 15, of Dayton. ``It's sad that something like this 
could happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Dinkin, executive director of the Jewish Community Center  
in Columbus, one of the hosts for the games, said an extra off-duty 
police officer has been added as a precaution because of the 
California violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Two officers stood watch over a tennis match in Wolfe Park, east  
of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me feel more comfortable,'' said Boris Dvorkin, 14,  
of Bexley, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Meyer of Bexley, who is providing housing to two athletes  
from Washington, D.C., said they asked about the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were concerned about what had happened and were  
nervous,'' she said. ``They saw the security here and thought that 
was great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opening ceremonies Sunday at Ohio State University's Value City  
Arena featured a tribute to 11 Israeli athletes who were killed at 
the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a lot of discussion out of all of this,'' said  
Aaron Friedberg of the Columbus area. ``Hopefully with the extra 
security, nothing will happen here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke before Wednesday's news that Buford O'Neal Furrow, the  
suspect in Tuesday's shootings, had surrendered in Las Vegas.

<HEADLINE> FCC Declines Internet Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the Federal Communications  
Commission has declined to open a formal review of access to 
high-speed Internet connections, saying it would slow down the 
process of making those services available to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard, in a letter to state and local  
officials that advise the agency, once again defended the FCC's 
hands-off approach to regulating high-speed Internet services, also 
known as broadband, and particularly those offered over cable 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	He said by rejecting intervention, the FCC has fostered growth  
in the marketplace with ``impressive results across the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups and some Internet companies have voiced their  
concerns that cable companies will develop a monopoly in delivering 
fast Internet service over their wires. They want government 
regulators to force the cable companies to open their lines to 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FCC has declined to do so, saying that it's too soon to  
determine if any one player has an advantage in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``While some consider cable to have a lead at this time, it is  
premature to conclude either that such a lead will last or that its 
current position amounts to a monopoly,'' Kennard wrote in his 
letter. He noted that only about one million of the 40 million 
Internet users rely on cable Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that FCC policies have helped fuel activity among  
phone, satellite and wireless companies in the race to build their 
own high-speed connections. Competitive pressures have led to 
increased rollouts of digital subscriber line, or DSL, services by 
local phone companies over their networks and at decreasing costs, 
Kennard said. Other companies are looking more seriously into how 
they might offer such high-speed connections using wireless or 
satellite technology, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-member advisory panel of local and state officials had  
recommended that the agency open a formal proceeding on access to 
high-speed Internet service. But Kennard said such a probe ``would 
chill investment in cable modem service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public interest groups said the FCC's policies will lead to a  
closed system that runs contrary to the open nature of the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it especially painful that (the chairman) is telling  
state and local governments what to do and that he is forcing the 
restrictive cable television model down their throats,'' said 
Andrew Schwartzman, president of the public interest law firm the 
Media Access Project. ``The cable industry wants the Internet to be 
just like cable television.''

<HEADLINE> Oakwood Homes CEO To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Struggling manufactured-home builder  
Oakwood Homes Corp. said Wednesday its longtime chief executive 
will retire and that the company is no longer looking for a suitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas St. George, chief executive officer since 1979, will  
retire Sept. 30. President and chief operating officer William G. 
Edwards will be his successor, St. George said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, 55, was founder and president of Destiny Industries  
before Oakwood acquired the Georgia company in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which is the nation's largest retailer of  
manufactured homes, also said it had halted efforts to look for a 
buyer after a succession of poor earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``After extensive deliberations, the Board of Directors believes  
that the interests of the company's shareholders are best served by 
the company and its management focusing on addressing the 
challenges facing the company,'' said Oakwood director Dennis 
Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakwood also said that recent layoffs, attrition and three plant  
closings have eliminated about 1,000 jobs from its 12,500-member 
workforce since April. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has about 400 company-owned stores and 29  
manufacturing plants. It also sells homes through independent 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under St. George's leadership, the company raised revenues from  
$37 million in 1979 to $1.5 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But earnings tumbled last year after Oakwood had to take $45  
million in charges against earnings because more people defaulted 
on its mortgage loans than expected and more people than 
anticipated refinanced their loans.

<HEADLINE> EU Clears KLM-Alitalia Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union antitrust regulators  
Wednesday cleared the long-term alliance between KLM Royal Dutch 
Airlines and Italy's national carrier Alitalia SpA., after the 
airlines agreed to end their monopoly on flights between Amsterdam 
and the Italian hubs at Milan and Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission said KLM and Alitalia pledged to allow  
competitors to operate up to four daily flights on Amsterdam-Rome 
and Amsterdam-Milan routes, including two at peak times, and to 
take other measures to open up competition on the routes. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU executive body said the alliance did not risk creating an  
anticompetitive situation on other routes. 
</P>
<P>
	KLM and Alitalia announced their pact in November, aiming to  
strengthen their position in intercontinental and European routes 
in the face of a series of alliances involving other European 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they won't take equity stakes in each other, the two  
will integrate passenger and cargo operations, sharing sales and 
reservation systems, coordinating routes and combining frequent 
flier programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance is scheduled to come into operation Nov. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	Alitalia and KLM combined hope to get 20 percent of Europe's  
commercial air travel within the next five years. KLM currently has 
about 8 percent, Alitalia 7 percent. The companies say the project 
will generate annual savings worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	KLM and Alitalia also have a code-sharing arrangement with  
Northwest Airlines and are expected to soon enter into a similar 
deal with another U.S. carrier, Continental Airlines.

<HEADLINE> Fed Says Economy Growing Strongly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy is growing strongly with even the  
beleaguered manufacturing sector showing signs of an upturn, the 
Federal Reserve said Wednesday in a new survey of business 
conditions around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	While nearly every region of the country faced labor shortages,  
the Fed said wage pressures did not seem to be accelerating or 
causing widespread pressures on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets took heart from the Fed's lack of alarm about  
inflation. But private economists said the Fed report, known as the 
``beige book'' for the cover's color, did not change their view the 
central bank is getting ready to raise interest rates for a second 
time this year when policy-makers meet Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message from this report is that the economy is doing very  
well with inflation tame, but it is bumping up against capacity 
constraints,'' said Mark Zandi, economist at Regional Financial 
Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``Fed officials are laying the 
groundwork for another rate hike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices, however, posted their biggest gains of the month  
with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 132.65 points to close 
at 10,787.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists noted the numerous warnings the beige book  
included about labor shortages, low inventory stockpiles for 
retailers and supply constraints. They said all of this supported 
their view that the Fed will raise interest rates by another 
quarter-point later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the market took some comfort from this report, I don't  
think it changes anything,'' said Wayne Ayers, chief economist at 
BankBoston. ``Fed officials are returning to a pre-emptive mode and 
basing their policies on what they are fearful they will see down 
the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed raised its target for the federal funds rate, the  
interest that banks charge each other, for the first time in two 
years on June 30, nudging it up by a quarter point to 5 percent. 
That move immediately was followed by a matching increase in banks' 
prime lending rate, the benchmark for millions of consumer and 
business loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations of another rate increase have intensified since  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress last month 
the central bank would move ``promptly and forcefully'' at the 
first signs of price pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Wednesday's rally, stock prices are off sharply from  
their mid-July records and bond prices, always hurt when inflation 
worries increase, have fallen as well, pushing bond yields to their 
highest levels in nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed report, compiled from surveys by the Fed's 12 regional  
banks, said that the economy continued to show strength in late 
July and early August. Consumer demand and housing construction 
remained strong, and various manufacturing sectors shook off the 
effects of the Asian currency crisis, which has cut sharply into 
their export markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Widespread labor shortages persist in virtually every  
district, but there have been only scattered reports of 
acceleration in wages,'' the Fed survey said. ``There are some 
reports of accelerating prices -- largely related to home 
construction -- but there is no evidence of any broad-based pickup 
in consumer price inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston, Cleveland, Dallas and San Francisco Fed districts  
reported strong demand for computer and telecommunications 
equipment while Cleveland and Chicago reported orders for heavy 
trucks, the Fed said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that ``manufacturers in the West -- Dallas and  
San Francisco -- report some pickup in exports to Asia'' but as of 
yet the export rebound was not widespread. The Labor Department 
reported last Friday that employment in manufacturing rose in July 
for only the second time in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed report said that housing construction was continuing at  
a vigorous pace in most districts although there were signs that a 
lack of available building materials and skilled workers was 
limiting growth in many areas. 
</P>
<P>
	While hot and dry weather was causing crop damage in the eastern  
part of the country, the Fed said that crops were generally in good 
shape in other areas.

<HEADLINE> Buffalo News Editor To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo News Editor Murray B. Light is  
retiring next month after 50 years with the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, who is also senior vice president of the newspaper,  
announced his plan to retire Sept. 19 at an employee picnic on 
Sunday. He is the fourth person to hold the top editorial post at 
the newspaper this century. 
</P>
<P>
	``The responsibility of editing a daily metropolitan newspaper  
... involves critical and complex decisions made against stressful 
deadlines. Murray Light never faltered in his courage, principles 
or judgment,'' said the newspaper's President and Publisher 
Stanford Lipsey. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, who will be 73 in October, joined the newspaper as a  
reporter in 1949. A native of the New York City borough of 
Brooklyn, his first newspaper job was as campus correspondent for 
the old Brooklyn Eagle while he attended Brooklyn College. 
</P>

	Arizona's lead in the NL West is starting to seem comfortable.  
</P>
<P>
	With 7 1/2 weeks left in the season, the second-year Diamondbacks  
opened a 6 1/2-game lead, beating the Chicago Cubs 3-1 Tuesday to 
match their win total last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can call us a surprise,'' Arizona outfielder Luis  
Gonzalez said, ``but this is a totally different team than last 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Finley homered to tie the game at 1, and the Diamondbacks  
scored a pair of unearned runs to move ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona (65-49) has won four straight and 16 of 20. The  
Diamondbacks finished last with a 65-97 record last year in their 
inaugural season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been real lucky,'' said Diamondbacks manager Buck  
Showalter, who hadn't been to the postseason since he managed the 
1995 New York Yankees. ``Everybody's pulling in the same 
direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other NL games, it was Florida 8, San Francisco 7 in 12  
innings; Atlanta 6, Houston 4; New York 4, San Diego 3; Cincinnati 
6, Pittsburgh 1; Philadelphia 7, St. Louis 5; Montreal 6, Los 
Angeles 4; and Milwaukee 2, Colorado 1 in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	At Chicago, Greg Swindell (2-0) pitched 3 1-3 shutout innings,  
and Gregg Olson pitched the ninth. Jon Lieber (8-6) is winless in 
six starts since July 10. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Marlins 8, Giants 7    	
</P>

	Dave Berg went 4-for-4 with four RBIs, singling in the 12th for  
his second straight game-winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis Burks homered twice and drove in three runs for the  
visiting Giants, who have lost five of six. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida, which has won five straight, overcame a 6-2 deficit and  
led 7-6 before Bill Mueller's two-out RBI single in the ninth off 
Antonio Alfonseca, who had converted his previous 10 save chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Edmondson (5-6) pitched two hitless innings, and Felix  
Rodriguez (2-3) was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Braves 6, Astros 4    	
</P>
<P>
	Bret Boone drove in four runs and Tom Glavine (10-9) beat  
Houston for the seventh straight time as Atlanta (69-36) tied the 
visiting Astros for the best record in the NL and remained a 
half-game ahead of New York in the NL East. 
</P>
<P>
	Boone broke a 4-all tie in the seventh with a two-run double off  
Shane Reynolds (14-8). Boone and Chipper Jones homered on 
consecutive pitches against Reynolds in the first, and Ryan Klesko 
tied it at 4 with a sixth-inning homer. 
</P>
<P>
	John Rocker got three straight outs for his 24th save.  
</P>
<P>
                          *Mets 4, Padres 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Rickey Henderson scored the tiebreaking run on John Olerud's  
single off Andy Ashby (10-6) in the seventh at Shea Stadium as New 
York stopped a three-game losing streak, its longest since early 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud also had a two-run single and Roger Cedeno tied a Mets  
record with his 58th steal. 
</P>
<P>
	Turk Wendell (3-1) pitched one inning and Armando Benitez got  
his 13th save, sending the Padres to their fourth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Reds 6, Pirates 1    	
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati remained one-half game behind New York in the NL  
wild-card race as Mike Cameron hit a two-run homer to help Juan 
Guzman (1-1) earn his first NL win. Guzman allowed one run and four 
hits in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds (66-45) improved to a season-best 21 games over .500  
and are 38-16 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron's career-high 15th home run came in the third off Pete  
Schourek (3-6) following Brian Johnson's double. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Phillies 7, Cardinals 5    	
</P>
<P>
	Ron Gant crushed his former team again, delivering a three-run  
double in the eighth off Ricky Bottalico (1-6) as Philadelphia 
overcame a three-run deficit. Gant homered twice in a 12-6 loss 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It also spoiled a big night for J.D. Drew, who responded to  
ferocious booing at Veterans Stadium with a triple, two runs, an 
RBI and a stolen base. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire, leading the majors with 44 homers, left in the  
second inning with tightness in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Poole (1-1) got the victory despite allowing Drew's RBI  
single in the eighth. Wayne Gomes pitched the ninth for his 17th 
save. 
</P>

                         *Expos 6, Dodgers 4    	
</P>
<P>
	Vladimir Guerrero homered twice off Ismael Valdes (8-11) and  
drove in four runs at Olympic Stadium as Montreal stretched its 
winning streak to four with its ninth victory in 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Thurman (5-7) allowed four runs in 6 1-3 innings to stop  
the Dodgers' three-game winning streak. Ugueth Urbina got four outs 
for his 26th save.

	Dave Nilsson singled home the winning run in the 10th off Dave  
Veres (2-5), sending visiting Colorado to its fifth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>

leadoff single to left in the seventh. Astacio allowed an unearned 
run and two hits in nine innings, striking out nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocky Coppinger (1-1) pitched two scoreless innings as Milwaukee  
won for just the fifth time in 17 games.

<HEADLINE> Furrow Tied to Hate Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- The white supremacist accused of wounding  
five people at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles has links 
to anti-Semitic hate groups such as the Aryan Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. also had a long relationship with the  
widow of the founder of a violent neo-Nazi group called The Order, 
and subscribes to the Christian Identity religious movement, which 
considers white people superior to Jews and nonwhites. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow, 37, surrendered Wednesday in Las Vegas and allegedly  
told authorities he wanted his act to be ``a wake-up call to 
America to kill Jews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sparsely populated northeastern corner of Washington and the  
panhandle of northern Idaho are hotbeds of the Christian Identity 
religion. Richard Butler, head of the Idaho-based Aryan Nations, 
said Furrow attended a few services at his church about five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what might have motivated Furrow, Butler replied:  
``There's a war of extermination against the white male.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A book found in a van believed abandoned by Furrow, titled ``War  
Cycles, Peace Cycles,'' was written by Richard Kelly Hoskins, ``one 
of the principal ideologues of Christian Identity,'' said Mark 
Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., which 
tracks hate groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hard-line Identity adherents believe that in order for Christ  
to return to Earth, the globe must be swept clean of satanic forces 
-- meaning Jews, homosexuals and a whole laundry list of other 
enemies,'' Potok said. ``So it's a belligerent religion. It's a 
religion that demands that its followers take up the gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also believed to be an Identity member is Eric Rudolph, the man  
accused of the Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic and Atlanta 
Olympic bombings, Potok said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Christian Identity groups also are tied to the recent  
arsons at three synagogues in Sacramento, Calif., the murder of a 
gay couple near Redding, Calif., and many other violent crimes 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow's actions also suggest he is a believer in the Phineas  
Priesthood, a shadowy sect of Christian Identity named for a figure 
in the Old Testament who killed a mixed-faith couple. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is violently opposed to marriages between Jews and  
gentiles and the charging of interest by banks, and seeks the 
extermination of Jews, said Michael Reynolds of the Southern 
Poverty Law Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we see here with Mr. Furrow would be acting out of a  
calling as a Phineas priest,'' Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, four men identified as members of the Phineas  
Priesthood set off a series of bombs at a newspaper office and a 
Planned Parenthood clinic in the Spokane area as covers for two 
bank robberies. Three men were sentenced to life in prison without 
parole and the fourth got 55 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was not a member of the notorious group called The Order,  
a neo-Nazi group that acquired $4 million through bank robberies 
and armored car heists in the early 1980s, but he lived for a while 
with Debbie Mathews, widow of the group's founder, Robert J. 
Mathews. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathews was killed in 1984 in a shootout with federal agents on  
Whidbey Island, north of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, 22 Order members indicted on racketeering charges  
were convicted or pleaded guilty. The group also was involved in 
the 1984 murder of Alan Berg, a Jewish talk-radio host in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of The Order continue to proselytize from prison,  
Reynolds said.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean: N. Korea Missile Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea has finished building an  
upgraded ballistic missile and is weighing the pros and cons of a 
test launch, South Korea's spy chief said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chun Yong-taek, head of the National Intelligence Service, said  
it would take at least three or four weeks for North Korea to 
transport the missile and assemble it for launching at a base on 
the northeast coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Taepodong II missile will have a range of up to 4,163  
miles, which would put Alaska and Hawaii within reach, Chun said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea, which has little contact with the rest of the  
world, reportedly maintains a vigorous defense program despite a 
slumping economy and widespread food shortages. It receives 
millions of dollars in international food aid to help avert famine. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, South Korea and Japan have warned of economic  
and diplomatic penalties if impoverished North Korea, which relies 
heavily on outside aid, goes ahead with the test. But a launch 
would boost the morale of the North Korean military and could 
generate business for its missile technology in the Middle East and 
other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``North Korea appears to be weighing possible economic and  
political losses and gains before deciding whether to go ahead with 
the missile launch,'' Chun told a closed-door Parliamentary 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks were relayed to reporters by Kim In-young, chairman  
of the National Assembly's Information Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, North Korea sent a test rocket sailing over Japan and  
into the Pacific. To counter the threat, South Korea wants to 
expand its missile program and Japan plans to cooperate with the 
United States on missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Chun said North Korea conducted rocket-engine propulsion tests  
on May 5 and May 21 in an apparent attempt to build a more powerful 
rocket to propel its new missile. North Korea has enlarged its 
missile launch platform and renovated its fuel pipeline to the 
platform, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea says it has a sovereign right to test-fire missiles.  
It has told U.S. officials that it wants compensation if they 
suspend its exports of missiles and missile technology to countries 
such as Iran and Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Chun also said North Korea was assembling at least 30 MiG-21  
fighter jets in a plant near Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea bought parts for the planes from a former Soviet  
republic for $40 million, he said. It already has about 320 aging 
MiG-15 and MiG-17 jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Koreas have remained technically at war since the  
1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty. Some 37,000 U.S. 
troops are stationed in South Korea under a defense treaty with the 
Seoul government.

	The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share index finished with

<HEADLINE> Gore Vows To Bolster Farm Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore started his  
latest campaign visit to Iowa today with a warning that the 
nation's farm policy ``is in serious need of improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to cash in on the heavy attention of this weekend's  
Republican straw poll in Ames, Gore planned a two-day trip, hopping 
from small town to small town and focusing on farm issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are, in 1999, two Iowas,'' Gore said. ``There's an Iowa  
with unemployment under 2.6 percent with an economy that's booming 
and a future that's bright. But there's also a farm economy that's 
hurting badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's effort to draw attention to farm issues was echoed by his  
Democratic rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, making 
stops today in Sioux City and at the Dunlap Livestock Auction 
before heading to Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
	At his first event, Gore said the Freedom to Farm Act is badly  
flawed and in need of revision. That measure largely phased out 
traditional farm subsidies while also lifting restrictions on 
planting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some provisions should be kept but others must be changed,''  
Gore said, who also called for ``immediate emergency help'' for 
farmers who are suffering historic low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pledge my support and all out help to Iowans in both of  
those economies,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest visit to Iowa was Gore's 25th as vice president. He's  
a clear front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, 
leading Bradley in most early surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was solidifying that support today by announcing the  
endorsements of a long list of Polk County Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore collected the endorsement of Des Moines Mayor Preston  
Daniels, six Democratic state legislators and other prominent 
elected officials such as Polk County Attorney John Sarcone. 
</P>
<P>
	Those elected officials are important in Democratic  
organizational politics and are veterans in turning out Democratic 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also took note of the most recent shootings in California.  
</P>
<P>
	``My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims  
and the victims themselves,'' Gore said. ``It causes us all to 
pause and reflect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore planned stops in Newton, Marshalltown, Iowa Falls and Mason  
City before ending his campaign day. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine Republicans are competing in the straw poll Saturday that  
has attracted 600 journalists. Both Gore and Bradley are seeking to 
collect a bit of that attention by scheduling a campaign trip 
during the straw poll furor. 
</P>
<P>
	While Republicans are seeking to lure activists to the Ames  
straw poll, both Gore and Bradley were spelling out farm policy 
proposals. Gore was expected to announce farm proposals on Thursday 
and he said he was working with Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, to revamp 
the Freedom to Farm Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to spending the next two days in small  
towns across Iowa,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE>  Salt Lake City Tornado Injures 100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A rare tornado swept through downtown on  
Wednesday, tossing trucks and trees around and shredding tents set 
up for a convention. At least one person was killed and about 100 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It couldn't have picked a worse place,'' said National Weather  
Service meteorologist David Hogan. ``The chance of it hitting a 
city right smack where it did today is pretty slim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power lines were ripped down, roofs torn off, windows blown out  
and shards of glass were everywhere. Helicopters landed in the 
streets to ferry the injured to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt flew over the mile-long path of destruction  
before declaring a state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	The black funnel cloud also damaged the roofs of the Delta  
Center, home of the Utah Jazz basketball team, and the Salt Palace 
Convention Center, which was hosting an outdoor retailers show. 
</P>
<P>
	The streets were littered with shredded tents set up for the  
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Stock of Toronto, a sales representative for a  
rock-climbing company, said he saw the roof of the Delta Center 
lift up when the tornado passed over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It peeled it right back, just like an orange peel,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dan Groff of San Diego, attending the convention, said he saw  
several ``critically injured people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I helped one guy who had a beam fall on him. ... It just  
crushed him,'' Groff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Ellenwood, an employee of an audio-visual company who had  
been setting up a sound system for the convention, looked for a 
place to hide when the twister came. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, 'This is it. We're going to die,''' said Daren  
Loyola, who was working with Ellenwood. ``I thought about my wife 
and my daughter. I tried to run, but the wind was so strong that I 
felt like I was going nowhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one person died and about 100 were injured when the  
tornado struck about 1 p.m., said Ken Connaughton, spokesman for 
Mayor Deedee Corradini. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor said 40 were transported to hospitals, 12 in serious  
or critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first priority is people. We're not sure we have everyone  
out of this tent area near the convention center yet,'' said 
Corradini, adding that dogs were being used to search the debris. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross was sending additional blood supplies to  
Salt Lake hospitals. The organization keeps several hundred pints 
of blood on hand in the city, said Gary Ouellette, chief operating 
officer of the Red Cross' Utah Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Utah Highway Patrol is closing all major routes into  
downtown because of traffic congestions, accidents and debris,'' 
said Connaughton, the mayor's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds gathered on street corners to watch the twister over the  
Mormon church's Salt Lake Temple, which was not damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	A severe thunderstorm watch was issued at 12:48 p.m.; the  
twister touched down about seven minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw what was going on,'' said David Toronto, a  
meteorologist for the National Weather Service. ``But to look at it 
and say there's a tornado and it's going to hit downtown -- we 
didn't have that information because of the rapid development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan said the tornado was classified as a low-end F2, which has  
winds of between 110 mph and 150 mph. ``We're thinking maybe closer 
to 100 mph.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fatalities were the first recorded tornado-related deaths in  
the history of a state that averages two tornados a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we get a `Wizard of Oz' mentality that they occur in  
the middle of nowhere,'' said Tim Shy, a meteorology researcher at 
the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been enough counter examples here recently as  
Oklahoma City, Nashville and downtown Miami got hit in the last few 
years,'' he said.

	Today is Thursday, Aug. 12, the 224th day of 1999. There are 141  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 12, 1867, President Johnson sparked a move to impeach  
him as he defied Congress by suspending Secretary of War Edwin M. 
Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1851, Isaac Singer was granted a patent on his sewing  
machine. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1898, the peace protocol ending the Spanish-American War was  
signed. Hawaii was formally annexed to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1944, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., eldest son of Joseph and Rose  
Fitzgerald Kennedy, was killed with his co-pilot when their 
explosives-laden Navy plane blew up over England. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, the Soviet Union conducted a secret test of its first  
hydrogen bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1960, the first balloon satellite -- the Echo One -- was  
launched by the United States from Cape Canaveral, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, the last American combat ground troops left Vietnam.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, the space shuttle Enterprise passed its first solo  
flight test by taking off atop a Boeing 747, separating, then 
touching down in California's Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, Pope Paul VI, who had died Aug. 6 at age 80, was buried  
in St. Peter's Basilica. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, the world's worst single aircraft disaster killed 520  
people when a Japan Air Lines Boeing 747 on a domestic flight 
crashed into a mountain.

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G Buying Iams for $2.05B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., pursuing its previously  
announced strategy of expanding via acquisition, will buy premium 
pet food maker Iams Co. for $2.05 billion, its biggest purchase 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G hopes to substantially expand Iams' pet food sales in  
foreign markets. Iams' international sales now represent about 30 
percent of the company's total revenues, even though two-thirds of 
the global pet nutrition market exists outside of North America, 
P&AMP;G executives said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of premium pet food account for 10 percent of the $25  
billion global pet food market. The premium segment is the 
fastest-growing chunk of the market and Iams is a leader in that 
category. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which also includes $250 million in debt, is subject  
to U.S. and international regulatory approvals. P&AMP;G expects to 
receive those approvals in the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Iams sells Eukanaba and Iams premium dog and cat foods, dry and  
canned varieties, in 77 countries. It has annual sales of more than 
$800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst William Steele of Banc of America Securities said the  
move was a good one for P&AMP;G. Iams products already are sold 
overseas and P&AMP;G has a strong international marketing operation, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Iams is a premium brand. Procter's got a strong stable of  
premium brands,'' Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
	The privately held Iams employs 2,100 people globally, including  
more than 700 in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G appointed Jeff Ansell, who has been vice president for the  
baby care business in North America, as president of Iams. Clay 
Mathile, chairman and owner of Iams, will continue to play a key 
role in managing the business, P&AMP;G officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of buying Iams exceeds P&AMP;G's $1.85 billion buy in 1997  
of Tambrands Inc., maker of Tampax tampons. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G said in June that acquisitions will be part of the company's  
strategy for increasing its worldwide business. Entering the global 
pet health and nutrition business with Iams is a first step, the 
company said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati-based maker of consumer products, including Tide  
detergent and Pampers diapers, has annual worldwide sales of $38.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of P&AMP;G fell 50 cents to $93.50 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE>  Salt Lake City Tornado Injures 100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A rare tornado swept through downtown on  
Wednesday, tossing trucks and trees around and shredding tents set 
up for a convention. At least one person was killed and about 100 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It couldn't have picked a worse place,'' said National Weather  
Service meteorologist David Hogan. ``The chance of it hitting a 
city right smack where it did today is pretty slim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power lines were ripped down, roofs torn off, windows blown out  
and shards of glass were everywhere. Helicopters landed in the 
streets to ferry the injured to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt flew over the mile-long path of destruction  
before declaring a state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	The black funnel cloud also damaged the roofs of the Delta  
Center, home of the Utah Jazz basketball team, and the Salt Palace 
Convention Center, which was hosting an outdoor retailers show. 
</P>
<P>
	The streets were littered with shredded tents set up for the  
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Stock of Toronto, a sales representative for a  
rock-climbing company, said he saw the roof of the Delta Center 
lift up when the tornado passed over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It peeled it right back, just like an orange peel,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dan Groff of San Diego, attending the convention, said he saw  
several ``critically injured people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I helped one guy who had a beam fall on him. ... It just  
crushed him,'' Groff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Ellenwood, an employee of an audio-visual company who had  
been setting up a sound system for the convention, looked for a 
place to hide when the twister came. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, 'This is it. We're going to die,''' said Daren  
Loyola, who was working with Ellenwood. ``I thought about my wife 
and my daughter. I tried to run, but the wind was so strong that I 
felt like I was going nowhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one person died and about 100 were injured when the  
tornado struck about 1 p.m., said Ken Connaughton, spokesman for 
Mayor Deedee Corradini. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor said 40 were transported to hospitals, 12 in serious  
or critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first priority is people. We're not sure we have everyone  
out of this tent area near the convention center yet,'' said 
Corradini, adding that dogs were being used to search the debris. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross was sending additional blood supplies to  
Salt Lake hospitals. The organization keeps several hundred pints 
of blood on hand in the city, said Gary Ouellette, chief operating 
officer of the Red Cross' Utah Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Utah Highway Patrol is closing all major routes into  
downtown because of traffic congestions, accidents and debris,'' 
said Connaughton, the mayor's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds gathered on street corners to watch the twister over the  
Mormon church's Salt Lake Temple, which was not damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	A severe thunderstorm watch was issued at 12:48 p.m.; the  
twister touched down about seven minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw what was going on,'' said David Toronto, a  
meteorologist for the National Weather Service. ``But to look at it 
and say there's a tornado and it's going to hit downtown -- we 
didn't have that information because of the rapid development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan said the tornado was classified as a low-end F2, which has  
winds of between 110 mph and 150 mph. ``We're thinking maybe closer 
to 100 mph.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fatalities were the first recorded tornado-related deaths in  
the history of a state that averages two tornados a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we get a `Wizard of Oz' mentality that they occur in  
the middle of nowhere,'' said Tim Shy, a meteorology researcher at 
the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been enough counter examples here recently as  
Oklahoma City, Nashville and downtown Miami got hit in the last few 
years,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tornoado Postpones Retailer Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Mother Nature obliterated the largest  
convention of outdoor retailers as a freak tornado tore through the 
city, shredding a display pavilion and postponing the show's 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
	The Outdoor Retailers Summer Market was scheduled to open  
Thursday, but show director Dieter Tremp said there will be at 
least a one-day delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Tremp asked exhibitors whose booths remained intact to help  
those who suffered damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think about the gathering aspect rather than the selling  
aspect,'' he told exhibitors. ``Be prepared to offer your support 
to others tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado kicked up at about 12:45 p.m. and swirled northeast  
through the heart of the city, gouging a trail of rubble, uprooting 
trees, blowing out windows, and knocking over tractor-trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was killed and more than 100 injured.  
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday was meant to be setup day for the 2,500 booths. Some  
850 exhibitors and 17,000 visitors were expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tornado wiped out between 15 percent and 20 percent of  
the exhibits, mostly in a tent-covered pavilion designated for the 
smaller exhibitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Stock of Toronto, a sales representative for a  
rock-climbing company, said he saw the roof of the Delta Center, 
which was hosting the show, lift up when the tornado passed over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It peeled it right back, just like an orange peel,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	It will likely be three days before exhibitors can get into the  
devastated pavilion, Tremp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Simmons, spokesman for show organizers, said exhibitors who  
could least afford the loss were in the pavilion hit the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bank owns it all,'' Simmons said.  
</P>
<P>
	Buyers place orders for their spring products at the show, the  
largest for the $4.5 billion outdoor retail industry, Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
	The show was expected to generate between $15 million and $18  
million for the city, said Richard E. Davis, president and CEO of 
the Salt Lake Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Conventioneers and others staying at the Wyndham Hotel were  
displaced when the tornado blew out windows and forced evacuation. 
Davis said other hotels found space to accommodate those left 
without a room. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Salt Lake City, this is unprecedented. We've never had  
anything like this,'' Davis said.

<HEADLINE> Fed's Regional Assessments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the summaries of the 12 Federal Reserve districts  
reporting on economic conditions in their regions: 
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON: Economic activity continues its expansion. Area  
manufacturers report positive results more consistently than they 
did earlier in the year and retailers say sales growth is still 
strong. Most employers indicate labor markets are tight, but 
general wage increases remain in the 3 percent to 5 percent range. 
With limited exceptions, prices are generally level or down. 
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK: The economy continues to expand, thought at a somewhat  
slower pace than in the last report. There are indications of an 
increase in wage and price pressures in some key sectors. Most 
retailers report that sales retreated to more normal levels in 
July, following exceptionally strong activity throughout the second 
quarter. Manhattan's office market tightened further, but 
commercial real estate appears to have softened in most of the 
outlying suburbs. Housing demand continues to strengthen -- 
especially in the New York City area, where builders and Realtors 
report sharp price increases and cite lack of inventory as the No. 
1 problem. 
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA: Overall business activity advanced moderately in  
July and consumption spending appeared to be robust. Manufacturers 
posted slight gains in shipments and new orders. Retailers reporter 
an increase in total sales from a year ago and a surge in sales of 
summer merchandise. Auto dealers said sales were strong in June, 
although there was a seasonal slowing in July. ... Tourism 
officials indicated that spending for lodging, meals and 
recreational activities in most resort areas so far this season has 
been at its highest level in a decade. Farming has suffered from 
drought conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND: Employment agencies continue to have difficulty  
finding enough bodies to fill the positions available. Agencies 
report that demand for temporary workers is significantly higher 
than this time last year, with administrative assistants and 
computer support personnel in especially short supply. ... Tight 
labor markets have helped push up collective bargaining settlements 
slightly for all industries except mining. ... Low prices and a 
lack of rain have put pressure on the farming sector. 
</P>
<P>
	RICHMOND: Economic activity advanced at a brisk pace in June and  
July. Retailers reported strong sales, particularly of automobiles, 
furniture and apparel. Business services and tourism revenues 
strengthened and manufacturers stepped up production and hiring. At 
financial institutions, higher interest rates slowed mortgage 
lending but had little effect on the pace of commercial lending. 
The real estate sector remained generally strong. Home sales 
advanced at a rapid pace and prime commercial property continued to 
be highly sought. Wages accelerated slightly in the retail sector 
but remained moderate in other sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA: Moderate growth continues and the outlook is positive.  
July sales have been up moderately compared with a year ago and 
this trend is expected to continue through year-end. The tourism 
and hospitality sector continues to post strong numbers. 
Residential construction slowed recently but remains at strong 
levels while commercial construction is slightly ahead of last year 
at this time. Manufacturing has slowed recently but contacts remain 
upbeat about future prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO: Conditions in June and July were characterized by  
modest expansion and very tight labor markets. Consumer spending 
remained strong, led by resilient demand for home-related items and 
light vehicles. Construction activity was again robust, but some 
Realtors and homebuilders lowered their expectations for the coming 
months. Exceptional motor vehicle production, both light vehicles 
and heavy trucks, led a robust manufacturing sector, despite some 
segments continuing to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS: The economy continues to grow at a brisk pace. Most  
contacts report growth in sales and demand. Despite continuing 
difficulties filling some job vacancies, upward wage pressures 
remain at bay. Housing markets are still very strong. ... Despite 
persistent heat and the lack of adequate rainfall in July, crops 
remain in mostly good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS: The pulse of the economy continues strong. With the  
exception of natural resource-based businesses, most district firms 
are having a good year. Retail sales are robust; construction, 
particularly highway building, is healthy; tourism is gaining 
momentum after a slow, weather-induced start. Prices are generally 
stable, with a few exceptions. Signs of wage increases are evident 
as the region's businesses continue to cope with labor shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY: The economy remained healthy in June and early  
July, but growth continued to slow from the brisk rate of last 
year. The recent boom in construction appeared to subside somewhat, 
and manufacturing activity slowed slightly from a strong 
performance in May. Retail activity was flat, although sales were 
still comfortably higher than a year ago. District farmers faced 
cash flow concerns as grain prices continued to fall. Labor markets 
remained very tight, with wage pressures present but largely 
unchanged from previous surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS: In late June and July, economic activity accelerated  
slightly. Demand for manufactured goods and cargo transportation 
services increased. Energy activity increased slightly with more 
gas drilling and less oil drilling. Demand for business and 
financial services was steady and construction and real estate 
activity was unchanged. Agricultural producers reported generally 
good growing conditions. Retail sales slowed in July. 
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO: Reports indicated strong economic conditions.  
Retailers reported solid sales growth, while service providers 
noted a pickup in growth above an already rapid pace. Manufacturing 
activity picked up in much of the district, although import 
competition continued to temper growth in some sectors. Conditions 
among many agricultural producers deteriorated in recent weeks as 
poor weather, low prices and weak demand challenged profitability.

<HEADLINE> Three-Way Aluminum Merger Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Three top aluminum manufacturers Wednesday  
announced their merger in a combination that could create the 
world's largest aluminum producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian aluminum giant Alcan Aluminium plans to combine with  
European rivals, French company Pechiney and Alusuisse-Lonza 
(Algroup) of Switzerland to form a new company provisionally called 
Alcan-Pechiney-Algroup. 
</P>
<P>
	APA may not remain atop the aluminum industry for long, however.  
Just hours after the announcement of the deal, Alcoa, the current 
leading aluminum producer in the world, revealed Wednesday it had 
made an unsolicited $5.6 billion bid for U.S. competitor, Reynolds 
Metals. 
</P>
<P>
	If both deals go through, the new companies will have similar  
annual revenue, around $21 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed three-way arrangement, Alcan stockholders  
will ultimately hold 44 percent of the new company, Pechiney 29 
percent and Algroup 27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcan chairman Jacques Bougie will head APA, but he is expected  
to hand over to Pechiney chairman Jean-Pierre Rodier in two years' 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's 12-member board will contain four members from  
each of the three companies. The company will be registered in 
Montreal, the current base for Alcan, but will be directed from New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would have a substantial packaging business in  
addition to its aluminum side and will employ 91,000. Job cuts of 
about 5 percent would be achieved through natural attrition, the 
companies have said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's strong presence throughout the aluminum product  
cycle leaves it well-protected from the changing price of aluminum, 
Bougie said at a press conference in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``With three divisions -- primary aluminum, fabricated products  
and packaging -- APA would be less sensitive to aluminum price 
fluctuations on the London Metal Exchange,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the new company would have to act quickly if it  
wanted to have a big impact worldwide, especially as there are 
cultural and managerial differences between the three companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The management may have shareholder value in mind, but it may  
take some time to instill global thinking in the new company's work 
force,'' said Christoph Bohli, an analyst at Bank Sarasin in 
Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
	Pechiney's role in the three-way merger is subject to  
discussions about the fate of the work force, which are required 
under French law, and may also face a competition investigation by 
the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Algroup has signed a separate deal with Alcan, and Algroup chief  
executive Sergio Marchionne said the merger of the Canadian and 
Swiss companies would go ahead even if the French deal foundered. 
</P>
<P>
	Algroup president Martin Ebner said the deal was necessary to  
look for opportunities to expand on the world market. ``Only those 
who are big enough to act globally and produce at the lowest cost 
can survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pechiney shares ended the day up 5.5 percent on the Paris  
Bourse. Algroup shares were down 2.2 percent in Zurich on 
profit-taking following a 3.7 percent rise Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Algroup's Lonza chemicals division will not be part of the deal.  
It will be spun off into a separate company this fall, managers 
said. Shares in Basel-based Ciba Specialty Chemicals rose 6.6 
percent as dealers speculated that it might merge with Lonza.

<HEADLINE> American Express-Costco Card Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Costco Cos., a leading wholesale warehouse club  
operator, will issue co-branded credit cards with American Express 
this fall. It is the first foray by American Express into sharing 
its brand with a retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in November, consumers with a qualifying credit history  
can purchase an American Express card that will double as a Costco 
membership card, the companies announced Wednesday. Cardholders 
will earn cash rebates at Costco for purchases charged at the 
warehouse discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses with Costco accounts will be able to obtain an  
American Express corporate card, providing discounts on purchases 
at Costco. 
</P>
<P>
	Both cards will carry no annual fee, other than what it costs to  
join Costco, and both can be used anywhere that accepts American 
Express. That's in contrast to the annual fee of $55 for the basic 
``green card'' offered by American Express. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates and other details will be announced in the fall,  
the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Costco president James Sinegal said there would be no price  
increase or additional charge to members as a result of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Costco currently has its own branded credit card and accepts  
Discover cards, but does not accept MasterCard or Visa and said it 
has no immediate plans to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	David C. House, president of American Express Establishment  
Services, said the arrangement will boost his company's charge-card 
business ``outside the traditional travel and entertainment 
markets.'' He said Costco's customer base is ``the most affluent of 
any of the warehouse club stores and growing rapidly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based in Issaquah, Wash., Costco has 220 outlets in the United  
States, 4 million business customers and 17 million member 
households worldwide. Its competitors are Sam's Clubs, a subsidiary 
of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., and BJ's Wholesale Club Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sam's Clubs chain has a store credit card and accepts  
Discover Card. It discontinued a rebate program which it found too 
costly, a spokeswoman said. BJ's accepts Visa and Discover and has 
a co-branded card with MasterCard. Next month, BJ's will cut its 
rebate program to 1 percent from 2 percent of purchases, a 
spokeswoman said.

	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Hundreds of workers who lost their  
jobs when the state-run flour mill was privatized blocked its 
entrance with flaming tires Wednesday and demanded compensation for 
their lost income. 
</P>
<P>
	Waving placards demanding ``payment for our toil,'' the workers  
blocked the road from the northbound highway to the mill, about 18 
miles north of the capital, Port-au-Prince. This is the second such 
protest at the mill since July 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The flour mill was transferred to private hands in September  
1997, after it had been closed. Hundreds of workers were not hired 
back when it reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	The flour mill's privatization is part of a plan to privatize  
nine inefficient state-owned enterprises. The privatizations are 
expected to eliminate thousands of jobs.

	VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico (AP) -- A fisherman was killed Wednesday  
morning by a swarm of killer bees in the Gulf state of Tabasco, 
local authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Alvarez, 40, and his three children -- aged 6, 8, and 9 --  
were attacked while fishing in the La Iguana River, 45 miles 
northwest of Villahermosa, the state capital, civil protection 
deputy director Roberto Lopez Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
	The children escaped by jumping in the river. But Alvarez did  
not follow them. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's incident came a day after another killer bee attack  
left 60 injured in the central state of Nayarit. 
</P>
<P>
	Nayarit authorities said the attack was the most serious in a  
series of killer bee attacks over the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
	The bees are dangerous because they are so aggressive when  
protecting their hives. They began moving north after a Brazilian 
laboratory accidentally released them in 1956. Several people in 
the southern United States have been killed by them.

<HEADLINE> Gore for $2 Billion Biomass Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Wrioter    	
</P>
<P>
	IOWA FALLS, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore on Thursday will  
detail a $2 billion boost in Iowa farm income under an effort to 
boost the use of biomass technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to bolstering income for farmers, Gore will argue  
that the effort will cut sharply into greenhouse gas emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is set to make the announcement at an Iowa campaign swing,  
touting its boost to farmers who are suffering through a sagging 
farm economy that threatens to drive thousands from the land. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is made possible by advances in farming and biological  
technologies allowing for a far more diverse use of trees and other 
crops for a variety of purposes. Those range from distilling of 
ethanol to blend with gasoline to make it burn cleaner to bio-based 
textiles and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	Targeting an increase in the use of bioenergy and bioproducts  
would be a boon for farmers throughout the nation. The $2 billion 
boost in farm income in Iowa is certain to ripple across the 
country, and boost rural income substantially more than that. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to boosting farm income backers of the use of  
biomass technology say it's environmentally friendly as well. 
Backers argue it can cut into production of greenhouse gases often 
blamed for global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	The plants used in biomass technology -- such as trees -- absorb  
carbons during their growth, and their use in energy and other 
applications can cut into carbon emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the plants are largely deep-rooted varieties which  
are helpful in controlling erosion and filtering chemicals from 
groundwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing Gore to detail the impact of such a program in a  
politically sensitive state like Iowa is yet another sign of the 
clout he gains from having the White House on his side. 
</P>
<P>
	He's competing against former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley for  
the Democratic presidential nomination, and both are campaigning in 
Iowa on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's ability to make the announcement makes him the center of  
attention, and also the bearer of very good economic news for 
farmers at avery troubled economic time. 
</P>
<P>
	Most farmers are sufffering through historic low price levels  
for most traditional commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening the gate for the production of new and nontraditional  
commodities could hold out hope for farmers, and could provide the 
fodder for new research at places like Iowa State Unversity on 
seeking even more new uses for biomass technology. 
</P>
<P>
	That could be yet another fallout from the administration's  
decision to push for a sharply increased role for the rapidly 
evolving biomass technology. That technology isn't well known in 
many parts of the country, but is an emerging environmental issue 
and a hot topic in farm states like Iowa, where precinct caucuses 
launch the nominating season.

<HEADLINE>  Pakistan Fires on India Choppers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BHUJ, India (AP) -- Pakistan fired a missile at Indian aircraft  
flying near the crash site of a Pakistani surveillance plane today, 
the second aerial clash in the disputed border region in two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani military spokesman Brig. Rashid Quereshi said his  
forces fired on two Indian fighter jets escorting three helicopters 
to the crash site. An Associated Press reporter was among a group 
of journalists aboard the helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two Mig 21 fighters ... approached the site of the wreckage.  
Our troops who were there engaged them and fired one time,'' 
Quereshi said. He said a surface-to-air missile was used, but 
refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Group Capt. P. S. Bhangu said that from the cockpit he  
saw a missile flash coming from the direction of the Pakistani 
border, and immediately the three choppers veered away from the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	The helicopters returned to base, and defense officials in the  
Indian capital said they had no knowledge of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani soldiers were digging in at the crash site, placing  
anti-aircraft missiles and machine guns. India downed the navy 
plane Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan both retrieved wreckage from the downed  
surveillance plane today, and each accused the other of provoking 
their first aerial clash in nearly three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The downing of the Pakistani naval aircraft near the disputed  
border has reignited tensions between the hostile neighbors that 
had barely cooled since an undeclared war this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan said 16 crew members were killed. More than 24 hours  
after the plane was shot down, no bodies had been found. 
</P>
<P>
	India's air force chief said the Pakistani plane could have been  
scouting possible invasion routes, and that the pilots of the 
Indian interceptors feared the plane was armed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the event of an offensive, they could be looking for ...  
the possible creeks, the possible channels through which they can 
come in,'' Air Marshal A.Y. Tipnis told reporters at Naliya, an air 
base in the western state of Gujarat. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash site was near Sir Creek, about 60 miles southeast of  
the Pakistani port of Karachi and 90 miles northwest of the Indian 
city of Bhuj. 
</P>
<P>
	Both countries said they had recovered wreckage from the  
aircraft, which may have been scattered on both sides of the border 
where western India meets southeast Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pakistan's capital, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called a  
Cabinet meeting to discuss his country's response. On Tuesday, 
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said Pakistan reserved the right to 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
	India said the French-built Atlantique, a surveillance and  
submarine-hunting aircraft, was shot down after penetrating six 
miles into Indian airspace and failing to respond to warnings. 
Pakistan said the aircraft was within its own territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian defense officials said the Atlantique could carry Exocet  
air-to-air missiles, although Pakistan said its plane was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Quereshi, the Pakistani army spokesman, said his country's  
forces detected Indian naval movements near their waters. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Indian soldiers had violated Pakistan's territory and  
``stole some small parts of the aircraft'' to back Indian claims 
that the plane fell in its territory. 
</P>
<P>
	India said its air force had retrieved part of the wreckage --  
including a wing, the cockpit and the plane's cable hydraulic 
system -- from Indian territory near the Pakistani border. 
</P>
<P>
	An Indian air force statement said Indian radar detected the  
Pakistani plane in its airspace and signaled the pilot to land at 
an Indian air base. Instead, the propeller-driven plane turned 
toward an Indian jet ``in a hostile manner,'' according to the 
statement. The Indian MiG-21 fired an air-to-air missile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian military charged that Pakistan had violated Indian  
airspace in the area eight times since May. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz denied that, and  
described the attack as a ``blatant and unprovoked act of military 
aggression against an unarmed aircraft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani authorities showed reporters the mangled wreckage as  
well as a parachute, a dingy, the flight manual, a checklist and 
personal documents of the crew. 
</P>
<P>
	The confrontation dispelled any immediate hope of moving  
relations between the world's newest nuclear powers back onto a 
peaceful track. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan have fought three wars since they gained  
independence from Britain in 1947, and despite frequent diplomatic 
scuffles, this was their first aerial clash since they last went to 
war in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged the two rivals to  
exercise ``maximum restraint,'' and called on both countries to 
settle their differences peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan came to the brink of war this summer during  
an 11-week confrontation in the mountains of Kashmir. India said 
Pakistani troops had infiltrated its territory, but Pakistan denied 
its soldiers were involved and said all the fighters were local 
militants. 
</P>
<P>
	India said today its troops killed five Pakistani soldiers as it  
repulsed attacks Tuesday on the 20,000-feet disputed Siachen 
Glacier in northern Kashmir. There was no immediate comment from 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	A Defense Ministry statement said more than 20 Pakistani troops  
twice tried to capture an Indian post on the glacier, 600 miles 
north of New Delhi. Indian and Pakistani troops have been fighting 
for control of Siachen since the early 1980s despite severe cold 
and high winds.

<HEADLINE> Cisco Systems' Revenues Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nowhere is the Internet gold rush more apparent  
-- and real -- than at Cisco Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Capping a stunning fiscal year in which revenues grew 43 percent  
and operating profits improved 35 percent, Cisco's fourth-quarter 
results showed that it continues to dominate the frenzied race to 
upgrade systems for Internet communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the three month period ended July 31 totaled $3.55  
billion, a 48 percent increase from last year's fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., earned $727 million or 21  
cents per share, in the quarter, excluding one-time charges 
totaling $97 million for acquisition-related expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year-ago period, Cisco posted an operating profit of $525  
million, or 16 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The results edged most forecasts by industry analysts, which  
averaged 20 cents a share, according to a survey by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco's stock had retreated in advance of Tuesday's late  
afternoon report, but bounced back $2.25 per share to $61 in 
today's early Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some caution, however, on the part of Cisco executives  
regarding the uncertainty over whether concerns about the Year 2000 
computer bug would interrupt technology orders later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still don't know,'' said chief executive John Chambers.  
But, he added, ``We're more comfortable with Y2K than we were 
6-to-12 months ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Including all one-time factors, Cisco posted a net profit of  
$635 million, or 18 cents per share, in its fourth quarter, up from 
$493 million, or 15 cents a share a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco closed its fiscal year with revenue of $12.15 billion, up  
from $8.49 billion during the previous 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income totaled $2.55 billion, or 75 cents per share,  
for the fiscal year, an increase of 35 percent from the prior 
year's tally of $1.88 billion, or 58 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the fiscal year amounted to $2.10 billion, or 62  
cents per share. That compares with a net profit of $1.35 billion, 
or 42 cents per share, in the prior fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco again attributed its stellar results to the rapid growth  
of the Internet, including the race to bring high-speed, multimedia 
services to consumers over a single cable or phone wire. Revenues 
related to upgrading cable and phone systems for that purpose rose 
20 percent from the prior quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also pointed to the move away from traditional modes  
of voice and video communications, which are starting to be 
packaged in the format used to transmit data on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``By providing the systems that make the Internet work, Cisco is  
playing a major role in helping customers thrive in the explosive 
Internet economy,'' said Chambers. As a result, he boasted, Cisco 
is ``the fastest growing and most profitable company in the history 
of the computer industry.''

<HEADLINE> Marion Jones Wins 200M at Weltklasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Marion Jones stretched her winning  
streak at 200 meters to 21 races by winning the event Wednesday at 
the Weltlkasse meet. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old American, the only woman to run under 22 seconds  
this summer, sped past U.S. champion Inger Miller and was clocked 
in 22.10 seconds. Miller was timed in 22.19. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I felt the tailwind on the straight I was flying home. No  
problems with the bend,'' said Jones, the only woman to run under 
22 seconds this summer. ``I hope I'll do as well in Seville. That's 
what I'm training for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaica's Beverly McDonald was third in 22.46.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones has not lost at 200 meters since 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	The victory kept her in the running for a share of the Golden  
League's $1 million jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
	The three other athletes in contention also remained in the  
running with victories. Wilson Kipketer of Denmark won at 800 
meters while Kenyan steeplechaser Bernard Barmasai and Romanian 
3,000-meter specialist Gabriela Szabo also came through with 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	The four have to win in the two remaining Golden League meets to  
receive a share of the prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer, forced to produce a season best earlier this summer in  
order to remain in the chase for the Golden League bonus, won in 
1:43.01, beating South Africa's Hezekiel Sepeng by 0.65. 
</P>
<P>
	For Kipketer, who was fighting malaria just last winter, just  
being able to race, let alone win, is a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I had malaria I was fighting life and death,'' Kipketer  
said. ``I'm lucky to be running and posting good times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barmasai barely kept his chances alive, edging fellow Kenyan  
Christopher Koskei by just .27 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	In a women's 3,000 that saw three records fall, Szabo kept her  
Golden League payday hopes alive with a meet-record time of 
8:25.03. Zahra Ouaziz of Morocco broke the African record, placing 
second in 8:26.48. 
</P>
<P>
	World record holder Maurice Greene of the United States won the  
last major 100-meter race before the World Championships in 
Seville, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting a slight headwind, Greene crossed in 9.99 to collect  
his fifth straight 100-meter victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a good performance with a headwind of .7,''  
said Greene. ``You can be sure that wind like that means a lot, 
especially if it was a headwind and not a tailwind. 
</P>
<P>
	Obadele Thompson of Barbados was second, just .03 back. Canadian  
Bruny Surin finished third, clocking 10.06. 
</P>
<P>
	World and Olympic silver medalist Frankie Fredericks of Namibia  
was fourth in 10.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing from the field were Olympic champion Donovan Bailey and  
200-meter world champion Ato Boldon, both of whom were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	In the absence of double Olympic champion Michael Johnson,  
Jerome Young led an American sweep of the podium in the men's 400, 
crossing in 44.33 seconds. Antonio Pettigrew was second in 44.72 
while Anthuan Maybank finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who pulled his hamstring in Stockholm two weeks ago,  
preferred to skip the meet to nurse his leg for the Worlds in 10 
days time.

<HEADLINE> Navy Moves To Restore Tailhook Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Navy Secretary Richard Danzig took a step  
Tuesday toward restoring official ties with the Tailhook 
Association, a naval aviator booster group whose 1991 Las Vegas 
convention produced a sex-harassment scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Danzig told the organization's president in a letter that a  
three-member Navy delegation would to attend this year's Tailhook 
Association convention next week to observe it ``first hand and 
speak informally with the association's leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He held out conditional ``possible resumption of support'' for  
the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you know, the shameful events at the Tailhook convention in  
1991 led to a withdrawal of our support for the Tailhook 
Association,'' Danzig said in the letter to Retired Navy Capt. 
Lonny K. McClung, Tailhook's current president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past eight years, however, the association has taken  
a number of constructive steps that warrant a review of its 
status,'' Danzig wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Female officers were groped and fondled by aviators attending  
parties during a three-day aviator's conference at a Las Vegas 
hotel in September 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department Inspector General implicated 117 officers  
for sexual assault, indecent exposure and other acts, and faulted 
the Navy's leaders for failing to stop the behavior. In October 
1991 the Navy ended all support ``in any manner whatsoever, direct 
or indirect'' for Tailhook. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a cautionary act, not an embrace...,'' Cmdr. Brian  
Cullin, a Navy spokesman, said Tuesday. ``But it is an action taken 
based on the progress we have seen the Tailhook Association has 
taken over the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman also noted ``dramatic changes in the Navy'' since  
the episode, including the introduction of women combat pilots who 
fly aircraft off carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our profile has changed,'' Cullin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Danzig said the Navy delegation attending the Tailhook  
convention would include Carolyn Becraft, assistant Navy secretary 
for manpower and reserve affairs; Vice Admiral Mike Bowman, 
commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, and Lt. Gen. John Rhodes of 
the Marine Corps Combat Development Command. The convention is Aug. 
19-22 in Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	He commended the organization for taking steps to improve its  
image, including adopting resolutions condemning harassment and 
honoring the ``services and sacrifices of all those who are ... a 
part of carrier-based aviation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To determine whether official support of the association is  
now warranted, I need to assess the extent to which the association 
lives by these principles,'' Danzig said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that in order to earn back the Navy's support, Tailhook  
would have to show that it could focus on ``professional challenges 
and opportunities facing naval aviation,'' support all men and 
women in the carrier aviation community and ``take all reasonable 
steps'' to prevent other episodes of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Adm. Jay Johnson, the chief of naval operations,  
called rehabilitating the Tailhook Association a remaining piece of 
``unfinished business'' in the Navy's effort to put the scandal 
behind it. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said then in an interview with The Associated Press that  
he was working with organization's leaders ``to make sure that 
we've learned the lessons we needed to learn -- which we have -- and 
that we've institutionalized those lessons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McClung, a retired Navy captain who has been president of the  
Tailhook group since 1995, said then that ``the timing is right'' 
to get back in the Navy's good graces. 
</P>
<P>
	His organization, named for the hook on a plane that snags an  
arresting cable on the landing deck of an aircraft carrier, has 
about 10,000 members -- down from its 1991 peak of about 16,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides its annual conventions, which include professional  
seminars, the group sponsors college scholarships for children of 
former naval aviators and publishes a magazine on carrier aviation 
called Hook. 
</P>
<P>
	The September 1991 convention of Tailhook members at the Las  
Vegas Hilton Hotel triggered the resignation of Navy Secretary H. 
Lawrence Garrett and the early retirement of Adm. Frank B. Kelso, 
then the chief of naval operations. 
</P>
<P>
	It also led to lawsuits, multiple investigations and changes in  
the Navy -- including more emphasis on ethics and sexual harassment 
awareness and an opening of more aviation opportunities for women.

<HEADLINE> Van de Velde Keeps Shoes On  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- He kept his socks and shoes on. Other than  
that, very little about Jean Van de Velde has changed since he 
commandeered center stage for one of golf's greatest dramas ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``People recognize me and a lot of them say, `Thanks a lot for  
what I saw. It was great. I had a good time in front of my TV. Next 
time it will be you.' 
</P>
<P>
	``And so,'' he said, ``it makes you feel good.''  
</P>
<P>
	Good? Plenty of emotions come to mind recalling the tragicomedy  
in which Van de Velde hacked his way up and down the 18th hole at 
last month's British Open. But good is nowhere within 10 places of 
the top of that list. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, the longer the Frenchman sat and deftly handled  
questions on the eve of the PGA Championship, the more it seemed 
that this was the right man to have fallen into the wrong 
situation. Instead of being crushed by the triple-bogey 7 that 
pushed him into a four-hole playoff eventually won by Scotsman Paul 
Lawrie, Van de Velde appears to have been buoyed by the experience. 
Strengthened, even. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't watch a replay of the last hole at the Carnoustie Golf  
Links until Tuesday, when he taped a television interview. It 
turned out to be anything but the numbing show he expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty funny,'' Van de Velde said. ``I mean, my face  
was pretty funny, especially after I hit that drive. It went so far 
right I didn't even know where the ball was (until) someone told 
me. And when I looked at my face, I was still smiling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The temptation is to think that the humor is just a mask, a way  
of hiding the hurt that clings to memories as sharp as the one Van 
de Velde awakes to each morning. In that case, think again. 
</P>
<P>
	He admits he barely slept the first two nights after Carnoustie.  
But once Van de Velde settled back into the familiar rhythms of 
day-to-day life -- taking his daughter to school, sharing a bottle 
of wine with his wife, hitting golf balls on the range alongside 
fellow pros who barely knew how to approach him -- he found the 
laughter flowed easily enough once again. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, maybe it's in my temperament. I don't know. Not that  
I intend to forget things very quickly, but that's it. You don't 
live in the past. I walked out of there with my head and chin 
pretty straight. And that's all I could do. It wasn't enough that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if I ever arrive three shots ahead in a major,'' and here  
Van de Velde, a natural comic, fixed his audience, ``I guess if 
that happened about 10 times, I might make one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the chuckles died out, it began dawning on just about  
everyone in the room that he wasn't kidding. Not entirely, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, there's one thing that week taught me -- that I'm  
capable of doing it. I'm capable of competing with the best players 
in the world and that is something that no one's going to take 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like putting your name down on the trophy. It's  
something that you have to experience and that you know afterward. 
I knew somehow I could do it and I proved it to myself. Now it's 
going to be a matter of doing it again. I'd like it to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And why not?  
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde believes he learned more about himself through that  
singular, spectacular failure than a lifetime of close calls. He 
had a chance to win the British Open by playing not to lose, by 
pretending the brutal, water-lined 18th was a par-5 instead of a 
par-4. Instead, with his caddy keeping silent and doubt gnawing at 
his elbow -- Van De Velde went at it the only way his nature would 
allow. 
</P>
<P>
	The next time he finds himself in that situation -- and Van de  
Velde is certain there will be a next time -- doubt will not be part 
of the equation. That, he also believes, will make all the 
difference in the world. Because he is already finished with what 
might have been. 
</P>
<P>
	``What can I say to people who tell me you should have done  
this, you should have done that? 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I will answer them, `Well, I haven't seen you on the tee  
of the 72nd hole three shots ahead. So if you ever get that chance, 
I'm going to give you a quarter and you give me a phone call.' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's maybe one thing I can tell them.''

<HEADLINE> Boy Wounded in Shooting 'a Fighter' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- He lost 30 percent of his blood and underwent  
six hours of surgery after bullets blasted holes through his leg 
and abdomen. The 5-year-old faces countless more hours in the 
operating room. 
</P>
<P>
	But the youngest victim of the shooting at North Valley Jewish  
Community Center is a fighter with a will to live that dwarfs his 
pain, doctors and acquaintances who treated him said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Fernando Valley boy, whose name has not been released,  
was the most seriously wounded of the five victims, suffering 
injuries to his abdomen and left thigh. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in critical but stable condition Wednesday at Childrens  
Hospital Los Angeles after doctors inserted four stainless-steel 
pins in his leg during an hourlong operation to help his femur heal 
over the next three to four months, said Dr. Richard Reynolds, an 
orthopedic surgeon. Once the bone is healed, the pins will be 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds described the boy as conscious and able to carry a  
conversation, albeit with some difficulty. The boy was sedated to 
help him breathe with the aid of a machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the boy's leg has a good prognosis, Reynolds would not  
speculate on how long it would take the boy to heal from his other 
wounds or how much longer he would have to be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ultimate outcome will depend on whether there are any  
complications that arise from those procedures (for the other 
injuries),'' Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, this child is a fighter,'' said Nina Lieberman  
Giladi, whose son was inside the center when gunfire erupted 
Tuesday. ``(His classmates) take their cue from him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One bullet had entered his left buttocks and exited his abdomen,  
while another tore through his left thigh, said Dr. Clarence Sutton 
Jr., the chief surgeon who operated on the boy at Providence Holy 
Cross Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	When he came into the hospital, he was ``trying to reach out and  
touch the people around him'' as he gasped for air, the doctor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was transferred late Tuesday to the intensive care unit  
at Childrens Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-year-old boy taken to the same hospital was in fair  
condition after minor surgery for a bullet wound in the left 
buttock area, hospital spokesman Steve Rutledge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge read a statement from that boy's parents who thanked  
``everyone for their prayers and encouragement. Our son is 
recovering well. His leg is in a cast and he is comfortable. He is 
playing Nintendo with his brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another 6-year-old boy was in good condition at Granada Hills  
Community Hospital, where he was treated for a wound to the foot, 
spokeswoman Lori Kapper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-age counselor Mindy Finkelstein's condition was upgraded to  
good at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Woodland Hills, 
spokeswoman Lisa Kort said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wounded receptionist Isabelle Shalometh was released from a  
hospital Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Study: Rudeness at Work on the Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A co-worker slams down the phone. Someone snags  
the last of the office coffee without refilling the pot. The boss 
blows by without so much as a nod to the staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound like where you work?  
</P>
<P>
	Workplace civility has gone downhill in the past 10 years,  
according to a new study, and researchers say men are mostly to 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Although men and women are targets of disrespect and rudeness in  
equal numbers, researchers say men instigate the rudeness 70 
percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to make organizations aware of this,'' said study  
co-author Christine Pearson, a management professor at the 
University of North Carolina business school. ``You can calculate 
the costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearson pointed to several broad societal forces as possible  
reasons for all the ill will: downsizing, the growing pressure to 
``do more with less'' and technology -- which allows workers to 
``zap people anonymously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve percent of the people who experience rude behavior quit  
their jobs to avoid the perpetrator, the researchers found. 
Fifty-two percent reported losing work time worrying and 22 percent 
deliberately decreased their work effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, ``Workplace Incivility: The Target's Eye View,'' was  
presented Tuesday at the Academy of Management's annual convention. 
The authors interviewed and surveyed 1,400 workers and generated a 
list of suggestions to improve the workplace culture. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of those interviewed, 78 percent, said incivility  
has worsened in the past 10 years. The authors also found that rude 
people are three times more likely to be in higher positions than 
their targets. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Pearson said, men are seven times more likely be rude or  
insensitive to underlings than to superiors. 
</P>
<P>
	Women are equally rude to superiors and subordinates, the study  
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Fay Taylor, 49, a marketing director in Chicago, said she is not  
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``Men are more like bulls in a china shop when they are trying  
to get a job done,'' Taylor said. ``Women tend to couch things more 
carefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she added, ``If a woman is going to be rude, she's going to  
be rude. She'll butt in at the highest levels and the lowest 
levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Dutton, a University of Michigan professor who wasn't  
involved in the study, said its most important finding was ``to 
make concrete the costs of these small acts of disrespect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For companies and managers, she recommends a quick response to  
disrespectful acts, setting parameters for behavior, training and 
feedback. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all still kids,'' she said. ``If we can get away with  
it, we will.''

<HEADLINE> No Beeper for Mickelson at PGA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- The beeper has been replaced by a baby.  
</P>
<P>
	If Phil Mickelson gets into contention in the PGA Championship  
this week, he won't have to worry about his beeper going off to 
alert him to the impending birth of his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	That's been replaced by a bigger concern -- like whether little  
Amanda Brynn Mickelson will begin crying at just the wrong time as 
her mother totes her along the tree-lined fairways of Medinah 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may be a problem,'' Mickelson said Wednesday. ``It's  
experimental for us. This is the first time we've gone through this 
and it will be an experiment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amanda, who was born the day after Mickelson lost the U.S. Open  
by one shot to Payne Stewart, is at her first tournament, though 
she'll likely sleep much of the time as her father tries to win his 
first major. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson's wife, Amy, plans to carry their daughter in a baby  
backpack as she follows Mickelson around. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson has played only once, missing the cut in the British  
Open, since Amanda was born June 22. Since her birth, he's 
discovered what life as a new father is like. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past few months I've been getting up in the middle of the  
night. Primarily, my wife has, though,'' Mickelson said. ``And it's 
been tough on her as it's been tough on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his family life flourished, the golf game that peaked at  
the Open has suffered. Mickelson pretty much put the sticks away to 
concentrate on his newly expanded family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've spent a lot of time with my family, and it's been a very  
enjoyable couple of months,'' he said. ``This last week I've tried 
to play and practice quite a bit, and I feel like I've been playing 
well but I won't really know how I'm playing until I get in 
competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson readily admits he may have made a mistake by not  
playing more often since his daughter was born. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not about to apologize for it, though, or the fact he was  
ready to walk off the course at the U.S. Open had his wife gone 
into labor. 
</P>
<P>
	He might have had to do that if Stewart hadn't run in a putt on  
the final hole to win the Open. Otherwise, Mickelson would have 
been just about making the turn in an 18-hole playoff on Monday 
about the time Amy was getting ready to give birth. 
</P>
<P>
	``What really surprises me is that there are some people that  
would have considered staying and that disappoints me,'' Mickelson 
said. ``As a father, I think there's nothing more important in life 
to do than to raise that child and I'm disappointed that some guys 
would even consider leaving or not leaving and staying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the age of 29, Mickelson still bears the burden of being  
labeled the best player who has never won a major. 
</P>
<P>
	He has won 13 times on the PGA Tour, though, and his remarkably  
steady finish at the Open while keeping one ear on his beeper 
helped boost his confidence and shake a rap as a poor finisher 
under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that I'm just disappointed in myself for having been  
out here six, seven, eight years and not having won one,'' 
Mickelson said. ``I certainly had higher expectations than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though his game is rusty, the PGA Championship might be the best  
place for Mickelson to break through. 
</P>
<P>
	At 7,401 yards, Medinah's No. 3 course plays to long hitters,  
and Mickelson's short game is one of the best on tour when he is 
sharp. And 10 of the last 11 PGA's have been won by first-time 
major winners. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter if he wins the tournament or misses the cut, Mickelson  
believes he has his priorities in order both on and off the course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to pride myself on the ability to separate things that  
are going on in my life when I get on the golf course,'' he said. 
``I wouldn't want my family to take the brunt of poor play or be 
the bearer of praise when I play well.''

<HEADLINE> Slain Mailman Just Unlucky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Joseph Ileto had just started walking his  
mail route in suburban Chatsworth when he was gunned down in a 
driveway and left to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there were no witnesses to his slaying Tuesday,  
authorities said he was shot to death by Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. 
about an hour after the white supremacist opened fire in a nearby 
Jewish community center, wounding three boys, a receptionist and a 
camp counselor. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what linked Ileto's killing to the community center  
shooting, Police Chief Bernard Parks cited the timing and location. 
Ileto was of Filipino descent. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was charged Wednesday with murder and illegal possession  
of a firearm in Ileto's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Ileto, 39, had worked for the Postal Service for two years. He  
was a substitute carrier who took the routes of sick or vacationing 
co-workers. His colleagues ``really liked him. He seemed to be a 
happy-go-lucky kind of guy, always smiling,'' agency spokesman 
David Mazer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ileto was returning to his truck when he was shot several times  
in the upper body. There was no sign of theft, Mazer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' Mazer  
said.

<HEADLINE> Sumitomo Sues J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sumitomo Corp. filed a $735 million lawsuit  
against J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. on Tuesday, demanding compensation for 
its role in a scandal in which a Sumitomo copper trader lost $2.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was sealed, though a cover sheet spelled out the  
amount demanded by Sumitomo and allegations it was making against 
J.P. Morgan. These included fraud, racketeering, negligence, breach 
of duty, aiding and abetting and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit stemmed from a September 1996 revelation by Sumitomo  
that it had lost $2.6 billion from the unauthorized trading of one 
of its traders, Yasuo Hamanaka. After the announcement, copper 
prices plunged. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo has since paid out millions of dollars in class-action  
lawsuits filed by copper traders and others over trading in Japan 
and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The traders alleged that Hamanaka had cornered as much as 5  
percent of the copper market, keeping the price of copper high on 
the New York and London commodity futures markets in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamanaka was sentenced to eight years in prison in March 1998 by  
the Tokyo District Court on forgery and fraud convictions. Sumitomo 
has filed a separate civil lawsuit against Hamanaka. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone message left with a law firm representing J.P.  
Morgan was not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Polio Effort Stops Congo War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The warring sides in the Congo have  
stopped fighting in most areas in response to a U.N. appeal for a 
cease-fire so 10 million children can be vaccinated against polio, 
a U.N. spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary-General Kofi Annan received assurances from Congolese  
President Laurent Kabila and rebel leaders controlling the eastern 
part of the country that they would lay down their weapons on Aug. 
8 to permit the immunization campaign to proceed on Aug. 13-20. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with continued localized fighting, relief agencies believe  
that the campaign can reach over 95 percent of children under age 
5, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Congo is the top priority for the global campaign to eradicate  
polio by the end of the year 2000 because it has the most intense 
polio virus transmission in the world, according to a joint 
statement by Annan, World Health Organization Director-General Gro 
Harlem Brundtland and UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of reported polio cases worldwide has declined from  
35,000 in 1988 to 6,000 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The halt to most fighting for the immunization campaign comes as  
intensive diplomatic efforts are under way to get the main rebel 
group in Congo to sign a peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The cease-fire agreement was signed July 10 by Kabila and his  
allies -- Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- and by Rwanda and Uganda, 
who are backing the rebels. The rebel Congolese Liberation Movement 
signed on Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	But the principal rebel organization, the Congolese Rally for  
Democracy, has refused to sign because of a leadership dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan reiterated his call for all parties to comply with the  
truce so the immunizations can go ahead, stressing that the ``days 
of tranquility'' could also be used to promote peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``These vaccination campaigns are a platform for the  
peace-building process. They open windows of opportunity for 
dialogue between the different sides,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Volunteers will staff some 16,000 immunization sites with  
support from WHO and the U.N. Children's Fund, who are spearheading 
the polio eradication campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every child counts,'' Brundtland said. ``In the eradication  
effort we need to gain access to children in pockets of unrest and 
strife. If we miss a single village we will fail.''

<HEADLINE> Soldier's Life Ends Violently </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- Barry Winchell fired a .50-caliber  
machine gun well enough to be the best marksman in his company. He 
hoped to someday become an Army helicopter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	But Winchell's life ended violently last month, not on a  
battlefield somewhere but in his barracks at Fort Campbell, where 
he was bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Army prosecutors say he was murdered by a soldier in his  
platoon. But gay rights advocates say suggestions that hatred for 
homosexuals may have played a role reveals something larger about 
the military itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, anti-gay harassment has been a huge problem with  
`don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue,''' C. Dixon Osburn, 
co-executive director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, 
said Wednesday. ``Each year, the reports of anti-gay harassment 
from verbal gay bashing on to death threats have increased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Army conducted a hearing this week to determine whether the  
murder case against Pvt. Calvin Glover, 18, of Sulphur, Okla., will 
go to a general court-martial. The decision is expected in about 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Winchell's roommate, Spec. Justin Fisher, 25, of Lincoln, Neb.,  
is charged as an accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
	Trial counsel Capt. Gregg Engler, whose job is similar to that  
of a civilian prosecutor, said he believed simple vengeance was the 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
	Engler argued that a drunken Glover picked a fight with  
Winchell, 21, at a Fort Campbell party on July 3, became humiliated 
after losing the scuffle, vowed in front of several witnesses to 
get even and later used the bat to crush Winchell's skull. 
</P>
<P>
	``Private Glover murdered Pfc. Barry Winchell, and there's no  
doubt about it,'' Engler said. 
</P>
<P>
	But testimony at the hearing also raised the possibility that  
the killing was motivated by hatred for a man rumored to be 
homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	If Winchell was a hate-crime victim, it would be the first known  
case of sexual orientation being the motive behind a soldier's 
slaying at a U.S. military installation in the five years since 
Congress passed the ``don't ask, don't tell'' law, Osburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	His group has reported 400 cases of anti-gay harassment in the  
military in 1998, including death threats, compared with 182 
violations in 1997 -- a 120 percent increase. The group has said 
that commanders should enforce rules designed to protect the 
privacy of service members and limit investigations into their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime late last year, soldiers in Winchell's unit learned  
that he had started frequenting The Connection, a bar in Nashville, 
Tenn., that's popular among homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sergeants in Winchell's platoon, Michael Kleifgen and Eric  
Dubielak, testified that Winchell was the frequent target of 
name-callers because of rumors that he was gay. Both said Fisher 
started spreading the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	During the last several months of Winchell's life, rarely a day  
went by without someone calling the Kansas City, Mo., native a 
derogatory name, Kleifgen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Winchell, however, told Kleifgen and Dubielak that he wasn't  
gay, Kleifgen said. Another soldier, Spec. Lewis Ruiz, testified 
that Winchell was worried the rumors would get him kicked out of 
the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the ``don't ask'' policy, the military isn't supposed to  
investigate sexual orientation unless ``credible information'' 
surfaces about a person's homosexuality. Proof that someone is gay 
or professes to be gay is grounds for automatic discharge. 
</P>
<P>
	Just how much, if any, of Winchell's lifestyle played a role in  
his death may never be fully known. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarence Patton of the New York City Gay and Lesbian  
Anti-Violence Project attended the first day of the hearing. He 
said even if the killing wasn't entirely a hate crime, biases often 
escalate into violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are now clear on is surely Glover is a homophobe and a  
racist,'' he said after a witness testified to hearing Glover use 
derogatory terms about gays and blacks. ``What we need to hear now 
is that Glover had knowledge that, in fact, Winchell was indeed 
gay.''

<HEADLINE> Chiefs DE Browning May Miss Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVER FALLS, Wis. (AP) -- Defensive end John Browning had surgery  
on his right Achilles tendon Wednesday and likely is lost for the 
season, the Kansas City Chiefs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Gunther Cunningham described the injury as being ``high up  
in the Achilles,'' calling that a positive. But he said it was 
unknown how long Browning would be out. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham said Brown's leg ``rolled'' during a drill Monday  
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning, a third-round pick of the Chiefs in 1996, started the  
first eight games last season before a back injury sidelined him 
for the year. His quickness makes him a strong pass rusher from 
left end. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning had missed most of the Chiefs minicamp because of a  
knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Ty Parten was at left end in place of Browning and  
Leslie O'Neal played right defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham said right end Dan Williams, back with the Chiefs  
after holding out all last season, will likely miss the exhibition 
opener Sunday with a quadriceps injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is 95 percent recovered, but now is suffering from a  
bad cold, brought on in part by staying inside with the injury on 
ice.

<HEADLINE> Harvard School Names Roman Catholic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The Rev. J. Bryan Hehir, a Roman  
Catholic priest, was named Wednesday as head of Harvard's Divinity 
School, replacing the dean forced to quit after pornography was 
found on his university-owned computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hehir is the first Catholic to assume the role in a permanent  
capacity. A Harvard divinity graduate himself, Hehir specializes in 
the study of Catholic social teaching and has been a Harvard 
professor of religion and society since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been acting dean since the university asked Ronald F.  
Thiemann to resign last fall for ``conduct unbecoming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Father Hehir is a man of exceptional intellect and  
incisiveness, and he possesses rare human and spiritual qualities 
that make him ideally suited for this important position,'' said 
Harvard President Neil L. Rudenstine. 
</P>
<P>
	Four decades ago, it wouldn't have been possible for a Catholic  
to head an egalitarian institution such as Harvard because of 
church attitudes, Hehir said. In the early 1960s, the Catholic 
Church opened up ecumenical discussions with other Christian faiths 
and world religions. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a kind of symbolic recognition that there was a major  
change going on in Catholicism,'' Hehir said. 
</P>
<P>
	To allow him to continue his commitments as a Catholic priest  
and his role as a counselor with the Catholic Relief Services, the 
58-year-old Hehir will be assisted at the school's helm by several 
other faculty members and associate deans. 
</P>
<P>
	Hehir (pronounced ``hair'') won't actually be called dean, but  
will bear the title of ``chair of an executive committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Primarily, his responsibilities as a Catholic priest are to  
the Catholic Church. Given that, the job has been adjusted slightly 
in order to take advantage of his talents,'' said Joe Wrinn, a 
university spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Hehir has parish responsibilities at Church of the Resurrection  
in Ellicott City, Md., outside Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Another, Catholic priest, the Rev. George W. MacRae, was acting  
dean for several months in 1985 but died of a heart attack at age 
57. 
</P>
<P>
	Hehir said he views the appointment as a ``unique privilege and  
a major challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The privilege, he said, is to lead an institution that was  
established in 1816 as the first nonsectarian theological school in 
the country. The challenge, he said, is to build upon the solid 
intellectual and administrative foundation of Thiemann. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiemann, an ordained Lutheran minister, resigned late last fall  
and is on a one-year sabbatical. Married with two adult children, 
Thiemann had served as dean for nearly 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The university asked him to resign after school computer  
technicians found thousands of pornographic sites on his personal 
computer at his university residence. Thiemann had requested 
technical assistance in transferring files.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Religious Clashes Kill 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- Police and soldiers shot at battling  
mobs of Muslims and Christians in eastern Indonesia on Wednesday as 
street fighting between the religious groups flared, police and 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 25 people have been killed in rioting since Monday in  
Malaku province. Riot police shot and killed some people, witnesses 
said. Mobs stabbed or beat others. 
</P>
<P>
	One person died and four were severely injured when fighting  
erupted Wednesday in Poka, a village near the strife-torn 
provincial capital, Ambon, said Islamic official Imam Rachman. 
</P>
<P>
	``All were shot by security officers,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Jekriel Philip, a spokesman for the Maluku police force,  
confirmed the shootings but denied that officers used live 
ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were forced to shoot rubber bullets at the crowd,'' Philip  
said. ``Some people were hit by live rounds but we have not yet 
determined whether they were fired by policemen or civilians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frightened villagers in Poka said outnumbered officers fired  
directly at rioters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very scared. We can hear shots ringing out  
sporadically,'' Cornelis Pakarbesi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents said the fighting started in Ambon's Mardika and Batu  
Merah neighborhoods, where resentments between Christians and 
Muslims first led to bloody conflicts in January. More than 300 
people have died in the clashes in Malaku, 1,450 miles east of 
Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporadic gunshots and bomb explosions echoed across Ambon  
neighborhoods, while abandoned houses were set ablaze on Wednesday. 
Witnesses said a body was floating near a harborside marketplace in 
Ambon and two men were killed in Gudang Arang, a western 
neighborhood. Some residents reportedly have sought shelter in 
churches, mosques and military facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	An orderly at Ambon's main hospital said doctors have treated at  
least 120 wounded people since Monday night. Officials said police 
were among the injured.

<HEADLINE> Milwaukee Park Damage Minimal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST ALLIS, Wis. (AP) -- Experts inspecting Miller Park have  
found no additional structural damage from a crane collapse that 
killed three people but can't say whether the ballpark will be 
ready for opening day next April. 
</P>
<P>
	The only area that showed significant damage was near first  
base, where the crane fell, according to Michael Duckett, director 
of the board overseeing the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is good news to report,'' Duckett said Wednesday. ``It's  
much what we assumed earlier, but now there's evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the inspection halfway over, Duckett said it's too early to  
tell whether the retractable-roof ballpark will be completed in 
time for its scheduled opening. He said the board was waiting for 
the complete report before putting together a revised construction 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction on the $400 million stadium halted July 14 when a  
crane called ``Big Blue'' collapsed while lifting a 400-ton roof 
section of metal framework, killing the three workers and leaving a 
pile of twisted steel on the field.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Airline Back in Black </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Cathay Pacific Airways said Wednesday it swung  
back to profitability in the first half of the year, although its 
results were hit hard by a dispute with pilots that cost $64 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay said it earned $13.8 million in the six months ended June  
30. That compared with a loss of $22.4 million during the same 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	First-half revenues rose 1.4 percent to $1.7 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased that we have been able to return to  
profitability after facing extremely challenging conditions 
throughout 1998,'' said Cathay's chairman James Hughes-Hallett in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Cathay saw its fortunes improve in several markets,  
including the United States, Indonesia, Korea, and the Philippines, 
average fares remained weak, Hughes-Hallett said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that a January agreement with Cathay's flight  
attendants to fly more hours in exchange for a pay raise has 
boosted productivity and placed the company ``on a much better 
footing'' against its rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	An agreement with the airline's pilots on June 10 also boosted  
Cathay's competitiveness, Hughes-Hallett said. The pilots agreed to 
take an average 8 percent in pay cuts in exchange for stock 
options. 
</P>
<P>
	But before the pilots went along with the deal, they staged a  
sickout that grounded hundreds of flights and hit Cathay revenues 
hard. Cathay had not announced the cost of the dispute until 
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Bison Herd Quarantine May Be Lifted / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT PIERRE, S.D. (AP) -- Brucellosis, a disease that has  
afflicted cattle and calves around the country, could be eliminated 
from the nation's only quarantined private buffalo herd in 15 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Elimination of the disease, which now exists in only a handful  
of cattle herds nationwide, could save many of the nation's farmers 
and ranchers the expense of vaccinating and testing their animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Brucellosis causes cows to abort and become sterile, reduces  
milk production and makes calves sick. It also can cause undulant 
fever in people who drink unpasteurized milk; the debilitating 
disease is usually not fatal but can cause infections of the brain 
and central nervous system and heart dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Holland, state veterinarian and executive secretary of the  
South Dakota Animal Industry Board, said a plan was developed 
earlier this year to rid the Triple U Enterprises buffalo herd of 
brucellosis. The 60,000-acre Triple U ranch, about 30 miles 
northwest of Fort Pierre, once had the nation's largest private 
herd: more than 4,000 head of buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to a $1 billion eradication program, only the Triple U  
buffalo herd and five infected private cattle herds in Texas and 
Missouri still harbor brucellosis, down from 124,000 herds 
nationwide in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time, cattlemen have been concerned about bison and  
brucellosis,'' said Sam Albrecht, executive director of the 
National Bison Association. ``Now we can say ... 'We're not a 
threat to the cattle industry as far as bison are concerned.''' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Albrecht said brucellosis still exists in the public  
bison herd and in wild elk at Yellowstone National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	After running afoul of federal brucellosis regulations, the  
Triple U ranch was quarantined in 1982, preventing sales of live 
buffalo. Instead, buffalo were slaughtered at the ranch, and the 
meat, hides and skulls were sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to rid the herd of brucellosis began in 1990. Holland  
negotiated a deal with the U.S. Agriculture Department to have 
Triple U get rid of around 1,500 infected buffalo in exchange for 
$2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those animals, worth between $4 million and $5 million,  
were slaughtered for human consumption, since brucellosis does not 
affect meat. 
</P>
<P>
	No cattle herds in South Dakota have been infected by  
brucellosis since 1990.

	WESTMINSTER, Md. (AP) -- Maryland farmers, faced with new state  
regulations to curb nutrient runoff, are trying different methods

</P>

	Dozens of Carroll County officials and state agriculture  
officials went on a tour this week of seven farms, ranging from a 
500,000-bird poultry operation to 90-head of cattle dairy farms. 
</P>
<P>
	The group toured a 2,400-hog farm near Taneytown, which features  
a 933,500-gallon earthen holding pond for manure and a homemade 
composting site. At a dairy farm in Melrose, they saw two concrete 
manure storage pits, one costing $66,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Several farms had solar-powered water troughs and were using  
contour crop farming techniques. Farmers also had planted forested 
buffers and planted grassy waterways aimed at filtering run-off 
from farms, increasing natural habitat and shading stream.

<HEADLINE> Boy Scouts Issue Policy Toward Gays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A local chapter of the Boy Scouts of  
America has acknowledged that a Scout can remain a Scout even if 
he's gay, as long as he isn't open about it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Narragansett Council of the Scouts issued a written  
statement late Tuesday in response to controversy over a 
16-year-old Eagle Scout who has threatened legal action, claiming 
he was discriminated against because he is a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement, similar to the military's ``don't ask, don't  
tell'' policy, reaffirmed the group's position that being gay is 
``inconsistent with'' the oath all Scouts must take in which they 
vow to be ``morally straight'' and ``clean in thought, word and 
deed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the statement suggested that Scouts who are covertly gay  
won't be pushed out, by specifying that the organization ``does not 
accept those who openly self-identify as homosexuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds to me like the Boy Scouts are in retreat,'' said  
Mary Bonauto, an attorney with the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and 
Defenders in Boston. ``They acknowledge the sexual orientation of 
their members is none of their business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chapter said the statement had been approved by and written  
in consultation with the Scouts' national organization, which on 
Wednesday referred calls back to Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey Supreme Court recently ruled that the Boy Scouts'  
ban on gays is illegal under the state's anti-discrimination laws. 
The Boy Scouts are appealing that decision to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Evan Wolfson, a New York attorney who successfully represented a  
gay Scout in New Jersey, said the written policy in the Rhode 
Island case is the first time he is aware of that the Boy Scouts 
have put something in writing on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no true national policy that the members have  
adopted,'' he said. ``In past court cases they've defended the 
policy as a flat ban ... and they've made references to 'don't ask, 
don't tell.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He said a `don't ask, don't tell policy' is ``inconsistent with  
the principles of scouting, such as being open and truthful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfson said the policy also could undermine the longtime legal  
argument of the Scouts that they have been consistent in their ban 
on homosexuals.

to put to rest rumors that he is near death. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rumors are absolutely false,'' Nancy Reagan said in a  
statement read to The Associated Press by the Reagans' spokeswoman, 
Joanne Drake. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Reagan suffers from Alzheimer's, a progressive  
disease. However, there has been no dramatic change in his 
condition that would be cause for the alarming rumors that we are 
hearing,'' Mrs. Reagan said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that people would be more sensitive than this to the  
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about Reagan's health have been swirling for weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. News &AMP; World Report item, published Monday, quoted  
unidentified sources as saying Reagan representatives have talked 
about logistics for a state funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Tuesday, an e-mail on Reagan followed some redistributed  
versions of the California Senate Republican Caucus briefing that 
is sent out daily by state Sen. James Brulte, a Republican from 
Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rumors from newsrooms are that Ronald Reagan's health is  
fading and he is on a 36-hour death watch,'' the e-mail said. 
</P>
<P>
	A staffer in the office of state Sen. John Lewis, an Orange  
County Republican, had sent the e-mail to the same group of people 
to which she redistributes the briefing and ``one of the people who 
got that assumed that it came from us,'' Brulte said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the rumors spread through California GOP circles late  
Tuesday, Reagan was enjoying a scoop of sorbet outside Brentwood's 
Haagen-Dazs ice cream shop, manager Abbas Malik said. A Secret 
Service agent purchased the treat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just saw him the other day and he's fine. Quit scaring the  
family,'' son Michael Reagan said. ``My kids have to deal with it. 
People come up to them and they ask me if something's wrong with 
grandpa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan, who disclosed in 1994 that he had the incurable brain  
disorder, now makes weekly appearances at his Century City office 
rather than the daily regimen he had maintained since leaving the 
White House, Ms. Drake said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 88 years old and he maintains as physically active a  
schedule as possible,'' Ms. Drake said. That includes frequent 
Venice beach walks and park visits to watch sporting events, she 
said. On Monday, he swam in his pool at home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was late for an appointment the other day with me at home  
because he got up early and went down to watch some kids fly model 
airplanes,'' Michael Reagan said. ``I'm going to see him tomorrow. 
He's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ronald Peterson of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.,  
visited with Reagan in March and described his condition in a July 
appearance on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is gradually declining with respect to various  
functions. He's having the difficulties most patients have with 
Alzheimer's disease,'' Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average lifespan of someone with Alzheimer's is eight years  
after the disease is diagnosed, but some people live 20 years or 
longer, according to the Chicago-based Alzheimer's Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Four million Americans have the degenerative disease of the  
brain, which attacks memory and eventually leads to total 
dependency on others for help in everyday needs such as eating and 
bathing. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease affects people in different ways, association  
spokesman Danny Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are vulnerable to a lot of things,'' Chung said. ``Your  
body becomes susceptible to pneumonia and other complications.''

<HEADLINE> Spurs Pick Plan for $175M Arena  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The NBA champion San Antonio Spurs selected a  
proposal Wednesday to build a $175 million taxpayer-funded arena on 
the grounds of the county-owned Freeman Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials had pushed for a $203 million arena complex next  
to the downtown Alamodome, where the Spurs now play. 
</P>
<P>
	But Spurs chairman Peter Holt, after morning meetings with both  
sides, said team investors opted for Bexar County's plan to build 
the arena a few miles east of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Spurs now behind the county offer, efforts will proceed  
toward an election to secure voters' approval for arena funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, who complain their operation is unprofitable in the  
Alamodome and want more luxury suites, have made no commitment 
toward helping to fund the new arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The current plan calls for the project to be paid for with hotel  
and rental-car taxes. The Spurs would manage the arena and get 
naming rights.

<HEADLINE> Personal Bankruptcies Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Personal bankruptcies declined 2 percent  
during the 12 months ending June 30, the first yearly decrease 
since 1995, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal bankruptcies in the year ending June 30, numbering  
1,352,030, accounted for 97 percent of new bankruptcies. The total 
number of bankruptcies in that period was 1,391,964. 
</P>
<P>
	New bankruptcies filed during the second quarter of 1999 dropped  
to 345,956 from a record 373,460 during the quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``While bankruptcy filings are still very high, the trend over  
the past six months suggests that 1999 will fall short of last 
year's record pace,'' said Sam Gerdano, executive director of the 
American Bankruptcy Institute.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Damages Downtown Salt Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A tornado touched down without warning  
Wednesday in the downtown area, damaging buildings and causing 
dozens of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The black funnel uprooted trees and tents set up for a retailers  
convention. It also damaged the roofs of the Delta Center, home of 
the Utah Jazz basketball team, and the Salt Palace Convention 
Center. At the nearby Wyndham Hotel, windows were blown out. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had no immediate comment on the number of injured or  
on whether there were fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
	The downtown area looked like a disaster zone with trucks  
overturned, power lines down, windows blown out, shards of glass 
everywhere, and police and firefighters attending to dozens of 
injured. Helicopters were landing to ferry injured to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The streets were littered with shredded tents from the outdoor  
retailer show at the Salt Palace, which was evacuated because of a 
gas leak. It was not known how many people, if any, were trapped 
beneath the beams of the collapsed tents. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Groff of San Diego, attending the retailers convention, said  
he saw several critically injured people in the area around the 
huge outdoor tent housing the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I helped one guy who had a beam fall on him. His knees were  
buckled under his chest. It just crushed him,'' Groff said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he checked the man for vital signs but could not detect  
a pulse as others tried to lift the beam. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Stock of Toronto, a sales representative for a  
rock-climbing company, said he saw the roof of the Delta Center 
lift up when the tornado passed over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It peeled it right back, just like an orange peel,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	David Gross, an exhibitor from Sudbury, Mass., was inside the  
Salt Palace, watching the tornado through a door. It resembled 
billowing black smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was lots of thunder and wind,'' he said. ``The roof  
opened and it ripped off a door. It was over in 15 or 20 seconds 
but it seemed like a lot longer than that. Everything was shaking 
and shaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds of people gathered on streetcorners to watch the funnel  
cloud over the Mormon Church's historic Salt Lake Temple. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy hail the size of marbles preceded and followed the  
tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Alder, meteorologist in charge of the National Weather  
Service, said the location of the tornado was unusual. He said the 
state experiences only two tornados in a typical year. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather service said that at 12:41 p.m., spotters reported a  
severe thunderstorm with 1 1/2-inch-diameter hail over the southern 
end of the Salt Lake Valley in the suburb of Herriman. Other strong 
and possible severe thunderstorms were reported in the area and in 
Davis County to the north.

<HEADLINE> Estate Executor Is No Easy Task / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wanted: Motivated, fair-minded manager to  
identify and gather estate assets; sell and distribute assets; 
provide living expenses for dependents; pay debts, claims and court 
fees; prepare and file tax returns; and develop an investment 
strategy. Must be deadline-oriented. Salary: Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly a dream job, is it? Yet these are just a few of the  
many job requirements of an estate executor, or personal 
representative -- the person chosen to carry out the terms of 
someone's will after death. 
</P>
<P>
	Most folks give scant thought to the selection process,  
routinely naming their spouse or eldest adult child. And that, 
estate planners say, could be a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``The job should be given to the person who can do it the best.  
That doesn't always mean a spouse or child; it could be a trusted 
friend,'' said Edward A. Slott, an accountant from Rockville 
Centre, N.Y., who publishes a weekly newsletter on tax and estate 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people think it's an honor to be chosen, but it's not an  
honor. It's a job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If you've been selected to one day serve as an executor or are  
preparing to name your own, it's crucial to understand all the 
duties and responsibilities involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The executor must make many critical decisions, meet  
court-dictated duties and deadlines, prepare complicated tax 
returns and spend considerable time wrapping up the affairs of the 
deceased. After all, even the simplest estate can take several 
months to more than a year to settle, depending on the probate 
process in a state. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan J. Hoffman, probate surrogate of Hunterdon County in New  
Jersey, knows this all too well and advises residents about to 
undertake the duties of an executor: ``The administration of an 
estate does not divide itself into orderly small compartments with 
each operation waiting upon the completion of another. There may be 
many duties which must be performed simultaneously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, estate planners say, it may be necessary to pick  
more than one executor, or co-executors, to perform various tasks, 
depending on who is best qualified to handle each one. Each can 
keep a check on the other. Such a move also could help family 
harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	But Slott cautioned, ``You may have too many cooks. You may need  
to set up a tiebreaker vote'' from an impartial party, including an 
estate planner or a family attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	At the very least, an alternate personal representative should  
be chosen in the event that the original appointee is unwilling or 
unable to serve. Some states require that an executor be a resident 
of the state where the estate is located. Other restrictions: no 
minors, convicted felons, or non-U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember: You can make changes as often as you like -- adding or  
deleting names -- so long as you're still alive and kicking. If 
there's no valid will when you die, and hence, no executor, the 
court appoints an administrator, usually a bank trust department or 
an attorney, to handle your estate. 
</P>
<P>
	A corporate executor, such as a bank, may be best-suited to  
handle some estates, particularly ones with a large amount of 
assets. Among the advantages of hiring institutions: They never 
move or go on vacation; never die or get sick; have no emotional 
bias; are impartial; and specialize in handing these matters. 
</P>
<P>
	One key disadvantage: The fee can be high, usually 3 percent to  
5 percent of the value of the estate. A beneficiary, on the other 
hand, is more likely to waive a fee for serving as an executor. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want someone human, with genuine concern, not an  
impersonal institution that charges fees for every small act,'' 
said Denis Clifford in his book, ``Plan Your Estate'' (Nolo Press, 
Berkeley, Calif.) ``If your most trusted friend is your banker, 
name him as executor, but not the bank itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with a corporate executor is that it's not family.  
It might be a little cold and rigid,'' agreed Slott. ``I usually do 
it as a last resort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If your child ever needs money or has a special situation, it  
might not be that lenient because it may be afraid it might get 
sued by the other children, or maybe it wants to hold onto the 
assets to maintain its fees. It's also very hard to get out of such 
arrangements,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Slott encourages individuals chosen as executors to get as much  
outside professional help as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``The executor is a major delegator; he shouldn't try to do  
everything himself,'' he said. ``He'll need to hire a lawyer, hire 
an accountant ... out of estate funds. His job is to make sure the 
right people are doing the right jobs.''

<HEADLINE> Alcoa Offers $5.6B for Reynolds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum maker, has  
unveiled a $5.6 billion hostile bid for Reynolds Metals Co., as it 
jockeys to keep its No. 1 ranking amid the planned merger of three 
foreign rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa and Reynolds, the third-largest aluminum maker, would have  
a combined revenue of about $21 billion, rivaling the new marriage 
of Alusuisse-Lonza (Algroup) of Switzerland, Pechiney of France and 
Alcan Aluminium of Canada. Those three have combined revenues of 
$21.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In disclosing the offer Wednesday, Alcoa said it had been  
pursuing Reynolds since March 22 and was trying to get its rival to 
negotiate a deal. It asked for an answer by Monday or it would 
consider other options for closing a deal, presumably including 
taking a hostile offer directly to Reynolds' shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds, based in Richmond, Va., said its board would consider  
the offer Sunday and that it would have no further comment until 
after the close of business Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But shareholders were betting on a bigger bid, sending Reynolds  
shares above the $65-a-share cash and stock offer from Alcoa, in 
part because some analysts have a significantly higher value of 
Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	The flurry of activity in the rather staid aluminum industry was  
not surprising in a world that is increasingly made up of 
mega-companies in such industries as oil and automobiles, said 
Ilker Baybars, senior deputy dean at the Carnegie Mellon Graduate 
Business School in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Such combinations are aimed at keeping the surviving companies  
competitive by cutting costs, through reducing the work force, and 
in improving productivity. No plans for job cuts were immediately 
announced by Alcoa. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of Alcan and the Swiss and French aluminum  
makers is coming about because ``they're really nervous about 
losing their share to the U.S. in global markets,'' Baybars said. 
He said Pittsburgh-based Alcoa simply wants to hold onto its No. 1 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they acquire Reynolds, they will maintain that,'' Baybars  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A combination of Alcoa and Reynolds would unite companies that  
make the basic building blocks for products ranging from 
automobiles, appliances and airplanes to beer and soft-drink cans. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa had $15.3 billion in revenues last year. With operations  
in 31 countries, it is the world's largest producer of alumina, the 
principal ingredient in aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds, with $5.9 billion in revenue last year, has operations  
in 24 countries and is best known for Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil. 
But it also sells consumer products such as plastic wrap and wax 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts said Alcoa's offer -- as well as the European  
merger that would come in the form of a share-swap arrangement -- 
could face significant regulatory hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa first approached Reynolds in March but made its offer  
public on Wednesday in a ``Dear Jerry'' letter to Reynolds' chief 
executive, Jeremiah J. Sheehan, from Alcoa's CEO, Alain J.P. Belda. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusual tactic came just as analysts were absorbing the  
announcement of a three-way deal joining Alcoa's European rivals in 
a pact that would have placed the trio as an undisputed world 
leader in aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the beginning of June you stated publicly Reynolds'  
intention to `look at significant growth that can be achieved 
through merger and acquisition activity,''' Belda wrote Sheehan. 
``You further indicated your belief that our industry is moving 
toward global consolidation' in which Reynolds plans to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think those views are entirely congruent with our prior  
proposal and with our continued desire to negotiate a combination 
of our two companies using Alcoa common shares as the principal 
currency of exchange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa offered $65 in cash per share for about half of Reynolds'  
shares and the equivalent value in Alcoa shares for the rest of the 
stock. Belda indicated a willingness to negotiate an all-stock 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The $65 cash and stock offer represented a 16 percent premium  
over Reynolds' closing price Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa spokeswoman Bonita Cersosimo said the company would not  
discuss anything beyond its news release. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to wait to see how this process unfolds,'' she  
said. ``Above all else we want this to be a friendly negotiation.''

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Fernandez May Miss a Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins pitcher Alex Fernandez may receive  
a cortisone shot Thursday in his sore right shoulder, which would 
force him to miss a start. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, who pitched six innings in Wednesday's 6-5 victory  
over San Francisco, will visit Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham, 
Ala. during the team's off-day Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nothing unanticipated,'' Marlins general manager Dave  
Dombrowski said. ``We've pretty much known all along that at some 
point it was going to happen. It's nothing of major consequence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez is unlikely to go on the disabled list, Dombrowski  
said. The right-hander received a cortisone shot in April and has 
spent two stints on the DL this year while coming back from 
shoulder surgery that forced him to miss the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez allowed four earned runs Wednesday and wasn't involved  
in the decision. He's 6-7 with a 2.98 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Mets Claim Tam Off Waivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Right-hander Jeff Tam was claimed by the Mets on  
waivers from the Cleveland Indians on Wednesday and will rejoin New 
York for the second time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's another arm coming out of the bullpen and we know him  
pretty well,'' Mets general manager Steve Phillips said. ``He's the 
kind of guy who can give us an inning or a couple innings if we 
need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tam, 29, had surgery Dec. 11 to remove bone chips from his right  
elbow and started the season on the disabled list. After a 
rehabilitation assignment at Norfolk of the Triple-A International 
League, he was designated for assignment June 11 and claimed by 
Cleveland seven days later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Tam,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ``I was  
disappointed when he left. He threw strikes and did some good work 
for us last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tam was 1-1 with a 6.28 ERA in 15 games with the Mets last  
season. He made his only appearance with the Indians on July 4, 
allowing three runs, two hits and one walk in one-third of an 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Dan Murray was optioned to Norfolk to make room. He  
made his major league debut Monday against Los Angeles, allowing 
three runs and four hits in two innings during a 9-2 loss.

<HEADLINE> Three-Way Aluminum Merger Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Three huge metal companies announced  
today that they were to merge in a deal to create the world's 
largest aluminum company. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will see Zurich-based Alusuisse-Lonza (Algroup),  
Pechiney of France and Alcan Aluminium of Canada join together, 
passing U.S. firm Alcoa as the world leader in aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies are expected to have combined sales revenues  
of $21.6 billion per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company will provisionally be called  
Alcan-Pechiney-Algroup, or A.P.A., and will be directed from New 
York but registered in Montreal. Alcan boss Jacques Bougie will be 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement issued in Zurich said the merger would come in the  
form of a share swap arrangement, with Alcan shareholders receiving 
44 percent of shares in the new company; Pechiney, 29 percent; and 
Algroup, 27 percent.

	Algroup CEO Sergio Marchionne told reporters he expected to see  
a 5 percent cut in overall staff numbers -- about 4,550 of the 
companies' combined staff of 91,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said the new company expected to achieve $600  
million in yearly savings within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Pechiney chairman Jean-Pierre Rodier said the companies had  
preliminary contact with European Union competition authorities, 
and he expected a decision during the last quarter of this year on 
whether to approve the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am highly confident that we'll go through this process in  
due time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pechiney shares rose 9.9 percent in early trading on the Paris  
Bourse after the company said it will pay its shareholders a 
dividend of $550 million, or $6.77 per share, if the deal succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Algroup shares on the Zurich Stock Exchange fell 3.5 percent on  
profit-taking following the stock's 3.7 percent rise Tuesday. There 
was also disappointment with the company's first-half 1999 results, 
which showed a 4 percent drop in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The news of the merger came the day after the three companies  
announced they were in ``advanced discussions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Algroup pulled out of a planned merger with German  
industrial concern Viag following bitter disagreements over share 
swap arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal-based Alcan is the world's second largest producer of  
aluminum. It recorded sales of $7.8 billion last year and has a 
worldwide capacity of 1.6 million tons of primary aluminum per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pechiney, based in Paris, is the world's fourth-largest producer  
but the top producer in Europe. It operates in 60 countries, has a 
capacity of 1 million tons of aluminum per year and had sales of 
$10.9 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Algroup, the smallest of the three, nearly went broke in the  
1980s after a series of disastrous forays into the United States 
but recorded sales last year $6.4 billion. Last year it produced 
150,000 tons of aluminum, but in previous years that figure has 
been as high as 800,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> David Letterman Staffers Evacuated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A visit by the New York City fire department was  
nothing to worry about for ``Late Show'' host David Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen staffers working in The Ed Sullivan Theater were  
evacuated Wednesday when a construction crew working around the 
corner discovered a crack in the exterior wall of an adjacent 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty to 75 people were cleared from three buildings while  
engineers investigated, but the crack turned out to be nothing 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Letterman himself wasn't there, but that didn't stop him from  
taking advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	He rolled ``dramatic footage'' of the building crack, a man  
covered in tattoos peering at it through binoculars, and a fire 
truck idling on West 54th Street where the hubbub occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all lucky to be alive,'' Letterman quipped during his  
5:30 p.m. taping.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Right-hander Darren Holmes was activated  
Wednesday by the Arizona Diamondbacks, who optioned right-hander 
Erik Sabel to Triple-A Tucson of the Pacific Coast League.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted of Strangling Sisters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The man whose case led to a new  
Florida law expanding public access to information on convicted 
sexual predators has been convicted of murdering two young sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Steven Ault, 33, was found guilty Wednesday of  
first-degree murder in the 1996 strangulations of DeAnn Mu'min, 11, 
and her sister, Alicia Jones, 7, after raping the older girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Ault was also convicted on two counts of capital sexual battery,  
kidnapping and aggravated child abuse. He could face the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Ault confessed to the murders after police found the girls'  
bodies amid the clutter of his attic two days after they were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in the trial was whether Ault should be convicted of  
first-degree or second-degree murder. His defense attorney asked 
the jury to convict him of the lesser crime in an effort to spare 
him from the electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors will reconvene Sept. 22 to make a recommendation on  
whether Ault should be executed or sentenced to life in prison 
without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Ault was on supervised community release for a 1988 sex crime  
when he befriended the girls' mother and picked the girls up from 
school one day and promised them candy. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of Ault's case, legislators passed a bill in 1997  
tightening loopholes on public listings of registered sexual 
predators. 
</P>
<P>
	The law provided several new measures, such as a toll-free  
number to find out information on sexual offenders. Photos of 
offenders are provided on request.

<HEADLINE> Allentown Co. Faulted for Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- An Allentown chemical company denied  
government allegations that it ignored safety at an industrial 
plant leveled by a deadly explosion in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Concept Sciences Inc. was cited Wednesday by the Occupational  
Safety and Health Administration for 20 alleged safety violations, 
including 11 willful violations. The agency proposed penalties of 
$641,200. 
</P>
<P>
	If OSHA's rules had been followed, ``it is more than likely this  
catastrophe would have been avoided,'' OSHA spokeswoman Kate Dugan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five workers died in the Feb. 19 blast.  
</P>
<P>
	A company news release Wednesday said: ``CSI emphatically denies  
that it has ever intentionally taken any action that was a known 
violation with `plain indifference to the law.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it has adequate safety and training. It had not  
yet decided whether to contest the citations and wouldn't comment 
further. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion at the industrial plant in Hanover Township near  
Allentown caused the walls of the 25-foot high building to buckle 
and collapse inward, dumping tons of concrete and steel on workers 
inside and causing nearly $5 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened in a 2,500-gallon fiberglass reinforced charge tank  
containing about 750 pounds of the hazardous chemical 
hydroxylamine, a volatile chemical used by semiconductor makers and 
pharmaceutical companies, OSHA said. The tank was used in the 
distillation process. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency could not determine what ignited the tank, since the  
building was destroyed by the blast.

<HEADLINE> Georgia County Bets on Casino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPARTA, Ga. (AP) -- The economic tide that has buoyed much of the  
Southeast this decade has left Hancock County beached on an 
economic sandbar. 
</P>
<P>
	County leaders have tried everything to attract jobs -- any jobs  
for a population that is overwhelmingly poor and black. They've 
begged for projects no one else wanted: poultry processing plants, 
a landfill, even a waste incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the eastern Georgia county, located between Atlanta and  
Augusta, is going after the jackpot -- building the state's first 
full-scale casino. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no hope here. This has given everybody hope,'' said  
Allen Haywood, editor of the Sparta Ishmaelite, the county's weekly 
newspaper. ``The more I hear about this project, I don't think 
there's another thing in this world that would be better to come 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Building the casino -- along with a 350-room hotel and a golf  
course on a proposed Indian reservation -- would give the local 
economy a multimillion-dollar boost, county officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	And no amount of Bible-thumping by religious opponents or  
opposition from state officials -- including the governor -- has 
discouraged folks in Sparta from seizing the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no jobs in this county for people to work,'' said  
71-year-old Lavonia Bennett. ``With all the jobs they say it's 
going to have, they can go to work instead of sitting around on the 
corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton plantations once thrived in Hancock County, but farming  
waned after World War II and few industries stepped in to take its 
place. The county's population is 82 percent black, the highest 
percentage in Georgia and the fourth highest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The storefronts along Sparta's Broad Street, with their cracked  
paint and faded awnings, are dotted with padlocked doors and 
darkened windows. The Hardee's restaurant at the end of the block 
is closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 30 percent of the approximately 9,500 people in Hancock  
County live below the poverty level. The unemployment rate is 10.7 
percent -- more than double the state average. 
</P>
<P>
	Latimere Harris worries that his 18-year-old daughter, an  
aspiring mechanic, will have to leave town to get a job. ``We need 
something in here,'' said Harris, 69. ``The young people ain't got 
nothing to do around here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News that the tiny Kialegee tribe in Oklahoma had expressed an  
interest in establishing a casino in Hancock County sounded like 
the ticket out of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kialegee, a tribe of about 450, claim that old treaties show  
they were native to Georgia and relocated to Oklahoma as part of 
the Creek Nation. The tribe owns no land in Oklahoma, so it wants 
to buy land here and have it held in trust by the federal 
government, turning it into a reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe had tried several times to build casinos elsewhere but  
had been rebuffed, most recently in Carroll County, Ga., on the 
Alabama line. 
</P>
<P>
	The reception has been very different here.  
</P>
<P>
	Residents packed the courthouse last month to hear the sales  
pitch from the Kialegee. The tribe said up to 3,500 jobs would be 
created in the first year alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been crushed down, stepped on and abused for years. We  
need jobs,'' said Betty Hill, chairwoman of the Hancock County 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Political opposition and federal rules aimed at discouraging  
gambling on new reservations stand in their way. But the tribe 
promises a huge windfall if the county and the state play along -- 
up to $1.25 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, Georgia would become the 27th state to have some  
form of gambling on Indian reservations. There are 260 casinos or 
bingo halls operating on reservations, compared with 70 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	A Las Vegas casino operator already has agreed to put up the  
money to buy about 1,700 acres in Hancock County and build the 
casino in exchange for a share of the profits and the right to run 
the casino for up to seven years, said Ken Baldwin, who represents 
the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be difficult to build the project without the support of  
Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes, who has said he doesn't want casino 
gambling in Georgia. Federal regulations allow tribes to bypass 
governors in some cases, but officials say it's unlikely that will 
happen in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the governor of the state has said `I do not want a casino  
in my state,' that pretty much puts an end to it,'' said Rex 
Hackler, spokesman for the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Even local ministers who oppose the casino say they have little  
reason to fear the gambling hall will ever open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like people in Hancock County in the past have put  
all their eggs in one basket when looking for economic answers. 
They haven't panned out and I don't think this one will either,'' 
said the Rev. Jerry Bradley, pastor of Sparta Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say there's a curse here in Hancock County,''  
he said. ``But it's strange how many things have not worked.''

<HEADLINE> Lions Rep Visits Barry Sanders' Dad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSITY CENTER, Mich. (AP) -- A representative of the Detroit  
Lions went to Wichita, Kan., to visit with the father of recently 
retired running back Barry Sanders. But the elder Sanders said 
today his son wasn't a big topic of conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Hughes, director of security for the Lions, has been at  
William Sanders' home for two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Lions spokesman Bill Keenist said today that Hughes was visiting  
Sanders as a Lions official but he would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a relationship with the family and beyond that I'm not  
going to make any further comment,'' Keenist said. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked why Hughes would leave in the middle of training  
camp, Keenist repeated his statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit News reported that Hughes apparently was hoping to  
set up further talks between Barry Sanders, his family and the 
team's front office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's the start of something good,'' Sanders' father  
told the News. 
</P>
<P>
	But today, Sanders said Hughes just came down to spend some time  
with him. He said the two are friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``We discuss Barry once in a while,'' Sanders said. But he said  
he didn't think the Lions had sent Hughes specifically to discuss 
his son's football future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't discuss my son's future because I don't know what my  
son's intentions are,'' he said. He said he hasn't talked with his 
son since before Barry Sanders announced his retirement last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, who retired from the Detroit Police Department as an  
inspector, has headed the Lions' security department for four 
years. He is a former member of the Harlem Globetrotters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders announced his retirement July 28, the day before the  
team reported to training camp at Saginaw Valley State. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Sanders said his desire to quit football outweighed  
his desire to play. When camp opened July 29, Sanders was in London 
on a European vacation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers Activists Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sixteen Puerto Rican independence advocates  
imprisoned after a wave of bomb attacks on U.S. targets are being 
offered clemency by President Clinton if they renounce the use of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's offer came Wednesday in response to human rights  
officials who argued that the sentences meted out to the 11 men and 
five women were too harsh in light of their crimes. None were 
involved in any deaths, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the FALN -- the Spanish initials for Armed Forces of  
National Liberation -- staged some 130 bomb attacks on political and 
military targets in the United States from 1974 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton offered to commute the sentences, which had ranged from  
15 years to 90 years in prison, if the Puerto Ricans signed 
statements asking for the commutations, agreed to renounce violence 
and abided by all conditions of release set by law or the Parole 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokeswoman Chris Watney declined to explain  
Clinton's reasons for the decision. She did say the Justice 
Department, as is customary, submitted a report and recommendation 
to Clinton, but declined to describe it. 
</P>
<P>
	But administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity  
said Clinton's action was in response to the human rights campaign 
and after a review led by Charles F.C. Ruff, who left his post as 
White House chief counsel on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the president did, based on the recommendation of  
counsel, was grant clemency to individuals on a case-by-case basis 
that recognized the serious nature of the crimes that they were 
convicted of but also took into account the excessive nature of the 
sentences that were imposed upon them 20 years ago,'' one 
administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The persons here were not convicted in cases involving death  
or serious injury,'' the official said. They were convicted, in 
some cases, of armed robbery and supplying resources for FALN 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors branded those convicted for FALN activities as  
terrorists. But in recent months, Puerto Rican and U.S. church 
leaders, politicians and citizens have sent 75,000 signatures to 
the White House to demand the prisoners' freedom. South Africa's 
retired Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu; Coretta Scott King, widow 
of the slain civil rights leader; and three members of Congress are 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came to light shortly after Puerto Rico's governor,  
Pedro Rossello, attended a White House ceremony for Presidential 
Medal of Freedom honorees, including Isolina Ferre, a Puerto Rican 
nun recognized for her work with the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossello, a proponent of Puerto Rican statehood and long an  
opponent of clemency for the prisoners, said Clinton ``did this in 
the most prudent and just manner possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States after the  
Spanish-American War in 1898. It is a U.S. commonwealth that enjoys 
local autonomy but has no vote in Congress or for president. The 
FALN was committed to independence for the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven members of the group would be released immediately from  
prison if they agreed to Clinton's conditions; two others would 
have to serve additional prison time before release; and three 
would have the unpaid balance of their criminal fines canceled, 
according to a Justice Department announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the two who would have to serve additional time also  
would have the unpaid balance of his fine waived. Of the three 
whose only clemency offer was a reduction in fine, two already 
completed their prison sentences in 1994 and the third remains in 
prison with no reduction in his 15-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 original prison sentences for which Clinton offered  
reductions ranged from 35 years to 90 years. He offered to reduce 
them to a range of four years to 44 years. Watney could not 
immediately supply the amount of fines being waived. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombings attributed to the FALN killed six people and wounded  
dozens, but the 11 offered immediate clemency were not directly 
involved the deaths and injuries, officials said. The 13 didn't 
defend themselves at trial, saying they didn't recognize U.S. legal 
jurisdiction over them. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the prisoners were convicted in a $7.5 million armored  
truck robbery in West Hartford, Conn. The 1983 robbery was to 
finance the separatist group Los Macheteros, which has attacked 
U.S. government installations in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	There is precedent for pardons. In 1977 and 1979, President  
Carter pardoned four Puerto Rican nationalists who were convicted 
in a 1954 shooting attack on Congress that wounded five lawmakers. 
Carter also pardoned a fifth nationalist who was convicted of 
plotting to kill President Truman in 1950.

<HEADLINE> Gymnastics Champ Has Surgery on Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Olympic gymnastics champion Dominique Moceanu  
underwent surgery Wednesday to treat a malformation on her right 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the type of thing where you have kind of achy knee  
problems,'' Dr. Jack Jensen told KPRC-TV. ``It doesn't go out on 
you, it's not a ligament thing. It just keeps bothering her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The malformation wasn't caused by gymnastics, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jensen, who performed the operation, said Moceanu will begin  
rehabilitation as early as Thursday but won't be at full strength 
for four months. 
</P>
<P>
	She is scheduled to return to her training base in Colorado  
Springs within the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen said Moceanu has a good chance of rehabilitating the knee  
in time to qualify for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Austraila. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's at the level right now where she's got skill,'' he said.  
``She can do a lot and still shelter that knee over the next few 
months and come back strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu, who most recently won the individual all-around title  
in the 1998 Goodwill Games, has said she hoped that by giving 
herself time to rehabilitate she would still qualify for the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiny gymnast, who at the age of 14 captivated millions  
during the 1996 Olympics, returned to training in late February 
after a high-profile rift with her parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, Moceanu sued for her independence, saying her  
father, Dumitru Moceanu, had squandered the money she had earned in 
a 10-year professional career. 
</P>
<P>
	The gymnast reached a confidential financial settlement with her  
parents and ended a protective order against her father.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers: Fen-Phen Maker Misled Docs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- One of the manufacturers of the diet  
drug combination fen-phen misled doctors about the damage the pills 
could do, a lawyer said as opening arguments began Wednesday in a 
class-action lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Three women are suing Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products  
Corp. on behalf of 94,000 New Jersey residents who are healthy but 
want money for a lifetime of medical checkups. Attorney Esther 
Berezofsky said the pills had increased the plaintiffs' risk for 
heart and lung problems. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first class-action lawsuit over fen-phen to come to  
trial, and the only one seeking checkups rather than financial 
awards. If the company loses the New Jersey case, it could be 
forced to pay more than $1 billion over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a Texas jury awarded $23 million to a woman who sued  
American Home, blaming fen-phen for her heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home made fenfluramine, the ``fen'' half of fen-phen, a  
drug that makes the brain trick the stomach into feeling full. The 
combination was marketed under the brand names Redux and Pondimin 
until 1997, when Podimin -- fenfluramine -- was taken off the market 
after a study linked it to heart valve damage in some patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Berezofsky contended that American Home misled doctors about  
the risks of fen-phen, but defense lawyer Peter Bleakley said the 
company ``acted lawfully and responsibly when it learned of the 
risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the drugs were meant to treat obese people, not people  
wanting to lose a few pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6 million Americans took either fenfluramine or its  
chemical look-alike dexfenfluramine to lose weight. American Home 
faces thousands of other lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated  
with heart valve damage when taken alone and is still on the 
market.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Rare in Utah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tornadoes are often associated with the Midwest, but the  
swirling columns of air and debris can form anywhere if the right 
atmospheric conditions exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether they touch down in Kansas or downtown Salt Lake City,  
twisters need several ingredients found only in large 
thunderstorms: Warm, moist air near the ground, cool air aloft and 
winds that speed up and change direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Some regions of the United States are more vulnerable.  
</P>
<P>
	The Midwest is in an area where warm, wet air from the Gulf of  
Mexico collides with the fast-moving and cooler winds from the 
Rocky Mountains or Canada. Twisters are most likely to occur there 
in the spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, meteorologists in Salt Lake City watched the same  
conditions develop over their state. A severe thunderstorm watch 
was issued at 12:48 p.m.; the twister touched down about seven 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw what was going on,'' said David Toronto, a  
meteorologist for the National Weather Service. ``But to look at it 
and say there's a tornado and it's going to hit downtown -- we 
didn't have that information because of the rapid development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It remained on the ground for about five minutes, he said. Wind  
speeds were estimated to be about 100 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornadoes are rare in Utah. Thirty-two have been reported in the  
last 25 years, said Tim Shy, a researcher at the University of 
Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. Oklahoma recorded 1,326 over the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown areas also offer no special protection, he said. There  
just happen to be more rural than densely urbanized areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we get a `Wizard of Oz' mentality that they occur in  
the middle of nowhere,'' Shy said. ``There have been enough counter 
examples here recently as Oklahoma City, Nashville and downtown 
Miami got hit in the last few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether a tornado strikes a building or a barn, the most  
dangerous aspect is the debris carried by high winds. Researchers 
have discounted theories that pressure differences cause structures 
to explode. 
</P>
<P>
	``The damage comes from wind and flying debris, and we saw that  
downtown today,'' Toronto said.

<HEADLINE> Houston Battles Racial Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Joining a nationwide movement to end racial  
profiling, Houston leaders unveiled a plan Wednesday to study 
whether the city's 5,000 police officers are stopping citizens 
simply because of their skin color. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've watched the growing polarization. We've watched the  
issue of racial profiling go up on the radar screen, particularly 
with the African-American and Hispanic communities, and therefore 
we want to be proactive,'' Mayor Lee Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new program, which will begin immediately, requires officers  
to enter information on the race, age and gender of all people they 
stop or arrest into their patrol car computers. The reports will be 
placed in a database for review by Police Chief C.O. Bradford, 
police managers and the department's Internal Affairs Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston is the latest of several metropolitan cities -- including  
San Diego and San Jose, Calif. -- to attack racial profiling, which 
gained national attention last year through a federal civil rights 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	A 26-year Miami police veteran claimed he was the victim of  
racial profiling when a white Orlando police officers stopped him 
in 1997 for alleged minor traffic offenses. The black officer, who 
was doused with pepper spray and wrestled to the ground, later was 
sentenced to one year of probation for resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, President Clinton issued an executive order calling for  
federal law enforcement agencies to collect race and gender data in 
all stops and arrests. State lawmakers around the nation have 
scrambled to pass similar legislation, but so far only North 
Carolina has enacted laws.

<HEADLINE> Suzanne Somers Plans To Stay Thin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Suzanne Somers knows she's under a lot of pressure to stay thin.  
But she vows that she will never ``diet'' again. 
</P>
<P>
	As the author of two weight-loss books and pitchwoman for her  
ThighMaster and ButtMaster exercise products, Somers, 52, knows the 
public keeps an eye on her figure -- watching what she eats and how 
she exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be a messenger without following through,'' she said  
in a telephone interview from her Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
	Years ago, while on the set of the hit '70s sitcom, ``Three's  
Company,'' Somers said she would make daily trips to the food table 
for a cookie or a piece of chocolate with no adverse effect on her 
waistline. 
</P>
<P>
	When she turned 40, she began gaining weight.  
</P>
<P>
	``My metabolism betrayed me,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	After taking an ineffective ride on the ``diet roller coaster,''  
she began meeting with nutritionists and doctors who explained that 
as people age, it takes them longer to digest food. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar and high-starch carbohydrates, like white flour pasta and  
breads, were responsible for her weight gain, she said, because 
they store energy as fat cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1992, she has followed a system of eating a lot of  
protein, fruits, vegetables and whole grains. ``For the last few 
years, it's been my great secret: How do I eat so much and stay 
thin?'' she said. She now weighs about 116 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Somers started writing down recipes on scraps of paper and  
photocopying them to give to friends. Then, at the urging of 
husband Alan Hamel, she put the recipes in a book. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eat Great, Lose Weight'' was published in 1996. Somers' new  
book, ``Get Skinny on Fabulous Food,'' was just published (Crown, 
$24). Both books are best sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Get Skinny'' contains recipes for Moroccan Chicken with  
Preserved Lemon Rinds, Marinated Grilled Butterflied Leg of Lamb, 
and Chocolate Souffle with Whipped Cream and Hot Chocolate Sauce. 
(She does not include nutritional information with her recipes.) 
</P>
<P>
	She believes in ``food combining,'' which she defines as eating  
certain foods together and keeping others separate to aid 
digestion. She also believes in eliminating sugar and high-starch 
foods. 
</P>
<P>
	And she has a simple message for scientists who might discount  
her methods: ``science schmience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her system works, and that's what matters, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Somers follows a regular exercise routine, meeting with a  
trainer for about 35 minutes three times a week and throwing her 
ThighMaster into her suitcase when she travels. 
</P>
<P>
	Her life is busy. In addition to writing books and running her  
fitness business, she also appears on ``Candid Camera,'' which airs 
on CBS. Somers said she uses cooking as ``a kind of Zen'' that 
allows her to be focused and creative, yet relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
	She traces her love of cooking to her childhood, when she made  
her first beef stroganoff at 9. She enjoys preparing meals for 
guests and has fed 40 people at a party. 
</P>
<P>
	Does she consider herself an actress first, an author, even a  
chef? 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has a career like mine,'' she said. ``I'm a  
hyphenate.''

<HEADLINE> Route 66 To Be Refurbished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- New kicks are in store for Route 66.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton late Tuesday signed a law that supports state,  
local and private efforts to preserve Route 66 with $10 million 
over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``mother road,'' commissioned in 1926 and decommissioned in  
1985, traversed eight states and 2,448 miles between Chicago and 
Santa Monica, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	It inspired a 1960s television series about traveling the West  
and at least two songs by Nelson Riddle and Bobby Troupe. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``get your kicks on Route 66'' lyrics are Troupe's. The  
``mother road'' label belongs to John Steinbeck and his 1930s Dust 
Bowl classic, ``The Grapes of Wrath.'' Those displaced Oklahomans 
weren't the only ones to head West on U.S. 66. After World War II, 
it became the thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``America became more mobile than it had ever been,'' said Eric  
Szeman, co-owner of Albuquerque's Route 66 Malt Shop, who made the 
Route 66 trek himself with his parents in 1954. ``The mass 
migration westward was pretty much handled by Route 66.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Szeman hopes Albuquerque will gain a hefty share of the $10  
million earmarked for Route 66 restoration. Martin Zanzucchi, a 
Flagstaff, Ariz., restaurateur instrumental in getting Flagstaff's 
Santa Fe Street renamed Route 66, hopes the bill will do the same 
for his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means little towns like Flagstaff can apply for funding to  
repair parts of the old roads or to get some landscaping or 
park-like settings,'' Zanzucchi said after Congress approved the 
bill July 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists still retrace the route. An Italian couple shipped  
their Motoguzzi motorcycle to Chicago to ride west in tandem, and a 
German couple arranged to pick up their new Harley-Davidsons in Los 
Angeles for their eastbound Route 66 trek, Szeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the fellow from Ireland whose European travel club  
plans to ship in the 30 vintage U.S. cars they've collected. 
``They're going to ship them to Chicago and do the Route,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Milner, star of television's ``Route 66,'' hit the road  
again for a video issued last year. ``Route 66, Return to the Road 
With Martin Milner'' takes viewers on a historical-cultural 
nostalgia trip in two volumes. The eastern leg takes viewers across 
Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma. The western portion 
crosses Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.

<HEADLINE> Study: Allergy Shots Block Symptoms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Monthly allergy shots can lessen the torment of hay fever years  
after the shots are stopped, according to a study in today's New 
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the Imperial College School of Medicine in London  
found that patients who received immunotherapy monthly for three or 
four years reported weaker symptoms of the grass-pollen allergy 
three years after stopping the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may never relapse into symptoms as severe as what they  
had originally,'' said Samantha Walker, one of the study's authors. 
``In carefully selected patients, this form of treatment is 
extremely effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 20 percent of people in the United States and northern  
Europe have hay fever. Allergy shots were the primary treatment 
until the 1940s, when antihistamine medications were introduced, 
but the shots are still widely used. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers asked patients to keep detailed diaries of their  
hay fever symptoms in 1993, '94 and '95. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found little difference between the severity of  
symptoms reported by patients who had continued allergy-shot 
treatment during the three-year trial and those who got dummy 
shots. Those who had never had immunotherapy reported much more 
severe symptoms than the others. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also found that the immune systems of the  
patients who discontinued treatment produced less of the 
allergen-fighting substances that cause runny noses and other hay 
fever symptoms than the untreated group. Those who maintained 
allergy-shot treatment had even fewer of those symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the clearest demonstration of a long-term effect of  
immunotherapy that I'm aware of,'' said Dr. Marshall Plaut, chief 
of the Allergic Mechanisms Section at the National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said their findings and other studies suggest  
that starting immunotherapy sooner after an allergy appears, 
particularly in children, could prevent the allergy from becoming 
severe and prevent development of additional allergies. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may lower the bar for me to start people a little earlier  
on immunotherapy,'' said Dr. Leonard Bielory, director of the 
Asthma and Allergy Research Center at the University of Medicine 
and Dentistry of New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> New Pill Treats Deadly Brain Tumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patients who have run out of options to fight  
a particularly deadly brain tumor are about to get a new therapy 
that could prolong their lives a little with apparently few side 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved the first  
new chemotherapy for brain tumors in 20 years, a drug called 
Temodar designed for adults whose anaplastic astrocytomas have 
failed treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Temodar is not a wonder drug, ... not the cure drug that we're  
looking for,'' cautioned Dr. Alred Yung, oncology chairman at M.D. 
Anderson Cancer Center, who tested the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's better than what we have had,'' because patients can  
take Temodar at home with fewer side effects than many 
alternatives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Temodar, known chemically as temozolomide, is an oral form of  
chemotherapy. Patients would take pills at home for five days a 
month -- every month until their tumors seem to stop responding. 
</P>
<P>
	About 18,000 brain tumors are diagnosed in the United States  
each year. Anaplastic astrocytomas are one of the worst kinds, 
accounting for 2,000 to 3,000 new cases a year. These rapidly 
growing, hard-to-treat tumors typically kill within two to three 
years of diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Temodar is one of a new class of cancer drugs. Schering-Plough  
Corp. tested it against anaplastic astrocytomas in patients who 
relapsed despite surgery, radiation and other chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve of 54 patients -- a fairly impressive 22 percent -- had  
their tumors significantly shrink or temporarily disappear, the FDA 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was tiny and did not compare Temodar to older  
chemotherapies, so it's hard to say if Temodar will prove better 
than other cancer drugs that doctors now try as last-ditch efforts. 
But Yung said he believed that was a better response than doctors 
get other alternatives -- plus it's easier to take. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only can patients take the pills at home, but side effects  
proved milder than for many chemotherapies. The most common 
reactions were mild nausea and vomiting, headaches and mild immune 
suppression. Schering-Plough Corp. said side effects were severe in 
less than 10 percent of patients, and the FDA said most patients 
had their immune systems recover without having to delay treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Even for those people Temodar helped, it's not a cure, Yung  
stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	But the median duration of Temodar's effect was 12 1/2 months --  
meaning half of patients began relapsing sooner but half lasted 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Yung's patients, 59-year-old Larry Sager of Beaumont,  
Texas, has seen his tumor stop growing for a full 1 1/2 years -- after 
surgery, radiation and a type of surgically implanted chemotherapy 
patch all failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for'' Temodar, Sager said  
Wednesday. ``When I asked him (the doctor) my options, he said not 
to do anything, and then I'd have two months. That wasn't for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other than slight constipation the five days a month that he  
takes Temodar, ``I had no side effects whatsoever,'' Sager said. 
</P>
<P>
	Temodar, ``as a lower toxicity drug, is of paramount importance  
to these patients,'' said Naomi Berkowitz, executive director of 
the American Brain Tumor Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Temodar will be available next month, Schering said. Dosage  
varies according to patients' size, but company figures suggest the 
average treatment will cost about $1,500 a month wholesale.

<HEADLINE>  Alleged L.A. Gunman Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The man accused of wounding wounded five people  
at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles turned himself in today 
to the FBI here. A source said he confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokeswoman Julie Miller in Washington confirmed the  
surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who identified himself as Buford O. Furrow, 37, said he  
took a cab from Los Angeles, an agency source said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	He told investigators ``he wanted this to be a wake-up call to  
America to kill Jews,'' an the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked into the office and said, ``You're looking for me, I  
killed the kids in Los Angeles.'' The source said said Furrow 
assumed he had killed some children there. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said further details would be provided at a news  
conference this afternoon by the Los Angeles police department. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the hunt for Furrow had spread across the West amid  
reports the suspect had ties to white supremacist groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman gave the slip to police who arrived a the center  
within four minutes of the shootings Tuesday. He allegedly 
carjacked a Toyota at gunpoint about 20 minutes later -- leaving 
behind a van full of ammunition, survival paraphernalia, and a book 
some link to white supremacist thought -- then dumped the car at a 
motel and disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt about it that this is now a hate crime,''  
said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los 
Angeles. He spoke before the arrest of Furrow was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Craig Hum said that  
he had filed a warrant charging Furrow with five counts of 
attempted murder, a procedure that allows authorities in Las Vegas 
to hold him for extradition to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're charging him with the crime of deliberate, premeditated  
attempted murder,'' Hum said. Authorities will begin extradition 
proceedings after an arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern Poverty Law Center, which maintains a database of  
white supremacists, has information that Furrow belonged to Aryan 
Nations in 1995, including a photo, said Mark Potok of the 
Montgomery, Ala.-based center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a picture of him, Furrow, in a Nazi outfit,'' Potok  
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow lived at times in Metaline Falls, Wash., once a haven for  
the supremacist group the Order, The Spokesman-Review reported in 
Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as a security guard at a white supremacist meeting in  
the 1990s and had a relationship with Debbie Mathews, widow of 
Order founder Robert J. Mathews, the paper said. Mathews was killed 
in 1984 when his hideout caught fire during a shootout with federal 
agents on Whidbey Island in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not immediately describe the shootings at the North  
Valley Jewish Community in suburban Granada Hills a hate crime, but 
have said the choice of targets makes that a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacker strode into the community center's lobby and opened  
fire with a semiautomatic gun resembling an Uzi, peppering the 
building with some 70 shots. A center maintenance worker threw his 
body over an injured teen, while teachers and other workers led 
children to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing said by the suspect before the shooting,''  
Police Chief Bernard Parks said. ``It was indiscriminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wounded include a 5-year-old boy who was hit in the abdomen  
and leg. He was in critical condition today after undergoing six 
hours of surgery and was given a fair chance of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hurt were center receptionist, 68-year-old Isabelle  
Shalometh, two 6-year-old boys and a 16-year-old girl who was a 
counselor at the center's summer camp that began Monday. The boys 
and the counselor were in stable condition today and Mrs. 
Shalometh, grazed on the arm and back as she dove for cover, was 
released from the hospital Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center today, staff, parents and children slowly trickled  
back to summer programs under the gaze of armed security guards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good because my father's here,'' said Abby Dreyfuss,  
10, who arrived hand-in-hand with her father, Jonathan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's going to scare us away,'' said J. Eliad, a parent who  
was bringing his 4-year-old daughter back. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence was the latest shooting at workplaces and schools  
across the country, and brought immediate calls for stricter gun 
control and measures to protect children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by  
gun violence,'' President Clinton said in Washington. ``It calls on 
all of us not only to give our thoughts and prayers to the victims 
and their families, but intensify our resolve to make America a 
safer place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The organization that runs the community center posted armed  
guards at its several other operations in the region, and security 
was stepped up at children's programs in other states, said Nina 
Lieberman Giladi, an associate vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	She said children, including her son who saw two bleeding  
victims, wanted to get together with the other children to reassure 
themselves they were safe. She said her son ``just wanted to talk. 
He wanted to talk about his friends, talk about what happened, talk 
about why this man did this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report of the carjacking and discovery of the abandoned van  
came within 20 minutes and 4 miles of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the red-and-white van, officers found large amounts of  
ammunition in metal boxes, magazines for an assault rifle, a 
booklet titled Ranger Handbook and freeze-dried food. Various news 
reports have said there was a copy of the book ``War Cycles, Peace 
Cycles'' by Richard Kelly Hoskins, which the Southern Poverty Law 
Center says is a staple of hate group literature. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours later, the carjacked Toyota was found parked outside  
a motel in Chatsworth, another suburb in the San Fernando Valley, 
but hours of cautious searching by SWAT teams failed to turn up the 
gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	Police refused to say how the search was being conducted today,  
but said it involved the FBI and spread to Washington state and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The abandoned van was purchased Saturday from the Tacoma (Wash.)  
Kar Korner, said the manager of the lot, who refused to be 
identified. Cmdr. Dave Kalish, a Los Angeles police spokesman, 
identified Furrow as the buyer of the van, which had Washington 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents visited an Olympia, Wash., home believed to be that  
of Furrow's father Tuesday night. The FBI refused to comment on the 
visit and nobody in the house would speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times reported that late last year Furrow tried to  
commit himself at the Fairfax Psychiatric Hospital in Kirkland, a 
Seattle suburb, but got in trouble when he pulled a knife on 
staffers and eventually pleaded guilty to second-degree assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow satisfied his sentence for the assault, said Arthur  
Wallenstein, director of the King County Adult Detention in 
Seattle. Burrow was booked into jail Dec. 11, served all his time, 
received credit for 165 days and was released by a judge May 21 
this year.

<HEADLINE> Swapping Real Estate May Save Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Here's a problem you may share. You have  
accumulated rental property in a distant state that has increased 
substantially in value, but as you head into retirement you would 
rather own rental property closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
	Or you want to sell farmland in the Midwest so you can buy an  
apartment building in New York City. Or you own an office building 
you want to sell so you can buy a vacation home in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	In all of these cases, assuming the property you own has  
increased in value, you normally would have to pay taxes on the 
gain made from the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer to your tax problem may lie in a less-than-familiar  
tax strategy known as a 1031 like-kind exchange, according to 
Michelle Augustine, an academic associate at the College for 
Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benefit of a 1031 exchange is you can swap a piece of  
property for another and avoid the capital-gains taxes. You also 
can use it to consolidate several pieces of property into a single 
property, or swap raw land that doesn't produce much income for 
income-producing property such as rental homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Augustine cautions, this is a tax strategy you will  
want professional advice for. If it isn't done right, it can end up 
costing you money instead of saving money. 
</P>
<P>
	First, understand that you can exchange only investment-type  
property for other investment-type property: farms, ranches, 
commercial property, rental homes or apartments, raw land. 
</P>
<P>
	You can't swap the property for a new personal residence, or  
swap your current residence for another residence. The latter isn't 
much of problem anymore for most people, Augustine notes, because 
homeowners can protect up to $500,000 in home-sale profits from 
capital-gains taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	But retirees or people heading into retirement may well have  
accumulated investment property, such as the family farm or rental 
property. Its sale could trigger substantial capital-gains taxes. 
By exchanging the investment property for other investment 
property, you can delay or even avoid the taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, suppose you want to sell an office building and use  
the proceeds to buy a vacation home. First, consult with your tax 
or financial adviser to determine whether both properties are 
suitable for a 1031 exchange (1031, incidentally, refers to a 
section of the tax code). 
</P>
<P>
	Augustine especially cautions about the adjusted cost basis of  
the property -- the price you paid for the property plus capital 
improvements, minus depreciation. Significant depreciation of the 
property over the years could prove less favorable in this type of 
transaction, she says, and could even result in an exchange 
becoming taxable. The tax bracket you are in also is a factor, she 
adds. The higher your tax bracket, generally the more beneficial a 
like-kind exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	If an exchange makes financial sense, the next step is to find  
an intermediary -- technically referred to as an accommodator -- who 
handles the exchange, for a fee. Like-kind exchanges can be done 
directly between two parties, but typically it's tough to find 
someone who wants to swap straight across. Whoever owns the 
vacation home you want probably doesn't want your office building. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, you sell your office building and the cash from the  
sale goes to the intermediary, who holds it in escrow and 
eventually uses it to purchase the vacation home you want, which 
you must rent out so it is treated as investment property. 
</P>
<P>
	Augustine says you must identify the property you want to swap  
for (called replacement property) within 45 days from the close of 
escrow of the property you sold (relinquished property). You have 
180 days from closing to acquire the replacement property. If you 
don't meet these deadlines, the transaction will be treated as a 
sale and you'll end up paying capital-gains taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with a successful like-kind exchange, you may end up paying  
some capital-gains taxes. For example, your office building might 
be worth more than the vacation home you want to swap for. The 
leftover cash from the sale that wasn't used to buy the vacation 
home is distributed to you, and you must pay capital-gains tax on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	If you eventually sell the vacation home you swapped your office  
building for, you'll have to pay capital gains taxes, though you've 
received the financial benefit of postponing taxes. However, you 
might be able to avoid the taxes entirely, Augustine says. 
</P>
<P>
	One solution: you could leave the home in your estate and pass  
it on to your heirs. They in turn could sell it potentially free of 
tax. Or you could move into the vacation home you've been renting 
out, make it your principal residence for at least two years and 
then sell the home. You then could protect gains up to $500,000 
from taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``People need to be cautious about doing like-kind exchanges,  
and they need good consultation,'' Augustine says. ``But they also 
need to look seriously at doing this. So often people miss 
opportunities to do something with their property that might 
provide tax benefits.''

<HEADLINE> Airline Bomb-Screening Lapses Cited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Bomb detection machines installed at the nation's  
major airports are being underutilized by many airlines, according 
to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	The CTX 5000 machines are intended to scan the baggage of people  
identified as high security risks by a passenger-screening process. 
</P>
<P>
	The CTX 5000 is being installed in 100 airports nationwide.  
</P>
<P>
	It can process 225 bags an hour, but a government audit found  
some airlines run as few as four bags an hour through the $1 
million machines, the Chicago Tribune reported in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The utilization is starting to increase, but not at the rate  
that we and the inspector general's office would like to see,'' 
said Monte Belger, the acting deputy director of the Federal 
Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA's immediate goal is for the airlines to run 2 percent to  
20 percent of all checked baggage -- depending on perceived security 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	But nationally, the CTX 5000s now screen less than 1 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Airlines complain that widespread use of the scanners will  
disrupt flight timetables because of the additional time it takes 
to complete the screening process. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA says scanning takes 15 seconds or less per bag on  
average -- longer if possible contraband is detected or if the unit 
gives off a false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the Air Transport Association, which  
represents the carriers, declined to give interviews about the CTX 
5000, citing security concerns, the Tribune reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are issues that we believe are not beneficially aired in  
public,'' said John Meenan, the association's senior vice president 
for industry policy.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Say Goodbye to Garcia, Ward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Freddy Garcia and Turner Ward may have played  
their final games for the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, a power-hitting infielder-outfielder who began the 1998  
season as the Pirates' starting third baseman, was designated for 
assignment Wednesday to clear a roster spot for shortstop Mike 
Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin broke his left index finger July 22 against the Cubs.  
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, 27, must clear options before he can join a Pirates farm  
club. If he is not claimed, the Pirates have 10 days to trade him, 
release him or reassign him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get to play much over here,'' he said. ``It was tough  
because I wasn't playing very much. I would like to go to another 
team where maybe I could play more. They just have a lot of guys 
over her and they can't play everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia was batting .233 with six homers and 23 RBIs as a  
part-time third baseman and outfielder and was in a 2-for-18 slump. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-handed hitting Garcia showed flashes of power -- he hit  
a combined 31 homers with the Pirates (9) and Nashville (22) -- last 
season -- but had trouble hitting for average in the majors and was 
below-average defensively. 
</P>
<P>
	He has never been able to channel his considerable power into a  
fulltime job. He would often hit a 420-foot homer, then go into a 
slide. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got upper-deck power, and you don't like to give up on a  
player with that kind of power,'' manager Gene Lamont said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward, the 34-year-old outfielder who has been on the disabled  
list most of the season, cleaned out his Three Rivers Stadium 
locker after ending his rehabilitation assignment at Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	He has used up all of his rehabilitation time, and the Pirates  
have no plans to activate him soon, even though he told trainer 
Kent Biggerstaff that his sore right knee feels better than it has 
in months. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Cam Bonifay said Ward will continue his  
rehabilitation at his home in Saraland, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward hit .209 in 91 at-bats earlier this season and, despite  
having more walks (13) than strikeouts (nine), scored only two 
runs. He was 1-for-15 as the Pirates' chief pinch-hitter in April 
and early May. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward's situation would seem to be much like that of infielder  
Doug Strange, who cleaned out his locker in spring training before 
undergoing season-ending right elbow surgery. There is almost no 
chance he will play for the Pirates again. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward played previously for Cleveland, Toronto and Milwaukee. He  
was out of baseball, except for coaching his son's T-ball team, 
when the Pirates offered him a minor league contract in April 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The outfielder was called up later this season and was one of  
the pleasant surprises on a team that stayed in the division race 
until the final week of September, batting .353 in 167 at-bats with 
seven homers and 33 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward's average slipped to .262 with nine homers and 46 RBIs in  
282 at-bats as the Pirates' fourth outfielder last season.

<HEADLINE> Divorce Rate Study Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Adult children of divorced parents are less  
likely to dissolve their own marriages than they were two decades 
ago, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	While divorce has become more accepted in American society, the  
gap in the divorce rates of adults who were raised in broken homes 
and those from intact families has also narrowed, according to a 
study presented during the American Sociological Association's 
annual meeting in Chicago this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The research was based on a National Opinion Research Council  
survey of 21,963 adults that spanned more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, children of divorce were nearly three times more likely  
than their counterparts from intact families to divorce, the study 
said. By 1996, that number was down to 50 percent more likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas Wolfinger, a sociologist at the University of Utah who  
authored the study, said the trend will probably continue into the 
next century as the children of recent divorces grow into 
adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirty or 50 years ago divorce was so rare, so unacceptable,  
that only the worst marriages broke up,'' Wolfinger said Wednesday. 
``Of course, the children of those marriages carried the 
experiences of growing up in terrible family circumstances with 
them into their own marital relationships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, couples generally opt for divorce before their children  
have to witness the devastation and therefore have the opportunity 
to have healthier relationships, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor in the decline is that fewer adult children of  
divorced parents are getting married at all, the study found. That 
is a turnaround from the mid-70s, when the same group was 36 
percent more likely to get married than children of intact 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfinger said divorce still has an effect on the next  
generation's relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that the divorce rates for people from divorced  
families and intact families will ever be the same,'' he said. 
``Divorce will always be hard on kids. It's just not nearly as hard 
on them as it used to be.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Weighs Rival Draft Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's got to be one of the least politically  
popular proposals in years: reviving the draft to keep the military 
from losing its post-Cold War battle with attrition. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's just what some military-minded lawmakers are  
suggesting may be necessary if the services can't fill their ranks 
due to growing recruitment and re-enlistment shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon is dead set against any talk of reviving the draft,  
suggesting the 26-year-old all-volunteer force is a great success, 
despite current recruiting problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, just as talk is growing over whether to revive the  
draft, the House is prepared to take up legislation that would do 
just the opposite: terminate the Selective Service System. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress seems to be moving in two directions at once in this  
particular case,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon observed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dueling proposals underscore the attention Congress is  
giving to the issue of military readiness and the difficulties the 
services are having in recruiting and keeping people at a time of 
growing peacekeeping deployments and higher-paying private-sector 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	House Armed Services Chairman Floyd Spence, R-S.C., calls the  
military's recruiting and retention problem ``a desperate situation 
that keeps getting worse'' and suggests returning to some form of 
compulsory military service. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Herbert Bateman, R-Va., chairman of the subcommittee on  
readiness; Steve Buyer, R-Ind., chairman of the military personnel 
subcommittee; and Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C, former chairman of 
the Senate Armed Services Committee, have also suggested a fresh 
look at reviving the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	But such suggestions are not receiving wide support.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned about the trends away from public service, both  
the military and otherwise,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, 
senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. ``The recruiting 
goals are not being met except by the Marines. But I don't' think 
that's a good reason to reinstate the draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the Army had an authorization for 480,000  
positions but was down to 469,400. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's about a 10,000 shortage,'' Skelton said. ``Do you  
really want to reinstate the draft to get 10,000 soldiers? I 
question that. We'll just have to do a better job of retention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force may fall 2,500 recruits short of its annual goal  
and come up 1,400 pilots short of requirements, and the Navy 
projects a shortage of 22,000 sailors. Only the Marine Corps, the 
smallest service, seems capable of meeting recruitment goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Skelton and others point to a military compensation package near  
final passage in Congress that would provide the biggest increase 
in pay and retirement benefits since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes an across-the-board 4.8 percent pay raise to take  
effect next January, with additional increases set at half a 
percentage point above the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Air Force Col. Paul Arcari, director of the Retired Air  
Force Officers Association, said the new compensation package will 
go a long way toward making military pay and benefits more 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Arcari characterized reviving the draft as ``politically  
unpalatable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said the Defense Department is  
working hard to fix ``recruiting problems, many of which reflect 
the strong economy. ... The military has to show more imagination 
and hard work to meet its recruiting goals, and I believe we're 
doing that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that as long as our all-volunteer force does its  
job well in protecting the national interests, there should not be 
a need for a national mobilization,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said, the Selective Service System, which  
continues to register 18-year-old men for a potential military 
call-up, ``provides a very good backup, should that be necessary 
someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A provision to shut down the 59-year-old agency is tucked in a  
spending bill to be taken up when the House returns after Labor 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee approved the agency  
termination before the August recess with little debate, mostly as 
a cost-cutting move. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no advance warning,'' said Lew Brodsky, the  
service's director of public and congressional affairs. He noted 
Selective Service survived previous attempts to abolish it, in 1993 
and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Randy Cunningham, R-Calif., has said he'll mount an effort  
on the floor to restore the funds and save the agency.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers: Fen-Phen Maker Misled Docs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- One of the manufacturers of the diet  
drug combination fen-phen misled doctors about the damage the pills 
could do, a lawyer said as opening arguments began Wednesday in a 
class-action lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Three women are suing Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products  
Corp. on behalf of 94,000 New Jersey residents who are healthy but 
want money for a lifetime of medical checkups. Attorney Esther 
Berezofsky said the pills had increased the plaintiffs' risk for 
heart and lung problems. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first class-action lawsuit over fen-phen to come to  
trial, and the only one seeking checkups rather than financial 
awards. If the company loses the New Jersey case, it could be 
forced to pay more than $1 billion over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a Texas jury awarded $23 million to a woman who sued  
American Home, blaming fen-phen for her heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home made fenfluramine, the ``fen'' half of fen-phen, a  
drug that makes the brain trick the stomach into feeling full. The 
combination was marketed under the brand names Redux and Pondimin 
until 1997, when Pondimin -- fenfluramine -- was taken off the market 
after a study linked it to heart valve damage in some patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Berezofsky contended that American Home misled doctors about  
the risks of fen-phen, but defense lawyer Peter Bleakley said the 
company ``acted lawfully and responsibly when it learned of the 
risks.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Death Upheld for N.J. Girl's Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Supreme Court on Wednesday  
affirmed the conviction and death sentence for the man accused of 
raping and killing 7-year-old Megan Kanka, whose death prompted a 
national movement to keep track of sex offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The court in a 4-3 ruling rejected arguments by defense  
attorneys that Jesse Timmendequas' 1997 trial was tainted by 
publicity because it was only a few miles from the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Timmendequas, 38, was convicted of luring the girl into his  
home, raping and strangling her and dumping her body in a park. He 
had been convicted twice of serious sex crimes, but the Kanka 
family, who lived across the street from him in quiet Hamilton 
Township, had no idea of his past. 
</P>
<P>
	The murder led to ``Megan's Laws'' to keep track of convicted  
sex offenders after their release from prison and to provide 
community notifications on the whereabouts of the most dangerous 
ones.

<HEADLINE>  Alleged L.A. Gunman Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The man accused of wounding wounded five people  
at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles turned himself in today 
to the FBI here. A source said he confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokeswoman Julie Miller in Washington confirmed the  
surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who identified himself as Buford O. Furrow, 37, said he  
took a cab from Los Angeles, an agency source said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	He told investigators ``he wanted this to be a wake-up call to  
America to kill Jews,'' an the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked into the office and said, ``You're looking for me, I  
killed the kids in Los Angeles.'' The source said said Furrow 
assumed he had killed some children there. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said further details would be provided at a news  
conference this afternoon by the Los Angeles police department. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the hunt for Furrow had spread across the West amid  
reports the suspect had ties to white supremacist groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman gave the slip to police who arrived a the center  
within four minutes of the shootings Tuesday. He allegedly 
carjacked a Toyota at gunpoint about 20 minutes later -- leaving 
behind a van full of ammunition, survival paraphernalia, and a book 
some link to white supremacist thought -- then dumped the car at a 
motel and disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt about it that this is now a hate crime,''  
said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los 
Angeles. He spoke before the arrest of Furrow was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Craig Hum said that  
he had filed a warrant charging Furrow with five counts of 
attempted murder, a procedure that allows authorities in Las Vegas 
to hold him for extradition to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're charging him with the crime of deliberate, premeditated  
attempted murder,'' Hum said. Authorities will begin extradition 
proceedings after an arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern Poverty Law Center, which maintains a database of  
white supremacists, has information that Furrow belonged to Aryan 
Nations in 1995, including a photo, said Mark Potok of the 
Montgomery, Ala.-based center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a picture of him, Furrow, in a Nazi outfit,'' Potok  
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow lived at times in Metaline Falls, Wash., once a haven for  
the supremacist group the Order, The Spokesman-Review reported in 
Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as a security guard at a white supremacist meeting in  
the 1990s and had a relationship with Debbie Mathews, widow of 
Order founder Robert J. Mathews, the paper said. Mathews was killed 
in 1984 when his hideout caught fire during a shootout with federal 
agents on Whidbey Island in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not immediately describe the shootings at the North  
Valley Jewish Community in suburban Granada Hills a hate crime, but 
have said the choice of targets makes that a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacker strode into the community center's lobby and opened  
fire with a semiautomatic gun resembling an Uzi, peppering the 
building with some 70 shots. A center maintenance worker threw his 
body over an injured teen, while teachers and other workers led 
children to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing said by the suspect before the shooting,''  
Police Chief Bernard Parks said. ``It was indiscriminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wounded include a 5-year-old boy who was hit in the abdomen  
and leg. He was in critical condition today after undergoing six 
hours of surgery and was given a fair chance of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hurt were center receptionist, 68-year-old Isabelle  
Shalometh, two 6-year-old boys and a 16-year-old girl who was a 
counselor at the center's summer camp that began Monday. The boys 
and the counselor were in stable condition today and Mrs. 
Shalometh, grazed on the arm and back as she dove for cover, was 
released from the hospital Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center today, staff, parents and children slowly trickled  
back to summer programs under the gaze of armed security guards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good because my father's here,'' said Abby Dreyfuss,  
10, who arrived hand-in-hand with her father, Jonathan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's going to scare us away,'' said J. Eliad, a parent who  
was bringing his 4-year-old daughter back. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence was the latest shooting at workplaces and schools  
across the country, and brought immediate calls for stricter gun 
control and measures to protect children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by  
gun violence,'' President Clinton said in Washington. ``It calls on 
all of us not only to give our thoughts and prayers to the victims 
and their families, but intensify our resolve to make America a 
safer place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The organization that runs the community center posted armed  
guards at its several other operations in the region, and security 
was stepped up at children's programs in other states, said Nina 
Lieberman Giladi, an associate vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	She said children, including her son who saw two bleeding  
victims, wanted to get together with the other children to reassure 
themselves they were safe. She said her son ``just wanted to talk. 
He wanted to talk about his friends, talk about what happened, talk 
about why this man did this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report of the carjacking and discovery of the abandoned van  
came within 20 minutes and 4 miles of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the red-and-white van, officers found large amounts of  
ammunition in metal boxes, magazines for an assault rifle, a 
booklet titled Ranger Handbook and freeze-dried food. Various news 
reports have said there was a copy of the book ``War Cycles, Peace 
Cycles'' by Richard Kelly Hoskins, which the Southern Poverty Law 
Center says is a staple of hate group literature. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours later, the carjacked Toyota was found parked outside  
a motel in Chatsworth, another suburb in the San Fernando Valley, 
but hours of cautious searching by SWAT teams failed to turn up the 
gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	Police refused to say how the search was being conducted today,  
but said it involved the FBI and spread to Washington state and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The abandoned van was purchased Saturday from the Tacoma (Wash.)  
Kar Korner, said the manager of the lot, who refused to be 
identified. Cmdr. Dave Kalish, a Los Angeles police spokesman, 
identified Furrow as the buyer of the van, which had Washington 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents visited an Olympia, Wash., home believed to be that  
of Furrow's father Tuesday night. The FBI refused to comment on the 
visit and nobody in the house would speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times reported that late last year Furrow tried to  
commit himself at the Fairfax Psychiatric Hospital in Kirkland, a 
Seattle suburb, but got in trouble when he pulled a knife on 
staffers and eventually pleaded guilty to second-degree assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow satisfied his sentence for the assault, said Arthur  
Wallenstein, director of the King County Adult Detention in 
Seattle. Burrow was booked into jail Dec. 11, served all his time, 
received credit for 165 days and was released by a judge May 21 
this year.
