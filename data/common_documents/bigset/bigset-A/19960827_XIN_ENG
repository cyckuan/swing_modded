<HEADLINE> Symposium Commemorates Leading Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A symposium was held today at
the Great Hall of the People to commemorate the 90th birthday of
Wang Jiaxiang, a leading Chinese diplomat, and the release of an
album of photos of his life.
</P>
<P>
Present at the symposium were Liu Huaqing, a standing committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party and vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission, and Hu Jintao, a standing committee member of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and member of the
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
It was presided over by Qian Qichen, a member of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice-premier of the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
Wang was born in east China's Anhui Province in August 1906,
and joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1928. He was involved in
top military decisions that assisted Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai in
leading the Long March.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
Wang was appointed vice-minister of foreign affairs and the first
ambassador to the Soviet Union. He was persecuted during the
"Cultural Revolution," and passed away on January 25, 1974.
</P>
<P>
Wang took the lead in putting forth the concept of Mao Zedong
Thought in 1943 and did much to contribute to the development of
diplomacy in China.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqing called on CPC members and leaders to learn from
Wang's scientific idea of combining Marxism with China's reality,
his honesty in performing his duties, and his spirit of hard work,
and to adhere to a correct political orientation in order to
further the reforms and opening-up, and the modernization drive.

<HEADLINE> Premier Confirms Support For Libraries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China's government and society
will continue to place great importance on libraries and
documentation, and to provide support for them, Premier Li Peng
said today.
</P>
<P>
Knowledge, information, and documents now have a more important
role in both economic and social development as we reach the
threshold of the 21st century, Li said at the opening ceremony of
the 62nd General Conference of the International Federation of
Library Associations and Institutes (IFLA) here.
</P>
<P>
As a treasury of mankind's knowledge, libraries play a role in
protecting cultural heritage and civilization, he noted.
</P>
<P>
For different countries and regions, exchanges and cooperation
between libraries is essential to increasing understanding and
development, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,600 delegates from 89 countries and regions attended
today's opening ceremony, making the conference one of the largest
of its kind. It was also the first IFLA conference held in China,
which was one of its inaugural members.
</P>
<P>
Before the opening ceremony, Premier Li Peng met leading
officials of the IFLA and delegates from other international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Robert Wedgeworth, president of the federation, delivered a
speech at the opening ceremony, in which he said that the
development of libraries and the information industry will produce
great opportunities for China's economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
But, Wedgeworth noted, in utilizing information, the gap
between developed and developing countries is widening as changes
take place in libraries worldwide, and to meet the challenge, IFLA
will carry out a plan that is aimed at helping train librarians in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the week-long conference will discuss more than
300 papers that were submitted, focusing on information sharing,
electronic techniques, education rights and copyrights, and other
topics.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: "Trial of the Century" in South Korea Ends With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The "trial of the century" in
South Korea concluded today as Seoul District Court sentenced
former president Chun Doo-hwan to death and his successor, Roh
Tae-woo, to 22-1/2 years in prison on charges of mutiny, treason
and bribery.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in South Korea's history for two former
presidents to stand trial together and receive death and prison
sentences.
</P>
<P>
In today's ruling, the court also fined Chun 282 million
U.S. dollars and Roh 355 million dollars, representing the bribes
they allegedly accumulated during their years in power.
</P>
<P>
Separately, nine business tycoons, including the heads of
powerful conglomerates Samsung, Daewoo and Dong-ah, were sentenced
for bribing Roh. But Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee escaped jail
with a suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
Sentences ranging from four to 10 years were given to 13 former
South Korean military officers for their supporting roles in the
1979 coup. Another officer, Park Jun-byong, was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
Nine former aides, cabinet ministers, bodyguards and other
administration officials received jail terms on charges of bribery
connected with Chun and Roh's massive corruption during their
years in power.
</P>
<P>
The two ex-presidents and their followers were indicted early
this year for mutiny, treason, or both, stemming from their roles
in the military coup in December 1979 and the crackdown of a civil
uprising in Kwangju six months later.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 demonstrators were killed and some 1,000 others
wounded in the crackdown in Kwangju, capital of South Cholla
Province, in May 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun masterminded the military coup in December 1979 and seized
power in August the following year. He remained president until
February 1988 when his successor, Roh Tae-woo, who played a
supporting role in the coup, took over.
</P>
<P>
Roh stepped down after the December 1992 presidential election
which saw his fellow party-member Kim Young-sam returned to power.
</P>
<P>
Wearing light blue prison uniforms, the two former presidents
arrived in court by two separate buses in drizzling rain.
</P>
<P>
They nodded to the three-judge panel and the audience after
entering the courtroom, which was crowded with relatives of
Kwangju victims, the defendants' supporters and South Korean and
foreign news correspondents.
</P>
<P>
The court set aside five minutes for news media photographers
to take pictures of the defendants. Cameramen were allowed to
photograph the faces of the two ex-presidents from the front, the
first time this has been allowed in the trial which started last
March.
</P>
<P>
During sentencing, a middle-aged woman from Kwangju collapsed
on a chair in the courtroom. Soon after the session ended, some
Kwangju people, including three women in traditional white funeral
clothes inside the courtroom, and others outside, shouted "Bring
back my son" and "Death to other defendants".
</P>
<P>
Chun did not show any particular signs of remorse or shock when
the presiding judge sentenced him to death. He later shook hands
with Roh and other defendants sitting near him.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that he was trying to keep his dignity as a leader to
the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Roh, however, stood up to face the judges just before his
sentence was read. Immediately after being sentenced, Roh, with a
poker face, grasped Chun's hands.
</P>
<P>
The judges said Roh was spared the death penalty in recognition
of his diplomatic achievements which included gaining South Korea
entry into the United Nations in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Former military officer Park Jun-byong, who was acquitted on
charges relating to the Kwangju crackdown, and others who received
shorter prison terms than demanded by the prosecution, looked
relieved as they shook hands with their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
A hush fell over the courtroom when the sentences were meted
out but a flurry of whispers soon followed in response to the
"severe punishment" handed down to the two former presidents.
</P>
<P>
Since the two former presidents and their followers refused to
admit their crimes in connection with the 1979 coup and 1980
crackdown, it is likely that they will appeal against their
sentences.
</P>
<P>
People here reacted with general satisfaction to the heavy
punishment given to Chun and Roh as well as their followers and
expressed the hope that the punishment will be carried out.
</P>
<P>
However, many South Koreans are convinced that current
President Kim Young-sam will offer them pardons.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Say Earliest Library In China 3,000 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- In a cave along China's Yellow
River Basin, more than 20 thousand pieces of bone or tortoise
shell with inscriptions on them, that go back about 3,000 years,
were found in an orderly pile.
</P>
<P>
Alongside the bones and tortoise shells was the skeleton of a
person.
</P>
<P>
According to archaeologists, the cave was the world's first
library, and the dead person was the "predecessor" of modern
librarians.
</P>
<P>
The cave's purpose was to collect inscriptions on bones or
tortoise shells as a sort of "book" of the Shang Dynasty
(16th--11th century B.C.), which is believed as the oldest written
record in China.
</P>
<P>
"The inscriptions were well catalogued, with a large quantity,
showing that the library had developed to a certain level in China
3,000 years ago," according to a scholar at the 62nd General
Conference of International Federation of Library Associations and
Institutes.

<HEADLINE> Kazakh President Urges Halt to Civil War in Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev has appealed to government and opposition forces in
Tajikistan to stop their fighting on the Tajikistan-Afghanistan
border, the KazTAG news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
In letters addressed to Afghan President Burhannudin Rabbani
and Tajik opposition leader Saidu Abkullo Nuri, Nazarbayev said he
hoped the warring parties would find a peaceful solution to their
conflict through negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The use of force can only aggravate the conflict and bring more
casualties, said Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
He said all sides should continue efforts made in the truce
negotiations last spring in Alma Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
A civil war has been raging in Tajikistan, which borders
Afghanistan and China, for the last four years since the
pro-Moscow Tajik government drove out the Islamic opposition.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have continued their fight from anti-government
bases in northern Afghanistan, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik government has accused the Afghan defense ministry
of assisting the Tajik rebels, an accusation denied by Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Numerous ceasefire accords have been signed and then
broken. The latest ceasefire was agreed in mid-July but has
already been broken.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Japanese FMs Hold Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy met today with visiting Japanese counterpart Yukihiko
Ikeda, pledging Israel's efforts to ease the economic hardship
of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers hailed the continuing development of
the ties between Israel and Japan. Ikeda, who arrived here Sunday
on the third leg of his ongoing Middle East tour, said that
progress in the Israeli-Arab peace process would help "bring the
two countries together."
</P>
<P>
He promised Japan would contribute to the stability in the
Middle East, saying that Japan is interested in participating in
regional economic projects envisioned in a regional economic
summit held in Jordan last year.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting Sunday with Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat, Ikeda agreed to grant 11.6
million dollars in aid to the Palestinians. The PNA receives
about 100 million dollars annually in various forms of aid
from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Levy noted that Israel is trying to ease the economic duress
of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, who
have suffered dearly from the protracted closure of the
territories imposed since late February.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Israeli President Ezer Weizman Sunday,
Ikeda urged Israel to abide by the the land-for-peace principle in
order to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda is scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu later today. Before his visit to Israel,
Ikeda had already traveled to Egypt, Syria and Jordan for talks on
the peace process and bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the peace process, the Israeli-Japanese
relations have developed rapidly with several high-level visits
between the two sides, including a trip by former Israeli premier
Yitzhak Rabin to Tokyo in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The economic and trade relations between the two countries
have also expanded sharply, with Japan becoming Israel's second
largest trade partner after the U.S.. Last year, Israel's exports
to Japan reached 1.315 billion dollars and its imports from Japan
stood at 938 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Malian Public Opinions Rap France for Expelling Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Several newspapers in Mali today
sharply criticized France for deporting 23 Malian immigrants last
Saturday and violently evicting 300 Africans from the
Saint-Bernard Church in Paris last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"France is not qualified to give lessons on democracy and human
rights to others after having used brutality to solve a
humanitarian problem," Agence France Presse quoted "Nouvel
Horizon," an independent newspaper in the west African country, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that "France has turned from a country of human
rights into an inhospitable jungle" and "a nation yet to civilize."
</P>
<P>
"Neither the protests of the French people, nor the protection
of human rights, nor the law of God has stopped the French
authorities from violating a place of worship, using tear gas and
bludgeons to throw out those who they mistakenly call the
`paperless,'" the "Nouvel Horizon" said.
</P>
<P>
The independent weekly "Les Echos" said that France, "the
fatherland of human rights, liberty, fraternity and equality, is
transforming itself more and more into a land of xenophobia."
</P>
<P>
It also criticized the Malian government for maintaining
silence over the expulsions.
</P>
<P>
The independent weekly "Observateur" echoed the criticisms of
"Les Echos" by pointing out that not one Malian government
minister was at the airport to receive the expelled on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic archbishop of Bamako, Luc Auguste, said
today that France "lacked memory" when it expelled the Africans
from the Saint-Bernard Church last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Some people are trying to push down this Africa which is
trying to come up. Before being Christians, be human first," said
the archbishop.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said
today that the French government got agreement from several
African governments before it transported the first group of
African immigrants back home on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said that France is considering sending economic aid to Mali
and wants to "allow all those who went back to their country to do
well in good conditions."
</P>
<P>
Some 300 African immigrants had occupied the Paris church for
almost two months in protest at changes in French immigration laws
in 1993 which led to previously legal immigrants being made
illegal.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislators Review Three Law Drafts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Two drafts of laws on protecting
the rights and interests of the elderly and on the coal industry
and a draft of amendments to the mineral resources law are being
studied by the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
Dong Naifang, a member of the committee, said that to protect
the rights and interests of the elderly, "concerned departments"
should be clearly specified.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that the draft can be approved by the
end of the 21st meeting of the legislature, which started last
Friday and will end on August 29.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Fusheng, a member of the committee, suggested that a
clause on protecting the elderly's personal property, especially
when the person is weak, is mentally impaired, or lacks knowledge
about self protection, should be added.
</P>
<P>
Chi Haibin, said that the government needs to improve its
mineral resources controls, and proposed a responsibility system
directly linking the top provincial government officials to
provincial control of mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Tong Zhiguang suggested that the new law clarify the rights and
interests of overseas investors in mining to attract overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
He said that because the central government has decided to
accord national status to foreign investors, those who invest in
mineral resources should neither be given preferential treatment
nor be treated unfairly.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani has claimed that Arab countries will explode and the
peace process can not last for long if the Americans withdraw
their influence, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president made the statement in an interview with
local television, which was published in the Persian evening paper
Kayhan.
</P>
<P>
"The Middle East peace process is not for the sake of peace
but sort of a cease-fire," he noted
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old president said that the term of "peace" is
irrelevant to the negotiations and "one can not make peace with a
regime which is illegitimate from the root."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Rafsanjani's statement is the most
negative response to the on-going Middle East peace process and
he leaves no room for any reconciliation between Israel and Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Actually, they said, the Iranian government has made its foreign
policy very clear that Iran will be absolutely against the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Iran's hard stance might have something
to do with a recent visit by Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud
Zouebi, who secured a financial assistance of 70 million dollars
from the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that the Palestinians would not forego their
rights, even if it takes one thousand years to materialize them.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are four million Palestinian refugees and
they can not be easily ignored. Their homeland is of religious
importance, including Jerusalem that is holly to Moslems across
the world.
</P>
<P>
Peace and normalization of ties would not last in the long run
no matter how much force the Americans use, he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that "the region would explode as soon as the
Americans withdraw their influence."

<HEADLINE> IMF to Provide Loans for Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) may provide stabilizing loans within the year to support the
Ukraine's issue of its new currency, the grevna, a Ukrainian
official said today.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Ukrainian Agency of Recovery and Development,
Roman Shpek, told Respublika (independent press agency) that the
loans would amount to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
They might be given in the next six months as short-term loans
on condition that they were repaid within a year.
</P>
<P>
An inspecting mission from the IMF was satisfied with the
Ukraine's commitment to the Fund's "stand-by" program after a
visit to the country from August 10-23.
</P>
<P>
This entitled the Ukraine to get the fifth and sixth "stand-by"
loans from IMF without the permission of its council, Shpek said.
</P>
<P>
The Ukraine has postponed the issue of its new currency,
originally planned for October 1995, because of the absence of the
fourth "stand-by" loan from the IMF.

<HEADLINE> Central Authorities Concerned About Flooding in Shanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A group sent by the central
authorities have visited north China's Shanxi Province, which was
flooded by torrential rains at the beginning of August.
</P>
<P>
The group, led by Liu Jimin, vice-secretary general of the
State Council, China's top governing body, visited the province
from August 22 to 25.
</P>
<P>
Liu has conveyed the sympathy and solicitude of the Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council to
civilians, soldiers, and policemen who are in the forefront of the
anti-flood campaign.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who is also vice-chief of the State Flood Control and
Drought Relief Headquarters, visited Xiyang, Heshun, Zuoquan,
Licheng areas, and the Xishan Mining Administration in the
provincial capital of Taiyuan.
</P>
<P>
The inspection group told governments at all levels that they
should treat the flood work as a central task, make proper
arrangements for food, clothing, and problems of daily life, and
prevent a possible outbreak of epidemic disease.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the province to repair damaged farmland, roads,
and water conservation facilities, power and telecommunications
facilities, and to organize people to rely on themselves.
</P>
<P>
The province has also been warned about the possibility of new
flooding or drought.
</P>
<P>
The group have asked officials in Shanxi, a province which had
frequent droughts, to reflect upon their work and pay more
attention to flood prevention in farmland development, and
building bridges and dams.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholar Urges Economic Integration, Cultural Diversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Fei Xiaotong, a famous Chinese
scholar, called for information exchanges among different
countries and regions to promote global economic integration and
cultural diversity.
</P>
<P>
The 86-year-old sociologist made the point at a keynote speech
at the IFLA general conference today.
</P>
<P>
Fei said that scientific and technological, and economic
advances have created the necessary conditions for global
integration.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, growth in the world's economy has increased
not only people's awareness of their inter-relationships but also
of their own self-awareness, and the whole nation's awareness of
independence and democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Due to historical and national differences, there are diverse
solutions to diverse problems," he said. "No one should adhere to
just one model or go even one step further and force their views
on others."
</P>
<P>
The scholar said that the benefit of exchanges and the spread
of information goes first to economic development and manifests
itself in the increase in poverty relief.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the history of Chinese characters, paper, and
printing technology, he said, "Without a commonly understood
information system, it would be inconceivable to achieve a
consensus in terms of basic thought and lifestyle, or to
co-ordinate activity throughout such a vast land and among such a
large population."
</P>
<P>
"With the 21st century on the near horizon, the world will aim
to survive and develop through pluralism and integration. The key
will be to minimize the problems of estrangement and contradiction
caused by economic, political, social and cultural imbalances and
differences, through greater cultural information dissemination and
exchange," Fei said.

<HEADLINE> Another Former Ministry Official Questioned Over HIV Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo prosecutors have questioned
a second former Health and Welfare Ministry official in connection
with deaths caused by HIV-contaminated blood products, the Kyodo
News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting prosecution sources, Kyodo said Akihito Matsumura, the
55-year-old former head of the ministry's Health Service Bureau,
was questioned in connection with a complaint accusing a
hemophilia expert who headed the ministry's study group on AIDS,
of murder and attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
The complaint, filed by the mother of a hemophiliac who died
after using the tainted coagulant, says Abe allowed the continued
use of unheated blood-clotting drugs despite being aware of the
risk of HIV infection from the products.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors questioned Matsumura about whether the ministry had
recognized the dangers posed by the unheated blood products, in an
attempt to determine whether the ministry was responsible for the
HIV scandal, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Matsumura served as director of the Biologics and Antibiotics
Division from July 1984 to June 1986. That coincides with the
June-July 1985 period in which patients of Abe, a former vice
president of Teikyo University in Tokyo, were suspected of having
been infected with HIV.

<HEADLINE> Former South Korean Presidents Sentenced to Death, Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Court today
sentenced former South Korean Presidents Chun Doo-hwan to death
and Roh Tae-woo 22 and a half years in prison on charges of
mutiny, treason and bribery.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in South Korea's history that former
presidents were sentenced to death and prison term.
</P>
<P>
The two were found guilty of taking bribery. The court also
fined Chun 282 million U.S. dollars and Roh 355 million
U.S. dollars, representing the bribes they allegedly accumulated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 13 of the 14 former South Korean officers who helped
the two former presidents in their quest for power were also
sentenced by the court to four to ten years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Four of the two ex-presidents' followers including former 1st
Army Corps Commander Hwang Young-si were given ten years in
prison, four others including former Commander of the 3rd Airborne
Brigade Choi Sae-chang eight years in prison, other three
including former Commander of the 30th Security Group Chang
Se-dong seven years in prison and the other two including former
15th Battalion Commander of the 3rd Airborne Brigade Park Jong-kyu
four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Former Commander of the Army 20th Division Park Jun-byung was
acquitted.
</P>
<P>
The 16 former South Korean officers including Chun and Roh were
indicted early this year for mutiny or treason, or both. The
mutiny and treason charges stemmed from their roles in the
military revolt on December 12, 1979, and the crackdown of the
civil uprising on May 18, 1980, in Kwangju, capital of South
Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Roh and Chun, who were arrested on November 16 and December 3
last year respectively, were also indicted for bribery since they
received huge amounts of illegal funds from businessmen while in
office.
</P>
<P>
In December 1979, Chun arrested the then martial law commander,
Chung Sung-hwa, and accused him of complicity in the assassination
of President Park Chung-hee. That made Chun the de facto head of
the martial law command.
</P>
<P>
Chun, then a major general, had been in charge of investigating
Park's death. After consolidating power, Chun was elected
president in 1980 and was succeeded by his friend, Roh, in
1988. The latter stepped down in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
Today's ruling followed 27 trial sessions on the mutiny and
treason charges involving the 16 defendants since March 11 this
year.
</P>
<P>
However, since the two former presidents and their followers
refused to admit their crimes in connection with the 1979 and 1980
incidents, it is most likely that they will appeal the case to a
higher court.

PYONGYANG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A United States and Japanese
announcement of a large-scale joint military exercise to be held
in November is criticised in an article carried today in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's newspaper, Rodong Sinmum.,
</P>
<P>
The exercise might aggravate the already tense situation on the
Korean Peninsula, the article warned.
</P>
<P>
The two-week military action, participated in by American
warships and fighters and Japanese army, naval and air forces,
will be in the East Korea Sea.
</P>
<P>
Since this kind of military exercise was held previously in the
Pacific Ocean, the US and Japanese intention of strangling Korea
was obvious, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Japan the United States claimed they intended to familiarize
themselvies with military actions in the Pacific Ocean and other
seas, and also demonstrated that they were preparing for a
possible war on the Korean Peninsula, the article said.
</P>
<P>
While publicizing the DPRK's military threat, which in fact did
not exist at all, America strengthened its military forces on the
periphery of the Korean Peninsula. This showed America was a major
threat to the peace and security of the region.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK people would maintain vigilance on the US and Japanese
reactionary forces and their war attempts, the article said.

<HEADLINE> Telephone Users in Vietnam Grow Sharply in Ten Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The number of telephone
subscribers shoot up ten times in ten years in Vietnam after the
one millionth phone user was linked to the national network on
Saturday, the Vietnamese News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Phone users have increased 22 percent annually on the average
in Vietnam since 1986, when the number of telephone subscribers
only stood at 100,000.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Post and Telecommunications (VNPT) now plans to
link one million more telephone subscribers in the second quarter
of 1998 and three million more in 2000.
</P>
<P>
In late 1995, there was already one telephone in every 100
Vietnamese people, a target set by the VNPT for 2000.
</P>
<P>
The VNPT also mapped out a 1995-2000 plan to invest 30,000
billion dong (about 2.73 billion U.S. dollars) in building three
million extra telephone lines by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are only 1.3 telephone lines per every 100
people in the country, compared with the worldwide average level
of more than 10 lines.
</P>
<P>
The VNPT has already digitalized its telephone exchanges across
the country.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has speeded up the modernization of telephone service
with high technology since 1993. As a result, the hike of phone
users in 1993 equaled to the total number of combined telephone
subscribers over the past 40 years.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Tycoons, Former Officials Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Nine top South Korean business
leaders were today convicted of bribing former president Roh
Tae-woo who was earlier sentenced to 22 years in prison for
mutiny, treason and bribery.
</P>
<P>
Ten former officials, including former defense and finance
ministers, were also sentenced for their involvement in
accumulating slush funds for Roh and his predecessor, Chun
Doo-hwan.
</P>
<P>
The sentences on the nine businessmen including Samsung Group
Chairman Lee Kun-hee and President Lee Kyung-hoon of Daewoo
Corporation range from 10 months to two and a half years in
prison, with some sentences suspended.
</P>
<P>
However, none of the convicted was arrested after the prison
sentences were announced in view of their contributions to
economic development or the circumstances under which they gave
bribes to Roh.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen have seven days to appeal against their
sentences.
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel at Seoul District Court sentenced Lee
Hyun-woo, who served as Roh's chief bodyguard, to a seven-year
imprisonment and a fine of 762,500 U.S. dollars for accepting
bribes from businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Roh's two close associates, Kum Jin-ho and Lee Won-joe, were
sentenced to three years in jail for their roles in helping Roh
collect bribes from businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Kim Chong-in, former economic aide to Roh, was given two and a
half years in prison with a stay of execution for four years and
Lee Tae-jin, former presidential accounting officer, a one-year
prison term, suspended for two years.
</P>
<P>
Former defense minister Chung Ho-yong was sentenced to 10 years
in prison, former presidential chief bodyguard Ahn Hyon-tae four
years in prison and a fine of 62,500 dollars, former National
Administration head Sung Yong-wook three years in prison, former
National Security Planning Agency chief Ahn Mu-hyok three years in
prison and former finance minister Sagong Il two and a half years
in prison with a four-year stay of execution.
</P>
<P>
In today's ruling, the court also meted out prison terms
ranging from four to ten years to 13 former South Korean military
officers who helped the two former presidents in their quest for
power.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, former president Chun Doo-hwan was sentenced to
death and his successor, Roh Tae-woo, to 22 and a half years in
prison on charges of mutiny, treason and bribery stemming from
their roles in the military coup on December 12, 1979 and the
subsequent killing of civilians in an uprising in the southern
city of Kwangju on May 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
The court also fined Chun 282 million dollars and Roh 355
million dollars, representing the bribes the two former presidents
took during their time in power.
</P>
<P>
The two ex-presidents, who were arrested last year, have also
been indicted for graft for taking hundreds of millions of dollars
in bribes from businessmen while in office.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980, after a coup and ruled
the nation until February 1988. He was followed by Roh who stepped
down in February 1993.

<HEADLINE> FMG Workshop Participants Call for prohibiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, August 26 (Xinhua)--Participants to a three day
workshop of Female Genital Mutilations (FMG) today urged the
goverment of President Tejan Kabbah to pass a law ''prohibiting
any public discussion'' on the issue.
</P>
<P>
''Whatever debate is to go on should be done behind closed
doors as it infringes on the secrecy of our organisation'',
spokesman for the proposed National Council of Sowei
(mutilators), Haja Kadi Johnson said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
The council also proposed that ''all film shows, video clips,
press articles and radio broadcast (on FMG ) should be banned''
and fines of between 200,000 dollars and 500,000 dollars imposed
on mutilators who perform a FMG on Fridays (the Muslim holy day,
sundays, the month of Rramadan and in lent).
</P>
<P>
The workshop also proposed that FMG should not be performed on
a female child below 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Anti-FMG groups denounced the proposals describing them as
''back- ward and out of step with reality''.
</P>
<P>
The Director-General of the Ministry of Gender and Womens'
Affairs, Bailah Leigh in an interview, stressed the ''need for
collaboration between those for and against the practice to get a
better understanding of the advantages and disadvnatages of the
society.
</P>
<P>
The President of the National Council of Muslim Women, a
strong advocacy movement for FMG, Haja Isha Sasso,said taht life
will be meaningless if women from the villages are forced to stop
the practice.
</P>
<P>
''The rites of female circumcision are sacred and initiates
are taught useful acts of behaviour, social values and meaningful
life patterns," she said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) representative,
Yoshio Koiki, noted that the practice of female circumcision is
one of concern to his organisation. ''We feel the continuation of
this practice is a violation of human rights,'' Koiki said.

<HEADLINE> EU Scheme Upsets Big European, US Paper Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's efforts to
improve environmental standards for paper making could be
boycotted by big EU and U.S. producers following strong industry
resistance to an EU-wide ecology-labeling system for some paper
products.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU scheme, approved by the EU member states last
month, office, fax and copy paper could be eligible for an ecology
label if certain production standards are met, according to a
report carried in today's Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
Producers will be able to apply for the eco-label if they
reduce toxic waste, energy consumption and sulphur emissions and
provide proof that they are using wood fiber from ecologically
managed forests, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, pulp and paper producers on both sides of the
Atlantic are mapping out strategies to challenge the EU plan,
which is due to come into effect soon.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI), which
represents European pulp and paper manufacturers, said that there
was "widespread industry unease about the value of the label."
</P>
<P>
A CEPI official reportedly said that the CEPI believed that the
label-system would not reap serious environmental benefits and
that it discriminated against smaller paper producers.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the current system is elitist and that it will
have marginal impact on the environment," the official said. But
he denied that the CEPI would launch a boycott campaign against
the EU regulation.
</P>
<P>
Although the EU scheme is voluntary, industry officials believe
that it will take just one or two big producers to adopt the label
to put strong competitive pressure on other companies.
</P>
<P>
The American Forest and Paper Association, which has led the
U.S. campaign against the EU scheme, has said that its biggest
concern was that "voluntary will become mandatory."
</P>
<P>
Some EU and American industry officials believe that the scheme
discriminates against "non-integrated" mills, which buy pulp
supplies often from a number of sources, and favors "integrated
mills" which produce both pulp and paper.
</P>
<P>
The Americans also argue that "many if not all" U.S. suppliers
will not be able to qualify for the labels "without spending a lot
of money."
</P>
<P>
The American paper producers are considering to refer the
scheme to the World Trade Organization on the grounds that it will
affect U.S. market access to the EU.

<HEADLINE> Recession Awaits Next US President: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The next U.S. president, either
Bill Clinton or Bob Dole, will preside over a recession, according
to an article of the Wall Street Journal today.
</P>
<P>
The economic expansion, which started in late 1991, could last
beyond the year 2000, some economists argued.
</P>
<P>
But the article said that in 200 years of U.S. history, such a
long business-cycle has never happened. If the expansion were to
continue until November 2000, it would be nine years and a half
old. "But the longest expansion on record came in the 1960s, and
fizzled out two months before turning nine," the article said.
</P>
<P>
The average expansion during the past 200 years has been just
short of three years; the average since World World II has been
just over four, said the article contributed by Alan Murray.
</P>
<P>
Victor Zarnowitz, director of the Center for International
Business Cycle Research at Columbia University, says he would put
"a very low probability" on the economy surviving four more years.
</P>
<P>
The political and economic implications of a recession during
the next presidential term are enormous, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
President Reagan showed that if you get your recession over
early enough -- his began the year he was elected -- you can ride
the recovery to re-election. But a recession midway through the
term can be troublesome, as President Bush discovered; and a
recession late in the term is almost always terminal, the article
said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it said, a recession would make a mess of both
parties' plans to balance the budget by 2002 -- particularly
Dole's, which relies so heavily on assumptions of improved
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Even a mild downturn could add 100 billion U.S. dollars a year
or more to budget forecasts, according to economists. The pain of
recession might lead politicians to back off tough spending
restraint called for under their budget plans.
</P>
<P>
Both candidates for the next president argue that with the
right policies, they can defy history and avoid recession.
</P>
<P>
But Zarnowitz argues that neither Clinton nor Dole can do much
to change the likelihood of recession during the next four years,
although they could make important differences in the economy's
performance over time.

<HEADLINE> Israel Pledges More Funds for Olympic Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel, disappointed with the
poor performance of its athletes in the Atlanta Olympic Games,
pledged today to increase aid for athletes aiming for a better
showing at the next Olympic Games to be held in Sydney, Australia,
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Emanuel Zisman, chairman of Knesset (Parliament) Education,
Culture and Sports Committee, said at a reception for the
25-member Israeli Olympic delegation that the government would
allocate more resources to help the athletes now preparing for the
next Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Zisman, a former sportsman, dismissed the views of those who
expressed doubts about the continuation of government aid to
sports after the poor showing in Atlanta by Israeli athletes.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli athletes, which gained one silver medal and one
Bronze medal in judo at the 1992 Barcelona Games, only won a
wind-surfing bronze medal at the Atlanta Olympic Games by Gal
Friedman.
</P>
<P>
Zisman said that the committee would hold discussions in
November on the preparation for the next Games and would draw
conclusions on Israel's poor performance in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"We need the next Olympic Games to be better for our national
pride. We must analyze the results. And we must change the policy
about the national sports of Israel," said Zisman.
</P>
<P>
While officials attending the ceremony praised the Israeli
athletes for their efforts made at the Atlanta Games, nearly
everyone agreed that Israel still had a long way to go in order to
gain an Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Most people from the sports circle complained about the
inadequate financial support by the government, which has pushed
several sports clubs across the country to the brink of
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Yael Arad, the Barcelona judo silver medalist who only ranked
fifth in Atlanta, said that the Israeli delegation to Atlanta did
not have to be ashamed of its performance in view of the limited
resources granted by the government.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing those who demanded to reduce aid to the Olympic
athletes, swimmer Yoav Bruck defended the sports' role in
boosting national morale.
</P>
<P>
"If it (aid) stops right now, we will go back to 1956. If we
keep on developing the resources of the young kids, and giving
better conditions to them, so we will get better and may win a
couple of medals," said Bruck.
</P>
<P>
But the swimmer also acknowledged that Israel still has a long
way to go to win a gold medal in the Olympic Games, saying that
the government investment in sports was "too small."

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Situation in Africa Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Committee
meeting of the Global Coalition for Africa devoted its first day
session to the discussion of agricultural situation in
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in camera after the opening ceremony this
morning. The first day session reviewed the performance of
African agriculture with an emphasis on agricultural policy and
strategies with the aim of formulating and adopting comprehensive
strategies.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues raised during the closed-door discussion were
rural credits, extension and other services to farmers with a
view to recovering the African agriculture which has not
performed to its full potential.
</P>
<P>
According to a paper presented for discussion at the meeting,
broad-based poverty alleviation cannot take place without
sustained increase in agricultural productivity and income growth
in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The paper said, in Africa, on average, agriculture accounts
for 35 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and 60 percent of
export revenues and employs up to 80 percent of the active
population, adding that "a weak performance of the agricultural
sector not only retards the process of overall economic growth
but results also in widespread poverty and hardship."
</P>
<P>
However, African countries on average allocate no more than 10
percent of their national public expenditure for agriculture
annually, compared to over 20 percent in those of the world that
have achieved rapid growth in agriculture and industrialization,
such as Asia, the paper pointed out.

LAGOS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's President Jerry Rawlings
has commissioned 42 new officers of the Ghana armed forces and
warned them to guard against illegal acquisition of wealth.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that there is a trend in the armed forces

financial and social status above honor and service.
</P>

"Let me caution that legitimate opportunities for wealth and
social position in the military are few. Your greatest
satisfaction and reward will be in knowing that you have done
your duty well and honorably," Rawlings said, quoted by a report
from Accra, capital of Ghana today.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the new officers to keep themselves objectively
informed about current affairs as well as the concerns of the
people so as to perform effectively.
</P>
<P>
The new officers, including two from the Gambia, were
commissioned after 18 months training at the military academy and

<HEADLINE> Mandate of UN Mission in Liberia to Be Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended a three-month extension of the
mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia
(UNOMIL), according to a report available here today.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the UNOMIL will expire on August 31 in
accordance with Resolution 1059 adopted by the Security Council on
May 31.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report on the UNOMIL, Boutros-Ghali noted Liberia
had suffered a tremendous ordeal since hostilities erupted on
April 6 this year.
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of lives have been lost, hundreds of families
displaced and the city of Monrovia and its fledgling economy have
been largely destroyed," he said in the report.
</P>
<P>
Yet the successful outcome of the August 17 summit of the
Economic Community of Western African States (ECOWAS) offered some
hope for the restoration of the peace process, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the new timetable for the implementation of the Abuja
Agreement, the faction leaders agreed to cease all hostilities
throughout the country and to disarm so that free and fair
elections could be held by the end of May 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS had renewed its commitment to restoring peace and a
democratically elected government in Liberia and to remaining
engaged in that country until a new government would be installed
on June 15, 1997, in accordance with the revised timetable of the
Abuja Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his support for the endeavors of the ECOWAS, he
recommended that the Security Council consider extending the
mandate of the UNOMIL for a period of three months.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general also intended to deploy to Liberia an
additional 24 military observers and additional essential civilian
personnel in the fields of disarmament, elections, human rights,
public information and administration to assist the UNOMIL,
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Announces Coalition of Candidates to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri announced here tonight the list of his coalition of
candidates to run for the parliamentary election in the
constituency of Beirut, which is due on September 1.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally of some 50,000 feverish people in a stadium
in western Beirut, the prime minister declared that the aim of his
"Beirut's Decision" coalition was to achieve a unity of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers expected a fiercest contest in the
third of the five-phase general election after the two previous
rounds were held in Mount Lebanon and in the north on the last two
Sundays.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen out of the 128 parliamentary seats are reportedly at
stake for the Beirut constituency.
</P>
<P>
The multi-billionaire prime minister's main rival, ex-Prime
Minister Salim al-Hoss, is expected to announce his own list of
coalition on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, appearing freshly in plain clothes, called on all the
Beirut citizens to participate in the polling on Sunday in order to
"make Beirut the capital of capitals and the most important city
in the Arab Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Putting the manuscript aside, the prime minister said that 16
years of civil war and Israel's aggressions and bombardments at
the city had only "made Beirut raise its head higher."
</P>
<P>
His speech was frequently interrupted by hails of the mass
gathering inside the stadium and shouting "Hariri for Beirut,
Hariri for Beirut."
</P>
<P>
Pro-government candidates scored a crushing victory in the
first round of election in Mount Lebanon on August 18 where they
won 32 of 35 seats in the six constituencies.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to make a conclusion on the August 25 polling
in north Lebanon, where 133 candidates were competing for 28
seats, before the results are officially announced at Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
After Beirut, two remaining rounds of elections will be held
respectively in south Lebanon on September 8 and in Beqaa on
September 15.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A UNHCR official said here
Monday that 105 refugees had returned to Croatia since June from
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Head of the UNHCR office for repatriation program Tina Andersen
said the last group of 37 refugees left for Croatia last Thursday,
according to Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
She noted that all repatriates must have either a Croatian
citizenship certificate or a certificate on family reunification
issued by the Croatian government office in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Over 250,000 Serbs fled the Republic of Serb Krajina, a
self-proclaimed Serb state in Croatia after the latter seceded
from the former Yugoslav federation, following Croatian army
offensives last year.
</P>
<P>
Many of them want to return to their former homes, despite
destruction and looting which followed Croatian army operations,
Andersen said.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR official said that there was intensified tension in
Knin, a former Serb center, between Croats who has recently
settled in Serb homes and the Serb repatriates, adding that UNHCR
was monitoring the situation there.
</P>
<P>
Knin looks like a ghost town, she said. There is no power, and
destruction is widespread in suburban areas. Now only 4,000 people
live in the town and its area, out of the total of 12,000 living
in Krajina before the exodus last year, she added.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian parliament

anti-poaching operations and conservation of wild animals and
plants.
</P>
<P>
Moving a motion to seek the ratification of the agreement at

Resources and Toourism Minister Juma Ngasongwa stressed the need
for inter-governmental cooperation in the war against poaching.
</P>

Tanzania is a signatory to the Lusaka agreement of September
8, 1994, on co-operative enforcement operations directed on
illegal trade in wild fauna and flora, he said.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Wheat Production Surpass One Billion Bushels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Total wheat production in Canada
could surpass the one billion bushel mark this year for the first
time since 1993, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
Wheat production is expected to increase by 162 million bushels
over last year to 1,096 million bushels due to higher yields and a
15-percent rise in seeded acreage.
</P>
<P>
If farmers' expectations are realized, production will be the
highest since the 1992 level of 1,098 million bushels, the federal
fact-gathering agency said in its July 1996 Field Crop Survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 11,400 farmers was by telephone interviews
conducted during the last week of July and the first week of
August.
</P>
<P>
Canada's highest wheat production on record is 1,179 million
bushels in 1990.
</P>
<P>
High grain prices at world markets is the driving force behind
the increase in seeded acreage of wheat, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, favorable weather condition have more than
compensated for the very late spring seeding, resulting in
above-average yields, it added.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that spring wheat production in the three
Prairie provinces could expand by 188 million bushels this year.
Manitoba producers are expecting a 20 percent increase,
Saskatchewan, 38 percent and Alberta, 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Spring wheat in the Prairies accounts for 80 percent of all the
wheat produced in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Ontario Province, Canada's largest producer of
winter wheat, are expecting much lower yields this year because of
harsh conditions of last winter and disease problems during the
growing season. Production is expected to drop by 31 percent from
last year.
</P>
<P>
This year's barley crop could be the highest ever recorded in
Canada, reaching 747 million bushels, the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, canola production may drop to 235 million bushels
this year, compared with last year. Canadian farmers reduced
canola growing by 4.1 million acres because of the higher cost and
risks involved.
</P>
<P>
Flaxseed production may fall by 10 million bushels from last
year, because 655,000 fewer acres were seeded, the agency said.

<P>
BELGRADE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The OSCE provisional election
commission in Bosnia Monday deleted 8,000 out of the 23,000
candidates on the party tickets for elections at all levels in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
did so because it had failed to find those names in the 1991
census, the OSCE mission in Bosnia said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE mission, which is responsible for the organization and
monitoring of the first post-war national elections in Bosnia,
said the names of two candidates of the Party of Serbian Unity
were deleted because they were identical with the names of persons
indicted for war crimes by the Hague-based international
war-crimes tribunal,
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, those who have been indicted by the
war crimes tribunal as war criminals are banned from running in
the Bosnia elections. A total of 75 persons in the former
Yugoslavia have been charged for committing war crimes during the
regional crisis over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE provisional election commission will remain in contact
with political party representatives with a view to eliminating
the detected irregularities by the September 14 elections, Tanjug
news agency quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, IFOR said Monday it will use force if
necessary to ensure the freedom of movement during September
elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Sarajevo suburb Lukavica, IFOR
spokesman Brett Boudreau said 400 election supervisors would
arrive in Sarajevo from Vienna, Austria, on Wednesday and be
posted in 29 OSCE offices.
</P>
<P>
A total of 22,000 ballot boxes and other supplies will be
shipped to Bosnia next week and distributed by 20 helicopters, he
said.

<HEADLINE> 93 Put in Jail For 1984 Riot in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 27 ( Xinhua ) -- The Delhi Court today
sentenced 93 people to seven and a half years imprisonment and a
fine of 5,000 rupees (150.6 US dollars) each for their involvement
in the 1984 anti-Sikh riot following the assassination of former
Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi in October 1984.
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecution, at least 2,800 people were killed
in Delhi in the riot following the assassination of Indira Gandhi,
of which 400 were killed in an east Delhi colony.
</P>
<P>
The judge in the court observed that "the innocent persons who
were killed in the colony and other areas of Delhi could not be
denied, one because they were Sikhs and the other because they
were poor."
</P>
<P>
Many Sikhs in Punjab state in northwestern India launched a big
movement in 1983 demanding autonomy and big riots followed.
</P>
<P>
The then union government headed by Indira Gandhi sent troops
there to deal with the violence. But some diehards retreated to
the Golden Temple, the sacred place for the Sikhs, at Amritsar
city near Indo-Pak border to continue their struggle.
</P>
<P>
On June 5, 1984, troops dashed into the temple in an operation
codenamed "Blue Star." Sikhs was angered by the action and vowed
to take revenge on the prime minister. On October 31, Indira
Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh guards at her residence and
this had led to a nationwide riot against Sikhs.

<P>
Since 1980, great progress has been made in constructing new

<HEADLINE> OSCE Decides to Delay Bosnia's Municipal Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) decided today to postpone
municipal elections in the post-war Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Frowick, the head of the OSCE mission in Bosnia,
said, "In face of widespread abuse of rules and regulations... I
have made a chairman's decision therefore that it is not feasible
to hold municipal elections on the 14th of September."
</P>
<P>
Frowick is also chairman of Bosnia's Provisional Election
Commission which is made of representatives from all three
factions of Bosnia as well as from the international community.
Under the Dayton accord, he has the final say when the commission
fails to reach a consensus.
</P>
<P>
The decision to delay municipal elections came after the Muslim
side threatened to boycott the whole elections if the OSCE did not
annul the so-called P-2 form, which originates from the Dayton
accord and allows refugees to choose wherever they wish to vote.
</P>
<P>
Serb authorities have reportedly mobilized refugees to vote in
such strategically towns as Brcko and Srebrenica in order to
legally control the municipal governments after the elections.
</P>
<P>
But Frowick said that his decision is not only based on
irregularities on Serb territory, but also on those which had
occurred in the Muslim- and Croats-controlled towns.
</P>
<P>
"The electoral guidelines drawn from the (Dayton) general
framework agreement for peace were meant to enable individual
voters to decide for themselves where they wish to reside and
vote, but they have been seriously distorted at the municipal
level," Frowick said.
</P>
<P>
The retired American diplomat said that elections for the
cantonal, entity and central governments will proceed as scheduled
and the officials of the contact group for Bosnia will meet early
next month to decide a later date for the municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
The contact group consists of Britain, France, Germany, Russia
and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Blasts Iran, Calls for Awareness of US Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today criticized recent
statements made by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati on
moves of concluding lasting peace in Kurds-held northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Arabic daily Al-Jumhuriya said in an editorial that the
Iranian side does not understand very well the U.S. policy in the
region. It urged Iran to be aware of the U.S. scheme, which aims
to partition Iraq, Iran and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Iranian foreign minister as saying that Iran
is the only state that could forge a lasting peace in northern Iraq
and it is the only state that concerns about concluding peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The chief aim of the U.S. policy in the region is to crumble
Iraq, Turkey and Iran by making the Kurds fight each other,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
It warned Tehran that the United States, through involving Iran
in the conflicts in northern Iraq, wants to give Iraq an evidence
that Iran is not serious in calling for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The paper described the Iranian involvement in fighting between
two Iraqi Kurdish factions as the most dangerous matter.
</P>
<P>
For days running, the Iraqi media have been continuing denunciation
of Iran's involvement in the fighting in the self-rule area of
Kurdistan, which has been beyond the control of Iraqi government
since the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Attracts 1.1 Billion Dollars of Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has attracted direct
foreign investment worth 1.1 billion US dollars in the 1995-96
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here today, the secretary of the
Board of Investment (BOI), Mohib Ullah Shah, said direct foreign
investment in the year 1995-96 more than doubled that in 1994-95,
which was 442 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1993-94, direct foreign investment in Pakistan was 290
million dollars, about one third of what came to Pakistan in
1995-96, said the secretary.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that by the year 2000 Pakistan would achieve
the target of attracting five billion dollars of foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the work of BOI,
the board during its first meeting in the new fiscal year today
decided to induct five officers from different departments for a
"one-window service" for investors.
</P>
<P>
Officers from customs, taxation, water and power,
telecommunication and immigration departments will be posted as
regular officers in BOI to provide prompt service for foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
Shah said about one third of the total direct foreign
investment goes to power generation and energy sector while the
rest 70 percent goes to sectors of manufacture, mining, agri-food,
transportation, among others.
</P>
<P>
Besides traditional investors such as the United States, the
United Kingdom, France, Switzerland and Muslim countries, Asian
investors have also come to Pakistan after the country adopted a
new investment policy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
So far, the secretary said, the US remained the largest
investor in the country with an annual investment of 390 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The UK closely followed the US with 370 million dollars
investment in Pakistan per year while Japan, the United Arabic
Emirates and Hong Kong were the next three major investors.

today that it is now an extremely important period for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with a Hong Kong delegation from the Heung Yee Kuk of

Committee and are actively involved in it, having asked for more
than 15,000 applications.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in history for Hong Kong people to take
part in political affairs in a democratic way and it shows that
the work on the formation of the Selection Committee is open and
democratic, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the New Territories accounts for 90 percent of
Hong Kong's total area, and that it has great potential for
development. The New Territories plays an important role in
maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Heung Yee Kuk of the New Territories
will further unite other Hong Kong compatriots and contribute more
to Hong Kong's smooth transition, and the implementation of the
"one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" policies.
</P>
<P>
Lau said that the people of the New Territories are excited
about the return of Hong Kong and are determined to work hard to
maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.

Kong, according to results of a research conducted by Asia Market
Intelligence Ltd (AMI).
</P>
<P>
The results showed that sales of Western style fast food in

<HEADLINE> Final Verdicts on Ex-presidents By April 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The final verdicts on South Korean
ex-presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo will be made by the
end of April 1997 at the latest, court officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chun was sentenced to death and Roh to 22 and a half years in
prison yesterday by the Seoul District Court on charges of mutiny,
treason and corruption.
</P>
<P>
But lawyers for the two former heads of state are likely to
appeal against the sentences as the defendants have refused to
accept the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
An appeal trial has to be completed within four months of the
initial sentencing. A final decision by the Supreme Court must be
made within four months following the completion of the appeal
trial, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the prosecutors assigned to the first trial
will continue their work in the appeal trial, while the same
heavyweight lawyers will defend their clients in the forthcoming
trial.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges against Chun and Roh stem from
their roles in the military coup on December 12, 1979, and a
subsequent crackdown on a civil uprising in Kwangju, capital of
South Cholla Province, on May 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who masterminded the coup, seized power on August 27,
1980, and ruled the country until February 1988 when Roh took
over. Roh stepped down in February 1993 after a presidential
election which saw his fellow party-member Kim Young-sam take
power.
</P>
<P>
The court also fined Chun 282 million U.S. dollars and Roh 355
million dollars, representing the bribes they allegedly
accumulated while in office.
</P>
<P>
Many South Koreans, however, believe that Chun and Roh will be
granted amnesties by current president Kim Young-sam. A survey by
the independent Hankyoreh newspaper said 69 percent of Koreans
believe the two will be pardoned.

for all-round economic development in line with market rules.
</P>
<P>
Every province or region has its own economic pattern and
advantages, and must develop the local economy in accordance with
their conditions to survive market competition both at home and
abroad, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
With all its resources, Heilongjiang has made a great
contribution to the country's economic development, and although
it has had a number of economic woes in recent years, it has still
managed to register faster economic growth, Zou noted, encouraging
local officials to work harder for further improvements.
</P>
<P>
He said that the state-owned enterprises are the backbone of
the national economy and make up an important part of
public-ownership, and efforts should be made to improve them.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problems of money-losing enterprises, it is
necessary to develop new products that meet market demands,
improve management, and increase technological improvements, Zou
said.

BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The US's IBM and the National
Library of China, in Beijing, announced at a press conference here
today that they will cooperate in a project to put the library's
books on computer so that they can be read via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The library is the fifth largest in the world, with nearly 20
million books. At present, a part of its books are catalogued on
the computer network but only titles can be called up.
</P>
<P>
The first step of the plan is to transform the "Illustrated 500
Arhats" into digital graphs. The four-volume illustrated Buddhist
scriptures were drawn early this century.
</P>
<P>
The books will be preserved when they are part of the
multimedia network. Digital libraries represent the latest trend
in the development of libraries, experts say.
</P>
<P>
At the 62nd IFLA conference, being held in Beijing, experts
from Europe, the United States and Japan gave lectures on the
development of digital libraries. At present, one percent of the
information in the world has been digitalized.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that China's Ministry of Culture has agreed to
put the establishment of the digital library on its agenda.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Jet Hijacking Ends Peacefully in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The hijacking of a Sudanese jet
which was flown to Stansted Airport in London early this morning
with 199 passengers and crew on board ended peacefully this
afternoon, Essex police said.
</P>
<P>
Six hijackers -- thought to be Iraqi nationals travelling with
their families -- were arrested after giving themselves up to
police after nine hours of talks. They are seeking political
asylum in Britain, police told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 passengers and crew taken hostage on the jet were
released some two hours after the airliner arrived at Stansted,
and are all safe and well, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan Airways Airbus A310 was hijacked on Monday evening
soon after it left the Sudanese capital Khartoum for the Jordanian
capital Amman.
</P>
<P>
It was forced to divert to Larnaca in Cyprus for refueling and
the hijackers then demanded to be taken to Britain. They claimed
to have explosives on board and threatened to blow up the jet
unless their demands were met.
</P>
<P>
The plane landed at Stansted airport, 50 kilometers northeast
of London, at 4.30 a.m. (0330 GMT) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the stop in Cyprus, the hijackers told police they
wanted to claim political asylum in Britain and would release the
passengers once they landed in London.
</P>
<P>
When they arrived in London, the hijackers demanded to see a
British-based member of the Iraqi Community Association called
Sadiki, police said. This was their only demand.
</P>
<P>
Kim White, a spokeswoman for Essex police, the force
responsible for Stansted, said most of the passengers were
Sudanese but that there were also an unknown number of Iraqis,
Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Saudis on board.
</P>
<P>
This was the second hijacking involving a Sudanese airliner
this year. On March 24, a Sudan Airways Airbus A320 plane carrying
40 passengers and crew on an internal flight was hijacked to the
Eritrean capital Asmara, where the two Sudanese hijackers
surrendered and sought political asylum.

<HEADLINE> Rapid Development in China's Publishing Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China's publishing industry
prospered after the country's reforms and opening up began, but
there is still a long way to go before it will have a secure place
in the world's fast-developing publishing business.
</P>
<P>
It is undergoing a series of reforms and many measures are
being developed to improve quality and efficiency, to deal with
the fierce competition, industry sources say.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, in 1978 China had only 105 publishing
houses, but by July of this year, the number had come to
560. There were more than 300,000 people employed in the industry
at the end of 1995, some 30,000 of whom were editors.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, China published 12,500 different books, more than
9,800 of which were new titles, and more than four billion copies
were printed. In 1995, more than 101,000 different books were
published, with more than 59,000 new ones, and more than 6.3
billion copies printed.
</P>
<P>
A number of outstanding books were published, such as the
74-volume "China Encyclopedia", the 13-volume "Chinese
Dictionary", and works on the natural sciences.
</P>
<P>
However, quantity is not the most important factor with which
to judge a nation's publishing industry. Quality and improved
efficiency are the key factors which decide whether or not China's
publications can compete in the world market, experts say.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the Press and Publication Administration, the
country's top decision-making body in the publishing business,
made a strategic decision for the development of the industry by
improving quality and efficiency instead of increasing quantity.
</P>
<P>
A series of measures for developing the publishing industry,
and long-term goals for the year 2010, regulations for
streamlining the market, and plans to establish a book quality
guarantee system have been worked out.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts have also been made to crack down on illegal
and pirated publications.

<HEADLINE> China Looking for Response From Taiwan Authorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shen Guofang expressed the hope here today that the
Taiwan authorities will have a favorable response to the
mainland's suggestions and take concrete steps.
</P>
<P>
In responding to a question about this matter at a press
conference this afternoon, Shen said that the mainland has put
forward many suggestions on the opening of political talks and
direct links between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, but so
far has received no positive response from the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is important for the two sides to start
political talks in order to remove political differences and
eliminate the state of hostility. Direct links for better
communication and exchanges between the two sides are equally
important, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities, instead of making a positive response
to the idea of political talks, put many obstacles in the path of
the three direct links, especially trade relations, in order to
check the further development of economic and trade ties across
the straits, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that some of the Taiwan authorities are making a
greater effort at expanding the so-called living space of Taiwan
in the international community and in activities aimed at creating
"Two Chinas" or "One China, One Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Taiwan authorities will take practical and
effective measures in a favorable response to the suggestions made
by the mainland," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> WHO Reaffirms its Position on Gossypol-based Contraceptive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) today denied giving its backing to a new male contraceptive
pill to be marketed by the Brazilian company Hebron de Caruaru.
</P>
<P>
The company said last week studies on the drug, based on the
cotton extract gossypol, had been done in conjunction with the WHO
and that it was applying for health ministry approval for the pill.
</P>
<P>
The pill does not have the backing or approval of the WHO, a
statement put out by the health body said.
</P>
<P>
"WHO does not have a mandate for approving drugs for marketing
and it does not endorse products of any commercial company."
</P>
<P>
In 1981, WHO decided that it would not support any clinical
research on gossypol after examining the available information on
the safety of the compound and on the reversibility of its
antifertility action.
</P>
<P>
The WHO sponsored animal studies of gossypol in the early 1980s
to see if a dose level could be found at which there was a
reversible antifertility effect but no toxicity.
</P>
<P>
But even at relatively low doses the compound showed signs of
toxicity in animals and there remained concerns about the lack of
complete reversibility of its antifertility action.
</P>
<P>
"There has since been no basis for WHO to reverse its 1981
decision not to support studies in humans and not to develop
gossypol as an antifertility agent for men," the WHO said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Japan's aggressive actions in
China by militarists brought about untold suffering and that their
heinous crimes such as the Nanjing massacre are beyond doubt.
</P>
<P>
The remark came from China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen
Guofang at a press conference here today in response to a question
about a statement made by some members of the general committee of
the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party that the story about the
Nanjing massacre had been fabricated.
</P>
<P>
Shen noted that recent fallacies of one kind or another not
only hurt the feelings of the Chinese people but also hurt Japan's
image in the international community.
</P>
<P>
This also showed that there is indeed a move in Japan to deny
the history of aggression, and its activities are sure to meet
with strong opposition from Asian countries, Shen added.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Japanese government to adopt a more
somber-minded attitude and clear perspective, to face up to
history, and to embark on a path of peaceful development.

GENEVA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) appealed today for more than 5
million U.S. dollars to fill a gap in its 1996 budget for the
repatriation and rehabilitation of Somali refugees.
</P>
<P>
The funds will help send home and rehabilitate 10,000 Somali
refugees this year out of 280,000 still remaining in Ethiopia,
1,000 out of 25,000 in Djibouti, and 35,000 out of 125,300 in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR appealed for 12.6 million dollars for its 1996 Somali
refugee program and has so far received more than 7.3 million.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokesperson Ron Redmond told a press briefing this
morning that the funds would also cover reintegration projects for
some 500,000 refugees who had earlier returned to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1 million Somalis fled clan fighting that followed the
fall of the Siad Barre regime in January 1991 and a prolonged
drought, UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
There were also about 10,000 Somali refugees in Yemen as of

<HEADLINE> Diaoyu Island Is Chinese Territory, Chinese Spokesman Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shen Guofang reiterated here today that Diaoyu Island
has been an integral part of China since ancient times.
</P>
<P>
The remark came during a news conference here this afternoon in
response to a question about a report that members of a Japanese
right-wing group have erected a wooden tablet with a picture of
the Japanese national flag on the island.
</P>
<P>
Some members of Japanese right-winger groups have again built
some facilities on the island without authorization, he said.
"This has grossly violated Chinese territorial sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
"We express our indignation at such activities," he said,
adding that "we solemnly declare that any facilities they built on
the island are illegal."
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to take action to change China's stance on its
sovereignty in the case of the island will be in vain," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Japanese government should take
immediate steps to eliminate any harmful effects that could result
from this.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets World Bank Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
said here this afternoon that China is to continue its cooperation
with the World Bank (WB) in education.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark here this afternoon at the Diaoyutai State
Guesthouse when meeting with a seven-member WB Executive Board
delegation which is here as guest of China's Finance Ministry to
inspect the implementation of projects with WB loans.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that China's first project with WB loans was the
university development project since China resumed its seat in the
WB in 1980.
</P>
<P>
From 1981, there have been a total of 14 educational projects
in China involving WB loans, 12 of them have been completed and
under implementation.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of WB loans in such projects has reached over
1.3 billion US dollars, besides the 6.6 billion yuan (about 807
million US dollars) put into those projects by the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the visitors on the development of China's education,
Li said that China, a developing country, is developing the
largest education system in the world.
</P>
<P>
To realize the goal of revitalizing the country with science
and education, China still needs the support from the World Bank,
noted Li.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that during China's ninth five-year plan
period (1996--2000), the World Bank can support China's
popularization of a compulsory education and the reform of higher
education as key fields.
</P>
<P>
Franco Passacantando, a member of the delegation, said that the
World Bank attaches great importance to education, and China's
projects with WB loans have been conducted well, as he saw that
local governments and people contributed much capital and labor to
the construction of schools, which is a good manifestation of
their attention to education and left these WB officials with a
deep impression.
</P>
<P>
Li attributed the good implementation of these projects to
local government officials' efforts and local people's
enthusiastic support.
</P>
<P>
Passacantando said that the WB Executive Board will, as always,
continue to support China's educational projects.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel's Orthodox Jews Escalating Battle for Wider Control of Society (I) (By Zhi Linfei) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Orthodox religious
Jews are launching a hatred campaign against the Supreme
Court, escalating a cultural war to battle for a wider
control of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
An uproar erupted in the country after two Orthodox
newspapers, Hashavua and Yated Ne'eman, published articles in
recent days branding the Supreme Court President Aharon Barak
as "the great enemy of Judaism". Moreover, posters blasting
Barak also appeared in many Jerusalem neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
Barak was blamed for issuing two injunctions to halt
implementing an order by the Transportation Ministry to close
Jerusalem's Bar Ilan Street during prayer times on Shabbath,
the Jewish weekend starting from Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and opposition expressed shock and
condemnation over the incitement against the justice system of
the secular and open country.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman Monday denounced the attacks on
Barak and urged every citizen to observe and respect the
law. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, despite of the credit
he owed to the religious parties in May elections, also
defended the authority of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
"We are a country based on law, and the Supreme Court
is a cornerstone of the legislative authority in the state.
We will not permit attacks on this important and central
institution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Dan Meridor sharply criticized the Orthodox
papers for launching "a severe incitement campaign", which is
aimed at damaging not only senior justices but also the basic
values of society and the public's confidence in the justice
system.
</P>
<P>
The opposition even revived the memory of the assassination
of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin last November by a radical
Jew incited by a religious and rightist hatred campaign to
oppose his peace policies. Rabin was often branded as a
Jewish "traitor" for trading land for peace with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Bar Ilan street is a major traffic route cutting through
a religious residence area in northern Jerusalem. The closure
of the street is a long demand by the religious residents
there, but it was only until after the May elections that
they have raised their voice.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel's Orthodox Jews Escalating Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past two months, nearly every Saturday evening before
or after the end of Shabbath, large crowds of Orthodox Jews
gathered in Bar Ilan street to protest the court order to keep the
road open.
</P>
<P>
On July 10, Transportation Minister Yitzhak Levy, of the
Orthodox National Religious Party, ordered the closure of the
street during prayer times on Shabbath. But the Supreme Court
froze the implementation after hearing petitions by the secular
groups represented by Meretz and Labor parties.
</P>
<P>
This led to the outbreak of widespread protests and
violence in Bar Ilan street. Orthodox protesters threw stones
and rubbish at passing cars and even violently clashed with
secular demonstrators and police.
</P>
<P>
After the arrest of several stone-throwers, the religious
faction within the government requested the resignation of
Jerusalem police head Arye Amit.
</P>
<P>
In face of the complication, the Supreme Court renewed the
injunction on August 15 to keep the street open until after
a special commission makes a formal decision. Thus the
Orthodox community outpoured its anger on the Supreme Court
and its president Aharon Barak.
</P>
<P>
The religious faction in the Knesset is also considering
passing laws to rein in the court, which is accused of
being used as an anti-religious tool by the secular groups.
</P>
<P>
The worsening battle over the Bar Ilan street has in fact
become a cultural war as the Orthodox camp, armed with the
newly-found strength gained from the May 29 elections, increases
its demand for wider control of the state.
</P>
<P>
Four Orthodox religious parties won 25 seats in the 120-member
Knesset (parliament) in the elections, and controlled several
major posts in the new Likud-led coalition cabinet, including
the Interior, Transportation, Education, Labor and Religious
Affairs portfolios.
</P>
<P>
The secular activists have already rung the alarm bell for
an increasing wave of Judaism fundamentalism, characteristic of
religious coercion and deeper interference with the freedom of
every citizen.

<HEADLINE> US Statement About Arms Sales To Taiwan Unfounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shen Guofang said here today that the US's
rationalization that its arms sales to Taiwan did not violate the
Sino-US Joint Communique is baseless.
</P>
<P>
The remark came in response to a question about a large amount
of arms the US recently sold to Taiwan and its stating that the
sales do not violate the communique signed on August 17, 1982,
claiming that the weapons are defensive.
</P>
<P>
According to Shen, the US government explicitly stated in the
communique that "it will not seek to carry out a long-term policy
of arm sales to Taiwan and that its arms sales to Taiwan will not
exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level
of those supplied in recent years since the establishment of
diplomatic relations between the US and China, and that it intends
to gradually reduce its arms sales to Taiwan, leading, over a
period of time, to a final resolution."
</P>
<P>
However, Shen noted, recently the US has sold or will soon sell
weapons worth hundreds of million of US dollars to Taiwan,
including over a thousand missiles like the "Avenger" or the
"Patriot".
</P>
<P>
The US will also help Taiwan to expand its Hawk missile bases
from 13 at present to 20, set up missile maintenance centers in
Taiwan and sell Taiwan advanced military communications equipment,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the communique does not allow the US to sell what
it calls defensive weapons to Taiwan. In any case, the weapons
sold to Taiwan have gone far beyond the confines set down in the
communique either in qualitative or quantitative
terms. "Therefore," he said, "the defensive argument of the US on
its arms sales to Taiwan does not hold water."

<HEADLINE> China Denies Causing Cholera in Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese diplomat
today denied recent official reports in Mongolia that the cholera
epidemic sweeping Mongolia was started by contaminated food
brought in over the border by Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
It is impossible that the epidemic came from China because
northern China, including the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
has not seen cholera for years and not a single case of cholera
has been found in China this year, Commercial Counsellor Chai
Guangtian said from the Chinese embassy in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's official Ardiin Erkh newspaper quoted government
sources as saying Saturday that Mongolian health organizations
have discovered the infection was transmitted by foodstuffs that
were imported by Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
Publishing such an unfounded allegation to shift the blame onto
the shoulders of other countries' citizens is reckless and
irresponsible and will do unnecessary damage to bilateral
relations, said the counselor.
</P>
<P>
Chai urged Mongolia to conduct an objective and scientific
investigation into the real cause of the disease.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 people have died and more than 130 infected since
the epidemic broke out in Mongolia at the beginning of this
month.

<P>
Qian, who is also member of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, conferred with
the delegation on a wide range of topics, including Sino-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian welcomed the delegation, which was headed by Kenji Kosaka,
director of the NFP's International Affairs Bureau, on behalf of
the CPC Central Committee, and said that the NFP had forged
friendly ties with the CPC soon after its founding.
</P>
<P>
The delegation's China trip was proposed by its leader Ichiro
Ozawa, which shows its eagerness to understand China and attaches
importance to developing Sino-Japanese relations. "We appreciate
all of this," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was not easy for Sino-Japanese relations to reach
the level it has attained today, something that should be
treasured the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the CPC and the Chinese government have always
attached importance to Sino-Japanese relations, and expressed his
hope that all Japan's political parties and politicians can face
up to history and use it as a mirror to promote the long-term,
healthy development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Kosaka thanked Qian for the meeting and said that the purpose
of the China visit is to exchange views on establishing mutual
trust between China and Japan and to learn more about China.
</P>
<P>
The NFP hopes that its multi-faceted exchanges with the CPC
will help the growth of bilateral relations and contribute to
peace in east Asia and the world as a whole, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislators Review Two Draft Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Two drafts of laws on
controlling noise pollution and construction are being studied by
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's
top legislature.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the committee said that they attach great
importance to the draft of the Law on Preventing and Controlling
Noise Pollution, and that "priority should be given to putting the
draft into practice".
</P>
<P>
Other members pointed out that the draft primarily deals with
noise of machinery, and it would be better if the draft contains
more details about man-made noise.
</P>
<P>
Xin Yejiang, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
provincial People's Congress of Hainan, however, said that it is
not easy to implement a draft which does not define specifically
when the decibel level is violating the law.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that, although the chapter on "legal
responsibility" touches upon the issue of financial penalties, it
does not contain enough details, making it hard for the law
enforcement department to implement.
</P>
<P>
One committee member, Cai Zimin, said that although the draft
of the Construction Law has some regulations for environmental
protection and safety in operation, it contains no similar
regulations for design work.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he proposed that further amendments should be made
in this respect because bad design work is bound to bring about
problems.
</P>
<P>
Another committee member, Ye Zhengda, said that he believes
that sub-standard buildings pose a serious threat to people's
security, therefore, "great importance should be attached to the
issue."
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the buyer should also be entitled to check
the quality of a building upon completion and more details
concerning a probation period should be added to the draft because
he believed that "only after probation period, can one regard the
building as qualified".

<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh has reaffirmed that Yemen would stick to a peaceful
solution for the restoration of the Lesser and Greater Hanish
islands, saying that this is the only option for Yemen.
</P>
<P>
This came in an interview recently conducted by the BBC with
the Yemeni president and broadcast Monday night.
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't resort to the military option and would adopt
the peaceful solution, maintaining our legitimate rights within
International Law," President Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the outcome of the French mediation
between Yemen and Eritrea, Saleh said that he was told by the
French government that the Eritreans informed the French envoy
Francis Gutman that they would withdraw troops before August 26.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the date was set by the Eritreans, the
Yemeni president said that it was set by French officials.
</P>
<P>
As to what would happen if an Eritrean withdrawal is not
accomplished within the coming few days, he said: "It is our
legitimate right to restore our lands taken by force. We hope that
the peaceful solution will remain within the French mediation and
International legitimacy."
</P>
<P>
Both Yemen and Eritrea have claimed sovereignty over three
Red Sea islands - Greater and Lesser Hanish islands and Zugar
island.
</P>

The dispute flared up last December when the two sides fought a
fierce battle and Eritrean troops took control Greater Hanish, the

The dispute has come to the fore again after Yemen accused
Eritrean troops of having taken over Lesser Hanish on August 10.

LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- All of the 199 passengers and
crew have been released today from a Sudanese aircraft which was
hijacked to London, police said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Airbus, on a flight from Khartoum, capital of
Sudan, to Amman, capital of Jordan, landed at Stansted airport,
about 50 kilometers northeast of London, earlier this morning
after being forced to divert to Cyprus for refueling.
</P>
<P>
The plane was hijacked on Monday evening soon after it left
Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
During a refueling stop in Cyprus, the unidentified hijackers
told police they wanted to seek political asylum in Britain and
would release the passengers once they landed in London.
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers on board were Sudanese nationals, but
there were also an unknown number of Iraqis, Jordanians,
Palestinians, Syrians and Saudis, said Kim White, a spokeswoman

<HEADLINE> APEC Energy Ministers Aim To Promote Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- APEC energy ministers are
expected to endorse a series of initiatives designed to promote
business sector investment in the power industry at their
inaugural meeting due to be held in Sydney Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The expected endorsement is seen as having benefits for
Australia, a major fuel exporter to the region, and as a sign of
deeper cooperation between the 18 members of the APEC (Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation).
</P>
<P>
Christopher Eves, the principal author of a report to the APEC
Energy Working Group, told reporters today that in spite of a huge
need there had been a lack of business investment in power
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Demand for electricity among the APEC members is expected to
grow substantially over the next 15 years, with investment of more
that 1,300 billion US dollars needed.
</P>
<P>
Much of this will have to come from the business sector and the
bulk will be spent in developing and newly industrialized nations
such as China, Thailand and Indonesia, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day's meeting, the energy ministers are expected
to address issues such as greater exchange of information, sharing
experience in policy development, more efficient tender processes
and tariff and environmental policies.
</P>
<P>
Addressing these issues could facilitate business investment in
power infrastructure and remove a potential bottleneck to growth
in the region, Eves believed.
</P>
<P>
They will also help open new markets in the energy-related
field, reduce the cost of investment in new Asian markets and
promote economically rational decision making, he added.
</P>
<P>
APEC comprises: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand and the United States.

COLOMBO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A police constable and a

<HEADLINE> Japan's Regional Banks Cut Overseas Branches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of Japanese
regional banks are closing down their overseas branches to set
aside capital to write their bad loans, a banking industry
official said today.
</P>
<P>
The banks are targeting branches in the U.S. and European
countries where offices were set up merely for the sake of
appearance to compete with rival banks that already had overseas
branches, the official said.
</P>
<P>
However, some regional banks will maintain their overseas
business bases in China and some Southeast Asian countries due to
their growing dealings with small and medium-sized Japanese
companies that have production facilities there.
</P>
<P>
Regional Japanese banks had just 17 overseas branches in
1988. But that figure rose to 27 in 1989 and to 46 by the end of
1991 at the peak of the Japanese market before the economic
"bubble" burst.

<HEADLINE> Japan Calls For Continued Attention to Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Although the incidence of a food
poisoning epidemic caused by the O-157 strain of E. coli bacteria
is declining, Japan's Health Ministry today warned people of
continued possibility of being infected with the disease.
</P>
<P>
As sporadic outbreaks continued, people still need to watch out
and take precautions against the epidemic, Health Minister Naoto
Kan told a cabinet meeting, Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
But Kan said that since August 8, Sakai city of Osaka
Prefecture, center of the recent epidemic, had not registered any
new cases.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic had claimed 11 lives and infected almost 10,000
people across the country.
</P>
<P>
The Osaka prefectural government said it found seven more
food-poisoning patients who had eaten "kaiware daikon," or white
radish sprouts, shipped by the Minamino Farm in Habikino in the
prefecture, which the Health Ministry had suspected to be the
source of the disease in Sakai.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's latest nationwide food inspection,
seven out of 4,400 samples, or 0.2 percent, were found
contaminated with O-157 bacillus, with none of the cases in sea
food, vegetables, eggs or bean curd.
</P>
<P>
Of the 3,167 voluntary checks at slaughterhouses, only one
O-157 contamination case in a beef sample was found.
</P>
<P>
In September and October the state will launch more thorough
sanitary checks on school lunches, the major source of the recent
spread of food poisoning, Kan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa arrived here today to discuss the latest developments of
the stalled Arab-Israeli peace process with Syrian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Moussa was expected to meet with Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad to deliver a message from Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will also hold talks with his Syrian counterpart Farouk
al-Sharaa on means of reviving the stalled peace talks and the
preparations for the Economic Summit of the Middle East and North
Africa, which is slated to be held in Cairo in November.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which spearheaded the Arab-Israeli peace-making and
signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, has been trying to
mediate a resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel,
whose talks have been deadlocked over the issue of the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Damascus, Moussa reiterated his criticism
of Israel's hard-line leadership for making wrong interpretation
of the peace requirements and freezing the negotiations since
Likud Party Chairman Benjamin Netanyahu was elected prime minister
in May.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed his support for Syria's demand for Israeli
commitment to the land-for-peace formula as the very basis for
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Mubarak and Assad had a phone conversation to
exchange their views on the stalled peace process and other issues
of mutual concern.

CANBERRA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Wheat Board

revising its original forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The AWB said in a new release that it revised its estimate to

<HEADLINE> Israel Demolishes Palestinian Building in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel demolished this morning
a 150-square-meter Palestinian building inside Jerusalem's old
city, claiming that the building was built without a permit from
the city municipality.
</P>
<P>
According to a Jerusalem Media and Communication Center report
(JMCC), part of the building was served as a center for the city's
handicaps, and also used as a kindergarten and a club for youth.
</P>
<P>
However, officials from the Jerusalem Municipality said that
the building was financed by the Palestinian Authority, which
made it a violation of the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
A bulldozer pulled down the wall of the building, while dozens
of Israeli Border Police stopped Palestinians from approaching the
area, and the neighboring residents were also denied permission to
leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
The JMCC report quoted Palestinian Council (PC) member Ahmed
Al-Batsh as saying that the act exterminates the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Al-batsh said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
tells the world a thing while conducting on ground another.
</P>
<P>
He added that PC members from eastern Jerusalem called on
Jerusalem residents to participate in a sit-in in the place of the
incident between 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. local time (1000-1200 GMT)
today.
</P>
<P>
Today's demolition followed similar actions during the last
two weeks when several Palestinian buildings in east Jerusalem,
which the Jerusalem Municipality considered as "illegally built,"
had been torn down.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources, dealing with "illegal construction" in east
Jerusalem, said that the recent incidents were in line with the
long-standing policy and did not represent the start of any sort
of crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Today's demolition is seen as the latest incident in the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute over the future of Jerusalem. The
Palestinians want Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent
Palestinian state, while Israel's hardline government says it will
not share power in the city.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the eastern sector of Jerusalem from Jordan in
the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Transfer Satellite Technology to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian senior diplomat has
disclosed that Russia is to transfer satellite technology to Iran
under an agreement signed between the two countries, according to
today's Persian daily Iran.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Mehdi Safari, Iranian Ambassador to Russia, as
saying that Russia would transfer the technology for manufacturing
satellites to Iran in three stages.
</P>
<P>
But he did not go into detail about the deal, only saying that
Iran's first educational satellite would be launched into space
within the next three years.
</P>
<P>
As to the deal between Tehran and Moscow for the purchase and
manufacture of aircraft, including Antonov-140, Safari said the
two countries signed an agreement for training manpower in the
aero-space sector.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, he added, the Aero-Space University in
Moscow will commence a program within the next two months for
training Iranians in the required fields.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, instead of sending students abroad, the
trainees would be admitted at the Sheikh Bahaei University in
Isfahan where foreign professors would lecture on the courses.
</P>
<P>
He announced that as of next month, a daily cargo flight would
begin between the Iranian city of Tabriz and the Russian capital
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iran and Russia also signed a separate
agreement, under which Moscow would cooperate with Tehran in
staff training and equipment maintenance at Tehran's subway.
</P>
<P>
Another accord was also to be signed between the two
countries for the purchase of subway tracks, Safari said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a cargo bureau will be established in Moscow to
handle the purchase of equipment needed by the oil industry and
for the design and construction of oil platforms.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian diplomat said other agreements were also inked for
the transfer of technology including those used in the field of
semi-conductors and in the production of aluminum powder.
</P>
<P>
Processing fish powder in the Sea of Oman and the making of
artificial rain over the desert of Yazd in Central Iran, were
other joint ventures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he disclosed that two jetties were under
construction in Russia with the participation of Iran.
</P>
<P>
As for the volume of trade between the two countries, Safari
said aggregate commercial exchanges stood at 249 million dollars
in 1995, of which Iran had a share of 49 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Iranian export to Russia would amount to 2
billion dollars annually since the cooperation agreements have
paved the way for brisk markets in Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia was currently providing Iran with items which
used to be monopolized by the United States and European
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government has
rejected the academic credentials of medicine issued by Central
Asian republics and East European countries, a press report said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry announced that the ministry would no
longer recognize the academic credentials of Iranian students who
study medicine in some Central Asian republics and East European
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Minister Mohammad Hassan Imami did not specify
the names of those countries in a report carried in today's
Persian-language daily Salam.
</P>
<P>
He explained that his ministry rejected the academic
credentials by the Asian and European countries because their
study of medicine and its affiliated branches is "not developed
enough" and "does not enjoy the necessary scientific credit."
</P>
<P>
Thus, he added, the ministry would not recognize degrees from
these countries as being equivalent to their counterparts in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the ministry would partially recognize the
credentials awarded to returned Iranian students who graduated by
the Spring of 1996 in view of the time and resources they had
spent in those countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that his ministry will adopt a more picky attitude
toward the selection of countries to send students with
scholarship to study abroad.
</P>
<P>
No word was mentioned by the report on whether the rejection is
applied to credentials of other majors.

<HEADLINE> Library Plays Important Role in CPC Revolutionary History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China
(CPC) founded its first library 64 years ago, with collections
that support the victory of revolutionary wars and the founding of
New China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Faping, a leading researcher of library history, said that
based on historical records from the Ruijin Revolutionary Museum
during the agrarian revolutionary wars in east China's Jiangxi
Province, CPC established its first library in 1932, which is
named the Chinese Soviet Central Library.
</P>
<P>
The CPC, founded in 1921, set up a red revolutionary political
power in Ruijin at the end of 1931.
</P>
<P>
With thousands of books, reference materials and periodicals
collected from battles, or donated by people of all walks of life,
the red power started its first library in the following
year. There are still 2,400 copies of books, newspapers and
periodicals and other library materials stored in the
revolutionary museum, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The library, which was only manned with three librarians and
equipped with simple library equipment, has helped CPC educate a
group of party leaders and military officials, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The large military collections in the library contributed to
the victory of the Chinese revolutionary wars which led to the
final liberation of the whole country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The books in the fields of politics, philosophy, economy,
culture, education, and geology helped the CPC party members learn
more about science and society.
</P>
<P>
The library existed in Ruijin for only two years, and then it
followed the Red Army on the the world-famous "Long March"
(1934-1935).
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China in 1949, China has set up a
total of 250,000 libraries, which have been playing an important
role in the country's information industry and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,600 representatives from 89 countries and regions, who
attended the on-going 62nd General Conference of the International
Federation of Library Associations here, are discussing the
challenge the libraries face today and will face in the future.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Luoyang Bearing Company, one
of China's three largest bearing businesses, is working to
win a bigger market share with its high-quality products.
</P>
<P>
The plant produces about 100 kinds of bearings for use on
railways, turbines, automobiles, and electrical appliances, that
have already sharpened its competitive edge in the market.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still striving to turn its bearings into
brand-name products in domestic and overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Brand-name bearings made by Luoyang will reach market
availability of 20 percent by the year 2000, its general manager
Wu Weiguo said.

<HEADLINE> Vehicle Emissions Aggravate Air Quality in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Vehicle emissions are the
largest contributors of man-made pollutants in Hong Kong,
accounting for up to 65 percent of the aerosols or airborne
particles clogging the air, according to the experts of the Hong
Kong University of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Each year over 400,000 licensed vehicles in Hong Kong discharge
nearly 6,000 tons of particulates into the atmosphere, while only
400 tons come from industrial sources, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, researchers from the University's Research Center,
Department of Chemistry, and Safety and Environmental Protection
Office have investigated air quality in Hong Kong through various
means, including atmospheric studies and chemical analysis.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that most air samples have been found to
contain consistently high levels of Polycyclic Aromatic
Hydrocarbons, known to be the largest class of chemical
carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
They urged the Hong Kong government to take measures to handle
the worsening air quality in the territory, warning that since
aerosol levels are a direct consequence of energy use, it can be
expected that air quality in the region will be degraded
significantly with continued economic growth in Hong Kong.

HONG KONG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 504,344 Hong Kong
holiday-makers have passed through the Lo Wu checkpoint to and
from the Chinese mainland in the past three days, according to the

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Doctor Arrested in Circumcision Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian doctor was arrested
after he circumcised a 14-year-old girl who later died, a local
English-language newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The doctor, identified as Rabie Ibrahim Mahgoub, has been
charged with negligence, according to The Egyptian Gazette.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the police arrested him at the house of his friend
where he had been hiding since the death of the girl Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The girl's father said that the doctor had performed the
circumcision operation at home, charging 20 Egyptian pounds (six
U.S. dollars), police sources were quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The father also told police that after his daughter did not
wake up from the circumcision procedure, he went twice to seek the
doctor's advice. But the doctor told him that the girl was still
under the effects of the anesthetic he had given her.
</P>
<P>
The girl was the second child to die from circumcision in two
months.
</P>
<P>
Last month, an 11-year-old girl bled to death after a botched
circumcision performed by a barber in a village north of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Many Egyptians follow the tradition of female
circumcision. Despite the dangers to health, an estimated 70
percent to 90 percent of girls in Egypt are circumcised before
puberty.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Health Minister Ismail Sallam banned all registered
doctors, nurses and health-care workers from performing
circumcisions.
</P>
<P>
But there is still no law that specifically outlaws female
circumcision.

<P>
CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Histadrut Chairman Amir Peretz estimated Monday
that the number of foreign workers in Israel, that has a total
population of 5.5 million, is around 400,000, and not the 200,000
cited in official reports.
</P>
<P>
Peretz expressed his shock over the proposal by the Labor Party
and Social Affairs Minister Eli Yishai to set up camps for illegal
foreign workers who later would be deported, saying the plan "is
an inhumane solution" which would seriously damage Israel's image
abroad.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The International Hilton Hotel chain has signed an
agreement with Israel's Elad Hotels to run a hotel in downtown
Beersheba, capital of the Negev region, in southern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The 36 million-US-dollar hotel, which will include 262 rooms
and suites, is scheduled to open at the end of this year, and it
is expected to serve mainly businessmen pursuing projects in the
developing industrial regions of Negev.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- An Egyptian business delegation will visit the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on October 15 to seek new
joint investment opportunities, the local English-language
newspaper The Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, composed of members of the Egyptian Society for
Marketing Technology, will hold talks with their CIS counterparts
on ways of promoting bilateral trade which witnessed a radical
decrease during the last five years, Ahmed Sheha, chairman of the
society was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Middle East and North Africa Partners Fund is
expected to be launched before the convention of the Cairo
economic summit in November, the local daily The Egyptian Gazette
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new fund is planning to make equity investments of 250
million U.S. dollars in new and expanding businesses in Egypt,
Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, and the Palestinian self-rule areas, the
papaer said.
</P>
<P>
The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), an
independent U.S. government agency, is providing an investment
guaranty to support the privately capitalized and privately
managed fund.
</P>
<P>
The New York firm, Siguler Guff &AMP; Company, will manage the fund.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Leaders Lose in Parliamentary Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Many surprises have been seen in
Sunday's election in north Lebanon with a dozen of new faces
emerging among potential winners and several traditional leaders
defeated, according to preliminary results reported by election
officials this morning.
</P>
<P>
133 candidates were competing for 28 parliamentary seats in
the second of a five-phase election which began on August 18 in
the Mount Lebanon governorate and which will choose 128 members to
the half-Christian-half-Moslem parliament.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr announced that the final
results of the election in north Lebanon would be officially
issued at Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers noted that the main losers in
Sunday's contest appeared to be the Islamic groups and
well-established political parties such as the Christian
mainstream Phalange Party, the Arab Socialist Baath Party and the
National Syrian Social Party.
</P>
<P>
Although ex-premier Omar Karami and former Minister Suleiman
Franjieh, the most prominent traditional leaders in the area,
have not been removed, their supporters have apparently
diminished, giving way to new rivals.
</P>
<P>
The first winner seems to be Ahmed Habbous, 55, a
businessman owning several companies in North America and Asia
who is struggling for one of the two seats for Alawites,
an offshoot sect of Shiite Islam.
</P>
<P>
The votes which Habboush had obtained until the mid-night
were nearly 12,000 more than those gained by Nayla Moawwad,
widow of assassinated President Rene Moawwad who has occupied
the second place among the 28 most successful candidates.
</P>
<P>
In Tripoli, the governorate's capital and the second largest
city in Lebanon, Ahmed Karami has been regarded as a rocketing
star since he has won 88,000 votes, the most among those competing
for the five Sunni seats reversed for the city.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Karami is the cousin of former Prime Minister Omar Karami
 and is now the latter's main challenger for the leadership of
the Sunni community in Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Two Sunni fundamentalist group, Jamaa Al-Islamiya and the
pro-Syrian Al-Ahbash have apparently lost most representation in
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Four of their members were allies of the Iranian-backed Shiite
group Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the unicameral house.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah had earlier lost a parliamentary seat during the
first round of election in Mount Lebanon largely due to an
orchestrated anti-Hezbollah campaign by House Speaker Nabih Berri,
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and Druze leader Walid Jumblatt.
</P>
<P>
Pro-government candidates scored a crushing victory over
oppositions by winning 32 of 35 seats in the predominantly
Christian Mount Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At a rally in Beirut Monday night, Prime Minister Hariri
announced the list of his 17-member coalition of candidates to
contest with his main rival, ex-Prime Minister Salim Al-Hoss, in
the capital's election on September 1 in which 19 parliamentary
seats are at stake.
</P>
<P>
The toughest battles are anticipated in the fourth and
fifth rounds of election to be held respectively in southern
Lebanon on September 8 and in Beqaa on September 15 if a
coalition agreement is not reached between the Amal Movement
led by Berri and Hezbollah.

<HEADLINE> UN Asks Turkey to Increase Poppy Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has requested
Turkey to increase its production of poppies, the local newspaper
Daily News said today, quoting a Turkish Agriculture and Rural
Affairs Ministry source.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily, the international body defines Turkey
as a good model for other countries in the fields of planting
control and quality production.
</P>
<P>
The official source said, parallel to this request, the
purchasing price of poppies will be increased by 200 percent this
year as an incentive to Turkish producers to increase the planting
to its maximum 70,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The production of poppies, which fell to some 5,000 to 6,000
tons this year due to last year's low prices, is expected to
increase to 25,000 tons next year as the price goes up.
</P>
<P>
The source added that Turkey met 33 percent of the legal
narcotics needs of the world last year.
</P>
<P>
The largest poppy capsule processing factory of the world is
in Afyon Bolvadin in Turkey, with a production capacity of 20,000
tons a year.
</P>
<P>
Because of its share of production, Turkey is in a position to
determine prices in the world's legal narcotics market. The price
of Turkish morphine is 400 U.S. dollars a kilogram.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Manufacturing Output Down in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Affected by the slowdown in
the electronics industry, total manufacturing output of Singapore
declined by 1.4 percent in June, bringing the cumulative output
growth for manufacturing in the first half of 1996 to ten percent,
the Economic Development Board (EDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the output for the electronics sector in June was
2.2 percent higher than last year's, compared to the 20.7 percent
average growth of the first five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
This was due to declines in the production of personal
computers, consumer electronics, semiconductors and
telecommunications equipment. Nevertheless, it said, cumulative
output for the electronics sector in the first half of 1996 grew
by 16.9 percent compared to the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The output of the chemical industries, including petroleum,
pharmaceuticals, petrochemical and other chemical industries,
increased by 7.5 percent in June, bringing the cumulative output
growth in the first half of 1996 to 11.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The EDB said that the slowdown in the electronics industry also
affected the growth of the fabricated metal products and plastic
products industries, which are dependent on demand from
multi-national electronics corporations.
</P>
<P>
Output of these two industries contracted by 6.2 percent and
11.5 percent respectively, it said, adding that cumulatively, the
former still grew by 2.2 percent for the first half of the year,
while the latter had declined marginally by 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, output of the machinery industry declined by 8.2
percent, while the output of electrical machinery continued to
decline in June, falling by 9.1 percent in the month, sending the
industry's cumulative output for the first half to shrink by 2.6
percent, the EDB said.

<HEADLINE> New Anti-crime Initiative Launched in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A new anti-crime
initiative aimed at helping 100 most needy police stations in
South Africa to improve the use of existing resources has been
launched by National Police Commissioner George Fivaz.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony at Moroka police station in
Soweto on Monday, Fivaz said the initiative, known as Project
Lifeline, is a ''ground-breaking initiative'' that would have a
visible effect on police services in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
Business Day paper today quoted Fivaz as saying the Project
Lifeline, which targets police stations in all the nine
provinces, had already achieved significant operational
improvements at nine police stations which took part in a recent
pilot project starting in May.
</P>
<P>
The launching ceremony was also attended by Safety and
Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, Safety and Security
Secretariat Head Azhar Cachalia and Business Against Crime (BAC)
Chairman Wendy Lucas-Bull.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mufamadi said the government has given various
state departments the vision to tackle crime with its national
crime prevention strategy.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed concern about the general lack of skills
in the police force, saying if nothing was done soon, all the
plans drawn up to fight crime ''will remain in the books and
never get to operational level''.
</P>
<P>
The increasing high crime rate in South Africa has reportedly
brought about negative effect on the country's economy, taking
into consideration the business confidence of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
While the South African police service, due to serious
managerial and logistical shortcomings, do not have the necessary
source to tackle the problem.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Has 30 Aircraft Engines Scattered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- At least 30 aircraft engines and
10 auxiliary power units owned by the Nigeria Airways have been
discovered to be scattered in different parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the vital equipment is estimated at more than
28 million U.S. Dollars, the newspaper ''Third Eye'' reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The equipment was sent abroad for refurbishing at various times
and it is not yet known why the equipment has not been retrieved.
</P>
<P>
But, according to the newspaper, some officials in the airline
alleged unfair deal between officials responsible for ferrying
of the equipment and some of the airlines technical partners.
</P>
<P>
The officials claimed that if the management of the national
carrier has been able to retrieve one quarter of the engines,
the airline would not have been in dire need of engines to fix on
its grounded boeing 737s and airbus a310-300s.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the engines are found in various
maintenance yards in Brussels, Miami, Amsterdam, Dublin and other
places.

<HEADLINE> New Substitution for Marrow Transplant Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese doctors have discovered
a substitute for bone marrow which should help ease the country's
shortage of the substance, according to a report in the newspaper
"Health News."
</P>
<P>
Dry cells extracted from the umbilical cord blood during
delivery can replace bone marrow during transplants for leukemia
patients, the article said.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts should be made to speed up the building of umbilical
blood banks and clinical research in this field, in order to
create favorable conditions for curing leukemia patients," the
newspaper cited a senior doctor in blood research as saying.
</P>
<P>
The leading reason for the low supply of bone marrow is that
many people believe their health will be jeopardized if they
donate, said Song Shanjun, a hematologist and doctor from the
affiliate hospital of the Tongji Medical University.
</P>
<P>
He noted that donors give only three percent of their body's
marrow, which is not harmful.
</P>
<P>
The most successful transplants are done when bone marrow is
taken from blood relatives, but China's high number of one-child
families make this difficult, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
Blood from the umbilical cord is abundant, and it is not costly
to extract cells from it, the doctor said.

<HEADLINE> Sentences Excite Positive Reactions in S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The heavy sentences on the two
former Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo as well as their
followers by the Seoul District Court have excited positive
reactions from the general public in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
South Korean political parties appraised the court ruling as
having set a historical precedent in bringing justice back and
offered respects for the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
The ruling New Korea Party (NKP) said the sentences are part of
President Kim Young-sam's efforts to set history right.
</P>
<P>
"The court rulings have made it clear that taking power by
illegal means is destined to face a stern judgment of the
history," said NKP Spokesman Kim Chull in a statement.
</P>
<P>
NKP Secretary-General Kang Sam-jae ruled out the possibility of
President Kim offering clemency soon to the two ill-fated former
presidents. "Any political consideration for them is hardly
thinkable as their trials are still under way," Kang said.
</P>
<P>
However, some NKP officials, who used to be followers of Chun
and Roh, said that they hope leniency will be given to them.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP)
said in a statement that the verdicts will serve as a lesson that
those who usurp power by force are not above the law.
</P>
<P>
The conservative opposition United Liberal Democrats (ULD) said
in a statement that the disposition of the coup case should serve
as a turning point not to repeat disruption of the constitutional
order through a coup.
</P>
<P>
The minor opposition Democratic Party (DP) warned against any
politically-motivated bid to extend leniency to the coup leaders.
</P>
<P>
People from universities, companies and some civilian groups
also expressed their welcome to the sentences. They said that the
rulings have reflected the nation's efforts to put an end to
criminal activities by the politics-conscious military.
</P>
<P>
The court sentenced Chun to death and Roh to 22 and a half
years in prison on Augest 26, on charges of mutiny, treason and
bribery. It also fined Chun 282 million U.S. dollars and Roh 355
million U.S. dollars, representing the bribes they allegedly
accumulated while in office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 13 out of 14 former South Korean officers who helped
the two ex-presidents in their quest for power were also sentenced
by the court to four to ten years in prison respectively.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Moves to Desert to Escape Family Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti has moved to live
in the desert to escape family fighting among his four wives and
seek for calm and tranquility, local English daily Arab Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily said a quagmire of problems between his two Kuwaiti
and two non-Kuwaiti wives have driven Al-Ajmi out of his city
villa into a small, humble home not far away from the country's
southern borders in Nuwaiseb.
</P>
<P>
The desert, with its pristine environment, provides a welcome
breather from the burden of his problems in the city, he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sheep provide a modicum of financial independence and water
comes from a well he dug near his newly set-up home, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ajmi said crossfire of his four wives prompted him to
abandon the city home to the care of his two Kuwaiti wives and
their seven children and take up abode in the desert with the
non-Kuwaiti wives and their five children, although now life is
rustic.
</P>
<P>
According to the Islamic Sharia, a Moslem could marry four
wives at a time and in Kuwait most of the families are still
following the life style of their forefathers that a big family
usually lives under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
With new ideas coming into the daily life of Kuwaits and the
awakening of emancipation consciousness of women, resultant family
problems often occur, sociologists say.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ajmi said the desert life had proved to be a good place for
his three children with psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily, al-Ajmi now is in a quandary as Kuwait
Municipality has served him an ultimatum to demolish his house in
the desert but he ruled out living in the city home with his
Kuwaiti wives.
</P>
<P>
A tight budget also denied him the chance of taking another
house on rent in the city.
</P>
<P>
"I'm in big trouble, I don't know what to do about
these insurmountable problems," he said.

<P>
PARIS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Representatives from 126 governments and 50 non-government
organizations held meetings from Tuesday to Saturday in Stockholm
to elaborate a concerted action against sexual exploitation of
children. The international conference, the first of its kind,
will put into limelight the reality of millions of children being
victimized in the world.
</P>
<P>
-- Most of the American Democrats attending the Democratic
Convention in Chicago were activists in 1968, who went to the
street to protest the Vietnam War. Having turned from Hippies to
Yuppies, the delegates are nostalgic of the time when violent
demonstrations erupted first in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton is asking Americans to make him
the first Democrat to be reelected since Franklin
Roosevelt. Clinton, who was on an old train starting from
Huntington, West Virginia, to take him during four days across the
Midwest to Chicago, is observing the oldest tradition of electoral
campaign in America. "I am in the train because I want to meet the
people for whom I have fought for four years," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
-- After taking tobacco away from children, Bill Clinton wants
to take guns away from violent husbands of America, which is an
argument to win him more support in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The American family is often a battlefield. For Republican
candidate Bob Dole, the most important thing is to stop drug abuse
in American schools. But Clinton is turning towards the American
bedrooms by considering imposing a ban of guns upon violent
husbands and daddies to protect American women and children.

<HEADLINE> Flooded Liuzhou Prefecture on Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NANNING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Liuzhou Prefecture is showing
signs of speedy recovery following a disastrous and rare flood
that hit south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in mid
July.
</P>
<P>
The flood caused billions of dollars of damage to more than
2.3 million people in ten counties or cities in the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Leading groups for disaster relief have been set up at
prefectural, county and township levels, and a working group
consisting of 3,400 people has gone to the the disaster-stricken
areas to do relief work and assist flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the prefecture are losing no time in planting early
rice, and have replanted more than 540,000 kilograms of late rice.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture plans to increase its maize planting area by
10,000 hectares and that for autumn potatoes by 33,000 hectares,
and also organize farmers to plant tomatoes, peppers and beans to
supplement the grain production.
</P>
<P>
The local government is investigating the number of people,
grain in stock and income sources of the families that were
affected by the flood.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture has set up more than 80,000 makeshift shelters,
issued 6.5 million yuan (about 783,000 US dollars) of relief funds
for human loss and 2.16 million yuan for production, 268 tons of
rice, 28,000 articles of clothing, 15,000 bed sheets and 12 tons
of medicine for victims.
</P>
<P>
Insurance agencies are handling the claims.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the timely shipping of relief materials to the
flood-affected areas, the prefecture is repairing all major roads
or opening up temporary transportation routes.
</P>
<P>
In the Rongshui, Rongjiang and Sanshui areas of the
prefecture, hundreds of thousands of people are working to repair
roads and bridges. Traffic has resumed on roads in most of these
areas.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Still Preparing for Talks With C'wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian team to meet the
C'wealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) began a meeting Monday
to fine-tune its strategies although the Canadian Foreign
Minister said CMAG's trip to Nigeria has been shelved.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is necessary to make adequate preparations for
CMAG members since ''there is no formal notification that
it (the visit of CMAG to Nigeria) has been cancelled,'' a source
close to the team said Monday in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
''It is not a cancellation. We believe they are trying a
rescheduling,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
A CMAG delegation is scheduled to visit Nigeria between August
28 and 29, which was decided at a meeting between CMAG and
Nigeria in London last June.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has said it would want the CMAG team
to hold talks with its officials only on the progress made at
the London meeting.
</P>
<P>
But CMAG is said to be interested in a fact-finding tour,
which will include talks with political detainees and
pro-democracy groups. The disagreement has resulted in weekend's
announcement of cancelling the proposed visit by Canadian
Foreign Minister Iloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
However, the source said, ''the visit is still open. It is for
CMAG to say whether they will come on schedule or seek to
reschedule the visit.''
</P>
<P>
The eight-member CMAG is to hold an emergency meeting
Wednesday in London to consider further actions.

<HEADLINE> Fake Diplomas Found in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Zambian graduates
from private colleges have been issued with worthless diplomas
and certificates, Zambia's Daily Mail newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Kangwa Nsuluka, Deputy Minister of the Science,
Technical and Vocational Training, as warning that the private
colleges which have designed diplomas and certificates for the
courses they offer risk losing their licenses.
</P>
<P>
He said that private institutions should comply with the
standards laid by the departments concerned.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said it is illegal for any institution to
design their own certificates and diplomas.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a private college was indefinitely closed for
operating illegally, prompting the government to conduct strict
monitoring on the operations of the private institutions.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANYA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Among the numerous attractions in
the beach-front city of Sanya on Hainan Island, the Ethnic Li
Folklore Park is a tourist favorite.
</P>
<P>
The 13-hectare park, located at the foot of a mountain, tempts
visitors with its unique thatched cottages of the ethnic Li
minority culture.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, when the thatches on the roof became rotten,
women of Ethnic Minority Li group would repair them with new
cogongrass they cut from the mountain trees. And when the roof
beams cracked, the men of the minority group would cut timber to
re-fortify their homes.
</P>
<P>
Visitors at the park are treated to flavorful and delicious Li
cuisines and colorful stage shows that display the rich local
culture through song and dance items.
</P>
<P>
Funded by local farmers, the park will cost a total of some 20
million yuan (2.409 million US dollars). So far, 4.7 million yuan
has been spent on construction.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Filmmakers On Sluggish Chinese Film Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese filmmakers attending
the Third China Changchun Film Festival voiced their opinions on
the lack of success of Chinese films in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Director Chen Jialin said that China's film market has not
formed a benign circle yet, and that the quality of domestic films
has dropped, resulting in lower ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that more than 50 percent of Chinese
audience said that they would prefer to stay at home and watch TV,
if no foreign movies such as "The Lion King" from the US and other
imported films.
</P>
<P>
Yu Min, screenwriter of China's first feature film "Bridge,"
said that the major cause for the disinterest in Chinese movies is
that there are no good scripts.
</P>
<P>
Professor Huang Shixian from the Beijing Film Academy stressed
that riots and sex in movies will not attract audiences for
long. He believes it is more important for films to grasp the
honesty, kindness and beauty of life, in order to find out what
the audience is thinking about and to grasp the hot topics of
society.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has placed great importance on
screen-writing and plans to give awards to good scripts.
</P>
<P>
Director Chen Jialin noted that the low quality of actors and
actresses has added to the deterioration of Chinese films. He said
that in recent years, many actors and actresses were more
concerned with their image, and ignored the need to improve their
performing skills.
</P>
<P>
Some actors and actresses said that most current films and TV
plays are made solely for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
Some filmmakers held that the key to filmmaking is to consider
the needs of the audience.
</P>
<P>
China plans to produce 70 films this year, but only 20-some
films had been made by August.
</P>
<P>
Though Chinese films have been in a difficult position in
recent years, many filmmakers said that the future of China's
movie industry is promising.
</P>
<P>
Chinese films have experienced two golden periods -- in the
1950s and in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

LUSAKA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- About 10 major international

Copper Mines (ZCCM) and have sent experts to the country to
assess prospects of investment.

</P>

The local newspaper quoted Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA)

<P>
Meanwhile, Chitalu said that a recent investment-promoting
mission to Asia found that potential investors know very little
about Zambia and the incentives it offers.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the trip was successful because it increased
awareness of Zambia's various investment opportunities and also
the desire for the country to compete for investment capital in
the world.

<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Pre-Congress of the 13th
International Congress on Archives opened here today, with full
financing from the Chinese government and the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
The theme for the pre-congress, which will close on September
1, is "Protection of Archives."
</P>
<P>
Fifty delegates at the pre-congress will also attend the
congress, scheduled to open in Beijing on September 2. Twenty of
the delegates come from China, 19 are from other developing
countries, and the rest are from developed countries.

<HEADLINE> Reform of Optical Telecom Industry to Accelerate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China's telecommunications
experts have urged that reforms in the fiber-optics industry be
speeded up, and that a scale economy be established to replace the
existing decentralized model.
</P>
<P>
According to the "People's Posts and Telecommunications News,"
experts with research institutes under the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications proposed that in order to survive the
increasingly bitter competition with foreign fiber-optics
businesses, a centralized production structure should be set up by
developing a number of large companies and enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
Though the country now has nearly 200 cable optics plants, a
strong manufacturing force is still far from being established to
challenge the foreign companies' dominance in domestic markets,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Also, the technology standards of optics electronic components
and other optics materials produced by domestic manufacturers
cannot meet the industry's demand.
</P>
<P>
As a result, China is still not able to manufacture optical
fibers on large scale.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the country's input in research and
development work in this field should be increased over the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the central government should issue more preferential
policies and capital supply to the large state-owned enterprises,
which are expected to lead a take-off in the domestic optics
telecom industry in the future, they said.

WELLINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government

The Works Corporation, the NZ institution building roads and

has links with NZ's largest investment company Birerley
Investments, while its works consultancy section was sold to the
Malaysian company Kinta Kellas.
</P>
<P>
The deal came only one week after the government sold the
state-owned Forestry Corporation to a consortium led by the NZ
forestry giant Fletcher Challenge.
</P>
<P>
All the opposition parties strongly opposed the sale of the
Forestry Corporation, but the government said the sale would help
it to pay back foreign debt.

<HEADLINE> Booming Towns Boost Rural Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Small rural towns are
mushrooming in China, creating more than 70 percent of the total
output value generated in the state's countryside.
</P>
<P>
According to Zheng Kunsheng, a senior official with the
Ministry of Construction, the small towns nationwide employ a
total 130 million rural farmers who work for various township-run
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the remaining years of this century an annual
average of seven to eight million surplus rural laborers will be
employed by these towns.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the fast development of small towns has
greatly boosted rural prosperity, and they are becoming important
bases for promoting rural social and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, small rural towns in China have proliferated to
over 55,000. They not only absorb large numbers of surplus rural
laborers but also stimulate the restructuring of agriculture. In
addition, they play a major role in preventing the random floating
of rural population to big cities.
</P>
<P>
To date, some 60 percent of the country's 20 million
township-run enterprises are concentrated in small rural towns.
</P>
<P>
In the developed, coastal provinces such as Guangdong, Fujian,
Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong and Liaoning there have emerged a
large number of enterprise groups whose annual output value
exceeds one billion or several billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The small rural towns have shown salient features in economic
development. They promote industry, commerce, sightseeing and farm
and side-line products.
</P>
<P>
The farmers in Guangdong province, while giving priority to the
development of Sino-foreign joint ventures, have quickened the
urbanization of the province and built over 300 small rural towns
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The fast growth of small towns has also contributed a lot to
the cultural, educational and scientific undertakings in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the economically-developed regions, the growth
of small towns also shows vigorous momentum in the central,
western and border provinces, and autonomous regions of the
country.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country is giving priority to an ambitious
project to build 100 key towns in these regions, which remarkably
expands rural urbanization here.
</P>
<P>
The official source said that China has more than 100 million
surplus rural laborers nationwide, and by the year 2000 the number
is expected to reach 200 million. So more towns are needed to help
boost rural economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran today once again protested
against the U.S. forces for violating Iranian airspace and
territorial waters in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government submitted a written protest to
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on the military
provocation by U.S. warships and a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
The protest letter was published today by the official news
agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for the Iranian government to lodge
such a protest against the United States this month.
</P>
<P>
On August 7, Iran lodged a protest against U.S. fighters'
repeated violations of its airspace on the single day of August 3.
</P>
<P>
Today's letter listed another three cases of violation as
follows:
</P>
<P>
On April 7, a U.S. frigate at the position of N2852 and E5022
violated the territorial waters of Iran and fled the region after
receiving warning.
</P>
<P>
On April 9, a U.S. helicopter at the position of N2829 and
E4921 flew over an Iranian tugboat and questioned the tugboat
regarding its origin and destination.
</P>
<P>
On April 18, at 14:00 hours, a U.S. warship at the position of
N2905 and E5015 created a nuisance for Iranian helicopter Ab-212.
</P>
<P>
The protest letter stressed that the government of the Islamic
Republic of Iran protests against these illegal measures by the United
States government and calls for an end to such actions.

<HEADLINE> Least-Developed Nations to Receive Aid in Developing Libraries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The international community will
help some of the world's least-developed nations establish
libraries, in a move to arrow the huge gap between them and
developed nations in the field of information.
</P>
<P>
A program to set up libraries in the Third World will provide
training opportunities for librarians from the least developed
nations and set up some libraries in Latin America, according to
Shawky Salem, an official of the International Federation of
Library Associations (IFLA).
</P>
<P>
IFLA also will cooperate with UNESCO to develop libraries and
information services in remote rural and suburban areas in Africa,
he said.
</P>
<P>
It is important to support these library associations, he said,
adding that the focus will be on the national library associations
in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Although new techniques for library systems and book
preservation are currently hot issues, the most urgent need in
some least-developed nations is basic training, he said.
</P>
<P>
Difficulties with raising funds, and securing technology and
equipment are broadening the gap between developing and developed
nations, according to representatives from the developing nations
attending the ongoing 62nd Conference of IFLA.
</P>
<P>
IFLA President Robert Wedgeworth noted that some countries
do not have even the basic conditions necessary for libraries,
while developed countries have equipped their libraries with
electronic networks.
</P>
<P>
The Internet is linking more and more libraries, and the
network's information might result in the economic takeoff of a
nation or a region, according to IFLA conference
participants. Thus, many developing nations are demanding that
their libraries and information services be improved.
</P>
<P>
Difficulties facing developing countries include the stagnant
information flow caused by insufficient funds, techniques and
basic facilities, according to Shawky Salem, who is also the
chairman of the Alex Center for Multimedia and Libraries in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Under the aid program, a data bank will be set up that contains
information about librarians and library science education in the
Third World, according to A.P. Gakhar, an official of the Regional
Activities, IFLA.
</P>
<P>
The developing nations should actively improve their libraries
and information services and depend on themselves, IFLA officials
noted.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China, the largest developing country, was chosen
to host the conference is the best example that libraries and
information services lend strong support to economic development,
Wedgeworth said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: No Policy Change Toward Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said today that there is no change in the
government's policy toward Syria, adding Israel's sole interest
is to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Israel Radio, Netanyahu said that
there is no basic change in the deployment of the Syrian troops
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's remarks came after reports from Lebanon Monday
indicated that some units of the Syrian troops, including tanks,
had pulled out of positions on the Beirut-Damascus highway.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar said that it appeared the
movements of the Syrian army were designed to guard against air
raids and were apparently in response to recent "warlike"
statements by Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The change of positions of the Syrian army in the mountains
and on the Syrian-Lebanese borders follows fears of an Israeli
operation against these forces," An-Nahar quoted sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Israeli expert pointed out that the Syrian troop movements
were a pressure tactic aimed at pushing the peace talks with
Israel out of their current stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Ze'ev Maoz, head of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in
Tel Aviv University, said the Syrians wanted to keep the pressure
on and they wanted to indicate that "if there is no movement on
the political front then things might escalate."
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, if the political stalemate continues, the
likelihood of conflict increases," said Maoz, during an interview
with The Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
However, Lebanese security officials said that Syrian troops
appeared to be carrying out a routine rotation of forces, as well
as redeployment in which they were vacating some exposed
positions they have held for years in central Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been escalated between Israel and Syria, as the
peace process between the two countries went into a deadlock,
since the new Israeli government took office in June.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israel and Syria accused each other of preparing
for war.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has called on the Syrians to resume the peace
negotiations with Israel in the U.S., but he refused to make any
commitments regarding an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, a strategic plateau the Jewish state seized from Syria in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Israel sent Syria a message via the U.S.,
saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations
without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
However, Syria has rejected Israel's suggestion to renew peace
talks unless the Israeli government changes its policy and makes
concessions on the Golan Issue.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad told visiting
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda that he was committed to
making peace with Israel on the basis of the land-for-peace
principle.

<HEADLINE> Hainan to Introduce 10,000 Overseas Experts in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province
will invite some 10,000 overseas experts to the area to spread
their knowledge of tropical agriculture, the ocean aquatics
industry, new and advanced technology, tourism and other fields.
</P>
<P>
The province hopes to learn more about advanced technology to
improve its residents' skills in crop planting, processing and
storage of tropical fruits and vegetables, and also pest
control.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the province has benefited
substantially from the knowledge offered by over 6,000 overseas
experts in several areas, including agriculture, environmental
protection and education.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has also sent 4,000 of its residents abroad to receive
special technical training. Since 1991, the province has
dispatched about 200 people to Japan to learn technology used by
the Japanese in automobile manufacturing, the aquatic industry,
food processing, the chemical industry and electronics.
</P>
<P>
Tropical agriculture has been a pillar industry in Hainan, and
it has been producing products such as rubber and pepper for the
past several decades.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Hainan has invited a number of Japanese,
Malaysian and Portuguese experts to teach local farmers a rubber
tree gum diversion technique, planting skills for high-quality
cassava and pest control techniques to battle insects that invade
coffer trees.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Trade Mission Ends Visit to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A Yugoslav trade mission headed
by Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic ended a one-day visit to
Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first such visit since the Bosnian war broke out in
1992.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Sainovic held talks with Bosnian Prime
Minister Hasan Muratovic, who agreed to focus on setting up a
"more intensive economic relationship."
</P>
<P>
"We agreed concretely for experts to meet in the shortest
possible time to define a common payment system and to define
border crossings and procedures," Muratovic said.
</P>
<P>
"Economic development needs to be the long-lasting cement of
the peace agreement," said Sainovic, adding that his visit to
Bosnia would help implement the Dayton peace agreement, which
ended the three-and-a-half-year war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
During their stay, the Yugoslav delegation also met with
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic.
</P>
<P>
A Bosnian trade mission headed by Vice-President Ejup Ganic
paid a visit to Belgrade in July. During the visit the mission
signed with the Yugoslav government accords on the restoration of
telecommunications and railway transport links between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia and Bosnia have not recognized each other.

<HEADLINE> Copyright Protection Should Not Hinder Information Flow: IFLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of world libraries
approved a document here today that says limitations resulting
from copyright protection should not be an obstacle to the flow of
information and ideas.
</P>
<P>
The document was adopted by the Executive and Professional
Boards of the International Federation of Library Associations and
Institutes (IFLA).
</P>
<P>
Issued at the the IFLA's 62nd General Conference, the document
maintains that digitalized information should not only be
available to those who can pay for it.
</P>
<P>
"Unless librarians and individual users have clear rights,
without prejudice to the legitimate interests of rights owners,
this will create a greater divide between the information rich and
the information poor," it notes.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that in this digital age, users expect to
obtain information without delay. However, librarians who want to
meet the needs of users are often frustrated by copyright
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The document says that it should not be seen as an infringement
of copyrights for librarians to make digital copies and store them
temporarily as part of an electronic document delivery service.
</P>
<P>
And the lending of published electronic resources by libraries
for cultural and educational purposes should not be restricted by
legislation. Laws should only prevent the setting of terms by
supplies of published electronic resources, which aim to restrict
the reasonable lending of such resources by librarians, it added.
</P>
<P>
The document also says that laws should give librarians and
archivists permission to convert copyright-protected texts and
images into digital format for preservation and
conservation-related purposes.
</P>
<P>
It concludes that copyright protection should encourage use and
creativity, not inhibit it. And the benefits of new technologies
should be available to all -- the public, copyright holders and
librarians, and information should be accessible regardless of
format.
</P>
<P>
Copyright protection, particularly, on the Internet, has been a
hot topic at the 62nd IFLA conference. Delegates from many
countries agreed that the Internet has become a commercial tool
rather than the academic network it was originally designed to
be.

</P>
<P>
More than 80 scholars and experts from China and India are

<HEADLINE> Co-operation Vital for Chinese Film Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese film market will
have a good future if inland areas, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan
increase their cooperation, a recent seminar at the China
Changchun Film Festival was told.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was attended by nearly 30 noted figures in the film
industry.
</P>
<P>
The inland areas, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan together rank
second in the world, after the United States, in total number of
films made.
</P>
<P>
"The prospect of Chinese films is very rosy if the four places
strengthen co-operation in the film industry," Joseph Kuo Hong
Ling, chairman of the Movie Producers and Distributors Association
H.K. Ltd., told the group.
</P>
<P>
But, in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the inland areas, the Chinese
film market is sluggish. The market in inland areas has been under
assault by foreign films since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese films, such as "The Red Swan", "The Temptation of
Braid", "The Moving Tragedy of The People in Block", were expected
to do well but did not do so well in the end.
</P>
<P>
Due to lack of controls on imported films, the Taiwan film
market is dominated by Western films, said Lee You-ning, a famous
director from the island.
</P>
<P>
Despite that, the Chinese film market still has a large
potential. On the inland areas alone, there are more than 30,000
theaters in 600 cities and some 50,000 towns and 800,000 villages
also have a vast number of film goers.
</P>
<P>
Xu Tiansheng, manager of the development department of the
China Film Making Cooperation Corporation, said that cooperation
in film making will not only result in a larger market, but also
help each other with intelligence, funds, and technology.
</P>
<P>
Cai Anan, president of the Cai Brothers (Macau) Film Company,
said that although Macao has a 400-year history, film making in
the region is practically nonexistent. The nascent film industry
in Macao needs the support of the Chinese community.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yong, president of the Pearl River Film Company, said he
is optimistic about co-operation prospects. "The profound Chinese
culture and sharing of personnel and funds will certainly promote
the development of Chinese-language films," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Conflicts and disagreement are unavoidable since different
parties have different policies, manufacturing processes, and
operational forms," Xu said, and that common rules should be made
for joint production.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yingxiang, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of
Taipei, said that to protect Chinese films, it is necessary to
control the quantity of imported films.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jianzhong, director of the film bureau of the Ministry of
Radio, Film and Television, said that in the past, the four places
had successful cooperations in shooting films, and that China will
continue to entrust China Film Making Development Corporation with
co-operative affairs.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale co-operation among the inland areas, Hong Kong,
Macao, and Taiwan started in 1989 and since then, they have
co-produced nearly 200 films.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Sweden Wins Ice Hockey World Cup Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Sweden opened its world cup
ice hockey tournament on Monday with a 6-1 win over Germany.
</P>
<P>
Peter Forsberg, who became a Stanley Cup champion last season
only two years after leading Sweden to the 1994 Olympic title, set
up two of the three first power-play goals.
</P>
<P>
They came after a lackluster opening session in which Germany
had the closest chance. Defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom took a pass
from Forsberg near the blue line and beat the screened German
goalie with a wrist shot for the opening goal at 12:09.
</P>
<P>
The Swedes took a 2-0 lead at 16:40 when former Calgary Flames
star Mikael Nylander whipped a one-timer.
</P>
<P>
Mats Sundin, who hit the post from point-blank range late in
the second period, made it 3-0 at 3:24 in the third period on
another assist by Forsberg.
</P>
<P>
Ulf Dahlen scored on another one-time at 3:51 and Niklas
Sundstrom made it 5-0 at 5:24 before German coach George Kingston
sent Klaus Merk, who scored a goal with 13:55 left.
</P>
<P>
Forsberg set up his third goal at 9:56, when Johan Garpenlov
scored a shorthanded goal to end the scoring.
</P>
<P>
Other teams in the European pool at the world cup are Finland
and the Czech Republic, who meet in Helsinki, Finland, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The North American pool consists of Canada, the United States,
Russia and Slovakia. Canada plays Russia on Thursday in the North
American opener in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
After single round-robin play, the second- and third-place
teams play a crossover, single-elimination second round.
</P>
<P>
The group winners play the second-round winners in the
semifinals and the winners there face off in a best-of-3 final
series beginning in Philadelphia September 10. The second game,
and third if necessary, is scheduled for Montreal's new Molson
Center.

<HEADLINE> NZ Trade Deficit Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's balance of
trade for July is better than expected with deficit declining by
nearly 40 percent compared with the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by Statistics New Zealand today show that the
country recorded a trade deficit of 123 million NZ dollars (84
million US dollars) in July 1996, down from 204 million dollars
(139 million US dollars) in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
The decline is due to the fact that the export value grew
faster than the import value. In July 1996, total exports were up
by 14.6 percent to 1,817 million dollars (1,236 million US
dollars), while imports rose by 8.4 percent to 1,940 million
dollars (1,333 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
An increase was registered in the month in the export of dairy
products, meat and edible offal, and wool.

<HEADLINE> Investment Increase in Sanya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANYA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Seven new foreign-funded
enterprises, with total contractual investment of 84 million US
dollars, were set up in Hainan Province's southernmost Sanya in
the first three months of this year, up six times over the same
period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Over 590 foreign-funded firms were opened with a total of 400
million US dollars in investment in Shanya from 1991 to 1995, 10
times more than for the 1985-1990 period.
</P>
<P>
The success is attributed to efforts by the local government to
improve its investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Sanya has beautiful tropical scenery and 200 kilometers of
coastline. In recent years, the city has afforested 54,600 ha of
wasteland and closed five enterprises because of heavy
pollution. The local government is expected to invest 500 million
yuan in setting up a factory which will dispose of 80,000 tons of
waste water every day.

<HEADLINE> Bridge Forged Between Shanghai with Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A bridge of understanding,
communication and mutual assistance has been forged between
Shanghai, China's biggest economic powerhouse, and southwest
China's Tibet known as the "roof of the world".
</P>
<P>
Large quantities of educational and sanitary equipment, donated
by Shanghai, can be seen in Xigaze, a major city to the west of
Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous region. In a county at the
south end of the Xigaze region, there are 15 Shanghai-funded
projects, including two primary schools, a hospital and a
kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the outcome of the Third National Conference on
Tibet, which was called in 1994, urging the country's economically
developed provinces to help Tibet.
</P>
<P>
As part of the move, the first group of 49 officials from those
provinces were sent to Tibet in May of last year.
</P>
<P>
"Though many Shanghai officials have worked in Tibet since the
1950s, " said a Tibetan official, "however, it's quite different
this time when so many people from Shanghai have come at one time."
</P>
<P>
"Those Shanghai officials not only have brought with them
advanced management expertise, but also new ideas on how to
develop local economy, " he said.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of Tibetan officials have been sent to
study in Shanghai's factories.

NEW YORK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- World number three and second

Jaime Oncins to win the first-round match on the opening day of
the U.S. Open on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Chang, who is seeded highest in his career and

186th-ranked Oncins 3-6, 6-1, 6-0, 7-6 (8-6) in the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
Chang, one of the hottest players on tour this summer, had a
16-2 record on hardcourts that included two titles and a runner-up
finish.
</P>
<P>

MaliVai Washington, the 11th seed, who also took four sets to beat
Moroccan Karim Alami 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-1.

<P>
CHICAGO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Over 4,000 Democrats gathered
here to approve their platform of action and nominate Bill Clinton
and Al Gore for re-election when the Democratic National
Convention began on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting, which also drew above 600 alternates from

</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to make an acceptance speech later this

</P>
<P>
The discussion topics include economic growth, education,
employment, taxation, welfare and immigration.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the opening day were Chairwoman of Handgun Control
Inc. Sarah Brady, actor and activist Christopher Reeve and four
others, who are expected to highlight the themes of this year's

President Clinton started a four-day train trek on Sunday
through several key states before arriving in Chicago on "The 21st
Century Express", opening the final stage of his campaign for
re-election.

Transport and Maritime Economy Ministry, Tadeusz Szoda, was under
investigation and suspended from duty today.
</P>
<P>
The suspension, ordered by the Polish Prime Minister,

illegally from the Polish-Russian border last Friday.

delegation to Russia consisting of Szoda and seven other

border station in Elblag Province without showing their passports
while returning last Friday.

They were stopped by the Polish border police and sent back to
the border station where they were interrogated for a long time
before being released, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Under Polish laws, entering the country illegally carries a
minimum of one year imprisonment and fines, and a maximum of five
years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Another delegate, the director of the ministry's Public
Relations Bureau, was also removed from office and the two drivers
for the delegation were fined, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Extradition Bill to Be Introduced to Colombian Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A group of 10
Colombian congressmen announced today that they will introduce a
constitutional reform bill Tuesday to eliminate the clause
prohibiting the extradition of Colombians.
</P>
<P>
But the initiative does not have the backing of President
Ernesto Samper's government. The congressmen were headed by
Senator Luis Guillermo Giraldo Hurtado, co-director of the Liberal
Party.
</P>
<P>
"Extradition is not a priority for the government," said
Interior Minister Horacio Serpa Uribe. He said earlier that he
was not against having the matter debated in Congress.
</P>
<P>
The re-establishment of extradition, so that drug cartel
kingpins can be turned over to the U.S. Justice Department, is one
of the conditions imposed by Washington for the normalization of
its deteriorated relations with Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Extradition was prohibited by Colombia's 1991 Constitution in
the midst of a terrorist war unleashed by the Medellin Cartel to
block the extradition of drug trafficking kingpins to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, court magistrates, legislators, university
professors and politicians said they support the re-establishment
of extradition.

<HEADLINE> Crimean Parliament Chairman Escapes Kidnappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Crimean Parliament
Yevgeny Suprunyuk escaped last night after being kidnapped
by unknown armed people and held for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Suprunyuk told the parliament this morning by telephone from
Krasnoperekopsk, northern Crimea, that he was forced by several
men and women in police uniform, and with guns, into a car when he
returned home at about midnight local time Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Then he was driven from the capital city of Simferopol,
southern Crimea, to a villa near Krasnoperekopsk, where he was
beaten and jailed.
</P>
<P>
He finally succeeded in removing a kidnapper's weapon and
escaping to Krasnoperekopsk, the Independent Press Agency (UNIAN)
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The guards in front of Suprunyuk's house were reportedly off
duty when the kidnap happened because they were taking a molester
to a nearby police station.
</P>
<P>
Suprunyuk did not reveal why he was kidnapped and was now in a
hospital, Anushevan Danelyan, the vice chairman of Crimean
Parliament, told deputies.
</P>
<P>
The parliament was scheduled to hold an exceptionally full
session on Wednesday to discuss a no-confidence vote in the Prime
Minister, Arkady Demedenko.
</P>
<P>
Head of Ukrainian Interior Ministry in Crimea Mikhail Kornienko
said the police had started an investigation of the kidnap. But no
reports on the cause of kidnap or of the identity of the
kidnappers were available.
</P>
<P>
Crimea, bordering on the Black Sea, belonged to the Russian
Republic of the Soviet Union between 1918 and 1954. Then it was
governed by Ukraine. The self-styled Republic of Crimea was
declared in February, 1992.

<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The students of 25 Uruguayan
secondary and technical schools today continued their occupation
of campus buildings for the 12th day to back their demand for a
bigger educational budget.
</P>
<P>
The government has instructed the principals of these schools

The Central School Board (CODICEN) has ordered the re-opening
of the other 330 technical and secondary schools, which have been
on strike to support the students who are occupying school
campuses.

The students said that they would not end their occupation
unless CODICEN agrees to a bigger budget for education and to a
suspension of educational reforms.
</P>
<P>
CODICEN officials have ruled out the possibility of a forced
evacuation of the students from the school premises.

<HEADLINE> Mali Newspapers Rap France Over Expulsions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Several newspapers in Mali today
condemned France for the August 22 expulsion of 23 Malian
immigrants, and the violent dispersal a day later of 300 other
Africans from the Saint-Bernard Church in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"France is disqualified in giving lessons on democracy and
human rights to others for having used brutality to solve a human
problem," Novel Horizon, an independent newspaper, said.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse quoted the paper as saying: "France has
turned from a country of human rights into an inhospitable jungle"
and "a nation yet to become civilized".
</P>
<P>
"Neither the protests of the French people nor the protection
of human rights, nor the law of the God has stopped the French
authorities from violating a place of worship with tear gas and
bludgeons to throw out those who they mistakenly call the
`paperless'," said the Novel Horizon newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The independent weekly, Les Echos, said that France, "the
fatherland of human rights, liberty, fraternity and equality, is
transforming itself more and more into a land of xenophobia".
</P>
<P>
It also criticized the Mali government for keeping silent over
the expulsions.
</P>
<P>
The independent weekly, Observateur, echoed the criticism by
pointing out that not one government minister was at the airport
to meet the expelled on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic archbishop of Bamako, Luc Auguste, said
today that France "lacked memory" when it expelled from the
Saint-Bernard Church the Africans, who were protesting against the
French government for refusing to give them residence permission.
</P>
<P>
"You don't want us. But you cannot drive us like black sheep.
There are historical reasons which link us with France," said
Archbishop Auguste in an interview with Radio Vatican from Bamako.
</P>
<P>
"Some people are trying to push down deeper this Africa which
is trying to come up. Before being Christians, be human first,"
said the archbishop.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry spokesman, Jacques Rummelhardt,
said today that the French government got agreement from several
African governments before it transported the Malians, the first
group of African immigrants, back to their home.
</P>
<P>
He said that France was considering sending economic aid to
Mali. It wanted to "allow all those who went back to their
country to do well in good conditions".

<P>
CANBERRA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Aleksandr Popov of Russia May
swim for Australia next Olympics in Sydney as ge is to be offered
Australian citizenship, said Australian sporting officials on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Popov, four-time Olympic champion, is currently recovering in a

Australian Institute of Sport after his coach Gennadi Touretski
was appointed as head of swimming at the Ais.
</P>
<P>
Popov has since bought a house in Canberra and has signaled his
intention to remain in Australia, but he remains tight-lipped
about whether he'd continue to swim for Russia or for his adopted
homeland.
</P>
<P>
Popov will be eligible to apply for Australian citizenship in
October and must take up the option by 1997 if he wants to swim
for Australia at the 2000 Games, under the International Olympic
Committee's rules.

HELSINKI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The prime ministers of the five
Nordic countries today expressed their support for the three

<HEADLINE> Chechnyans Return Captured Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chechnyan fighters today
responded to strong demands from the Russian armed forces, and
returned weapons captured from 58 Russian soldiers last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This gesture has removed some obstacles for the resumption of
contacts between military leaders of the two sides, and the
withdrawal of Russian troops from Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Russian Joint Forces earlier today warned that if the Chechnyan
opposition army did not return the captured weapons, the scheduled
meeting between Vyacheslav Tikhmirov, Commander of Russian Joint
Forces in Chechnya, and Aslam Masknadov, Chief of the General
Staff of the Chechnyan opposition army, would be called off. The
planned Russian troops withdrawal would also be stopped
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
According to sources within the Russian Command, half of the
50 automatic weapons returned were not the same as those captured
by the Chechnyans.
</P>
<P>
The Command said that representatives of the two sides would
continue negotiations this evening, until the return of all 61
captured automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of troops withdrawal, a commander of the Interior
Troops of the Russian Federation said that due to murky weather
and darkness, 1,500 interior troops would be pulled out tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that Alexandr Lebed, secretary of the
Security Council of the Russian Federation, who returned from
Chechnya to Moscow, today held talks with Prime Minister Viktov
Chernomyrdin. However, no details were revealed.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Revive Major Hydro Project Dumped by WB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Even one year after the World
Bank (WB) withdrew its pledged support for a large-scale
hydropower project in East Nepal, the government here is still
looking for a revival of the project with private investments.
</P>
<P>
The 402-megawatt Arun III project remains attractive to the
country and efforts are underway to implement it with the
participation of private sector, Water Resources Minister
Pashupati J.B. Rana said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Work on the 852 million US dollar project was stopped suddenly
in early August last year when the World Bank announced it would
not provide its earlier pledged 175 million dollar loan for the
project due to high economic and environmental risks.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government's efforts to lobby the bank for the
revival of the Arun project later turned in vain while the bank
vowed to continue to support alternative medium and small-sized
hydro projects in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Nepali officials and economists, however, claimed that the
World Bank's withdrawal from the Arun project, which it had backed
since the project was first proposed ten years ago, would have a
negative impact on the economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Nepal had the intention to export electricity to its
power-hungary neighbor India after the completion of the project
in the early next century.
</P>
<P>
According to Water Resources Minister Rana, talks are being
held with various donors for the development of the Arun valley,
about 200 kilometers east of Katmandu, after the World Bank's
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Rana Monday told the Lower House of the parliament that at
present only 15 percent of the country's population have access
to electricity.

<HEADLINE> Nestle Suspends Powered Milk Testing on Thai Orphans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Testing of a new Nestle powered
milk at a Thai orphanage has been suspended after an investigation
by Thailand's Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The investigation was based on reports that several of the 176
children at Pak Kret Home fell ill after taking part in the
testing, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The suspension will remain in force until the cause of the
children's illness is found, according to FDA Secretary-General
Pakdi Pothisiri.
</P>
<P>
The powdered milk under test was Nestle's Nan 2 follow-on
formula added with bifidobacteria, which might be effective in
reducing diarrhea among infants not breast-fed.
</P>
<P>
Bifidobacteria, commonly known as "health bacteria" and found
in many types of food products, such as yogurt, low-fat milk and
breast milk, helps to increase immunity against diarrhea,
according to Dr. Kraisid Tontisirin, director of Mahidol
University's Institute of Nutrition in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Pakdi said that from now on human testing of any new food or
drug product in Thailand must be approved by the Public Health
Ministry's Ethics Committee, instead of by researching
institutions.

<HEADLINE> OAS Ruling Against U.S. Unprecedented: Cuban FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto
Robaina today described as "unprecedented" a conclusion favoring
Cuba by the legal committee of the Organization of American States
(OAS) over the U.S. Helms-Burton Law.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local press, Robaina said that it was
"the very first time that a body of the OAS, an entity that could
not possibly be accused of being controlled by Cuba, has ever
spoken out against the U.S. position against the island country".
</P>
<P>
The OAS legal committee recently wrote in a legal opinion that
the U.S. Helms-Burton Law, designed to tighten the blockade
against Cuba, violated the principles of international law.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law in March
after Cuba shot down two American civil planes piloted by Cuban
exiles.
</P>
<P>
Robaina said the OAS legal committee's conclusion showed that
the "monstrous" U.S. law should be revoked immediately.

</P>
<P>
Under the internal operational procedures of the OAS, its

strong agreement opposing the legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Rio Group is scheduled to meet in September in Bolivia.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels Monday
killed a district leader of their rival Tamil Eelam Liberation
Organization (TELO), K. Baskaran, and critically injured six
others in Trincomalee in Eastern province, according to police
sources here today.
</P>
<P>
TELO President S. Vinothalingam and General Secretary M. K.
Sivajilingam escaped what police suspect to be an assassination
attempt by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, the TELO and other Tamil military groupings had
earlier fought for their common demand for a separate state in Sri
Lanka. The TELO and other groups later broke away when the LTTE
tried to take command of the military groups.
</P>
<P>
The TELO, which has now returned to the mainstream of politics,
is supportive of the government in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 TELO cadres have reportedly been killed by the LTTE or
died in fighting with the LTTE since 1990.

<HEADLINE> More Singaporeans Travel Overseas, STPB Finds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of Singaporeans
traveling overseas increased by 15.2 percent in the first half of
this year from the same period last year, the latest Singapore
Tourist Promotion Board (STPB) figures showed.
</P>
<P>
The STPB found that since 1992, full-year figures for outbound
travel have shown increases of between 13.5 percent and 17.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 1.54 million who traveled in the first six months
of this year, the number using air travel grew by 12.1 percent,
while sea departures increased by 22.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The strongest monthly growth of 35.7 percent in outbound
traffic was registered in February, mainly because of the three
consecutive public holidays for the Lunar New Year and the Hari
Raya Puasa festivals, the STPB report said.
</P>
<P>
The STPB also found that Singaporeans are increasingly
venturing further afield beyond the Asia-Pacific region. Although
the total number of Singapore arrivals to Asia-Pacific
destinations rose yearly from 1.99 million in 1991 to 2.89 million
last year, the rate of growth has slowed significantly, it said.
</P>
<P>
Growth was 7.6 percent in 1993 and 8.8 percent in 1994, but
slumped to 3.8 percent last year, it said. In the meantime, the
report noted that the outbound figures for areas like Europe and
America are likely to have risen, though statistics are not
available.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Cassava Output to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's production of fresh
cassava this year is forecast to increase by 1.3 million tons to
17.3 million tons in the 1996-97 crop year (October 1996 to
September 1997).
</P>
<P>
The expected increase in cassava production follows a decline
for several years from a high of 24.6 million tons in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The growth is attributable to quality seeds, attractive cassava
price and expanded cultivation.
</P>
<P>
About 10 million tons of cassava this year will go toward
producing 4.3 million to 4.4 million tons of tapioca pellets,
according to Seri Denvoraluk, president of the Thai Tapioca
Traders Association.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has agreed to limit tapioca exports to the European
Union (EU) to 21 million tons over four years, with a maximum of
5.5 million tons in any single year.
</P>
<P>
However, Thailand's production can not meet the limit.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is likely to export 4 million tons of tapioca pellets
this year, of which 90 percent, or only 3.6 million tons, would go
to the EU, according to Pracha Charutrakulchai, director-general
of the Foreign Trade Department.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 7.3 million tons of cassava root would be used to
produce 1.5 million tons of tapioca flour. Of this, 800,000 tons
will be exported, Pracha said.

<HEADLINE> Normalcy Returns in Bogra Town, Dhaka University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Normalcy returned in Bangladesh's
northern town of Bogra and the trouble-torn Dhaka University on
Monday after the continuous campus violence for the past few days,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The situation of Bogra town, however, continued to remain tense
and anti-police sentiment was very high. All educational
institutions in the district remained closed for the consecutive
third day on Monday as students enforced a strike protesting the
killings in the town.
</P>
<P>
At least six people, including three students, were killed in
police firing during clashes in the town since Thursday in
backlash to the death of a college student under the wheels of a
bus.
</P>
<P>
Black flags flew atop schools and colleges and students wore
black badges while life in the business town started returning to
normal with no reports of violence on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the situation on the Dhaka University campus was
quiet on Monday though armed outsiders remained in most of its
residential halls.
</P>
<P>
Campus sources said that about half of the resident students of
the university had left the campus because of the unrest for the
past few days.
</P>
<P>
The university authorities had suspended all classes till next
Thursday due to the volatile situation which was caused following
a clash between the activists of the Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal
(JCD) and the ruling party backed Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL)
a week ago.

<HEADLINE> Japanese TV broadcasters Eye New Internet service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Japanese TV broadcasting companies
are planning to launch a new service enabling personal computer
(PC) users to simultaneously view Internet pages and television
programs, the Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo quoted industry sources as saying that the Tokyo-based
Asahi National Broadcasting Co. (TV Asahi) is planning to start
the service next April.
</P>
<P>
The sources also predicted that other Tokyo-based TV
broadcasting companies are likely to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The technology for the new media, known as "Intercast," was
developed by Intel Corp. of the United States, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
With the technology, Internet information sent from TV stations
can be viewed on PC screens simultaneously with TV programs.
</P>
<P>
The TV stations will be sending the Internet data on radio
frequencies not used for regular TV broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo said the Intercast service will be free of charge though
current Internet users have to pay for telephone lines and access to
the network service.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, several broadcasting companies have
already started Intercast services.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources predicted strong user demand for the service
because the use of PCs has been on the rise.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Records Higher Trade Surplus in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAUALA LUMPUR, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Higher exports led
Malaysia to record a bigger trade surplus of 574.1 million ringgit
(about 229.64 million U.S. dollars) in June this year, according
to the Statistics Department today.
</P>
<P>
The June surplus was higher by 140.8 percent compared with the
surplus of 238.5 million ringgit (95.4 million dollars) recorded
in the previous month, and was in sharp contrast to the deficit of
2.1 billion ringgit (840 million dollars) recorded in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
Exports for June totaled 16.3 billion ringgit (about 6.52
billion dollars) while imports were valued at 15.7 billion ringgit
(about 6.28 billion dollars), the department said in its external
trade summary released here today.
</P>
<P>
However, in the first six months this year, Malaysia continued
to register an external trade deficit amounting to 798.4 million
ringgit (about 319.36 million dollars), which nevertheless was 4.8
billion ringgit (about 1.92 billion dollars) or 85.7 percent lower
compared with the deficit of 5.6 billion ringgit (about 2.24
billion dollars) during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The substantially reduced trade deficit was the result of a
much faster growth in exports in the first six months this year,
valued at 96.5 billion ringgit (about 38.6 billion dollars), a
12.6 percent higher than that in the same period 1995, as against
imports of 97.3 billion ringgit (about 38.92 billion dollars) in
the period under review which was a 6.6 percent increase over
imports of 91.3 billion ringgit (about 36.52 billion dollars) in
the same period in 1995, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Thermionic valves and tubes, photocells, palm oil, liquefied
natural gas, plain plywood, articles of apparel and clothing
accessories and crude petroleum recorded increased export earnings
in the January-June period 1996, it said.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Refuses Treaty Change for Romanian Kin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The treaty is a vital condition for both countries in their
bids join the European Union (EU) and NATO.
</P>
<P>
During talks with the delegates of the Hungarian Democratic
Union of Romania (UDMR), Horn said the Hungarian government never
committed itself to getting the approval of the Romanian minority
when signing an amity treaty with Romania.
</P>
<P>
The text of the treaty, which was expected to be signed as
early as next month, would not be allowed to be amended, Horn said.
</P>
<P>
Tokes Laszlo, the honorary chairman of the UDMR, charged that
the Hungarian government did not heed its members' voices or give
them adequate protection when drafting the treaty.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the treaty was not in line with the interests of
Romania's Hungarian minority, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian government negotiated the signing of the treaty
in a hurry and "under the pressure from foreign countries," Laszlo
charged.
</P>
<P>
The treaty talks, much delayed by disputes over minority
rights, were restarted last year after setting aside differences
about the status of Romania's Hungarian minority, which numbers
some 1.6 million people, a seventh of the population.
</P>
<P>
The current treaty text includes a Council of Europe
recommended clause on minority rights but it has been interpreted
as not granting Hungarians collective autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Bucharest had feared autonomy would lead to Yugoslav-style
secessionist movements.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for the Hungarian government to take such
a tough stance against the Hungarian minority in Romania, local
observers said.
</P>
<P>
Both Hungary and Romania have come under pressure from the West
to sign such a treaty ahead of decisions on NATO and EU
membership, due as early as the end of this year. They appear to
have realized it is in their common interest to hurry the
process.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chamber of Commerce and
Industry of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
will discuss a proposal by Argentina to establish an
ASEAN-Mercosur free trade area, ASEAN chamber president Aburizal
Bakrie said.
</P>
<P>
"Visiting Argentinean President Carlos Saul Menem has expressed
keen interest in establishing a free trade area covering ASEAN and
the member states of Mercosur," Antara news agency quoted Bakrie
as saying here today.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, composed of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay,
has a population of 200 million and a total of gross domestic
product (GDP) of about 600 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since January 1995, almost all goods produced in the four
Mercosur members are being traded among them without being
subjected to import duties.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Indonesia-Argentina economic cooperation,
Bakrie said, businessmen of both countries can cooperate in many
fields.
</P>
<P>
According to the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics, the
two-way trade between Indonesia and Argentina reached about 156
million dollars in 1994, against a mere 8.9 million dollars in
1980.
</P>
<P>
The figure for the first nine months of last year amounted to
more than 232 million dollars with a deficit of 159 million
dollars for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Argentinean President Menem arrived here on Monday for a
one-day visit to Indonesia.

<P>
DHAKA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Manila-based Asian Development
Bank (ADB) is likely to delay its 100 million U.S. dollar finance
to Bangladesh's power sector as the two sides are still wrangling
over increasing the power tariff.
</P>
<P>
According to sources of the Energy Ministry, the ADB had agreed
to finance Bangladesh's ninth power project on condition that
power tariff be raised by at least 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the ministry submitted a proposal to the cabinet for
increase of 15 percent and the cabinet, on political
considerations, even could not agree the 15 percent increase and
sent the proposal back to the ministry for reconsideration.
</P>
<P>
Although the ministry and the ADB agreed in principle on the 15
percent raise after several rounds of talks on the issue and its
political sensitivity, the difference of opinion between the two
sides now centered on how to implement the proposed tariff
increase.
</P>
<P>
The ministry suggested that it be effected in phases, but the
ADB maintained that it must be implemented at one go, the sources
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Major military academies in
China are creating a library information computer network that can
improve troops' fighting capability.
</P>
<P>
A delegate to the 62nd General Conference of the International
Federation of Library Associations now in session in Beijing, said
that the Chinese military plans to install an information computer
network for the library of every academy in three years' time.
</P>
<P>
He said that the installation will be completed in 1997, with
unified computer hardware and software used in all libraries.
</P>
<P>
Each library's network will be designed to form a local
network, he added.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Chinese military leaders have realized the
importance of information resources in modern wars, and that
computer technology is crucial for victory in the electronics and
information wars.
</P>
<P>
The delegate said that by with the local network, efforts can
be made to improve computer networks in various military
academies, in order to establish a network that will link all
academies at the turn of this century.
</P>
<P>
Then this network will be connected with the national and
international computer networks to turn the networks of libraries
of Chinese military academies into a modern multi-function system
with the characteristics of China's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Since March of 1995, computer experts from various academies
have been working in the National Defense University to develop
such software.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July 1995, they had developed five sub-systems,
which were put into use on a trial basis in September 1995 in the
library of the National Defense University, he said.
</P>
<P>
The sub-systems have been issued to the first group of 15
military academies, he added.

NANCHANG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- While four college graduates
from Wuhan University are out working in the fields, three farmers
from rural Jiangxi are preparing to go back to school.
</P>
<P>
The four graduates are Xia Huajian, Zhou Jianyong, Cheng Peng,
and Xi Weipeng, who all were employed soon after their 1994
graduation from Wuhan's colleges.
</P>
<P>
They have a similar goal and confidence that they can be
successful farmers.
</P>
<P>
With support from their families, they raised 120,000 yuan
(some 15,000 US dollars) early this year and built a vegetable
production base in Leping. They hired vegetable technicians and
asked some local farmers to help work in the field.
</P>
<P>
Their 20 mu (1.2 hectares) of vegetables are doing well, and
early hot peppers, potatoes and cabbages are selling on the market.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, farmer Wu Guofu dropped out of school because of
his family's poor economic conditions, but he never stopped
studying. He received a bachelor's degree in Chinese literature,
and now is a post-graduate at Hangzhou University, majoring in
ancient Chinese literature.
</P>
<P>
Ding Siru from the Dianxia Town in Zhangshu City did not pass
the college entrance examination when he graduated from senior
middle school. He also continued to study on his own, and this
year was enrolled as a post-graduate by Beijing University of
Science and Engineering.
</P>
<P>
Yu Yunjun was formerly a private employee who bred and sold
pearl products. He said he can always make money in the future,
but now, education is what brings him the greatest personal
satisfaction.
</P>

NEW DELHI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- India's National Association
of Software &AMP; Service Companies (NASSCOM) has drawn up an action
plan which it claims, if implemented in full spirit, will allow
Bangalore, capital of Karnataka state in southern India, to
overtake the state of California, the Silicon Valley of the United
States, NASSCOM sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
NASSCOM, the premier association of Indian software industry,
stated in a study that if Karnataka can put its act together, then
it would easily overtake California, both in terms of number of
software companies and revenues by 2020.
</P>
<P>
If some measures needed to be taken, Bangalore would have a
software export revenue of one billion US dollars by the year
2000, NASSCOM said.
</P>
<P>
Among its various recommendations, NASSCOM has called for
forming a high-powered committee comprising industry and
government to coordinate strategy and actions and run business
that are not usually taken care of by other bodies. The government
must frame software friendly policies and ensure quick response
time from government agencies.
</P>
<P>
The action plan calls for a focus on target markets like the
US, Europe and Japan and for attracting further foreign investment
into development and service centers and joint ventures.

<HEADLINE> China Takes Measures for Better Use of WB Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Finance is
experimenting with a redemption fund system for World Bank (WB)
loans in parts of the country to ensure solvency.
</P>
<P>
"All the measures we have taken against the debt management
risks have yielded the desired results," according to a ministry
official.
</P>
<P>
He added the ministry is also planning to delay newly-approved
projects in order to make more efficient use of WB loans.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of China's credit-worthiness, the ministry has
withheld part of the state's appropriations to local governments
for repayment of WB loans, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Since China rejoined the World Bank in 1980, the international
financial body has financed 174 of China's projects, of which 68
are already completed, latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The Bank has committed to China 25.2 billion US dollars in
total lendings, and has actually paid in more than 15.1 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996 fiscal year, the Bank committed to China a
total of 2.97 billion US dollars to finance 16 projects. China has
been the Bank's largest borrower for four consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
World Bank money to China is often channeled into poverty
reduction and agriculture, transportation, energy, environmental
protection and other infrastructural projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran today once again protested
against the U.S. forces for violating Iranian airspace and
territorial waters in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government submitted a written protest to
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on the military
provocation by U.S. warships and a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
The protest letter was published today by the official news

This is the second time for the Iranian government to lodge
such a protest against the United States this month.
</P>
<P>
On July 7, Iran lodged a protest against U.S. fighters'
repeated violations of its airspace on the single day of August 3.
</P>
<P>
Today's letter listed another three cases of violation as
follows:
</P>
<P>
On April 7, a U.S. frigate at the position of N2852 and E5022
violated the territorial waters of Iran and fled the region after
receiving warning.
</P>
<P>
On April 9, a U.S. helicopter at the position of N2829 and
E4921 flew over an Iranian tugboat and questioned the tugboat
regarding its origin and destination.
</P>
<P>
On April 18, at 14:00 hours, a U.S. warship at the position of
N2905 and E5015 created a nuisance for Iranian helicopter Ab-212.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Ruling Parties Can End Rows Peacefully: Ranariddh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The two main coalition
partners have pledged to end their political disputes peacefully
and work together again, First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful
and Unificative Cambodia (Funcinpec) and the Cambodian People's
Party (CPP) are to "resolve political differences through
negotiations, not resort to force," said Ranariddh, also the
leader of Funcinpec.
</P>
<P>
"The partners in the Royal Government of Cambodia are working
together well again after a few glitches and differences,"
Ranariddh said in a statement at the opening ceremony of a
three-day International Conference on Peace and Cooperation in
Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Samdech Hun Sen (the leader of CPP) and I share a common
vision for Cambodia... and we are prepared to work for a
peaceful... and stable nation." he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will do our best to find a solution to political
differences so as to bring stability and prosperity to the
well-deserved people of Cambodia." he said.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec beat the CPP in the 1993 elections and agreed to a
union to avoid renewed strife, but tension mounted when Ranariddh
recently threatened to pull out of the cabinet and parliament if
the CPP continued to refuse his party a fairer share of power in
the provinces.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen had rejected the demand and threatened force against
any bid to dissolve parliament before the 1998 national
elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- More import and export
commodities passed strict inspection at Shanghai Port, a leading
foreign trade port of China, in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The commodity inspection authorities examined approximately
29,800 batches of exports and 5,300 imports in the first half of
this year, of which 98.35 percent and 88.68 percent, respectively,
were deemed qualified, setting a record.
</P>
<P>
As a major port that handles more than 40 billion US dollars of
foreign trade cargo each year, Shanghai has always viewed
commodity inspection as an important measure essential for
ensuring the quality of goods.
</P>
<P>
Strict examinations have brought 100 percent of the exported
cigarettes up to qualification standards over the past two
years. Exports of cigarettes brought 70 million US dollars in
1995.
</P>
<P>
In order to maintain a clean market, the inspection authorities
will punish violators according to law. This year, 20 cases were
dealt with and fines reached more than 500,000 yuan (60,2400 US
dollars).

<HEADLINE> New Delhi Tops in Kidnapping Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- New Delhi, capital of India,
has topped in kidnapping, abduction and rape cases among all the
metropolitan cities in the country, said the annual report of
National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) for the year 1994.
</P>
<P>
Among metropolitan cities, New Delhi recorded the highest
incidence of 916 kidnapping cases, followed by Bombay 234 cases,
Kanpur 211, Bangalore 192, Jaipur 145 and Patna 122. The Delhi

<HEADLINE> Agro-technician Hailed By Villagers As 'Living Buddha' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural technician Guan
Shusen, was cold shouldered by farmers in Gyerba township in
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region last year.
</P>
<P>
Now he is treated like a living Buddha in Changzhug Township,
Nedong county, by the Yarlung Zangbo River.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Guan, director of the Tibet Institute of the
Agricultural Sciences, failed to persuade Changzhug peasants to
use a newly improved wheat strain known as "9011." The technician
wanted to spread the use of high-yield wheat strains.
</P>
<P>
Changzhug farmers had grown a wheat strain called "fat wheat"
for 23 years until Guan suggested that they use "9011," which can
yield at least 750 kg per mu (15 mu is equivalent to one hectare).
</P>
<P>
Even if the traditional strain can yield only 350 kg per mu,
farmers trusted it so much so that they refused to use the new
strain. The head of the township, Soinam Ngoidrub, was upset about
the reluctance of farmers to give the new strain a chance.
</P>
<P>
By September 27, 1995, not one villager had volunteered to try
9011. Soinam called the heads of the villages to a meeting and
asked them to sign a contract with Guan.
</P>
<P>
The contract promised the farmers a good harvest from 9011 and
that peasants could ask Guan's institute for compensation should
9011 cause a drop in production.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 215 mu of fields were seeded with 9011. Per-mu
yield reached 750 kg, double that of the traditional strain.
</P>
<P>
The good harvest has convinced farmers of the benefit of the
new wheat strain. More villagers asked Guan for the new wheat
seeds and asked him to serve as their adviser on growing 9011.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year some 500 families in Changzhug Township
joined an association to spread the use of fine crop strains,
including 9011.
</P>
<P>
In mid-August of this year, farmers held their traditional
"Onggo Festival" to greet the forthcoming harvest. They gave the
members of the institute buttered tea, beef and vegetables in
appreciation of their help and guidance.
</P>
<P>
The head of Gyerba township, who had refused to use the new
strain last year, came to Guan from the other side of Yarlung
Zangbo River to present him with one hundred eggs.
</P>
<P>
Guan said, "Take your things back. You treat me almost as a
living Buddha."
</P>
<P>
The head said: "We'd like to ask you to cross the river to tell
our fellow villagers how to increase wheat production."

<HEADLINE> Incompetent Personnel Receive Serious Warning in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A young official of the
procuratorate of the Hexi District in Tianjin municipality,
surnamed Jia, was recently fired for incompetence.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Jia, who had been an assistant public
procurator, allegedly made excessive demands of his clients, was
arrogant in his dealings with common citizens, and refused to mend
his ways while in office.
</P>
<P>
He is one of 18 officials who have been dismissed in Hexi
District, since Tianjin, north China's largest industrial city,
adopted a system to terminate unqualified officials in January,
1991.
</P>
<P>
The system aims to promote competent officials and dismiss
those proved to be incompetent, regardless of their age and social
backgrounds, putting an end to the "Iron Rice Bowl" system that
protects officials.
</P>
<P>
No government department at any level, nor any organization or
individual is permitted to fire an employee who has not violated
any criminal law.
</P>
<P>
Of the 18 terminated officials in Tianjin, 13 are under the age
of 30.
</P>
<P>
Under the termination system, officials are routinely assessed
in areas of morality, competence and achievement. Those who do not
meet prescribed standards are warned they will be released within
three months if no obvious improvement is evident.
</P>
<P>
According to related regulations, the dismissed employees are
entitled to receive unemployment insurance and could be re-hired,
but they cannot work for any governmental administrative
organizations for five years after termination.
</P>
<P>
"The firing system, which helps to select competent officials
and dismiss those deemed incompetent, will guide the management of
officials onto a more scientific and standardized track," said Sun
Jinqiang, deputy director of the district's Bureau of Personnel.

<P>
SHANGHAI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- In a move to help curb
industrial pollution in Shanghai, 342 factories in the downtown
areas have been ordered to shut down, relocate, or make different
products in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai plans to put more than 20 billion yuan (2.4 billion
U.S. dollars) into research that can help solve industrial
pollution problems by the turn of the century, doubling the amount
spent in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year 2010, 1,500 factories in the central
commercial areas will be asked to move to other places or produce
new products.
</P>
<P>
Also in the next 15 years, the city also plans to carry out
technical upgrading in 100 industrial enterprises in metallurgy,
pharmaceutical and chemical industries, and in the leather and
paper fields.
</P>
<P>
Other factories with serious pollution problems will be
required to reduce pollutants by over 60 percent during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai plans to increase purification efforts of the Huangpu
River, that runs through the city. Some 100 factories in the upper
part of the Huangpu River have been asked to install sewage
drainage pipes by the end of this century, and are not allowed to
discharge waste water to the river directly.
</P>
<P>
By keeping steady economic growth, the municipality can also
maintain its industrial pollutants drainage volume at the 1995
level over the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba's Initiative to Meet Kaunda Welcomed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba's
initiative to meet former president and opposition leader Kenneth
Kaunda to ease political tension in Zambia has been welcomed in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Agency quoted Bweendo Mulengela, publicity
secretary of Kaunda's United National Independence Party (UNIP),
as saying in an interview on Monday that any dialogue aimed at
resolving pressing national issues ''even at the 11th hour will
always be welcome''.
</P>
<P>
This is a response of the UNIP to the announcement of Chiluba
who said in Pretoria of South Africa on Sunday that he is to meet
Kaunda soon to promote dialoguea and ease tension in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mulengela insisted that the meeting between Chiluba and Kaunda
should be held on neutral grounds under a neutral chairman since
that is what the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) did in
1991 when the MMD wanted to have dialogue with the then ruling
UNIP for the last general elections.
</P>
<P>
He said that the agenda number one should be the withdrawal of
the current constitution that will see Kaunda stand for
presidency in the forthcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
The UNIP will not accept anything outside the constitution and
the current update of voters roll which, as it is "in a mess",
will prove futile the efforts to dialogue, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Foundation for Democratic Progress (FODEP) and
the Zambia Independent Elections Monitoring Team (ZIMT) also
expressed their welcome to the reports that Chiluba is to meet
Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
FODEP President Archbishop John Manbo said his organization
salutes President Chiluba for taking such a bold decision. He
appealed to Chiluba to stop his cabinet from witch-hunting as to
who is not a Zambian as this would dent the image of the country.
</P>
<P>
ZIMT President Alfred Zulu said the meeting between Chiluba
and Kaunda is a welcome gesture and would coincide with an
inter-party consultative meeting which the ZIMT is presently
organizing.
</P>
<P>
Political strife has taken place between Zambian ruling and
opposition parties since April and May when a controversial
constitution amendment bill was passed in parliament and signed
by the president.
</P>
<P>
According to the new constitution, only the second indigenous
generation Zambians are qualified to be president of the country.
This actually bars Kaunda from running for the post as his
parents immigrated from neighboring Malawi before Zambia gained
independence.

<HEADLINE> Japan Opposed to Hard-Fisted Approach to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Japan is opposed to the
hard-fisted approach toward Iran taken by the U.S., a local daily
today quoted visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Jerusalem Post published today, Ikeda
justified Japan's maintaining commercial ties with Iran despite of
the pressure from Washington.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has charged Iran with "sponsoring terrorism."
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a bill early this month to
punish foreign companies making business with Iran, a move that
was criticized by most countries including European states and
other U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
"We share with the entire world community the concern about
the possible involvement in terrorism of Iran," Ikeda said.
</P>
<P>
He added that if there is clear and abundant evidence that Iran
is involved in terrorism, Japan will change its attitude toward
Iran
</P>
<P>
"However, at a stage where there is no such clear and absolute
evidence, we would not take that sort of hard-fisted approach that
a certain country is taking," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said Japan would continue to caution Iran by maintaining
its channel of critical dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese minister is here on a three-day visit on his
current Middle East tour, which had already taken him to Egypt,

<HEADLINE> Karpov Takes on World in On-Line Chess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia's World Chess
Federeation champion Anatoly Karpov took on the world Monday in
the first-ever open chess game on the Internet, a report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the match, dubbed "Karpov Against the World,"
began at 11:00 GMT, when the world, playing white, had seven
minutes to decide the first move.
</P>
<P>
A server chose the most popular proposal from 52 suggested
moves sent online from chess aficionados around the globe, and
moved the king's pawn (e2-e4).
</P>
<P>
Karpov took just two seconds to counter with the Caro-Kann
opening, moving the bishop's pawn (c7-c6).
</P>
<P>
Players participating via Internet had seven minutes to send in
proposals for each move against the world champion.
</P>
<P>
"It's my first Internet game, but I always play seriously,"
Karpov was quoted as saying. "I don't joke when I play chess."
</P>
<P>
Fifty-two participated in proposing the first move. By the end
of the first hour, 250-300 proposals were being sent in for each
move.
</P>
<P>
At Karpov's request, organizers cut the time allocated for each
move from an earlier agreed 10 minutes to seven minutes. The world
opened the match to facilitate computer programming, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Karpov was in Finland for six games against local chess clubs
over five days, through Thursday. The games were organized by the
Finnish Parliament's Chess Club and the Workers' Chess Association.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Karpov retained the title of the World Chess
Federation champion by beating challenger Gata Kamsky in Elista,
capital of the southern Russian republic of Kalmykia.

<HEADLINE> Northern Economic Giants Stress Importance of Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Beijing,
Tianjin, and Hebei have said they will increase cooperation to
form a dynamic economic center by making full use of their
economic advantages.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan said his city will improve its
industrial structure by putting stress on technology-intensive
industries that consume less energy, water, and resources; do not
pollut; and have a high degree of added-value. Electronic
information, bio-engineering, pharmaceuticals, and new materials
are at the top of this list for the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The city will also devote much effort to developing tourism,
transport, commerce, finance, and culture.
</P>
<P>
The mayor pointed out that a major readjustment in the
industrial structure does not, however, mean that Beijing will not
take economic development as its major task.
</P>
<P>
The city will give priority to industries that are suitable to
Beijing's role as a the country's political and cultural center,
and that will turn the city into an international metropolis early
in the next century.
</P>
<P>
It is impossible for Beijing not to enter into an alliance with
nearby Tianjin and Hebei in the economic development in north
China, Li said, and the city will fully consider coordinating
activities with other northern cities in the Bohai economic zone.
</P>
<P>
Li's sentiments were echoed by Tianjin, China's third largest
city.
</P>
<P>
Gao Dezhan, secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the
Communist Party of China, said that the port city is willing to
establish a new type of partnership with Beijing and Hebei. It
will develop a strategy of unified distribution, rational division
of labour, mutual supplements, and common development.
</P>
<P>
The city is building a 350-sq-km export-oriented development
zone in its coastal area, following the example of Shanghai's
Pudong New Area, and has attracted 6,000 foreign-funded
enterprises. Their GDP in 1995 totalled 24 billion yuan,
accounting for a quarter of Tianjin's total, said Chen Zhifeng, an
official in charge of the zone's development.
</P>
<P>
When the coastal new area takes shape by 2003, its GDP will
climb to 100 billion yuan and its industrial output value is
expected to make up half of the city's total, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hebei Governor Ye Liansong said his province is looking for
cooperation and development by providing improved services for
Beijing and Tianjin.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- South China's booming
Guangdong Province plans to use on-line computerized taxation
services by the year 2000, under a newly-formulated taxation
reform program.
</P>
<P>
The program calls for the provincial government to choose a
pilot county in which experiments with the reform can be carried
out from October through December.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1998, all cities, counties and villages located in
the Pearl River Delta will begin using the computerized taxation
method.
</P>
<P>
The program urges the cities and counties in the delta area to
put their tax business on a computer network by 1999, and link
with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and other
departments concerned. The rest of the province is expected to
realize on-line computerization by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Tax departments in only 14 cities in Guangdong have computer
rooms, provincial government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Their goal is to have 70 percent of tax departments' staff be
trained to operate computers. The shortage of computer operators
makes reaching that goal difficult, they said.

NEW YORK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Coca-Cola Company said
today that it has achieved soft drink leadership in Russia, which

Now products of the Coca-Cola Company -- led by Coca-Cola,
Fanta and Sprite -- represent about 18 percent of carbonated soft
drink sales in Russia, the company said. The company's beverage
products have outsold those of any other company for 12
consecutive months.

CHANGCHUN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Teheran Metro will
receive 217 subway coaches worth 138 million US dollars from
northeast China's Changchun Passenger-Car Plant (CPCP) in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
The contract for the project is said to be China's largest in
terms of exports of mechanical and electrical machinery, and
represents a giant leap forward by the CPCP into the international
market.
</P>
<P>
Plant director Ma Shukun said that the plant won the contract
over a three-year period, and defeated competitors from Germany
and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, CPCP must deliver the first batch of train
coaches within 22 months, and turn out the rest in the following
25 months.
</P>
<P>
Located in the capital city of northeast China's Jilin
Province, CPCP is the largest passenger train coach provider in
the country, claiming half of the country's train coach market.
</P>
<P>
CPCP designed and manufactured China's first subway passenger
train in the 1960s, and has provided Beijing, Tianjin, and
Pyongyang of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with more
than 500 subway coaches of 20 different styles.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that CPCP also won the contracts to supply Iran and
Beijing with double-deck buses and subway coaches.
</P>

In northeastern Oregon, a 10,500-acre (4,260-hectare) blaze
forced the evacuation Sunday night of 1,500 firefighters from a
fire camp. The fire had joined with another to form one big fire
that had burned about 70,000 acres (28,420 hectares).
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ross in Paris to Discuss Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
confirmed that U.S. envoy Dennis Ross has been in Paris in an
attempt to revive the momentum of the Middle East peace process,
which has been stalled because of the hard-line policies pursued
by Israel's Likud government.
</P>
<P>
State Department deputy spokesman Glyn Davies said: "I can
confirm for you that in fact Dennis Ross has traveled to Paris...
to consult with the French on peace process issues. They may got
into some discussion of the monitoring group."
</P>
<P>
Ross will also meet with his Egyptian counterpart Alsam Albaz
and Dora Gold, an advisor to Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu before Tuesday when formal discussions start on the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that as the peace
process goes through a delicate period, "it seems important that
the Americans and the French may be able to exchange views
regularly to help the quest for peace".
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has put aside the land-for-peace formula in the
Middle East peace process, which was he regards as endangering
Israel's security. And the Arabs, especially Palestinians, feeling
frustrated, have warned Netanyahu that he might pay price for
that.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last week threatened to cancel
a Middle East economic conference scheduled to be held in Cairo in
November, unless Israel fulfills its peace treaty commitments.
</P>
<P>
Davies told reporters Ross will stress in Paris that the United
States has "interest in moving forward with the (economic)
summit".
</P>
<P>
"There have been some summit meetings in the past, including
last year in Amman that were very successful and brought some new
interests and business to the region. So we want very much for
this November summit to go forward," he said.

<P>
BELGRADE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Vice-Premier Nikola
Sainovic said on Monday the Belgrade and Sarajevo governments had
agreed upon a series of forms of economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after one-day talks with officials of the Bosnian
Muslim-Croat federation in Sarajevo, Sainovic said that future
economic cooperation would "consolidate the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Sainovic, who arrived in Sarajevo earlier today heading a
high-ranking Yugoslav delegation, said the two sides had agreed to
negotiate specific accords on mutual cooperation in their future
economic contacts.
</P>
<P>
Sainovic's partner in talks, Vice-President of the Muslim-Croat
federation Ejup Ganic, also described the talks as "successful."
</P>
<P>
Ganic told reporters that the talks would be followed in the
coming weeks by a series of more concrete economic discussions,
Tanjug news agency reported from Sarajevo.
</P>

The Yugoslav delegation, the first of its kind over the past
four years, was comprised of a few ministerial officials and 15

<HEADLINE> U.S. Calls on Iraqi Kurds to Abide by Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
urged two main warring Kurdish factions of northern Iraq to abide
by terms of a Washington-brokered cease-fire they agreed to on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Only one day passed in cease-fire, then the truce fizzled when
heavy fighting broke out between the Kurdistan Democratic Party
and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan at midnight Sunday and at
least 29 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
State Department deputy spokesman Glyn Davies said at a
briefing: "The United States calls on both sides to fulfill their
commitments to implement an immediate cease-fire, to return their
forces to positions they held before August 17, and to meet with
U.S. officials to pursue reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
He said continued fighting between the Kurds would only set
back their interests, and encourage "outside forces to pursue
their own agendas, not to mention of inside forces such as
Saddam Hussein".
</P>
<P>
The fighting has threatened a U.S.-led plan to unite the
mountainous Kurdish region in northern Iraq against President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraqi is an enclave created by The U.S.-led allies
right after the Gulf War in 1991, to prevent the Iraqi forces from
attacking the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
The United States hosted several rounds of talks between the
Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
last year but has failed to secure any permanent agreement.
</P>
<P>
Davies admitted on Monday that the United States was "no
further along in terms of setting a date or any specifics" for
talks in London.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 3 to 2 on the New
