German Justice Minister Herta Daeubler Gmelin in the West Bank
city of Ramallah Saturday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Denies Siege of Palestinian Refugee Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Amid a flaring crisis with the
Palestinian authority, Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss on
Saturday denied that there were special security arrangements on
Palestinian refugee camps in his country.
</P>
<P>
"There is not any siege on Palestinian camps, but some routine
security measures," Hoss told reporters, adding that the Lebanese
army will issue a statement to provide an explanation.
</P>
<P>
Hoss' remarks came two days after the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) said Lebanon was "conducting an oppressive policy"
against the refugees living in the country, accusing Beirut of
"radical discrimination."
</P>
<P>
The harshly-worded PNA comment was provoked by last month's
death sentence handed down by a Lebanese court on Brigadier Sultan
Abul-Ainayn, head of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah
faction in the Ain al-Hilweh camp.
</P>
<P>
The camp, near Lebanon's southern port city of Sidon, is the
largest among the 12 camps across the country, home to 350,000
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Ainayn was convicted of forming and heading an armed gang with
the purpose of committing crimes against Lebanese people and their
properties and to defy the authority of the Lebanese state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, about 150 Palestinian students held
demonstration at the entrance of Ain al-Hilweh camp to protest
Lebanese security measures around the camp.
</P>
<P>
A Lebanese army officer was slightly wounded when the
demonstrators threw stones at his patrol.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Meet Mubarak on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
will visit Egypt soon for talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on the Middle East peace process, the Palestinian minister
of international cooperation said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Shaath, who arrived here earlier in the day, made the
announcement after meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
But he did not specify the timing of Arafat's upcoming visit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently visits Egypt to consult with Mubarak and get
advice on the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Shaath delivered a message from Arafat to Mubarak via Moussa,
MENA said. The content is not known.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is playing a key role in helping contain tension between
the Palestinians and Lebanon over Palestinian refugees in the
country, Shaath told reporters.
</P>
<P>
This is even more important at this crucial stage when the
Palestinians are negotiating with Israel in the final-status talks
for the refugees' return to their homeland, Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
He said he briefed Moussa on the latest developments in the
peace process, adding there are many difficulties in the talks for
a permanent peace between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Shaath accused Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak of continuing
to approve settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian
lands, a move he said would obstruct the realization of peace.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Five old ladies were killed
and nine others injured in a road accident involving a bus and a
tipper on the outskirts of the Ugandan capital city of Kampala
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place at 6:00 p.m. local time when a
Kampala-bound bus carrying 14 passengers rammed into a big
stationary tipper loaded with bricks.
</P>
<P>
Chief Police Spokesman Asuman Mugenyi told Xinhua in a telephone
 interview that "overspeeding is identified as the cause of the
accident."
</P>
<P>
However, the driver of the tipper was also to blame because he
parked the vehicle inconsiderately, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "all the injured and the dead were rushed to
Mulago hospital in Kampala."
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, six of the injured are still in
critical conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said that the five killed carried no identification papers
on them and their bodies are waiting for identification by
relatives.
</P>
<P>
This is the second serious road accident in the country this
week. Earlier on Thursday, three people, two of them sisters, died
in a motor accident on the Jinja- Kampala highway.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Urges Accountants to Help Curb Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Parliament Speaker
Francis Ayume has urged accountants across the country to help the
government curb the rampant corruption among officials.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal at an accountants' seminar in Entebbe, 40
kilometers south of the capital city of Kampala, on Saturday,
Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
At the function attended by more than 100 accountants, the
speaker said the proper management of funds is one of the best
ways to tackle the problem of corruption and accountants have the
responsibility to help the government in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has blamed the judiciary for
the rampant corruption among top government officials and has on
several occasions reaffirmed the government's political commitment
to this issue.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has, besides government departments, more than 20
commercial banks, but the country has only dozens of qualified
accountants. Lack of qualified accountants is considered a major
factor leading to corruption.
</P>
<P>
The government is said to have lost some 200 million U.S.
dollars as a result of corruption.

<HEADLINE> Compensation for Crash Victims' Relatives Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian economy minister on
Saturday stressed the necessity to pay compensation as soon as
possible for relatives of the victims in an EgyptAir crash.
</P>
<P>
Youssef Boutros-Ghali met with EgyptAir Chairman Fahim Rayan
and officials of the Misr Insurance Company and discussed the
issue with them, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali said the issue would be settled as soon as
possible and that the compensation will be paid according to an
agreement between EgyptAir and Misr Insurance.
</P>
<P>
The officials of Misr Insurance said the company is prepared to
pay compensation after the relatives submit death certificates and
proof of relation, MENA said, without specifying the amount for
each victim.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the
eastern coast of the United States less than an hour after
takeoff, killing all 217 people, including more than 60 Egyptians,
on board.
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, the Egyptian Airline Pilots' Association
welcomed a statement by U.S. investigators of the crash
discrediting speculative reports suggesting the incident was
caused by a co-pilot of the flight.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the association said Egyptian pilots feel
relieved by the announcement of the U.S. officials that the
reports, which leaked from the investigative committee, were false.
</P>
<P>
It urged the media to be patient and give the investigators a
chance to concentrate on their work.
</P>
<P>
The speculation that the crash might be caused by suicide of a
co-pilot has shocked and angered Egyptians, and triggered tension
in relations between Egypt and the U.S..

<HEADLINE> No Foreign Shares in Kuwait's Oil Project: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Kuwaiti official
reiterated here Saturday that foreign oil companies will not be
allowed to own shares in the project of developing Kuwait's
northern and western oil fields.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah
Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah said that project "does not implicate allowing
any form of takeover of our oil wealth by others."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of "the International
Conference on Role of International Oil Companies in Development
of Kuwaiti Oil Fields," Sabah, also chairman of the Kuwaiti
Supreme Petroleum Council, said the project is aimed at realizing
objectives in raising the state's crude oil production capacity to
3 million barrels per day (bpd) in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, which accounts for 10 percent of the world's 1 trillion
barrels crude reserves, now has a maximum production capacity of
around 2.5 million bpd and enjoys a quota of 1.84 million bpd
under the current oil cut scheme of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
Aiming to increase the total capacity, the Kuwaiti government
has been planning to speed up the development of its northern and
western oil fields, with a proven reserve of 16 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
But the government intends to call in foreign expertise and
investment to help bring down the cost in the development process
and prolong the projected age of the oil fields and traps.
</P>
<P>
However, the consideration met strong opposition in the
parliament for many lawmakers fear the government might award
partial ownership of the fields to foreign firms, which is banned
by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, state decision-makers have been trying to map out
an appropriate form of getting foreign technical assistance
without affecting the state's ownership of its oil fields.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Kuwait has contacted several world oil giants
on its oil development project, but no agreement has been signed
so far.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing three-day international conference on oil is also
designed to invite foreign advice and suggestions on the the
government-proposed oil project.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects U.N. Extending of Oil-for-Food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammad Said al-Sahaf announced Saturday that Baghdad rejected
the U.N. Security Council resolution 1275 on extending the sixth
phase of the oil-for-food program for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, Sahaf said the
new Security Council resolution was of no significance in
implementing the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the resolution of providing "convenience for the
U.S. to pressure other member states of the council into accepting
the British-Dutch proposal on Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain recently has been pushing for the
adoption of a proposal which recommends a conditional suspension
of sanctions after Iraq agrees to allow the United Nations weapons
inspectors to return to the country and put its oil revenues under
U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf accused that the U.S. and British representatives at the
U.N. Sanctions Committee had put on hold 807 million dollars worth
of Iraqi contracts concluded in the six phase phase for imports of
food, medicine and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. and British envoys had delayed or put on
hold 621 Iraqi contracts in the current phase which expired
Saturday, and that Iraq sees no point in extending the program for
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Friday unanimously approved the
extension of the current oil-for-food program for two weeks until
December 4 to allow more time for Iraq to reach its export ceiling
of 8.3 billion dollars set up by the council.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly declared its rejection of the British-Dutch
proposal, saying it will not accept any U.N. resolution short of a
total and comprehensive lifting of the sanctions which has been in
place since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Feature: UN Council Wrangles Over Iraq Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council met Friday afternoon to extend the sixth phase of
the U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq, which expires on November
20, for two weeks until December 4.
</P>
<P>
Before the 15-member Security Council began to vote on a draft
resolution on the extension, the meeting unexpectedly turned into
tense with the 10 non-permanent members getting impatience over
the failure of the five permanent members on forging a new
comprehensive policy towards Iraq and the five permanent members
sparring among themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has been deadlocked over the Iraqi issue
since the U.S.-led military strikes against the country last
December after which the U.N. suspended all its weapons inspection
which has been in Iraq for eight years. consultations and
discussions among the members of the Council on how to bring Iraq
once again into full cooperation with U.N. has been underway since
the beginning of this year, most of which have been conducted
among the five permanent members (P-5), namely China, Russia,
France, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Meeting was the first one participated by the full
members of the Council in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
"For over a year the Council has failed in its responsibility
to deal effectively with the Iraqi problem," said Canada's
representative to the United Nations Robert Fowler, who was echoed
by representatives from Argentina, Brazil and Gambia.
</P>
<P>
Peter Van Walsum, representative of the Netherlands, who
co-sponsored a comprehensive draft resolution with Britain, said
"We have been too intimately involved in the process for us to
underestimate the difficulties. But we cannot conceal the fact
that my delegation is far from happy with the way the Iraq file is
being handled in the Security Council today."
</P>
<P>
"While the P-5 have been struggling with this issue for almost
six months, we, the nonpermanent members, have had approximately
no more than one progress report per month, courtesy of the United
Kingdom delegation. It is possible that this way of functioning
and this speed is acceptable to the permanent five. But we, the
elected members, simply cannot go on telling the other United
Nations members who have elected us that we are content to sit and
wait for white smoke to emerge from the H-5 -- the P-5 --
chambers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I use the word H-5 because in my delegation we have started to
call the permanent five the 'hereditary five,'" said Peter Van
Walsum.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of two of the P-5 Jeremy Greenstock of Britain
and Sergey Lavrov of Russia sparred over what would come over the
next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the United States, the allies in the Council who
are used to be hardliners on U.N. policy towards Iraq and worried
about the long absence of U.N. weapons inspectors in the country,
expect to hammer out a comprehensive arms resolution ready for a
vote when the two-week extension of the oil-for-food program
expires on December 4.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the British and U.S. eagerness, Lavrov, who asked
for the second chance to make a statement, an unusual practice in
the Council meeting, saying there could be no artificial
timetables or links between the two, a view supported by China's
representative Shen Guofang.
</P>
<P>
Russia favors lifting of the ceiling on Iraqi oil export,
doubling the oil revenue Iraq can use to import spare parts and
equipment for its dilapidated oil industry and wants Britain and
the United States to suspend the enforcement of the no-fly zones
over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Council fired words over each other, but
they are uttered in a polite and diplomatic manner.

<HEADLINE> Lord Archer Pulls out of London Mayor Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Controversial millionaire
novelist Jeffrey Archer announced on Saturday that he was
abandoning his bid to become London's first elected mayor after a
13-year-old scandal came back to haunt him.
</P>
<P>
Archer's decision was prompted by a report about him sold by a
friend to a British Sunday newspaper, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Lord Archer said the decision was as a result
of a report which is due to appear in a newspaper on Sunday -
believed to be the News of the World.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Lord Archer said he had asked a friend, Ted
Francis, to cover for him by saying that they had dinner together
in 1987, when in fact he was dining with a close female friend.
This was the day before he had been accused of sleeping with the
prostitute Monica Coghlan.
</P>
<P>
"That accusation was false and, in the libel action that
followed, I was fully vindicated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Archer, 59, last month beat former transport minister Steven
Norris in a ballot of Conservative Party members in London to
become the opposition party's mayoral candidate.
</P>
<P>
His career in politics has been dogged by allegations about his
educational qualifications and financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
Londoners elect a mayor next May 4, and while Prime Minister
Tony Blair's Labour Party is expected to win, Archer had been seen
as a strong, populist candidate. He had been been endorsed by
former prime minister Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
Archer said: "Although I would like to be mayor of London, I am
unwilling to put my family or the party through six months of
sustained attack."
</P>
<P>
Conservative Party leader William Hague said: "Conservatives
must set high standards of integrity in public life. Jeffrey
Archer has let the party down and there could be no question of
him continuing as our candidate for mayor."
</P>
<P>
Outside politics, Archer is an author who earns millions from
sales of his novels worldwide.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Canada to Reduce Debt, Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) urged Canada to cut its debt and tax, the Ottawa Citizen
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In its recent annual review of Canada's economy, the IMF told
Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin that cutting the debt and
tax will be more beneficial economically in the long run.
</P>
<P>
"Debt reduction and income tax reform should be the top
priorities in allocating the prospective fiscal surpluses," the
newspaper quoted the IMF report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian minister, in recognition of the importance of the
IMF's surveillance role, said Friday that he was encouraged by the
IMF's favorable assessment of Canada's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Canadian officials say that the IMF welcomed Martin's decision
earlier in the month to present five-year projections of budget
surpluses, which will total 95 billion Canadian dollars (about 65
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The IMF applauded Martin when he said tax cuts would be a
priority during the next five years, as a result of a stronger
economy.
</P>
<P>
Canada has one of the highest ratios of debt to gross domestic
product in the industrialized world at 67.8 percent in 1998,
according to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The country has been devoting the unspent portion of a yearly 3
billion Canadian dollars (about 2 billion U.S. dollars) to
contingency fund as a minimum for debt reduction.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Belarus to Sign Common State Treaty Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Belarus will sign a
treaty here on November 26 on the formation of a common state and
a program to materialize it, the Kremlin said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The date was agreed in a telephone conversation between
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his Belarussian counterpart
Alexander Lukashenko, who was invited to come here next Friday to
sign the treaty.
</P>
<P>
During the conversation, the two talked about the just-
concluded summit meeting of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and agreed that the two countries "
will continue rejecting attempts of interference in their internal
affairs," the Kremlin press service said in a report.
</P>
<P>
Satisfied with the overall results of the summit, they said
that the documents approved in Istanbul, Turkey, generally meet
the interests of all OSCE members, consolidate the policy of
safeguarding security, equality and mutually-beneficial
cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also held a telephone conversation with Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma on Saturday, the Kremlin said, expressing
his thanks for his support to Russia's stance at the OSCE summit.
</P>
<P>
In the face of mounting Western pressure on Moscow to ease its
military campaign against rebels in the breakaway republic of
Chechnya, Yeltsin staunchly defended Russia's policies in the
North Caucasus, saying the military actions were against "bandits
and terrorists" and that the West has no right to criticize Russia.

<HEADLINE> Terrorists Caught Trying to Infiltrate Canadian Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign terrorists have been
caught trying to infiltrate Canadian airports, according to the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).
</P>
<P>
CSIS agents have detected several people associated with
terrorist groups in attempts to apply for airport clearance
passes, baggage handling jobs or work in secure sectors of flight
terminals.
</P>
<P>
The country's National Post newspaper Saturday quoted a latest
CSIS report as saying "of particular interest were two individuals
who required access to secure areas of the airport."
</P>
<P>
"Both were found to have been actively involved with terrorist
groups, and had in fact spent time overseas providing support to
these groups," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The CSIS warns that "most of the world's terrorist groups"
maintain a presence in the country and that "in the past,
terrorists have been apprehended in Canada while planning the
hijacking or bombing of aircraft."
</P>
<P>
This is the first time CSIS has admitted that Canadian airports
are being targeted by terrorists, the National Post said.
</P>
<P>
The report came after Canadian and U.S. agents broke several
cases of infiltration by organized criminals into both country's
airports.

<HEADLINE> Greece, U.S. Agree on Turkey's European Orientation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece and the U.S. Saturday
agreed that Turkey could become a European Union (EU) candidate
country with conditions.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came following the talks between Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis and U.S. President Bill Clinton, who
arrived here Friday for a 24-hour official visit to Greece.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference, Simitis said that both
sides agreed that Turkey's EU vocation helps its closer connection
with a sphere of development and peaceful cooperation. They also
stressed that Turkey's EU candidacy could not be accepted without
conditions that help confrontation of the existing problems.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Clinton hailed the recent rapprochement in
relations between Greece and Turkey, saying that differences
between the two rival neighbors could be resolved through recourse
to the international court of justice at the Hague or a mutually
agreed and internationaly-recognized mechanism for the resolution
of disputes.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged the two countries to double their efforts to
resolve their disputes in order to go hand-in-hand into the bright
future.
</P>
<P>
On the Cyprus problem, the two men agreed that the restarting
of next month's proximity talks between Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash must be
substantive in order to lead to its resolution.
</P>
<P>
As for the Balkans, they stressed the need for stability in the
region, respect of existing borders, intensification of the
initiatives for reconstruction of the area and materialization of
the stability pact.
</P>
<P>
On Greek-U.S. relations, they agreed that relations between the
two countries were very good and there was significant room for
stepping up cooperation between them.
</P>
<P>
Greece is the second leg of Clinton's five-nation European tour
which also includes Turkey, Bulgaria, Italy and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
During his visit here, Clinton also met with Greek President
Costis Stephanopoulos and main opposition New Democracy (ND)
leader Costas Karamanlis.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Budget Deficit Up in First 10 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's budget deficit hit
44.8 percent of expenditure in the first 10 months of this year,
compared with 41.2 percent in the same period of 1998, a finance
ministry statement said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit figure was 3.8 percent beyond the targeted 41
percent set in the 1999 budget bill.
</P>
<P>
Government expenditure reached 4.527 billion U.S. dollars in
the first 10 months of this year, against 4.21 billion dollars in
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Revenues of the period were 2.52 billion dollars, up from 2.48
billion dollars in the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 budget bill introduced a hefty tax increase in car
gasoline and customs duties in an effort to cut down the country's
huge budget deficit and the ballooning public debt.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit finished at 43 percent of expenditures in
1998, equal to around 14 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The public debt has accumulated to around 18 billion dollars,
over 120 percent of GDP, by the end of October due to the
reconstruction process after the 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the bulk of the 10-month spending went to
domestic and foreign debt serving of 1.96 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry hopes that revenues would improve in the last two
months of this year once the Ministry of Telecommunications
transfers revenues collected from phone bills which are estimated
at 600 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Expert On China's Space Program (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China deserves a place in the world in the area of high
technology, said the head of China's Manned Spaceflight Program.
</P>
<P>
The expert said that the success was the fruit of concerted
efforts by the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the development of manned spaceflight technology
ushered in a new era for mankind to enter into the outer space and
has been the focus of attention within the international space
circles.
</P>
<P>
It is significant for China to develop manned spaceflight
technology, the expert said, as it will strengthen the country's
comprehensive national strength, promote the development of
science and technology, enhance national prestige, boost the
nation's sense of pride and cohesiveness.
</P>
<P>
China started preliminary studies of manned spaceflight
technology as soon as it was in command of technologies on
launching, monitoring and controlling low-earth recoverable
satellites, earth-synchronous communication satellites and solar-
synchronous meteorological satellites.
</P>
<P>
Based on feasibility studies both technologically and
economically, the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee
with Jiang Zemin at the core decided to carry out China's own
manned spaceflight project in 1992. Practice has demonstrated that
the decision is "absolutely correct," said the expert.

<P>
LAGOS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Eight west African countries
have decided to set up a commission to ensure co-operation and
development in the resource-rich Gulf of Guinea.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made by Gabon, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea,
Sao Tome and Principe, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the
Republic of the Congo, Angola and Cameroon at a summit held in
Gabon's capital Libreville on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The commission aims "to create a framework for consultation on
co- operation and development and the prevention, management and
settlement of conflict in the Gulf of Guinea," said a press
release reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the summit, host Gabonese President Omar Bongo said
the eight countries have a shared interest in the waters of the
Gulf of Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf of Guinea, which is abundant in natural resources,
offers the most exciting prospects of the world's deepwater areas
and is estimated to hold about 14 percent of global offshore oil.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that West Africa has planned to invest about 17
billion U. S. dollars in oil exploration and exploitation in the
Gulf of Guinea in the first few years of the new millennium.

<HEADLINE> EAC Ministers Meet on Treaty Signing, Action Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of the
three East Africa Cooperation (EAC) member states are meeting in
Tanzanian northern town of Arusha for preparation of an action
plan and a new community treaty signing ceremony expected on
November 30.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Arusha said Saturday that an extra-ordinary
meeting of the Permanent Tripartite Commission for EAC has adopted
an action plan to be fulfilled after the signing of the treaty
there.
</P>
<P>
The plan entails a 26-point action that is to be accomplished
or initiated by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda within a specific
period ranging from six months to four years.
</P>
<P>
It deals with institutional matters as well as treaty signing
program, said Chairman of the Commission Eriya Kategaya, who is
also Uganda's First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
It will cover ratification of the treaty within six months by
the partner states, procedures for admission of new members and
constitution of new organs and their rules of procedures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The action plan also insists on conclusion of protocols for
establishment of the customs union, standardization, quality
assurance, metrology, testing and development of an East African
industrial development strategy, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to officials present at the meeting, activities
including the holding of a trade fair, a cultural festival and an
East and Central African handball tournament will make the treaty
singing a truly memorable event in the history of the East African
Region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by two deputy prime ministers, eight
ministers, seven permanent secretaries and over 80 other senior
officials of the three member states.
</P>
<P>
The EAC was founded in 1996 on the basis of the defunct East
African Community which collapsed in 1977 mainly due to reasons
including the divergence of economic policies and ideologies then
pursued by the member states.
</P>
<P>
Since its foundation, the EAC has tried to address the
shortcomings inherent in the past cooperation initiatives to boost
economies of the three countries with a combined population of
about 80 million and territories of 1.8 million square kilometers.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Saturday
admitted that it received an Iraqi Hajj (pilgrimage) delegation
but denied any political dimensions for it.
</P>
<P>
A Saudi foreign ministry official said his country received
the Iraqi delegation just like any other mission to discuss
preparations for the Hajj season with Saudi officials.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh's reception of the Iraqi delegation was part of "its
desire to take care of Iraqi pilgrims and to provide all
facilities to them to perform rituals of Hajj," the unnamed
official was quoted by the Saudi Press Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Saudi Arabia announced its reception of
an Iraqi Hajj delegation, which arrived in the Gulf kingdom last
week, since the end of the 1991 Gulf War triggered by Baghdad's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi delegation has presumably met with Saudi Minister of
Pilgrimage Mahmoud Safar.

<HEADLINE> Expert On China's Space Program (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The successful test flight demonstrates that China's spacecraft
and new carrier rocket are excellent in performance, said the
expert, and the newly-developed spacecraft launching site and
spaceflight monitoring and controlling networks have reached the
world's advanced level.
</P>
<P>
Various experiments conducted during the mission on space
remote sensing, environment monitoring, space materials, life
science, astronomy and physics also helped expand China's use of
the space for peaceful purposes, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the expert, China's manned spaceflight program,
which started in 1992, has achieved the expected results thanks to
the strong support of all departments and localities concerned.
</P>
<P>
The research and construction work shows China's distinct
characteristics and technological advancement. Chinese scientists
and engineers carried forward the country's mature space
technology and actively explored for ways to develop manned
spaceflight according to China's own situation.
</P>
<P>
In carrying out the program, Chinese scientists have resolved
many key technological problems and mastered a lot of new
technologies and new techniques, which helps improve the country's
overall level of space technology and relevant technologies and
promote the development of related sciences and technologies.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the program has also provided good
opportunities for young scientists and engineers to improve
themselves, thus trained a contingent of space science workers for
the next century, he said.
</P>
<P>
A number of facilities that have been built for the manned
spaceflight project also lay a solid material and technological
foundation for the sustained development of China's space industry.
</P>
<P>
The well organized and coordinated implementation of the
program has also enabled China to accumulate a wealth of
managerial expertise in developing large spaceflight projects, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The expert said it is the Chinese government's persistent stand
to make use of the outer space for peaceful purposes and for the
benefits of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Based on today's maiden flight, China will conduct more
unmanned test flights before putting its astronauts in space, he
said.

<HEADLINE> China Successfully Launches First Experimental Spacecraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- China's first experimental
spacecraft, part of the country's manned space flight program,
touched down in the central Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in
north China at 3:41 a.m. (Beijing time) today, successfully
concluding the first flight of the system.
</P>
<P>
As another milestone in China's astronautical history, the
successful launching and retrieval of the spaceship marks the
country's new major breakthrough in manned space flight technology.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the
State Council and the Central Military Commission have sent a
message of congratulations on this event.
</P>
<P>
The space vehicle, named "Shenzhou" by President Jiang Zemin,
was launched with a new model of "Long March" rocket at 6:30 a.m.
(Beijing time) on November 20 at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch
Center in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes after takeoff, the spaceship detached itself from
its launching vehicle and entered its preset orbit.
</P>
<P>
The Spacecraft and carrier rocket were made by China itself.
And the experimental flight was unmanned this time.
</P>
<P>
According to technical staff working at the launch site, the
satellite launch center for the first time completed at its
technological workshop the general assembly in a vertical way and
tests of the combined body of the space aircraft and booster
rockets.
</P>
<P>
The center also transported the combined body of the space
aircraft and booster rockets to the launching site vertically and
used the technology of long-distance monitoring and control of the
launching.
</P>
<P>
China has built a new land-sea based space monitoring and
control network which meets international standards and put it
into operation in this first experimental launch.
</P>
<P>
During the spacecraft's flight in orbit, it was traced,
monitored and controlled by ground monitoring and controlling
system and four surveying ships, named "Yuan Wang," stationed at
high seas. They successfully conducted a series of scientific
experiments.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the organization work said that China started to
implement the manned space flight program in 1992. He described
the program as a huge system that embodies great cooperation
between various trades of the country. The success was a major
step toward China's manned space flight cause.
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft was developed and manufactured mainly by the
China Research Institute of Carrier Rocket Technology under the
China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Chinese
Research Institute of Space Technology and Shanghai Research
Institute of Astronautical Technology.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Aerospace Directing and Controlling Center
organized the tracing, surveying and controlling of the test
launch. Relevant departments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
and the Ministry of Information Industry took part in the
designing, manufacturing and testing in the project.
</P>
<P>
This was the 59th launch of the "Long March" carrier rocket
series, and its 17th successful launch in a row in the recent
three years.
</P>
<P>
Manned space flight technology is the most difficult one in the
aerospace area. In the past, the United States and Russia were the
only countries that had this technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Manned spaceflights refer to
human beings' flights beyond the Earth's atmosphere by space
vehicles for the missions of exploration, experiment, research and
production as well as military applications.
</P>
<P>
By getting over the blockage of the atmosphere and the gravity
of the earth, the space flights expand the scope of human
activities from the land, ocean and atmosphere of the earth to the
outer space and help the man better recognize the universe.
</P>
<P>
The flights are also used to conduct various kinds of
researches and experiments in the unique environment of the space
and the manned spacecraft, in order to explore the space and its
abundant resources.
</P>
<P>
Manned space vessels can be divided into manned spaceships,
manned space stations and space shuttles, according to their
functions.
</P>
<P>
A manned spaceship, or manned satellite or lunar lander, can
cater to one man or several crew members, while a manned space
stations normally can accommodate several astronauts. A manned
spaceship can serve as a space station and is reusable.
</P>
<P>
In the past, only Russia and the United States had the
technology of manned spaceflight.
</P>
<P>
The former Soviet Union launched the world's first manned
spaceship on April 12, 1961. Yuri Gagarin made one circle around
the earth and returned to the ground safely.
</P>
<P>
On February 20, 1962, the United States launched its first
manned spaceship.
</P>
<P>
Before launching their manned spacecraft, the two countries had
conducted a series of unmanned test flights in the space.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Holds Ceremony to Publicize Jasmine Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROI-ET, THAILAND, November 21 (Xinhua) -- "Ask for Thai Jasmine
rice, whenever you feel hungry or at whichever of the 5,000 Thai
restaurants around the world," Pongpol Adireksarn, Minister of
Thailand's Agriculture and Cooperatives, told 16 ambassadors and
hundreds of local farmers here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He made the "advertisement" at the Thai Jasmine Rice Harvesting
Day ceremony, which was held in this northeastern province and
broadcast to 144 countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Thailand has total arable land of 57
million rais (9.12 million hectares) that is suitable to grow
rice.
</P>
<P>
Of the 57 million rais, 22 percent, or 12.5 million rais (two
million hectares), are growing jasmine rice, a well-known
high-quality fragrant rice, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand produces about 4.6 million tons of jasmine rice every
year, of which 62 percent are for domestic consumption and 34
percent for export.
</P>
<P>
The largest Thai jasmine rice importer in 1998 was China, which
imported 224,790 tons. It was followed by the United States and
China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
During Sunday's ceremony, local farmers demonstrated the whole
process from harvesting in the paddy field, threshing, milling to
household rice cooking in the traditional Thai fashion.
</P>
<P>
Pongpol said agriculture is the "backbone of Thailand", since
60 percent of the country's 6,000 million population are farmers.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is also the largest rice exporter in the world. It
exported 6.5 million tons of rice in 1998.

<HEADLINE> China Considering Laws to Protect Major Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The National People's Congress
(NPC), China's highest legislative body, is considering drafting
laws to protect the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the country's two
largest rivers.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent national conference on protecting
environment and resources in Guiyang, the capital city of
southwest China's Guizhou Province, participants from 17 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities called for accelerated
legislation to avert ecological deterioration and protection
ecology in the two river valleys.
</P>
<P>
Gao Ni, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the Qinghai
Provincial People's Congress, said that drafting laws will help
plan demographics, ecological construction, environmental
protection and economical growth in the river valleys.
</P>
<P>
Qu Geping, chairman of the Environmental and Resources
Protection Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), also
praised the proposals put forward by the participants, calling
them "constructive".
</P>
<P>
In protecting major rivers, we can also learn from other
countries, Qu said.
</P>
<P>
The 6,300-km Yangtze River and the 5,464-km Yellow River
originate from the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. The ecology around these
river valleys has greatly deteriorated because of opening up
wasteland and logging in the past 20 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Excessive logging in the upper reaches of the two rivers was
blamed for the heavy flooding in 1998 and desert storms in
northwestern China.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Li Peng's Visit to Enhance Sino-Kenyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- At the invitation of Francis
ole Kaparo, Speaker of Kenya's National Assembly, Chinese top
legislator Li Peng will start his official goodwill visit to
Kenya from Monday.
</P>
<P>
During his first visit to the east African country, Li Peng,
Chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National People's
Congress (NPC), will also hold talks with Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan officials said that Li's visit to their country is of
great importance to promote the relationship between the two
countries, especially at the turn of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Li's visit to Kenya will not only expand exchanges and
cooperation between the parliaments of the two countries, but also
give a new impetus to further development of friendly relations
between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Since China and Kenya established diplomatic ties in December,
1963, the relations between the two nations have been developed
steadily.
</P>
<P>
On September 30, President Moi, Vice-President George Saitoti
and eight cabinet ministers attended a reception hosted by the
Chinese ambassador to Kenya marking the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China. It was rarely seen in
Kenya's diplomatic history.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Kenya pursue their own independent and peaceful
diplomatic policies. They share the same or similar views and
position on many international issues.
</P>
<P>
Kenya firmly stands for "one China" policy, recognizing the
People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of
China and regarding Taiwan as an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
On several occassions, the president said that China is
Kenya's true friend and the two countries enjoy cordial relations.
</P>
<P>
President Moi paid three visits to China, in 1980, 1988 and
1994 respectively. And Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Kenya
in May, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Mutual support and cooperation have deepened the understanding
and the friendship between the peoples of the two countries and
also promoted their economic cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 36 years, China has provided Kenya with loans and
grants totalling hundreds of million U.S. dollars and assisted
Kenya in building dozens of projects including the Moi
International Sports Center.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 10 Chinese companies are contracting over 100
projects in Kenya with a combined contractual volume of 600
million dollars in fields of housing construction, road building,
tourism and wildlife protection.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade between China and Kenya topped 100 million
dollars in 1995, and in 1998, the figure hit 119 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the two countries have also enhanced cooperation in
the areas of parliament, education and culture.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, China and Kenya signed an agreement on
educational exchange and cooperation for 2000-2005.
</P>
<P>
China's Nanjing Agricultural University and Kenya's Egerton
University are engaged in a cooperative project on horticultural
technology which is going on smoothly.
</P>
<P>
China has also sent sports coaches to Kenyatta University to
train personnel in swimming, volleyball, basketball and badminton.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Kenya are developing countries and their
economies are complementary to each other. They still have huge
potential for economic and trade cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Legislator Calls on Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, Chairman of
China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee,
called on former South African President Nelson Mandela here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese top legislator was extended a warm welcome at
Mandela's residence in Johannesburg. Li said he felt very pleased
to meet Mandela again.
</P>
<P>
Li said Mandela, as an old friend of the Chinese people, has
played an important role in developing the relationship between
China and South Africa as well as in the building of a new South
Africa after apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Referring to international issues, Li said Chinese and South
African leaders hold identical views on many international issues.
 He stressed the importance of peace and stability which, he said,
are prerequisites for development.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that different countries are at different levels of
economic development with different characteristics and developed
countries should not apply their own standards to developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Mandela agreed with Li, saying that independence, sovereignty
and economic interests of developing countries should be
respected.
</P>
<P>
The former South African president congratulated China on its
recent agreement with the United States about China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, saying that China's accession into
WTO will not only benefit China itself, but also other developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also briefed Li on the latest developments in Africa,
particularly the situation in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China appreciates South Africa's efforts to help
promote peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Li was on a six-day official good-will visit to South Africa,
the second leg of his six Afro-Asian tour. His first stop was
Mauritius.

<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Chunyun, a member of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, met today with a delegation from Japan's Komei Party
led by its leader Kanzaki Takenori.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Ready to Host Somali Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Sunday voiced
readiness to organize a conference aimed at forging national
reconciliation in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid told Egypt's
Middle East News Agency that the pan-Arab forum will cooperate
with the U.N., the Eastern African Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development, the European Union and other parties concerned in
helping realize peace in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been in division since 1991 when former President
Siad Barre was toppled. In 1997, the world community mediated an
agreement among the Somali factions on forming a central
government. But the factions have failed to implement the
agreement due to disputes and distrust.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid blamed the Somali faction leaders for the failure
to advance the peace process and the deterioration of the
situation in the Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
He urged all countries, especially Somali's neighbors, to
stick to a U.N. Security Council resolution banning exports of
weapons to Somalia and respect its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The league is to form a committee on Monday to discuss future
drives aimed at helping realize peace and stability in Somalia,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reiterates Rejection to British-Dutch Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi cabinet on Sunday
reiterated its firm rejection to the British-Dutch proposal on
Iraq currently under discussion at the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The 55th session of the cabinet chaired by President Saddam
Hussein reviewed "what is going on in the Security Council such as
the debates and manoeuvres aiming at issuing a new resolution
based on the dubious British proposal," the Iraqi News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The British-Dutch proposal recommends a conditional suspension
@495:.@4" @:4'9%(4"74,@,9:4,4)4"9.) 2@,/9
of the sanctions after Iraq agrees to allow U.N. weapons
inspectors to return to the country and put its oil revenues
under the U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
"This proposal does not aim at lifting the embargo, but in
reality, it is a colonial proposal aiming at imposing new terms on
Iraq for a number of coming years," said the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet called upon the member states of the Security
Council, particularly the friendly ones, to reject this proposal
and to stand firm with what it called "fair and just situation on
the Iraqi just issue."
</P>
<P>
Baghdad on Saturday announced that it would never deal with
the U.N. Security Council resolution 1275 for extending the sixth
phase of the oil-for-food program for another two weeks until
December 4, calling the resolution "absolutely meaningless."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahaf said in a
statement that "the only meaning of this resolution... is to
blackmail other Security Council members and build pressure on
them so as to accept the ill-famed British draft resolution."

<HEADLINE> Injured Soldiers Urged to Acquire Vocational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has urged injured soldiers to take advantage of their
rehabilitation period and acquire vocational skills.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the appeal Saturday when touring at the Mubende
Rehabilitation Center, not far away from Kampala, a press release
from the President's Office said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that when retrenchment took place in the
Uganda People's Defense Forces, the army deliberately did not
accept the demobilization of the soldiers who were injured in the
war without first making sure they had been given alternative
skills.
</P>
<P>
Museveni strongly advised the injured soldiers to take the
issue of skill acquisition as a crucial matter for the good of
their future as private citizens.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he told both the Defense Ministry and Ministry of
Sports and Education to expand the facilities at the
rehabilitation center by putting up more buildings so that the
area is upgraded to a polytechnic with the purpose of concretizing
the program of skill acquisition.
</P>
<P>
At present, the center has numerous projects including
agricultural activities, bakery, marketing, fish farming,
carpentry, dairy farming, tailoring, welding and poultry.

<HEADLINE> China Defend Asian Women's Football Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BACOLOD CITY, Philippines, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Defending
champions China lived up to their expectation as they defended the
Asian soccer title with a 3-0 win over Chinese Taipei on Sunday at
the 12th Asian Women's Football Championship here.
</P>
<P>
With the presents of 7,000 audience at the Panaad Sports
Complex, China virtually claimed the title in the first half when
the Chinese women scored the three goals in the first 45 minutes
of the last game of the two-week, 15-team competition.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese settled the issue on their only way as they
dictated the tempo from the start to the end to secure their
seventh straight Asian crown.
</P>
<P>
The runners-up of the World Cup in the United States will go
home with 50,000 U.S. dollars bonus, and star midfielder Wen
Lirong was voted the Most Valuable Player of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
A check of 25,000 dollars went to the pocket of the outclassed
Chinese Taipei team, who ruled the first three editions of this
event before China joined in the biannual event in 1986.
</P>
<P>
DPR Korea salvaged third place with a scrambling 3-2 win over
Japan earlier on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There was no doubt about the outcome of the championship match
as the Chinese got their act rolling right away as Wang Liping
struck with the first goal in the 16th, a 15-yard volley before
the mouth of the Chinese Taipei's net.
</P>
<P>
Skipper Sun Wen acted more of a decoy and let her teammates
carry the scoring load, typified by Liu Ying, who was credited
with the two other goals.
</P>
<P>
Liu Ying blasted one in with a sizzling header from the left on
a right cross passed by Sun in the 42nd, adding another two
minutes later with a pointblank smash off a free kick from the
left flank.
</P>
<P>
The pace slowed down considerably in the second half but the
Chinese Taipei could not make any gains over the superior skills
and tight defense of their rivals.

JERUSALEM, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli air forces will buy
700 guided bombs from the United States at a total cost of 45
million U.S. dollars, local media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Ministry announced the planned deal on
Saturday, the first time that the purchase of such bombs by

</P>
<P>
The joint attack munition (JDAM) bombs, produced by the Boeing
company in St Louise, are considered the most advanced of their
type in the world.
</P>
<P>
By the aid of a combined inertial navigation system and global
positioning system, the weapons convert free-fall bombs into
accurately guided smart bombs, which can be released accurately as
far as 24 kilometers from their target.
</P>
<P>
The bombs, used by specially mounted F-15 and F-16 fighter
planes, were employed by the U.S. air forces in the recent air

<HEADLINE> HK Customs Takes Measures to Improve Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Customs Airport Command
of Hong Kong had introduced a number of measures to improve its
service, said a spokesman for the Customs and Excise Department
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures is the publication of a pamphlet on reasons
for search of baggage.
</P>
<P>
"The distribution of the pamphlet, one of our measures
introduced to enhance the communication between passengers and our
staff, could give passengers more information on our work and
reduce misunderstanding in the course of Customs clearance," the
spokesman explained.
</P>
<P>
Conducting personal search on passengers was another crucial
factor triggering customer dissatisfaction, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We have published and placed inside our search rooms a booklet
in 20 languages explaining to passengers the purpose of personal
search, the laws, procedures, their rights and the venue of
complaint," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the department had arranged training in Thai, Japanese
and Putonghua to customs officers to overcome the language barrier,
which hindered communication with passengers.
</P>
<P>
"More other foreign language courses, including Nepalese, will
be arranged soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from attending language courses, 50 front-line officers
have also attended anti-corruption and staff integrity briefings,
organized by the Independent Commission Against Corruption, to
refresh anti-corruption concept and to enhance integrity ideas
among customs officers.
</P>
<P>
"In order to motivate front-line officers to strive for the
best, we have initiated two competitions at the airport -- the "
Distinguished Customer Service Awards" for baggage examination
counter officers and the "Best Service Awards" for cargo examiners,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Customs Dog Team played an important role in
drugs detection.
</P>
<P>
"To make the drugs detector dogs discharge duties more
efficiently, the department is now launching a 'passive dog
training' program," he said.
</P>
<P>
By introducing such training, drugs detector dogs will be
deployed to conduct close passenger screening duties.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that we engage passive dogs. For
further improvement, our dog handlers will attend training courses
relating to passive dogs in Japan," he added.
</P>
<P>
The passive dogs will stay calmly next to any suspicious
objects in which dangerous drugs were found.
</P>
<P>
To enhance the efficiency in cargo examination, the customs
plans to install sophisticated facilities.
</P>
<P>
"We shall acquire mobile X-ray vans equipped with Ionscanner,
which enables our officers to perform cargo examination duties
more efficiently. It will allow customs officers to provide
service at the spot without moving cargo to customs examination
area," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other development which facilitates the air cargo industry will
be the implementation of Air Cargo Clearance System (ACCS) Phase
III in February 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
When ACCS Phase III comes to operate, the time used in
processing outbound and breakdown cargo will be tremendously
reduced.

Mindanao, including our struggle for self-rule and
self-determination," Al Haj Murad, MILF military affairs chief,

With the signing of the long-awaited treaty later this month,
deliberate steps would be taken to attract investments within the
climate change convention framework, delegates from the three
countries said at a recent workshop in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The climate change convention was adopted during the U.N.
conference on climate change held in Kyoto, Japan, in December
1997. Clean development mechanism was designed to reduce
emissions of greenhouse gases, which are blamed for global
warming.
</P>
<P>
The Director of Environment in Tanzania's Vice-President's
Office Eric Mugurusi called on East African countries to initiate
joint programs on new investments in climate change projects, the
Daily News newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The director suggested that scientists in the region build a
credible knowledge base and formulate proposals for measures that
can be adopted by the governments to address the climate change
problem.
</P>
<P>
Globally, the energy sector is the main emitter of carbon
dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides, the leading greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
However, in Tanzania, 95 percent of carbon dioxide emissions is
derived from land use and deforestation, four percent from the
energy sector and one percent from the industrial sector, Mugurusi
noted.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Calls for More Protection for Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has said that economies of developing countries still need
more protection than that offered under the World Trade
Organization (WTO) regime.
</P>
<P>
"Our economies will, for longer periods, continue to require
some substantial protection through reasonable tariff and
non-tariff mechanisms than the transition periods provided for
under the WTO regime," Mugabe said in Harare on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Equality between developed and developing countries was not
possible because of existing differences in industrial and trade
capacities, the Zimbabwe News Agency Sunday quoted Mugabe as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks ahead of the second summit of
the 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries in Santo Domingo,
the Dominican Republic, from November 25 to 26.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to leave Monday for the summit.
</P>
<P>
ACP members enjoy preferential tariffs and quotas in the
European Union (EU) market under the Lome Convention of 1975.
</P>
<P>
The summit in Santo Domingo is expected to consider a report of
the Council of Ministers on the ACP-EU negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The series of conventions expires in February next year and
negotiations for future cooperation between the ACP and EU take
place in Santo Domingo next week.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Surgeon Draws "Road Map" For the Brain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The workings of the human brain
remains a mystery. The brain is often described as a "virgin
forest" because of its complexity.
</P>
<P>
A "road map" for the brain devised by a Chinese surgeon will
serve as a guide for doctors performing cerebral operations. Brain
surgeons often use an endoscope with a micro-video camera or other
medical instruments to help explore the human brain during
operations.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Han Zhanqiang works at the No.1 Hospital Attached to
Harbin Medical Sciences University in the northeast province of
Heilongjiang. The slender, tubular optical instrument can enter
the brain via "three routes". These "three routes" have been
carefully marked by Dr. Han to guide other doctors when examining
the brain.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Annual Water Festival Kicks Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's annual Water
Festival, the most colorful and interesting event in the country,
kicked off Sunday, expecting to attract nearly half million people
to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Monineath Sihanouk and other
government leaders, including Prime Minister Hun Sen and the
Senate President Chea Sim, watched the boat racing Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The King looked very happy, waving to the crowds and wishing
encouragement to the racing teams.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the races commemorate the past glory of
Cambodia's navy in ancient times when the Angkor civilization
ruled much of what is now modern Thailand, Burma and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
More than 22,000 racers in 374 boats from 14 provinces are
taking part in the races, which began at 11 am on Sunday and will
end on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The three-day traditional event includes races, fireworks,
moonprayers and illuminated boats with ministry and royal emblems.
The festival celebrates the change in direction of the Tonle Sap
river, one of the few rivers in the world to do so, and the
traditional beginning of the fishing season.
</P>
<P>
It is the first Water Festival for Cambodian people to
celebrate since the new government was formed last November.
</P>
<P>
The yearly event drew all kinds of people to Phnom Penh's
waterfront in front of the Royal Palace to watch the boat racing
and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
In order to have a peace and happy festival and avoid the
traffic jams and security problems caused by crowds of people, the
city authorities strengthened police force by deploying an
additional 5,000 men.
</P>
<P>
The traffic is restricted in many areas, and an extra 500
traffic police is being deployed during the festival to direct
moving vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The Water Festival will cost about 205,000 U.S. dollars from
the national budget, according to government officials.
</P>
<P>
The final string-cutting ceremony will be held at 5 pm on
Tuesday. Once the string between three boats is cut, the festival
ends and the fishing season traditionally begins.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rate Crosses 3 percent Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate has
crossed the three percent mark, rising to a 22-week high of 3.01
percent for the week ended November 6, on account of a spurt in
prices of food articles.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve bank of India, the annual rate of
inflation, based on Wholesale Price Index (WPI), recorded a 0.23
percentage points increase to 3.01 percent as against 2.78 percent
in the previous week and a high of 8.61 percent during the
corresponding week of last year.
</P>
<P>
The last time inflation was over three percent was on June 5
this year at 3.53 percent.
</P>
<P>
The lower rate of inflation during larger part of the current
year is mainly due to comparison with a higher base last year when
prices of most essential commodities had risen abnormally
following shortfall in agriculture production.

<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times
</P>
<P>
-- Lord Archer's political career ended in disgrace on Saturday
when he was forced to withdraw from the race to be mayor of London
after admitting that he lied 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraphy
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's security chiefs have launched a nationwide hunt
for a dissident IRA terrorist cell following intelligence reports
that its members are planning a campaign of violence on the
British mainland to disrupt the Northern Ireland peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The Independent on Sunday
</P>
<P>
-- Several members of the IRA and Sinn Fein have quit the
organization to protest the devolution deal hammered out by Sinn
Fein President Gerry Adams and Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble. Reliable sources said the resignations are a symptom of
significant grassroots unease about the deal because it might lead
to the decommissioning of the IRA weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Observer
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair may be "delighted and shell-
shocked" at the prospect of a fourth child, but he is not looking
forward to the late night nappy-changing routine.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say I'm wildly looking forward to that aspect, but
the fact is we are both very happy," Blair said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Talks on Deal Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators are scheduled to reconvene Sunday in another effort to
iron out differences over the Israeli next troops withdrawal from
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the "Voice of Palestine" radio, chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the talks would also deal
with the third phase of Israeli redeployment, the release of the
third batch of Palestinian prisoners in Israel, the opening of
the northern safe passage linking Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Palestinian-Israeli deal, Israel should
carry out the second and third troops withdrawal from the West
Bank on November 15 and January 20 respectively.
</P>
<P>
But the second troops redeployment was delayed due to the
differences between the two sides over what territory should be
transferred to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand geographic contiguity and certain Arab
populated areas in the West Bank, but the Israel only agreed to
relinguish sparsely-populated remote and isolated areas to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Erekat expressed hope that the talks would reach positive
results, emphasizing the readiness of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) to fully execute all items in the latest peace
deal, the Sharm El Sheikh Memorandum, signed in September.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal, Israel should have transferred 5 percent
of the West Bank land to the Palestinians, with 3 percent from
solely Israeli control to jointly rule and 2 percent from joint to
full Palestinian jurisdiction.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Latrell Sprewell returned

</P>
<P>
Sprewell was booed upon taking the floor for warmups, but
scored 14 points and had six rebounds in a game that was not as
close as the final score indicated.
</P>
<P>
On December 1, 1997, Sprewell choked Carlesimo in a practice
and was suspended and traded to New York. The two men did not
shake hands before the game.
</P>
<P>
New York (6-6) was led by Allan Houston's 24 points. It had
lost five of its previous six contests.
</P>
<P>
In Charlotte, the league-leading Portland Trail Blazers needed
overtime to beat the Hornets 100-96.
</P>
<P>
Detlef Schrempf sank a 23-foot jumper with 1:14 to go in OT to
put Portland ahead for good as the Blazers won their sixth
straight and dealt Charlotte its first home loss.
</P>
<P>
Brian Grant returned to action for Portland (10-1) after
missing nine games with an injured knee and contributed 12 points
and seven rebounds in 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In Milwaukee, Karl Malone scored a season-high 40 points and
Bryon Russell added 19 and seven rebounds off the bench as the
Utah Jazz (6-4) beat the Bucks 111-100.
</P>
<P>
Ray Allen scored 23 points but shot just 6-of-17 from the field
and Glenn Robinson added 18 for Milwaukee (6-4), which suffered
its first home loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
In New Jersey, Allen Iverson scored 37 points to make John
Calipari a winner in his first game on the sidelines against his
former team as the Philadelphia 76ers posted a 100-96 victory over
the woeful Nets.
</P>
<P>
Calipari wound up running the Sixers Saturday night after head
coach Larry Brown was ejected with 1:29 left in the first quarter.
Brown named Calipari an assistant coach this past offseason after
he was fired by the Nets last season.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, Chris Gatling scored 28 points and Darrell
Armstrong added 21 as the Orlando Magic snapped a four-game losing
streak with a 107-103 win over the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
Dikembe Mutombo had 22 points, 21 rebounds and six blocks for
Atlanta, which suffered its fifth loss in seven games.
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, Vernon Maxwell put on a one-man show, scoring 15 of
his team's final 24 points as the SuperSonics pulled out their
fourth straight win, 110-97 over the floundering Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
In Cleveland, Jalen Rose scored 22 points and Rik Smits had 18
for the Indiana Pacers, who avoided their third straight loss with
a 107-98 victory over the Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
In San Antonio, Jaren Jackson scored 24 points off the bench as
the Spurs pounded the Dallas Mavericks 106-90.
</P>
<P>
In Miami, Jamal Mashburn scored 23 points and Alonzo Mourning
22 as the Heat pulled away in the second half for a 110-92 victory
over the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Eric Piatkowski scored 25 points as the Los
Angeles Clippers had a surprisingly easy time in a 98-89 victory
over the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
In Denver, the Nuggets got 21 points from Antonio McDyess and
19 from Ron Mercer in a 95-86 victory over the Chicago Bulls.

will not result in a "blow" to China's domestic insurance industry,
although changes always look threatening in short term.
</P>
<P>
Consumers will welcome the high quality of service brought by
competition, and foreign firms will become Chinese companies
dedicated to serving local people," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
No matter how easy it is to enter the market, Howard said his
company will regret the more than 300 million U.S. dollars
invested in the Chinese market in the past.
</P>
<P>
But, the Chinese government should make its criteria of market
admission for foreign companies more transparent after joining the
WTO.

<HEADLINE> DPR Korea Gets 3rd Place at Asian Women's Football Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BACOLOD CITY, Philippines, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The DPR
Korea salvaged third place with a scrambling 3-2 win over Japan in
the 12th Asian Women's Football Championships in Bacolod on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Koreans survived the second-half rally of the Japanese
led by Nami Otake in securing the win worth 15,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Koreans took command of the match early, scoring in the
11th minutes as Pak Jong Ae chipped in with her left foot from
pointblank off a cross pass.
</P>
<P>
Japanese goalie Nozami Yamago had a busy day at the office as
she saved at least three clear attempts in the first half by the
DPR Korea team who dominated most of the attack.
</P>
<P>
But Yamago was not ready when Jin Pol-hyui connected on a
follow-up in the 28th minute following a penalty box scamble.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, runners-up in this event four years ago, sorely
missed key forward Nami Otake and steady midfielder Tomomi Mitsui
in the first half as they both nursed injuries suffered in the
elimination round.
</P>
<P>
Shoko Mikami nearly scored Japan's first goal as the first half
about to end but her sizzling 30-foot volley from the right flank
was quickly smothered by DPR Korean goalie Kye Yong Sun.
</P>
<P>
But Otake, who was suffering from a groin pull, entered the
second half and immediately make her presence felt after Sin Kum
Ok scored DPR Korea's third goal in the 51st, heading in the ball
from a right corner kick.
</P>
<P>
Exactly a minute later, the pony-tailed Otake finally broke the
ice for Japan as she broke away from her DPR Korean defender and
slotted in the ball in front of the net from 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
Despite being heavily marked, Otake scored once again, slipping
past two DPR Korean players before heading the ball over a rushing
Sun in the 69th as Japan narrowed the gap to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
But DPR Korea shut down Otake after that as she repeatedly got
hammered by her foes' physical defense, resulting in yellow cards
by Yang Kong Hui, Sin Kum Ok, O Kum Ran and Yun Yong Hui.
</P>
<P>
Sorely missed by Japan, which pocketed the fourth place purse
of 10,000 dollars, was midfielder Yasuyo Yamagishi, who sat on the
game for incurring two yellow cards earlier.

JERUSALEM, November 21 (Xinhua) - The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian National Authority officials said informally
that they are likely to accede to a key Israeli demand to retain
some settlements in West Bank in a final-status deal, as long as
they obtain statehood and equivalent land swaps inside the Israeli
territory before the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Tensions mounted in the West Bank as 15 demonstrators,
demanding the release of all Palestinian prisoners held in
Israeli jails, were injured in Saturday's clashes with the
Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) at the Ayosh Junction at the northern
edge of the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who said his government
is sensitive to real social distress, will not add a single penny
to the state budget, but he is willing to make minor adjustments.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel is cutting water allocation to farmers as the
drought continues, and the weather forecast showed no signs of
easing in the situation. Foreign Minister David Levy suggested
that Israel import water from Turkey as a short-term solution.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Court Denies Release of Top Rwandan Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) Friday denied that the
tribunal was on the point of releasing top genocide suspect
Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza.
</P>
<P>
An ICTR spokesman said that there were "still a number of
issues" which had to be resolved before an Appeal Court decision
on November 3rd could be implemented.
</P>
<P>
On that date, the Appeal Court in Hague, Netherlands, ordered
Barayagwiza's release on the grounds that procedures had been
repeatedly violated during his initial detention in Cameroun and
after his transfer to the U.N. prison in Tanzania's north town of
Arusha on November 19th, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Appeal Court ordered the ICTR Registry to take steps to
hand Barayagwiza back to the Camerounian authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, the ICTR Registry was still awaiting a response from
the Camerounian authorities on whether and how they intended to
comply with the Appeal Court decision.
</P>
<P>
Barayagwiza's release order has caused the Rwandan government
to suspend its cooperation with the ICTR, the independent
Hirondelle News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Barayagwiza was a leader of the extremist Hutu Coalition pour
la defense de la Republique (CDR) party and a founder of the radio
and television station Libre des Mille Collines, which incited
Hutus to kill Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
He was also foreign policy adviser to the Rwandan interim
government that presided over the genocide in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Ships Stranded by Declining Water Level Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Two ships, one from Cyprus,
and the other from China, which were stranded at the lower reaches
of the Yangtze, the country's longest river, because of the
continuous ebbing water level, have now been released.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this month, the water level of the river
dropped drastically. By Saturday, the river's water level at the
city of Yizhen in the Nanjing section was lowered to less than
five meters, or nearly 80 centimeters down as compared with
November 1.
</P>
<P>
Apart from declining water level, the long-lasting high water
levels during the flood seasons in summer this year and last year
are also a factor for the rise of silt accumulation in the river
bed, and this, too, is attributed to ship stranding in the river.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Negotiators to Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Chief Negotiator
Saeb Erekat and his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran are scheduled to
meet Sunday again to discuss the further Israeli troops withdrawal
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Although the venue of the meeting has not been announced, a
senior Palestinian official confirmed Sunday to Xinhua that the
two will discuss several clauses in the Sharm El Sheikh peace deal
that Israel is tardy in implementing, besides the delayed second
Israeli redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal signed in September, Israel was supposed to
convene a meeting on the third troops redeployment in the West
Bank on September 13, then decide on the location for a northern
safe passage crossing by October 31, and enact new arrangements
for the Cave of the Patriarchs in West Bank city of Hebron, the
official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
But all those issues have not been settled yet, he added.
</P>
<P>
As for the dispute over Israel's second troops redeployment,
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) is opposed to the
redeployment lines mapped out by Israel and is insisting on
receiving a contiguous stretch of territory of the West Bank, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Israel should have handed over another 5 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinians in the second-stage withdrawal on
November 15, but the implementation was delayed after Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat's refusal to sign the redeployment maps
delivered to him.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has insisted that redeployment produce geographic
contiguity and certain Arab populated areas in the West Bank must
be included in the maps.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side said that it is Israel that has the right to
decide from which part of territory to pull bank its troops.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have met several times recently to discuss the
issue, but no progress was made.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Expects Quick Entry Into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordan could join the World
Trade Organization (WTO) as early as next week after final
bilateral meetings with WTO member states in Geneva, Switzerland,
the semiofficial Jordan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
WTO committees reviewing the kingdom's application are expected
to present final reports to the WTO ministerial meeting in Geneva
before the membership is announced, the paper quoted Secretary
General of the Industry and Trade Ministry Mohammad Halaiqa as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Halaiqa left here for Geneva Saturday, heading the Jordanian
government delegation to take part in the final bilateral talks
scheduled for Wednesday on the sidelines of the ministerial
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to sign bilateral agreement on WTO entry with
participating nations, mainly the United States and those of the
European Union, as part of the final process to join the
international trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
Jordan had reached bilateral agreements on WTO entry with
Japan, Canada and Switzerland earlier this month after two years
of negotiations with WTO member states.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom had lowered import duties on cars and family
electric appliances and made amendments to economic laws as part
of its efforts to join the WTO, which generally calls for lower
tariffs to facilitate international trade.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientists Claim To Have Found Herbal TB Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists claimed to
have isolated a herbal compound that can kill the
antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis bacteria, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the laboratory tests, the compound had been found to be more
potent than some of the present antibiotics, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The herbal compound was isolated at the Central Institute for
Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIAMP) in Lucknow, 490 km east of
here.
</P>
<P>
However, animal tests and clinical trials to determine the
safety and efficacy of the compound were yet to be carried out,
PTI quoted Suman S. Khanuja, head of the project, as saying.
</P>
<P>
After clearing the hurdles of animal and human trials, he said,
the compound could lead to development of a fourth generation
antibiotic which was believed to be more effective than the most
powerful antibiotics like lomefloxacin currently available.
</P>
<P>
It was isolated from a plant widely available in India, Khanuja
said. But he refused to disclose the name of the plant as patent
application had not yet been filed.
</P>
<P>
The plant extract acted by inhibiting the DNA replication in
bacteria and had been found to overcome bacterial resistance which
occurs due to genetic mutations, said Khanuja, who started his
project three years ago.

XINING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Qinghai Provincial Civil
Affairs Department has managed to collect and provide disaster-
relief goods, medicines and 10 tons of fodder for the snow-
strained herdspeople in the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 herdspeople and 1.1 million domestic animals
in the prefecture have been strained by the heavy snows that have
fallen continuously in Yushu Prefecture since last October.
</P>
<P>
The snow-trapped herdsmen had to burn for heating the wooden
poles of their tents and saddles because of acute fuel shortage.
And the work of relocating scattered herdspeople is still under
way.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the famous Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the "roof of the
world", Qinghai Province is among the provinces which are most
vulnerable to natural disasters such as floods, snow storms and
drought.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, record snowfalls reported in the Yushu Prefecture
caused the heaviest damages and losses in four decades. A total of
5,193 people suffered from frostbite and 278,000 heads of cattle
were frozen to death.

<HEADLINE> Oil Price Surge to Cut Oman's Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The increase in oil prices
is bound to reduce Oman's budget deficit announced early this
year, a senior Omani official has said.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable rise in oil prices during the second half of the
year will undoubtedly reduce the budget deficit and balance of
payments, Mohammed Bin Nasser Al Khusaibi, secretary of Oman's
Ministry of National Economy, was quoted by the Gulf News daily as
saying on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Oman's 1999 budget was based on an oil price of nine
U.S. dollars per barrel. On Saturday, however, the state's crude
oil was priced at 23.30 dollars per barrel. And the official
expected the world oil average to be more than 16 dollars by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, Oman will have a positive gross
domestic product (GDP) for 1999, with an estimated growth of 1.5
percent. And the budget deficit, originally put at around 631
million rials (about 1.64 billion U.S. dollars), could drop to
about half the figure.
</P>
<P>
Oman has also dropped plans to borrow 400 million dollars
through an international bond issue due to economic improvements
on the back of stronger oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf state, however, indicated that it would continue
efforts for economic diversification, to reduce the dependence on
oil, which currently accounts for about 40 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
"We must not forget that oil is a finite resource, with its
price at the mercy of external circumstances beyond local control,"
Oman's Sultan Qaboos Bin Said said on the country's National Day
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He called for more efforts for economic diversification and
encouraged the role of the private sector, which could help
lessen the dependence on oil.
</P>
<P>
The monarch stressed that the country's priority should be
given to tourism in future development, saying "this sector has
great potential for growth and for making an effective
contribution to economic diversification."

<HEADLINE> Knicks Win as Sprewell Backs to Golden State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Latrell Sprewell returned
to Golden State for the first time since choking his then coach P.
J. Carlesimo and his New York Knicks throttled the Warriors 86-79
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell was booed upon taking the floor for warmups, but
scored 14 points and had six rebounds in a game that was not as
close as the final score indicated.
</P>
<P>
On December 1, 1997, Sprewell choked Carlesimo in a practice
and was suspended and traded to New York. The two men did not
shake hands before the game.
</P>
<P>
New York (6-6) was led by Allan Houston's 24 points. It had
lost five of its previous six contests.
</P>
<P>
In Charlotte, the league-leading Portland Trail Blazers needed
overtime to beat the Hornets 100-96.
</P>
<P>
Detlef Schrempf sank a 23-foot jumper with 1:14 to go in OT to
put Portland ahead for good as the Blazers won their sixth
straight and dealt Charlotte its first home loss.
</P>
<P>
Brian Grant returned to action for Portland (10-1) after
missing nine games with an injured knee and contributed 12 points
and seven rebounds in 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In Milwaukee, Karl Malone scored a season-high 40 points and
Bryon Russell added 19 and seven rebounds off the bench as the
Utah Jazz (6-4) beat the Bucks 111-100.
</P>
<P>
Ray Allen scored 23 points but shot just 6-of-17 from the field
and Glenn Robinson added 18 for Milwaukee (6-4), which suffered
its first home loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
In New Jersey, Allen Iverson scored 37 points to make John
Calipari a winner in his first game on the sidelines against his
former team as the Philadelphia 76ers posted a 100-96 victory over
the woeful Nets.
</P>
<P>
Calipari wound up running the Sixers Saturday night after head
coach Larry Brown was ejected with 1:29 left in the first quarter.
Brown named Calipari an assistant coach this past offseason after
he was fired by the Nets last season.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, Chris Gatling scored 28 points and Darrell
Armstrong added 21 as the Orlando Magic snapped a four-game losing
streak with a 107-103 win over the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
Dikembe Mutombo had 22 points, 21 rebounds and six blocks for
Atlanta, which suffered its fifth loss in seven games.
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, Vernon Maxwell put on a one-man show, scoring 15 of
his team's final 24 points as the SuperSonics pulled out their
fourth straight win, 110-97 over the floundering Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
In Cleveland, Jalen Rose scored 22 points and Rik Smits had 18
for the Indiana Pacers, who avoided their third straight loss with
a 107-98 victory over the Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
In San Antonio, Jaren Jackson scored 24 points off the bench as
the Spurs pounded the Dallas Mavericks 106-90.
</P>
<P>
In Miami, Jamal Mashburn scored 23 points and Alonzo Mourning
22 as the Heat pulled away in the second half for a 110-92 victory
over the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Eric Piatkowski scored 25 points as the Los
Angeles Clippers had a surprisingly easy time in a 98-89 victory
over the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
In Denver, the Nuggets got 21 points from Antonio McDyess and
19 from Ron Mercer in a 95-86 victory over the Chicago Bulls.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Arrests 3 Suspected Drug Traffickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian Drug Enforcement
Commission has arrested three suspected drug dealers in capital
Lusaka for allegedly trafficking in khat (a stimulant for chewing)
worth about 174.3 million kwacha (about 70,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the commission, Nelson Banda, said in a statement
the three - a Zambian, a Somali and a Zimbabwean - were arrested
after they were found with 41.5 kilograms of the drug, which they
attempted to smuggle through Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Two of the suspects were travelling on a bus from Zimbabwean
capital Harare to Lusaka with the illicit drugs, the Sunday Times
of Zambia quoted the officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
The third suspect was arrested in Lusaka's Makeni residential
area, he said.
</P>
<P>
Banda said the attempt to smuggle khat through Zimbabwe by the
trio was meant to deceive the law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
It is common with drug traffickers to select what they believe
are less monitored routes to transport their illegal merchandise,
he said.

NAIROBI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- About two million Kenyans are

Health Sam Ongeri has said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Over 116,000 People Use Mobile Phones in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Over 116,000 people are using
mobile phones in Bangladesh at present, The Financial Express
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The accumulated number of users of the country's four mobile
operators stood at 116,200 in October this year, with the Grameen
Phone enjoying the lion's share of 44 percent, followed by the
Pacific Bangladesh Telecom Ltd. with 25 percent, and Telekom
Malaysia and Sheba Telecom 21 percent and 10 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to 500,000 fixed telephones operated by the
state-owned Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB), all
the four companies are operated by the private sector having
acquired 23 percent of the telecom market in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The first mobile phone service, Citycell, was launched in the
country in early 1993 by the Pacific Telecom, but hostile
regulatory environment, inadequate infrastructure of BTTB and
impractical import duty on the handset have been hindering the
cellular mobile growth, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Some 28,800 mobile subscribers, representing 25 percent of the
entire cellular community in the country with a population of over
120 million, are unable to call any BTTB number, according to the
report.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Insurers Welcome Sino-U.S. Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Foreign insurance firms regard
the historic Sino-U.S. agreement concerning China's admission to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) as a first step of a "long
march".
</P>
<P>
Foreign insurance company staffers interviewed by China Daily
Business Weekly said they ere excited by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Business Weekly today quoted Howard Margules, chief
representative of the US-based life insurer Lincoln Financial
Group, as saying that the introduction of more overseas companies
will not result in a "blow" to China's domestic insurance industry,
although changes always look threatening in short term.
</P>
<P>
Consumers will welcome the high quality of service brought by
competition, and foreign firms will become Chinese companies
dedicated to serving local people," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
No matter how easy it is to enter the market, Howard said his
company will regret the more than 300 million U.S. dollars
invested in the Chinese market in the past.
</P>
<P>
But, the Chinese government should make its criteria of market
admission for foreign companies more transparent after joining the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
"We are most interested in the transparency of market access
criteria," said a U.S. property insurer's Beijing deputy.

Direct navigation across the Taiwan Strait began on April 19,
1997, and six shipping companies have taken part in these trial
cargo shipments with their monthly cargo handling ability now
increased from 10,000 TEUs to 30,000 TEUs.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, approximately 340,000 TEUs are
expected to be handled for the whole year on this route, and the
prospects for the direct shipping across the strait is very good.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Likely to Unify Railway Administration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
likely to unify administration of its railway systems, doing away
with the present dual administration of two zones, The Bangladesh
Observer reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a highly-placed official source, the newspaper said a
concrete proposal to this effect had been submitted to the
government, and the World Bank and the country's donors had
reportedly favored the unification of the Bangladesh Railway
administration.
</P>
<P>
The unified administration, replacing the present
administrative set-up of two zones -- the East Zone and the West
Zone, was likely to be run by a board with a chairman at the top,
as an apex body to run the affairs of the railway of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Railway Board, consisting of minimum four members in
addition to the chairman, would hold its office in Dhaka, and
would be responsible to the Ministry of Communication for all its
activities.
</P>
<P>
The government also envisaged the necessity of reshuffling the
present railway administration in order to minimize the overhead
cost, cut the number of administrative staff, centralize the
administration and finally ensure financial viability of its
functioning, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The two railway zones in Bangladesh are separated by the
Jamuna-Padma-Meghna River and have different gauges, with mainly
broad gauge in the West Zone and meter gauge in the East Zone.

<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- China's first experimental
spacecraft, "Shenzhou" (meaning "magic vessel" in Chinese), has
completed a 21-hour space voyage at 3:41 hours (Beijing Time)
today with a successful landing.
</P>
<P>
The whole process has been covered by Xinhua reporters from the
satellite launch site, spaceflight commanding and monitoring
center, spaceflight survey ships and the spaceflight preset
landing site.
</P>
<P>
JIUQUAN SATELLITE LAUNCHING CENTER (Gansu Province in northwest
China) -- Along with multi-level pads being stretched open on the
launch tower in a newly-built manned spaceflight launching site,
there emerged a carrier rocket and an experimental spacecraft in
the wee hours on November 20.
</P>
<P>
Atop the new model "Long March" cluster-rocket was the first
spacecraft independently developed and manufactured by China. "
Shenzhou" spacecraft, named by President Jiang Zemin, is composed
of cabinets of propulsion, return and orbit. The designs of the
two red Five-Star national flag, which were painted on both sides
of the spacecraft, looked dazzling and were eye-catching under the
bright light.
</P>
<P>
At 6:30, there came the order to ignite the rocket. "Long March
" blasted off immediately amid a huge red ball of flammulated
flames. Ten minutes after takeoff, the spacecraft detached itself
from the launching vehicle and entered a pre-set orbit. This was
the 59th flight of "Long March" cluster carrier rocket, thus
adding a brand-new page in the annals of China's spaceflight. (

SOUTHERN ATLANTIC OCEAN (on the No.3 Spaceflight Survey Ship)
</P>
<P>
At 18:00 hours on November 20 (local time), an order of return
was transmitted to the spacecraft, which has revolved around the
Earth for the 14th circle, when it arrived above southern Atlantic
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The order was from No. 3 spaceflight survey ship, namely "
Yuanwang" (meaning "Looking Far into the Distance" in Chinese),
which has been stand-to on the Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Then, the spacecraft established the state of return, stated up
the retropack, and began to return from the sky with an altitude
of over 300 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three other survey ships, Yuangwang No.1 and 2 on
the Pacific Ocean, and Yuanwang No.4 on the Indian Ocean, have all
accomplished the survey tasks of their own with flying colors.
</P>
<P>
However, with a sudden climate change, three-meter waves rolled
up on the vast ocean and foams splashed onto the sides of the
survey ship, Yuanwang No. 3, and it sailed ahead despite pounding
waves.
</P>
<P>
At 18:48 hours, with an order of "ready in one minute" over the
broadcastg from the Control Center in Beijing, a radar tracing and
surveying antenna on the top of the No.3 survey ship began to move
slowly towards the direction that the spacecraft would appear.
</P>
<P>
The next order of pose adjusting from Beijing was smoothly
transmitted to the spacecraft via No.3 survey ship, which had
fulfilled tracing and survey mission of the spacecraft at 18:58
hours after it has sent out a series of remote orders related to
pose adjusting, detaching of the orbit cabinet and brake
application.
</P>
<P>
At 19:41 hours when the last sunset clouds fading away on the
Atlantic Ocean, people in Beijing longing for the return of the
spacecraft have finally heard the good news: it landed at last.
The clock directed to 3:41 hours on November 21 in Beijing.

SPACECRAFT LANDING STRIP IN MID-INNER MONGOLIA (north China) --
When it was over 3 o'clock in the early morning (Beijing Time),
spacecraft "Shenzhou" deviated from its original elliptic orbit in
the sky with an altitude of more than 300 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Like a violent-tempered horse tamed by the scientists on the
ground, "Shenzhou" spacecraft slided towards mid-Inner Mongolia,
its designated destination.
</P>
<P>
At the scheduled landing strip, technicians with various survey
equipment were on the tiptoe of expectation and ready to capture
the magic craft.
</P>
<P>
"Attention," a voice from the speaker call everybody's
attention. "Shenzhou" has entered the aerosphere which is only 80
km above the ground. Its fabulous speed of about 7.5 km per second
resulted in violent friction between the spacecraft and the
aerosphere.
</P>
<P>
When "Shenzhou" craft lowered to the height of some 40 km, a
plasma shell, formed on the surface of the spacecraft, produced
electromagnetic shielding, so that the ground-spacecraft
communications suspended for a while.
</P>
<P>
A brief silence was broken by a report from a radar station: "
target discovered." The simple, short words meant that radar has
captured "Shenzhou" during the communication-dark period.
</P>
<P>
"Shenzhou" continued to decline, radar continued tracing, and
three helicopters convolving above the landing spot.
</P>
<P>
When there were only 30 km to slide before landing, "Shenzhou"
craft received one more order to have its electric power switched
on.
</P>
<P>
And, afterwards, one good news came after another. Brake
parachute was detached, and the principal parachute turned
completely open.
</P>
<P>
In a twinkling when there were 1.5 meters from "Shenzhou" craft
to the ground, four spacecraft-carried landing buffer propulsions
simultaneously burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft was landed with loadfulls of scientific
experiment data, after a space voyage of 21 full hours for China's
first spacecraft.

<HEADLINE> Computers Being Promoted in Shaanxi Rural Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 21 (Xinhua)-- "What is a computer?" If you
asked the question to some rural pupils in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province a year ago, few of them could answer. But now,
some 110,000 students are taking formal computer course in a large
number of schools in the province.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi, one of China's least developed provinces, had provided
an average of one computer for every 774 primary and middle school
students by the end of 1997. Since 1998, the local government has
worked hard to promote computers in elementary and middle schools
throughout the province. Some 210 schools in 35 counties and
regions have now set up computer courses. Online education is also
available.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government not only provides financial aid but
seeks support from companies to donate computers and related
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Educational departments have carefully chosen computer
graduates allocating them to schools in need after special
training classes.
</P>
<P>
Within seven to 10 years, all schools with an enrollment of
more than 300 students will set up computer education courses to
give rural children access to the modern world.

<HEADLINE> Panama, U.S. to Discuss Canal Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Panama is to hold talks
with the United States next Monday on the security of the Canal
and cooperation in the next century, said Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Aleman.
</P>
<P>
He said that a delegation led by him will discuss in Washington
with U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary for Latin America, Peter
Romero, the possibility of establishing a high level mechanism to
handle the bilateral relations after the U.S. returns the Canal to
Panamanian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
There is also the possibility to discuss the issue of Anti-drug
Multilateral Center (CMA) on Monday and Tuesday, said Aleman.
</P>
<P>
The talks about the CMA failed last year because the two
countries could not reach an agreement on its mission.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. considers that the CMA could perform other missions
besides fighting drug trafficking in the Canal Zone, which the
former Panamanian administration saw as a military base under
disguise.
</P>
<P>
Vice Panamanian Foreign Minister Harmodio Arias Cerjack said
that the installation or presence of U.S. military bases in Panama
will not be negotiated in any way as they receive no support from
the people.
</P>
<P>
However, Aleman did not dismiss the possibility of a plebiscite,
so the Panamanian people will decide what must be done about the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that whether the U.S. presence will
continue in Panama after the reversion of the Canal is important
to the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
There are strong pressures on the U.S. President Bill Clinton
to prompt him to oppose returning the Canal to Panama after the
year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Drug Addicts Estimated to Spend 18 Mln Dollars Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 1.3 million
Indonesians are drug addicts and believed to be spending about 130
billion rupiah (18.6 million U.S. dollars) on drugs a day, Antara
News Agency Sunday quoted a psychiatrist as saying.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Dr. Dadang Hawari of the University of Indonesia's
Medical Faculty said if Indonesia successfully coped with drug
addicts and traffickers, it could save around 130 billion rupiah a
day which could be used to develop its human resources.
</P>
<P>
In addition, success in dealing with the illegal drug trade
would lower the drug-related death rate -- which was now 17.1
percent --, prevent new cases of lung disease among drug addicts
-- which was now 53.5 percent --, and help check the spread of
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He proposed the government form a special body like the U.S.
Drugs Enforcement Agency to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Security personnel found guilty of trafficking in and abusing
drugs must soon be dealt with according to law to make the
anti-drug campaign effective, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The operational and welfare budget for police personnel should
be raised to enable them to perform their duties in dealing with
drug addicts and traffickers," he added.

BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The first non-governmental
environmental protection organization in Beijing has opened the
first hotline in the city to offer information and legal aid to
victims of pollution.

<HEADLINE> Brown Ready to Quit at End of Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Craig Brown has announced that
he intends to stand down as coach if Scotland fails to qualify for
the 2002 World Cup finals in Japan and Korea.
</P>
<P>
Brown's current contract with the Scottish Football Association
expires in December 2001 and he plans to move aside then, unless
his employers tempt him with a new deal.
</P>
<P>
The former school teacher, who was appointed national coach in
1993, has come in for heavy criticism following Scotland's failure
to qualify for the European Championship finals in Holland and
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Scotland was defeated 2-1 on aggregate in a play-off with old
foes England, after a dismal first-leg display at Hampden Park
where Kevin Keegan's men ran out 2-0 victors.
</P>
<P>
Some pundits believe that, despite Scotland's heroic 1-0 win in
the second leg at Wembley on Wednesday, now is the right time for
Brown to step down.
</P>
<P>
Brown told the News of the World: "If all things are equal I'll
go at the end of my current contract - if we qualify for the World
Cup finals and I'm invited to stay on, I will.
</P>
<P>
"Anything prior to that would be determined by my employer, the
SFA.
</P>
<P>
"If the international committee was to ask me to stand down I
would say 'thanks - it has been a privilege, an honour and a
delight.'
</P>
<P>
"I've never thought of resigning and I retain the same
enthusiasm for the job."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United kept their
leading place at the English premier league with a hard-fought 2-1
victory over 10-man Derby on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Despite having German defender Stefan Schnoor sent off with
eight minutes left of the first half for a second bookable offence,
Derby refused to give in easily to the visitors.
</P>
<P>
But a goal always looked inevitable and Nicky Butt finally
provided it in the 53rd minute. Andy Cole added the second seven
minutes from the end. There was some late consolation for Derby
with a goal in the final minute by Rory Delap.
</P>
<P>
Second-placed Leeds had equal trouble subduing lowly Bradford 2-
1 and it was the 54th minute before striker Alan Smith put them
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Ian Harte increased the lead through an 80th minute penalty
before there was once again a consolation for the losers when Dean
Windass scored for Bradford in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
Of the leading clubs, only Arsenal won with style as they
thrashed Middlesbrough 5-1 with a hat-trick from Marc Overmars and
two from Dennis Bergkamp. Hamilton Ricard scored for Middlesbrough.
</P>
<P>
The result saw Arsenal move up one place to third, ahead of
Sunderland who were somewhat unlucky to go down 2-0 at home to
Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Sunderland had looked the more likely to score until a splendid
run by England striker Michael Owen who shook off a series of
tackles before chipping the ball into the net in the 63rd minute.
Patrik Berger added the second five minutes from the end.
</P>
<P>
Manchester top the table with 33 points, one ahead of Leeds.
Arsenal are third on 29 with Sunderland on 28.

</P>
<P>
The primary school was built as part of an agreement with China

in poverty-stricken areas all over China.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yongguang, secretary-general of the China Youth Development
Foundation, said, "Coca Cola is one of the most significant
overseas supporters for Project Hope in China. It took an

<HEADLINE> China Invests 34.3 Million Dollars on Tarim River Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to invest 285
million yuan (34.3 million U.S. dollars) in the next five years on
new projects aimed at improving ecological conditions around the
Tarim River, the longest inland river in China.
</P>
<P>
Running a total of 1,321 kilometers, the Tarim River flows
through Xinjiang, China's largest provincial-level autonomous
region with an area of some 1.65 million square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating ecology caused by over-logging in 1970s and
desertification have long been a concern for both state and
regional governments as well as world organizations.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has provided 125 million U.S. dollars in loans
for the last six years to improve the conditions in the area. The
Chinese government recently applied for a new loan of 150 million
dollars from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
According Mao Xiaohui, chief engineer of the Tarim River
Management Bureau, construction is underway of some water projects
which include a reservoir and 23 sluice gates. A computer network
monitoring water data of the river has also been completed and is
operational.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting water projects along the river last month,
Qian Zhengying, former minister of water resources, said that
efforts to improve the ecology in the area are vital to the
sustainable growth of Xinjiang and China's western areas as a
whole.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou To Improve Social Insurance System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, the capital city
of south China's Guangdong Province, will have in place a thorough
social security system by late 2000 covering old-age pensions and
insurance for on-the-job injuries, childbirth, and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The past 12 years of reform has helped the city's social
security system to evolve from simple workplace coverage to a
comprehensive plan.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 730,000 local residents in Guangzhou
currently have old-age pension insurance, one million workers have
unemployment insurance and 670,000 people have childbirth
insurance.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou recently introduced its labor and social security
bureau as part of an effort to unify management of all areas of
coverage. The existing social security system chiefly involves
people with ties to the state-owned enterprises. Most workers in
private enterprises are not as yet covered by the city's insurance
offerings.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou city government has set a 2000-2001 goal for
expanding coverage of social security system, and will place
special emphasis on issuing detailed regulations governing
employees from private enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's International Reserves Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's international
reserves reached 15.12 billion U.S. dollars by Thursday following
a jump of 176 million dollars in one week, the Central Bank said
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The amount was a record high since December 15, 1998, when it
hit 15.15 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the increase (2.8 percent just so far this
month) to the recovery of the oil prices. The prices of the
Venezuelan crude have climbed 20 percent in one month, from 19.40
dollars per barrel in the second week of October to 23.28 dollars
at the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
Reserves rose 718 million dollars in October, or 5.1 percent,
to 14.71 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the end of September, the country's Central Bank saw its
reserves down to 14.00 billion dollars for paying foreign debt
interests.
</P>
<P>
The bank should spend some 4.7 billion dollars this year to
service the foreign debts. The payment accounts for over 20
percent of the government revenue in 1999, and is expected to go
up to 6.8 billion dollars in 2000, equivalent to 24 percent of the
government revenue, according to the Finance Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Faces Davenport in Chase Tennis Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Martina Hingis and Lindsay
Davenport, the top two players in the world, advanced to the final
of the Chase Tennis Championships today with straight-set
victories in New York.
</P>
<P>
Relying on her experience and playing the big points better
than her opponent, Hingis defeated third-ranked Venus Williams 6-4,
7-6 (7-2). Davenport survived a first-set scare to oust No. 6
Nathalie Tauziat of France 7-6 (7-3), 6-0.
</P>
<P>
Hingis defeated then-No. 1 Davenport in four sets in last year'
s
final, but the roles are reversed this year. Hingis comes in
having locked up the year-end top ranking, which Davenport held in
1998, and the 19-year-old from Switzerland played up to that form
today.
</P>
<P>
Williams, a 19-year-old American, was the more spectacular of
the two players, but mixed amongst her powerful serves and
blistering forehands were untimely unforced errors and numerous
missed opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't keep up with her today because of extenuating
circumstances," said Williams, who said her father advised her not
to play because of the injury, a muscle strain near her left
shoulder blade. "There were a lot of points where I was unable to
get my best because I just had to slow down some and I had to
speed it up more at different times."
</P>
<P>
The victory evened the season series between the two at 3-3 and
gave Hingis a 9-5 lifetime edge. Hingis has won all three of the
meetings between the two players in New York, including victories
at the U.S. Open in 1997 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
While the Hingis-Williams battle featured long, exciting and
often spectacular baseline rallies, the Davenport-Tauziat match
was a series of short points, aces and double faults.
</P>
<P>
Tauziat jumped out to a 4-1 lead in the first set. Davenport
rallied to break back and even the set at 4-4, but the 32-year-old
Frenchwoman worked her way to a set point on Davenport's serve in
the 12th game with a volley winner. Facing a second serve with a
chance to take the set, Tauziat mishit the return and the ball
headed into the crowd after barely missing the scoreboard. Tauziat
's chances went with it.
</P>
<P>
Davenport held serve to force a tiebreak and jumped to a 6-1
advantage. Tauziat held on two service points before Davenport
placed a 99 mile per hour ace, her seventh of the match, down the
middle to ice the set. Tauziat lost her racket stretching to reach
the serve and played the second set as if she never retrieved it.
</P>
<P>
Consecutive double faults by Davenport gave Tauziat the first
two points of the second set, but the American then won 15
straight points as Tauziat clearly lost her focus. Tauziat won
only four points --three on double faults -- during the entire 18-
minute set.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who has won a tour-best seven titles this season, will
be appearing in her 13th final of 1999 on Sunday. She has lost her
last two, falling to Williams last month in Zurich, Switzerland
and to Davenport last week in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
Last week's victory over Hingis gave Davenport an 8-7 lead in
the head-to-head series. She has won both meetings this year, also
beating Hingis in the final at Sydney in January.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Davenport, the reigning Wimbledon champion, is
a two-time runner-up at the event, also losing to Gabriela
Sabatini in 1994. She will be seeking her seventh title of the
season.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese doctor has
successfully developed an electromagnetic device which has been
proven effective in narcotic drug rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
The Electromagnetic Drug Rehabilitation Device, created by Wu
Qingmin from Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province,
has already been patented and received an official production
license.
</P>
<P>
Integrating traditional Chinese medicine with electronics, the
machine consists of an electromagnetic treating device and a
computerized controller.
</P>
<P>
The electromagnetic treating device is designed to be attached
to the drug addict's ears which will stimulate acupoints with
electromagnetic waves and help reduce the graving to take drugs.
Clinical tests indicate that therapy generally becomes effective
on an addict within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the new physiotherapy may help reduce a drug
addict's dependence on other medicines after the treatment, a side
effect repeatedly resulting from medicinal therapies.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's President Calls Congress to Pass Budget Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran President Jamil Mahuad
called Saturday on the Congress to approve the government budget
for next year, as a measure to resolve the country's financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad said in his Saturday radio speech that the lack of
approval of the budget has contributed to the rapid devaluation of
the country's currency, the sucre, against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The delay to pass the budget law prevents the implementation of
financial agreements signed with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the application of the government economic program.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad described the economic situation of the country as "very
critical at this moment."
</P>
<P>
It is important that the budget be approved at moments in which
the deadline in the Congress arrives, added Mahuad. The Congress
has scheduled for next week the debate over the budget.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Ecuaodor increased Friday the banking rate
of interest from 63 percent to 83 percent, the third increase in
the week.
</P>
<P>
The sucre value against the dollar has dropped 142 percent in
the first 10 months of this year, and on Friday it was quoted at
20,000 units for a U.S. dollar.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema
and United States President Bill Clinton opened a talk in Italy's
central city of Florence Saturday evening on the opening day of a
summit conference entitled "Progressive Governance in the XXI
Century".
</P>
<P>
Also attending the parley of progressive leaders looking to
what has been labeled the "third way" of government between the
traditional concepts of free-market liberalism and socialism are

Gerhard Schroeder and Brazilian President Fernando Enrique
Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, the meeting between

Italian Air Force base in Pisa, after the flight from Athens,
where Clinton was on official visit.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Italian premier met Cardoso, a former
left-wing sociologist who has governed Brazil with neo-liberal
policies for the last six years.
</P>
<P>
He is the only representative of the developing world invited
to the weekend of talks.
</P>
<P>
After his talk with Clinton, D'Alema hosted a dinner organized
by New York University at Villa La Pietra in Florence.

Outside, a crowd of about 5,000 peaceful demonstrators marched
under banners proclaiming, "Progressive Governors Go Home",
"Yankee Go Home", "Merchants of Death", "God Hates World
Exploitation".
</P>
<P>
Under the watchful eyes of some 200 policemen deployed along
the route, demonstrators of all ages, men and women, babies in
strollers, filed through the center of Florence.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Economy and Finances
Ministry and the Panama Canal Administration started to record the
value of the Canal assets with the purpose of guaranteeing their
profitability.
</P>
<P>
Economy and Finances Minister Victor Juliao said on Saturday
that the registering of the Canal assets includes land, building,
equipment, and other properties that must be mandatorily
registered and assessed.
</P>
<P>
Juliao said that the three floodgates (Miraflores, Pedro Miguel
and Gatun), the administrative buildings, and the dams stand out
among the main assets of the Canal.
</P>
<P>
Canal administrator Alberto Aleman Zubieta said that all the
operating areas of the Canal are part of the patrimony and are
inalienable, because the Panamanian people is the owner of the
interoceanic waterway and this cannot be transferred or sold.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Canal will be more dependable with the
increase of security measures, the strengthening of the logistics
system and modern transportation.
</P>
<P>
According to the books, the assets of the waterway, traversed
every year by 4,000 ships, are worth about one billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Spacecraft Blasts Off Into Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUQUAN (Gansu), November 21 (Xinhua) -- On the early morning
of November 20, thousands of people were gathering around the
Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, holding their breath awaiting the
launch of "Shenzhou", China's first experimental spaceship.
</P>
<P>
The carrier rocket, with the spacecraft on board, stood still
at the 100-meter-plus launching pad. Four Chinese characters,
meaning "China Aerospace", were borne on the white rocket, while
the spacecraft was painted with two Chinese national flags on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
Both the rocket and the spaceship are designed and manufactured
by Chinese independently.
</P>
<P>
At 6:30 (Beijing Time), there came the order to ignite the
rocket. The rocket roared, rocking the ground and unleashing huge
flames, and shortly afterwards, blasted off into the sky, amid
loud applause and cheers of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes later, the vehicle detached from the rocket and
began its space voyage. As the spaceship gradually disappeared
from the sight, celebrations were still going on at the launching
site, with numerous fireworks cracking.
</P>
<P>
The successful launch of the Shenzhou has fulfilled a long-
cherished dream of the Chinese people who, generation after
generation, have been fancied by sky-flight stories. As early as
500 years ago, Chinese test-fired rockets into the sky in an
attempt to realize the dream.
</P>
<P>
On April 12, 1961, the former Soviet Union astronaut Yuri
Gagalin made the first space tour. Since then dozens of spacecraft
have been sent into the space, some of them were manned.
</P>
<P>
Local scientists hailed the first spaceflight a historic
breakthrough for China's space industry, noting that launching
space vehicles needs the most sophisticated technology and is a
comprehensive demonstration of a country's political, economic,
scientific and technological strength.
</P>
<P>
China set up its space industry in the 1950s and since then,
the Chinese have been able to send and recover satellites, launch
several satellites with one rocket, fire rockets driven by high-
performance and low-temperature fuel, master the technology of
launching and monitoring earth-synchronous satellites, and cluster-
rocket launching technology.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China also has developed the capabilities of
launching low-earth satellite, solar-synchronous satellite and
earth-synchronous satellite, which have laid a solid foundation
for the country to loft its spacecraft into orbit.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, China decided to jump-start the manned spacecraft
program and thousands of Chinese scientists from hundreds of units
have since been involved. Their hard work has resulted in today's
success.
</P>
<P>
As a Chinese scientist puts it, "the Chinese people are capable
of developing world-class technology independently and making
greater contribution to the world's high technology industry and
mankind."

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-four long duration seisms
and six volcano-tectonic movements were registered in the last two
days in the Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador's Geophysical Institute of
the National Polytechnical School (IGEPN) said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
There were also 64 explosions, and of these the most powerful
occurred Thursday afternoon and Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The emission of ashes was continuous, according to the reports.
A thin layer of volcanic ashes, half a millimeter deep, covered the
city of Banos, located on the slopes of the Tungurahua volcano,
and the ashes layer was two millimeters deep in the sector of
Runtun, close to the volcano.
</P>
<P>
Tangurahua, or "Throat of Fire" in the Quechua Indian language,
is some 169 kilometers south of the capital city of Quito. It
towers 5,016 meters above sea level and is one of Ecuador's 31
active volcanos. Tangurahua has erupted 81 times in the past
3,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IGEPN registered 595 long period seisms, 313
events of hybrids, and 29 signals of dropping of rocks in the
Guagua Pichincha volcano, 12 kilometers away from Quito. The 4,877
meter-high volcan's name means "Chile Pichincha" in the native
Quechua Indian language.
</P>
<P>
The IGEPN monitoring report said that there was a new eruption
Thursday night, with a reduced displacement of 18 square
centimeters.
</P>
<P>
This event spewed a column of ashes and water steam that
reached a height of 9,000 meters, and covered the sky over the
city of Quito. The noise and the smell of sulphur were very strong
during the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The Volcanologists said that there will be bigger eruptions in
the next days in the Guagua Pichincha and the Tungurahua, two of
the more than 60 volcanos located in Ecuador.
