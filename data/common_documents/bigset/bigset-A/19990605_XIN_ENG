<HEADLINE> Emergency Operation to Feed 1.2 mln Ethiopians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) has approved a 40.5-million-U.S. dollar emergency operation
to feed the nearly 1.2 million people desperately in need of food
in eight drought-stricken regions in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
In a news release issued here Friday, WFP said farmers in some
regions in Ethiopia had been hurt by an extended dry spell in the
rainy season ended in May, which hindered crop planting,
germination and growth.
</P>
<P>
Because of the deteriorating food situation, WFP said, many
farmers had been forced to sell their oxen and other livestock.
</P>
<P>
"WFP has been very concerned about this problems," said Judith
Lewis, WFP country representative for Ethiopia who is in Rome to
finalize the emergency operational document. "We are acting now
to prevent a potentially major humanitarian crisis."
</P>
<P>
The emergency operation running from June through December, the
release said, would provide some 103,253 tons of emergency food
aid to most vulnerable sectors of the population, namely pregnant
and nursing mothers, children under five, the disabled and
elderly.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that an increased numbers of destitute people,
particularly women and children have been forced to beg for food
and money.
</P>
<P>
"There are no crops and no animals. The people have sold
everything in an effort to survive," said Catherine Feeney, a WFP
program officer who joined an assessment team that visited the
worst affected areas in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the people we saw just pointed in despair to the land
they had prepared for planting, which was dry and cracked,"
Feeney said. "For those who had planted, the shoots had barely
started to poke out the ground, and there was no chance they
would germinate."
</P>
<P>
WFP is the United Nations front -line agency in the fight
against global hunger. In 1998, its relief workers fed 75 million
people, including most of the world's refugees.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Continue With Peace-keeping Duties: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said Friday that his country will continue to fulfill its
international peace- keeping and peace-making obligations under
the auspices of the Southern African Development Community (SADC),
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of Zimbabwe's important international duties
whose main objective and strong wish are to seek solutions to
armed conflicts whenever and where ever they occur on the African
continent, especially in the SADC region," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who was officially commissioning 64 officer cadets at
the Zimbabwe Military Academy, said that Zimbabwe's interests and
those of its neighboring countries are inextricably linked.
</P>
<P>
"Collaboration and cooperation among nations of our region have
become extremely essential because of the problems we are facing
which have become more intricate than before," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted it is also important that the defense forces of the
different nationalities harness their resources and experiences in
seeking better solutions to common challenges facing the region
like the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Mugabe pointed out that it is in Zimbabwe's interest to pursue
a defense policy which contributes to sustainable socio-economic
development in the region.
</P>
<P>
"It is in this framework that the DRC should therefore create
and guarantee a conducive atmosphere for the country's peace and
stability," he said. "The smooth pursuit and implementation of
socio-economic development strategies can only be realized in an
atmosphere of non-interference."
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope the the on-going military and diplomatic
efforts aimed at restoring peace in the DRC and Angola would
culminate in a permanent solution to the current crisis in the
Great Lakes region.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Bans Belgium's Livestock Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch government said on
Friday that it has banned imports of Belgian livestock in order to
prevent animals that might be infected from being slaughtered in
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the ban was made by Minister of Health, Welfare
and Sport Els Borst and State Secretary of Agriculture, Nature
Management and Fisheries Geke Faber, the government said in a
press release.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) also took a further step to stop
chicken, pork and beef products from being contaminated by high
levels of a cancer-causing chemical, dioxin, following a ban by
Belgium of chicken- and egg-based foods from more than 400 farms
due to excessively high levels of the toxic pollutant.
</P>
<P>
The food-poisoning scandal spread to Belgian pigs on Thursday
and the U.S. agriculture authorities announced a temporary ban on
all imports of chicken and pork originating from EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch government said it took the measure because reports
about the "Belgian dioxin affairs were becoming ever more
confusing and alarming".
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the Lower House in the Hague, Faber said that
official toxicological investigation of suspect animal feed
samples has shown that "the dioxin levels found are comparable
with the levels found under normal circumstances".
</P>
<P>
"Further investigations are in progress. No decisions will be
taken about the lifting of the ban from the farms, companies and
products concerned until all results are in," he added.

WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton announced Friday that she will form an exploratory
committee in July to prepare for a possible campaign for a Senate
seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to open an exploratory committee in July," she said
in an interview on ABC's "Good Morning America". "And then I'll
spend some time - a lot of time - in New York listening to people
and I'm looking forward to that."
</P>
<P>
Earlier her aides have repeatedly disclosed on several
occasions that she was interested in a Senate seat from New York
being vacated next year by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
Formation of an exploratory committee will allow Hillary to
begin raising money for the Senate race and will be seen in
political circles as tantamount to a declaration of candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Hillary will become the first first lady to run for public
office in the U.S. history. It is a race that could pit her
against the Republican mayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
Giuliani said though "exploring New York is a good thing", the
first lady has never lived in New York.
</P>
<P>
"I should say though, I have supreme confidence that the next
senator from New York will be someone from the state of New York,"
the mayor said.

<P>
NICOSIA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides Friday left for China on a six-day state visit at the
invitation of the President of the People's Republic of China,
Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot President is accompanied by Ministers of Foreign
Affairs, Finance and Commerce and some businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said on his departure that during the visit he will

In an interview with Xinhua correspondent in Nicosia ahead of

our relationship with China and to the further growth of ties," in
view of the international status and the constructive and active
role China plays today in world affairs.
</P>

China and Cyprus established diplomatic ties in September
1971 after the People's Republic of China restored its seat
in the U.N.. In June 1997 the Foreign Ministries of the two
countries signed a Protocol of Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said there is ample ground for the further development
of relations, due to the longstanding friendship between the two
countries, their determination to promote them further and the
close identity of their positions on major international and
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation for China's "principled and
constructive position" on the Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> Last Major Relief Food Arrives in Somalia Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) announced Friday the arrival in Merca of the last shipment
of relief food for drought-striken southern Somalia before the
onset of the monsoon winds, which will prevent boats from docking
due to the rough seas.
</P>
<P>
The WFP-chartered vessel is the first direct aid shipment from
Europe to Somalia since 1995. The ship, which sailed from France,
is carrying 5,000 metric tons of maize.
</P>
<P>
The food, to be distributed over the next four months, will
tide people over until the harvest in August and support
rehabilitation and social services.
</P>
<P>
The strong monsoon winds last from early June to Mid September,
during which time ships cannot dock or off-load cargo onto barges
because the seas are too high and rough.
</P>
<P>
Since the closure of Mogadishu seaport in 1994, WFP has been
forces to use the northern beach port of El Ma'an as well as
Merca, which lies 100 kms south of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Last year, WFP delivered over 15,000 tons fo relief food into
Somalia through Merca and El Ma'an in order to feed more than a
million southern Somalis.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the south of the country was especially hard hit,
first by devastating floods and later by a drought which caused
large population movements.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz arrived in Cairo Friday to discuss with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on the Mideast peace process and ways of
promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah flew in from Amman, Jordan, on a two-day visit. He
began talks with Mubarak right after his arrival, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the sixth leg of a tour which has taken the Saudi
crown prince to South Africa, Italy, Morocco, Libya, Syria and
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif, told reporters
that the prince's visit will offer a chance for consultations on
the future of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
El-Sherif lauded the strong and close relations between the
leaders and peoples of Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah is trying to coordinate Arab stands to resume peace
negotiations between a new Israeli government under Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak and Israel's Arab neighbors, namely
Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan, the only two Arab states which have conceived
peace with Israel, are trying to revive the peace talks, which
were deadlocked under Barak's right-wing predecessor, Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Abdullah
and Egyptian leaders would exchange views "on what the Arab world
will be subjected to and the future of the peace process which we
all believe should be fair and balanced."
</P>
<P>
The talks would also focus on "Arab cooperation in the areas of
security and economy and fortifying ties among Arabs," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Prince Abdullah recently stressed that no regional settlement
can be achieved without a solution to the Palestinian cause, the
core of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem
must be returned to the Arab fold. Israel captured the eastern
sector of Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East War.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Balkans envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin on Friday denied statements by some politicians that
his mediation efforts in the Kosovo conflict have been
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
"There were two options -- either to stop the war by political
methods or to fight; to put on our greatcoats and march ahead. I
don't think that was the option the Russian people needed," the
Interfax news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying.
</P>
<P>
"In effect, Russia has been the only one to lead this
negotiation process, and if we achieve an end to the bombings, it
will be a success," the envoy said.
</P>
<P>
He said Belgrade is due to start talks with NATO on Saturday
and "after they sign a document the bombings will stop."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, who talked with envoys of the European Union and
the United States and paid four visits to Belgrade since NATO
launched its air strikes on Yugoslavia 72 days ago, said he and
his mission "have carried out all the directives and instructions
by the president of the Russian Federation."
</P>
<P>
"Of course, one may wish more had been achieved, but the main
thing is that the sovereignty of Yugoslavia has been preserved and
that the legal basis has been laid. The resolution of the Kosovo
crisis has been placed under the aegis of the U.N.," Chernomyrdin
said.

Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) killed 20 innocent civilians
in Tchindjenji town of central Huambo Province during May 27 and
28, an Angolan military source said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified source said that some 500 UNITA troops, with
the help of artillery, attacked and occupied the town on May 28,
which is 180 kilometers west of the provincial capital of Huambo.

<P>
The rebel troops destroyed some 46 houses and took away 180
head of livestock, the source added.

attacks against the UNITA forces and drove them out of the town,
killing six rebel fighters and seizing a lot of weapons, according
to the military source.
</P>

Though the situation in the town has basically become normal,
the shocked residents are still fleeing to other places.
</P>
<P>
Huambo City and its surrounding areas are among the places with
the most fierce fightings.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA troops had attacked and occupied Tchindjenji just in
order to cut the road traffic between the town and Benguela
Province, the source pointed out.
</P>

From late May to early this month, the Angolan government
troops launched a series of counter-attacks around Huambo City,

NICOSIA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
said Friday that the points of the peace plan which the Yugoslav
government has accepted are identical to what the Cyprus has said
at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government on Thursday accepted the Western-backed

Clerides pointed out that the return of the refugees under
conditions of safety is also a demand of Cyprus government, for
the refugees in Cyprus, displaced since the 1974 war which divided
the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
As far as the issue of self-administration is concerned,
Clerides explained that the acceptance of a bizonal, bicommunal
federation in Cyprus signifies that the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot communities will enjoy this right.
</P>
<P>
He said the stationing of an international force has always
been one of Cyprus government's fundamental demands, a force
with a U.N. Security Council mandate.

WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- NATO could end its bombing of
Yugoslavia as soon as Sunday if Serb military authorities
cooperate with the alliance's plan for the withdrawal of Serb
troops from Kosovo, the Pentagon announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
"If Serbia cooperates, the bombing could be halted by the end
of the weekend or very early next week," spokesman Kenneth Bacon
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that if the Serbs hesitate in accepting NATO's
terms for withdrawing their forces from Kosovo, the bombing could
continue many more days.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said NATO and Serb military authorities are scheduled to
meet Saturday morning at a location he would not disclose to work
out how Serb troops can leave Kosovo under the timetable laid out
in the peace proposal accepted by Belgrade on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The timetable calls for all 40,000 troops to be out within
seven days, an AP report said.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton said earlier Friday that "I am anxious to end
the bombing" against Yugoslavia but not until NATO has proof that
Slobodan Milosevic is complying with the alliance's terms.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Stresses Importance of Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Friday stressed the importance of primary education in enhancing
the quality of the work force.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks when addressing a rally in the
central district of Nakasongola Friday afternoon, a press release
from the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that the Ugandan government has launched the
Universal Primary Education program in order to vocationalize and
intellectualize a large section of the Ugandan population.
</P>
<P>
Education for children is a necessary step in the
transformation of the east African country, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Uganda launched the education program in early 1997. It
provides free primary education for four children of each family.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Uganda's primary school enrolment has reached 5.4
million pupils, more than doubling the figure before 1997.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, the president also talked about
poverty-eliminating projects and a revolving fund aimed at
increasing farmers' homestead incomes.
</P>
<P>
Nakasongola is famous for cattle grazing in Uganda. It is part
of the famous "cattle corridor".

<HEADLINE> SADC to Train Lesotho Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The program will be jointly conducted by the South African
National Defense Force and the Botswana Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
The training follows the military intervention by the two
countries. South African and Botswana troops entered Lesotho last
September under the auspices of the SADC as Lesotho became
ungovernable following disputes over the results of the general
election in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The troops pulled out of the country in mid-May this year.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the training program was announced after lengthy
talks in Maseru Friday among representatives of the Botswana,
Lesotho and South African defense forces.
</P>
<P>
Present at the talks were South Africa's Major General Ashwin
Hurribunce, chief of joint training, Botswana's Lieutenant
Colonel Gaseikanngwe Peke, Lesothos's commander Lieutenant General
Makhula Mosakeng, and other senior officers of the three armies.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the start of the training program, Hurribunce said
the aim of Friday's talks was to obtain Lesotho Defense Forces'
approval for the training plan which was drafted by the Lesotho
army.
</P>
<P>
Hurribunce said: "We are not here to train the LDF (Lesotho
Defense Forces) to do battle. That they already have. What we are
here to do is to ensure that within their training framework they
acquire the functional competence of being a soldier
professionally and militarily."
</P>
<P>
Peke said the program would be conducted in three stages to be
completed in May next year.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the participation of the Zimbabwean Defense Force,
Mosakeng said the Zimbabwean instructors would act in an advisory
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe the training would be to the best advantage
of Lesotho as the army had been crippled by divisions since
independence.
</P>
<P>
At present 50 army officers are facing trial for alleged mutiny
 in Lesotho arising from the country's political crisis in
September last year.

<HEADLINE> Seven Parties Question Results of S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Seven opposition political
parties in South Africa Friday said they had suspicion about the
results of Wednesday' s election and wanted the count
independently verified.
</P>
<P>
They requested to verify the results of all 14,650 polling
stations countrywide, election officials confirmed an earlier
report.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Independent Electoral Commission, the parties
said they were concerned about the manner in which results are
being received and verified.
</P>
<P>
"Our beautiful ideal of a free and fair election may be harmed
by unnecessary suspicion and uncertainty about the correctness of
the results," said the letter, signed by the Freedom Front, the
Inkatha Freedom Party, the Afrikaner Eenheidsbeweging, the Federal
Alliance, the United Democratic Movement, the Democratic Party,
and the New National Party.
</P>
<P>
Freedom Front's Gauteng leader Joseph Chiole, who represents
the group said in remarks published earlier by South African Press
Association (SAPA) that the parties' concerns included conflicting
statements by the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) on the
number of outstanding votes, which ranged from 20 to 2,000 polling
stations.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, they claimed that a number of result sheets, which
were completed at each polling station, had not been signed by
political party agents as prescribed, while others, which were
faxed through, were difficult to read.
</P>
<P>
The parties were also concerned about the fact that some
polling stations had reported voting percentages of up to 300
percent.
</P>
<P>
They therefore requested copies of the results sheets of all
polling stations, for independent verification.
</P>
<P>
Chiole said the parties would lodge a complaint should their
request not be adhered to, but added that Bam had responded
positively.
</P>
<P>
He said the parties did not foresee any problems serious enough
to warrant the lodging of an official dispute.
</P>
<P>
An IEC official said it had been agreed that the results sheets
would be made available to all political parties via computers at
the IEC results center in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) earlier in the day also
questioned the accuracy of the preliminary count, saying it would
consult other parties on the possibility of pressing for the
election results to be declared invalid.
</P>
<P>
IEC spokesman Victor Dlamini said the IEC had not received any
notice from the PAC by Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
South Africans went to the polls Wednesday to elect their
second democratic government. The African National Congress (ANC)
garnered most of the votes according to early results made public
by the IEC.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program (WFP)
announced here Friday the arrival of the last shipment of relief
food for drought- stricken southern Somalia at Merca port, 100
kilometers south of Somali capital Mogadishu, before the onset of
the monsoon winds.
</P>
<P>
The WFP Nairobi Office said in a news release that the
WFP-chartered vessel, MV Gimo 1, is the first direct aid shipment
from Europe to Somalia since 1995. The ship sailed from France
is carrying 5,000 tons of maize.
</P>
<P>
The relief food, a donation to WFP by the European Union, will
feed nearly half a million people suffering from a recent drought
in southern Somalia. The food, to be distributed over the next
four months.
</P>
<P>
According to WFP, the strong monsoon winds will last from early
June to mid September, during which time ships can not dock or
off-load cargo onto barges because the seas are to high and
rough.
</P>
<P>
Hayes said hundred of Somali workers were involved in the
ship's discharge, which is expected to take eight days, if
weather permitting.
</P>
<P>
The release noted that last year, WFP delivered over 150,000
tons of relief food into Somalia through the port of Merca and El
Ma'an for feeding more than one million southern Somalis, because
the south of Somalia was especially hard hit first by devastating
floods and later by a drought.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hails Belgrade Acceptance of Kosovo Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday extended his welcome to the Belgrade move to accept
an international peace plan on Kosovo, saying that the United
Nations is "proceeding at full speed with its planning" to prepare
for peace and humanitarian work in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here on Friday morning, Annan said, "I
welcome the news of the breakthrough agreement reached in Belgrade
yesterday," and he voiced his "warmest congratulations" on the
efforts by Finnish President Martti Astisaari, the European
Union's Kosovo envoy, and the Russian special envoy for the
Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
"Though many details of the agreement remain to be defined, we
understand that intensive work has begun on a Security Council
resolution to put the accord into effect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia Thursday accepted an international peace plan
hammered out by Russia and seven Western powers to solve the
Kosovo crisis, which broke out in February last year after ethnic
Albanians have been fighting with Serbs.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations, which has been active in preparing for
peace, is proceeding at full speed with its planning. so that it
can assume the responsibility the Security Council may wish to
entrust to it, particularly in the civilian field," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The 185-nation United Nations has been long sidelined by the
U.S.-led NATO on the settlement of the Kosovo crisis. Beginning
March 24, NATO, without the authorisation of the the Security
Council, unilaterally launched air strikes on Yugoslavia, a
sovereign and independent member of the U.N. family, thus
violating the U.N. Charter and international law.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter, the Security Council has primary
responsibility for maintaining peace and security in the world at
large.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is mainly focusing on the efforts to render
humanitarian operations to help nearly 1 million Kosovo refugees,
most who fled to neighboring countries since the beginning of the
on-going air strikes more than two months ago.
</P>
<P>
"I have always believed that the only meaningful victory for
the international community at the end of this tragic crisis will
be one which permits the refugees and displaced persons to return
to their homes in safety and dignity," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Annan has asked his two special envoys, Carl Bildt
and Eduard Kukan to "convene a meeting in Geneva fo all United
Nations agencies and other organizations likely to be involved in
post-conflict activities in Kosovo, in order to review the status
of our plans for a collective response to this humanitarian and
political challenge," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The peace plan includes the recognition of the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, and the U.N. role in the
future peacekeeping operations in Kosovo. However, the U.S.-led,
while keeping on air strikes, remains very tough in its demands to
stay at the core of the international military presence in Kosovo.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday lauded "the positive and peaceful atmosphere" in
just-concluded South African elections, and extend his "warm
congratulations" to President-elect Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued via his spokesman, said, "The
Secretary-General would like to commend the Government and people
of South Africa for the exemplary manner in which they have
conducted the second democratic elections of their country."
</P>
<P>
"He lauds the positive and peaceful atmosphere in which the
elections were conducted and the robust participation of South
Africans in the democratic process," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"He commends all the political parties and their supporters for
helping to consolidate the historic, democratic and non-racial
elections of 1994 which were pivotal to the transformation of
South Africa into a democratic society based on equality, respect
and opportunity for all of its people," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General would like to extend his warm
congratulations to President-elect, Mr. Thabo Mbeki, the African
National Congress (ANC) and the people of South Africa and to
assure them that the United Nations, which supported the struggle
of a non-racial society with equality for all, will spare no
effort to support South Africa as it continues to consolidate its
domestic and development achievements," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"He takes this opportunity also to express his abiding
admiration and respect for President Nelson Mandela, whose place
in the history of South Africa is self-evident," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
The ruling ANC roared towards a whopping two-thirds majority in
South Africa's second all-race election on Thursday, and the
victory ensured that party president Mbeki, Mandela's deputy
during the first five years of democratic rule, would take over as
president on June 16.

LOS ANGELES, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Trade with China is a
cornerstone of stable ties between China and the United States,
said a U.S. business organization in a statement Thursday,
supporting President Clinton's announcement on extending China's
normal trade relations (NTR).
</P>
<P>
Referring to the announcement, the statement said that "it is
the right thing to do, and a vital step toward normalizing our
economic relationship with China."
</P>
<P>
The statement was signed by Philip M. Condit, Chairman of CEO
of the Boeing Company and Chairman of Task Force on International
Trade and Investment of the Business Roudtable, a business
organization composed of CEOs from more than 200 leading U.S.
companies in manufacturing, banking, retailing, insurance,
transportation and communications.
</P>
<P>
"The Business Roundtable is pleased that President Clinton is
extending normal trade relations status for China," the statement
said. "Trade with China is a cornerstone of a stable U.S.-China
relationship and presents Americans with unprecedented
opportunities with the world's most populous country."
</P>
<P>
Renewing NTR is important, the statement added, but it is also
critical to press forward to resolve the remaining trade issues
between the two countries so as to achieve the objectives of
China's admission into the World Trade Organization (WTO) and
permanent NTR status.
</P>
<P>
"Achieving these objectives this year will help assure U.S.
competitiveness in the new millennium," the statement said. "NTR
for China not only sustains hundreds of thousands of export- and
import-related jobs, but it also supports U.S. companies operating
in China."

<HEADLINE> Emergency Operation to Feed 1.2 mln Ethiopians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) has approved a 40.5-million-U.S. dollar emergency operation
to feed the nearly 1.2 million people desperately in need of food
in eight drought-stricken regions in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
In a news release issued here Friday, WFP said farmers in some
regions in Ethiopia had been hurt by an extended dry spell in the
rainy season ended in May, which hindered crop planting,
germination and growth.
</P>
<P>
Because of the deteriorating food situation, WFP said, many
farmers had been forced to sell their oxen and other livestock.
</P>
<P>
"WFP has been very concerned about this problems," said Judith
Lewis, WFP country representative for Ethiopia who is in Rome to
finalize the emergency operational document. "We are acting now
to prevent a potentially major humanitarian crisis."
</P>
<P>
The emergency operation running from June through December, the
release said, would provide some 103,253 tons of emergency food
aid to most vulnerable sectors of the population, namely pregnant
and nursing mothers, children under five, the disabled and
elderly.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that an increased numbers of destitute people,
particularly women and children have been forced to beg for food
and money.
</P>
<P>
"There are no crops and no animals. The people have sold
everything in an effort to survive," said Catherine Feeney, a WFP
program officer who joined an assessment team that visited the
worst affected areas in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the people we saw just pointed in despair to the land
they had prepared for planting, which was dry and cracked,"
Feeney said. "For those who had planted, the shoots had barely
started to poke out the ground, and there was no chance they
would germinate."
</P>
<P>
WFP is the United Nations front -line agency in the fight
against global hunger. In 1998, its relief workers fed 75 million
people, including most of the world's refugees.

<HEADLINE> Russian, U.S. Leaders Discuss Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin and U.S. Vice President Al Gore had a telephone
conversation Friday, discussing Kosovo and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
It was Gore who placed the call to Stepashin, who was attending
a meeting in the Belarussian capital of Minsk, the Interfax news
agency quoted Russian government information department's
Alexander Mikhailov as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It was emphasized in the discussion that Russia's approval of
the agreements on the Balkans was a hard decision," Mikhailov
said.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo peace plan accepted Thursday by Yugoslavia was seen
by some at home as a near total capitulation on the part of
Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin. The Russian public and
politicians have been frustrated by his failure to win substantial
concessions from NATO.
</P>
<P>
"Russia accepted it aiming to promptly halt the bombing of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and to immediately put an end to
the growth of humanitarian catastrophe," Mikhailov said.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin sees the common objective of the G-8 countries,
primarily the United States and Russia "in terminating the
airstrikes at once, in jointly drawing up a U.N. Security Council
resolution and in working out plans for restoring the Yugoslav
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed bilateral ties and Russia's
relations with international financial organizations, Mikhailov
said.
</P>
<P>
Despite denials of reported differences within the Russian
delegation to Belgrade on the Kosovo peace mission, Russian
military officials are voicing their criticism of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Leonid Ivashov, a general in charge of the Russian military's
foreign contacts and was a member to the Belgrade talks, said
Friday that the peace plan contains a number of provisions that
threaten the sovereignty of the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
He said in Minsk, Belarus, that the rapid withdrawal of all
Yugoslav military and police forces from Kosovo could result "in a
power vacuum in Kosovo that might be filled by the Kosovo
Liberation Army, threatening the lives of the 250,000 Serbs
there."
</P>
<P>
According to Ivashov, the peace plan makes Russia dependent "on
the good or ill will of NATO," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav General Staff will have to conclude an agreement
with NATO under which the alliance will decide whether Russia is
to be involved in Kosovo or not, Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said that NATO and
Russia will discuss a detailed plan and formula for Russia's
participation in a future international peacekeeping force in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said the alliance will try to be as flexible as possible and
that NATO had no plans to monopolize the force and just wanted its
troops to form the nucleus of the contingent.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Russia's First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander
Avdeyev told journalists Friday after a closed meeting with State
Duma deputies that "plans on the size and form of deployment are
still unavailable."
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the main question, the bombing of Yugoslavia,
has not yet been solved.
</P>
<P>
"We should have done everything so that the bombing would have
ceased yesterday or today," Interfax quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Avdeyev noted that NATO's "interpretation (in the reached
accords) remain somewhat muddled," enabling the alliance to
continue its bombing of Yugoslavia "for several days to come."
</P>
<P>
He said Russia should act more effectively, if the Balkan
conflict is to be settled.
</P>
<P>
Avdeyev said the most important thing now is to work out a
mechanism so that "the implementation of decisions still leave
Russia with a chance to control the situation" rather than give
NATO an edge on the issue.

Zhu made the remarks during comments on U.S. President Bill
Clinton's announcement about renewing the annual normal trade
relations with China. The Chinese have taken note of President
Clinton's announcement, Zhu said, explaining that normalized trade
relations really mean reciprocal and mutual trade arrangements on
an equal footing agreed upon by both sides.
</P>
<P>
This is the basis for normal economic and trade exchanges
between the two countries, he said, and something that is in both
countries' interests and that is the aspiration of the people of
both countries.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Jordan Relinked by Arab Sat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The communication services and
television and radio transmission between Iraq and Jordan via Arab
Sat (satellite) system has been restored, the Iraqi Ministry of
Transport and Communications announced.
</P>
<P>
Communications via Arab Sat with other Arab countries would be
restored sequently, Transport and Communications Undersecretary
Jamil Ibrahim was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's communications systems were heavily bombed by the
U.S.-led allied forces in the 1991 Gulf War, and its links with
other Arab countries via satellites have come to a halt since then.
</P>
<P>
The services would enable Iraq to exchange TV programs with
other Arab countries and to facilitate the transmission of Iraqi
satellite TV programs via the three Arab satellites which can
cover Arab countries and other states.
</P>
<P>
Iraq can also use Arab Sat for direct telephone communications
with Arab countries, Ibrahim added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Repeats Platitude on Kosovo Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on Friday
harped on his platitude about the settlement of the Kosovo crisis,
saying that bombing against Yugoslavia could only wind up only
after President Slobodan Milosevic complies with NATO demands.
</P>
<P>
"I'm anxious to end bombing but I want to know that our
objectives have been achieved," Clinton said in an interview on
ABC's "Good Morning America."
</P>
<P>
He said what he wanted to know was Yugoslavia's forces was
withdrawing from Kosovo and a timetable for the NATO troops to
enter the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Until then, "I think it's important that we continue the
military action against the military targets" of Yugoslavia, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the administration said the vanguard of American
troops is prepared to move into Kosovo "within days" alongside
their heavily armed NATO allies after verifying a Yugoslav
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"there will be a military-to-military relationship established,
at least for the purpose of going over the details and the
mechanics and logistics of what would need to be worked out in the
event that there is intent to fully comply with this," Defense
Secretary William Cohen told reporters at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
And Clinton's National Security Adviser Sandy Berger demanded a
rapid timetable for the withdrawal of the Yugoslav troops.
</P>
<P>
In a interview on ABC's "Nightline" program, Berger demanded
Milosevic to unplug his air defense system within 48 hours and
pull out his troops from Kosovo in seven days.
</P>
<P>
While still showing its tough position on Kosovo, the Clinton
administration is desperately seeking a political settlement for
the crisis to deflect criticism for failure of over 70 days of
bombing and avoid possible division among its allies.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott planned to meet
other architects of the peace plan on Friday in Helsinki,
Finland.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Falls to 4.2 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate fell
down to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent in May while the growth of
payroll jobs was the smallest in more than three years, the Labor
Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Department's report said that the unemployment rate did
drop 0.1 percent from 4.3 percent in April, even though the U.S.
manufacturing sector continued to be battered by the world
financial crisis. Factories shed another 45,000 jobs last month,
bringing the total loss in manufacturing jobs to 453,000 since
since March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that while the overall unemployment rate fell
last month, the number of payroll jobs rose by a mere 11,000, the
smallest increase since an outright decline in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, another indicator closely watched for
inflation, average hourly earnings, was up 3.6 percent in May
compared to a year ago, only a slight acceleration from the 3.2
percent increase the month before.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that the low overall unemployment rate also
helped minority groups, who traditionally lag behind in economic
gains. The unemployment rate for blacks fell to a record low of
7.5 percent in May, down from 7.7 percent the previous month. This
was the lowest unemployment level for blacks since the government
began tracking this statistic in 1972, but the rate was still
above the 3.7 percent unemployment rate for whites.
</P>
<P>
The overall gain of 11,000 payroll jobs reflected the fact that
job growth in service industries moderated substantially last
month, increasing by only 71,000, far below the average monthly
gain of 125,000 over the past 12 months.

<HEADLINE> Greece Bans Imports of Belgian Pork </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece has decided to extend a ban
on the imports and sale of Belgian poultry to pork and beef
products.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) quoted an
Agriculture Ministry statement as saying Friday that a ministry
crisis management committee had decided the move as "a preventive
measure," which takes effect as of Friday and is effective for all
imports, distribution and sale of pork or beef from Belgium,
produced after January 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Any such foodstuffs already on the market would be impounded.
</P>
<P>
The emergency measures will be in effect until the meeting of
the permanent EU veterinary committee is held in order to issue
the final decision on the case.
</P>
<P>
The Greek move came in response to the food scare in Europe
concerning the contamination with dioxin of chickens and eggs.

<HEADLINE> UK Sounds Safety Alert for Offshore Oil Valves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain has alerted oil industry and
labour groups about up to 300 potentially faulty values used in
offshore production around the world, a safety watchdog said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Healthy and Safety Executive spokesman Mark Wheeler said 200 to
300 possibly defective ball values had been supplied by a
British-based company to customers in Iran, Norway, Canada, Qatar
and Australia, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
Potential faults came to light following the discovery of
allegedly fraudulent paperwork associated with valves supplied at
a North Sea Norwegian offshore site, he said.
</P>
<P>
The executive was investigating whether there had been
contraventions of a law requiring suppliers to ensure the safety
of their products and to provide accurate safety information to
customers about any equipment sold.
</P>
<P>
Police in the English county of Derbyshire said they were
investigating the alleged creation of false certificates needed for
the safety of valves placed on drilling rigs.
</P>
<P>
"The alleged offender has been interviewed and the inquiry is
continuing," a police spokeswoman was quoted saying.
</P>
<P>
The valves, used in high-temperature, high-pressure
applications such as gas compression, were supplied by a small UK
engineering company and were manufactured between late 1995 and
early 1999.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Admits Gun Control Can Take Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhu) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton vowed
Friday to tighten gun controls, though he admitted it could take
years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who appeared on ABC's "Good Morning America" with 40
teen-agers, said he prefers sweeping restrictions, such as a
mandate that people "register guns like they register cars".
</P>
<P>
Clinton accused "a Republican Congress" of getting "out of
touch with the American people".
</P>
<P>
The president narrowly won Senate passage last month of a
limited bill requiring mandatory background checks for all
transactions at gun shows, then lost a fight to have the House
follow suit before its Memorial Day recess.
</P>
<P>
He said the House delayed a gun vote until after the holiday
recess in order to give the National Rifle Association time to
lobby and water down the legislation.
</P>
<P>
"I made it clear I want to do this in sequence. I think this is
going to take years. The Congress is out of touch with the
American people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has launched a campaign to fight against guns since the
April Colorado school shooting which claimed 15 lives. Earlier
this week, the president ordered a joint investigation by the
Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission of marketing
practices by the motion picture and video game industries to see
if they are targeting children with their violent wares.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Measures Over Dioxin Contamination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- European Commission said here
Friday that it had prepared a draft decision to introduce measures
to prevent all poultry products from being further contaminated
after certain cancer-causing dioxin substance had been found in
chicken feed of some Belgian farms.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) executive said in a statement that the
draft decision was proposed by European Commissioners Franz
Fischler and Emma Borino. "in view of the urgency of the matter,
it is intended to use the legal possibilities available to take
the decision on the basis of the urgent safeguard provisions," the
commission said.
</P>
<P>
"This action has been prompted by the fact that the Belgian
authorities suspect that the dioxin contaminated feed stuff may
have been fed to livestock other than domestic fowl," the
statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive said the same requirement will apply as in the
decision made earlier this week, such as no placing on the market
of products from restricted farms, tracing of products already on
the market, the provision of information to other member states,
certification for export, among other things.
</P>
<P>
The new restricted steps "will therefore be extended to cover
products from the pork and bovine farms which are placed under
control by the Belgian authorities, and will apply to products
coming from these farms since January 15," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The worst food crisis in recent European history broke out a
week ago when chickens on about 400 Belgian farms found to have
been given feed contaminated with highly toxic dioxin, rocking
Prime Minister Jean Luc Dehaene's government two week before an
election and prompting the resignation of Belgium's farm and
health ministers.
</P>
<P>
EU has said it would order the destruction of all chicken, egg,
pork and cattle products from around 1,000 Belgian farms which
used tainted animal feed.
</P>
<P>
The US Agriculture Department announced a temporary ban
Thursday and said it would review all imports fo pork and poultry
products from the EU since January to see if any additional action
was needed. US inspection officials termed the action as a "hold",
rather than an outright ban.

<HEADLINE> Annan Optimistic, But Sees Hard Work Ahead on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday said that he is optimistic that the Kosovo conflict
will come to an end, but he acknowledged that "there's lots of
work for all of us to do."
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters, Annan answered a
press question, saying that "Yes, I am optimistic."
</P>
<P>
"I think we are moving definitely in the right direction and
now, if the peace agreement is confirmed, the real hard work
begins," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks after Belgrade Thursday accepted an
international peace plan hammered out by Russia and seven major
Western nations on the settlement of Kosovo crisis, which broke
out in February last year following ethnic Albanians have been
fighting with Serbs for independence.
</P>
<P>
Annan will be talking with Finnish President Martti Astisaari,
the European Union's Kosovo envoy, on Friday morning. The two U.N.
special envoys for Kosovo, Carl Bildt and Eduard Kukan, will be
meeting with all the U.N. agencies that could be involved in the
implementation in Geneva to discuss their status of planning and
how quickly we can move from here, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is expected to discuss the peace plan
as a draft resolution, which includes the recognition of the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and the U.N.
role in future peacekeeping operations in the Serb province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I would expect the Member States to start perhaps talking
about a Security Council resolution as early as next week," he
said, but he can not give a precise date.
</P>
<P>
"But I suspect it will be heard as early as next week, and
there will be many aspects of the implementation, not just the
military aspect, but there will be the civilian aspects, which
will deal with reconstruction, rehabilitation, the return of the
refugees and the displaced, and also the police training and
monitoring, and the kind of thing," he said. "So there's lots of
work for all of us to do."
</P>
<P>
"I'll have to talk to my colleagues who are handling the
humanitarian aspects," he said, "As you know, a team had been in
Belgrade." The U.N. chief is referring to a 11-day visit to
Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, by a U.N. humanitarian assessment
mission, headed by the U.N. under-secretary-general for
humanitarian affairs, Sergio Vieira de Mello.
</P>
<P>
De Mello is expected to offer a report of proposals for the aid
to Kosovar refugees as early as next week, a U.N. spokesman said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and the Security Council have long been
sidelined by the U.S.-led NATO on the issue of Kosovo. NATO,
without authorisation of the Security Council, unilaterally staged
air strikes on Yugoslavia, violating the U.N. Charter and
international law.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the U.N. chief, representatives of the 15
Security Councils members will begin a retreat Friday, it will
give the members of the Council "a chance to reflect--to reflect,
amongst themselves, and away from the daily chores, the phone
calls -- and discuss how the Council can be made more effective,
how their deliberations can be improved, and how they decide which
issues to get engaged in," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S.-led NATO remains tough on Kosovo after the
Yugoslav Government has announced its acceptance of the peace
plan in a bid to end the bombing and avoid further destruction.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Appreciates Russia's Role in Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
expressed his appreciation on Friday in a diplomatic note to
Russian President Boris Yeltsin for the role Russia has played in
mediating the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The president... has sent a diplomatic note to President
Yeltsin, which articulated his appreciation for the very
constructive role the Russians have played and continue to
play," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also expressed his appreciation "for the importance of
building on a very strong relationship and being able to work
through differences in a positive way that makes our relationship
(with Russia) stronger," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said on Friday that NATO could end its bombing of
Yugoslavia as soon as Sunday if Serb military authorities
cooperate with the alliance's plan for the withdrawal of Serb
troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"If Serbia cooperates, the bombing could be halted by the end
of the weekend or very early next week," spokesman Kenneth Bacon
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, Bacon also warned that if the
Serbs hesitate in accepting NATO's terms for withdrawing their
forces from Kosovo, the bombing could continue many more days.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, President Clinton said that "I am anxious to
end the bombing" against Yugoslavia but not until NATO has proof
that Slobodan Milosevic is complying with the alliance's terms.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said NATO and Serb military authorities are scheduled to
meet Saturday morning at a location he would not disclose to work
out how Serb troops can leave Kosovo under the timetable laid out
in the peace proposal accepted by Belgrade on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The timetable calls for all 40,000 the Serb troops to be out
within seven days and the air defense system to unplug within two
days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the administration said the vanguard of American
peacekeeping troops is prepared to move into Kosovo within days
alongside their heavily armed NATO allies after verifying a
promised Serb withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a military-to-military relationship established,

within days of a peace agreement," Cohen said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Germany Differ on G-8 Ministers Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday said
on Friday Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was ready but
others may not be, to attend a meeting of foreign ministers of the
Group of Eight nations this weekend.
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a meeting at this time scheduled," State
Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Germany said that foreign ministers of the United
States, Russia, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada
would attend the Sunday meeting to approve a draft U.N. Security
Council resolution to resolve the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary is prepared to participate in a meeting, at very
short notice, very quickly, as soon as it can be scheduled, but I
believe the schedule put forward by some is not possible for other
foreign ministers," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally European officials announce a meeting before
there is a meeting," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Albright did intend to travel in Europe next week to
visit several Balkan countries and to meet Kosovar Albanians to
discuss with them the settlement of the Yugoslav-NATO conflict
accepted by Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> African Governments Urged to Take AIDS Seriously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The international donor community
and governments in the southern African region must take the
HIV/AIDS pandemic seriously as the region has some of the highest
AIDS cases in Africa, a senior European Commission (EC) regional
health official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
EC regional health advisor Julian Lob-levyt told the Zimbabwe
News Agency that both the international donor community and
national governments were not giving HIV/AIDS enough attention it
deserved.
</P>
<P>
"The international donor community's total annual budget
allocation on HIV/AIDS for the region has been 150 million U.S.
dollars as compared with 600 million U.S. dollars allocated to
Bangladesh over a period of five years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EC official noted national governments were also partly to
blame as there was no political commitment on their part in the
fight against HIV/ AIDS.
</P>
<P>
However, he cited Zimbabwe and South Africa as some of the few
countries in the region which were showing political commitment in
the fight against the killing disease.
</P>
<P>
He said the international donor community is willing to work
with countries in the region in the fight against HIV/AIDS but
this has to be coordinated by national governments.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for transparency and accountability on the part
of national governments as we cannot release funds we know will go
down the drain," he said.
</P>
<P>
In sub-Saharan Africa, it is estimated that 20 million people
are infected with HIV/AIDS and more than eight million children
have been orphaned by AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Aid Agencies Allowed for Free Access to All Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean government and the
rebels have agreed to allow free access for humanitarian aid to
all parts of the west African country, reports reaching here said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued in Lome, capital of Togo, both
sides at the peace talks pledged that "all recognized humanitarian
agencies will have guarantees of free access to all zones under
control of the respective parties to ensure effective flow of
humanitarian assistance."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached Thursday, the government and the
rebel Revolutionary United Front will before next Monday set up a
joint implementation committee involving Sierra Leonean civil
associations, international aid agencies and the U.N. mission in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Francis Okelo, U.N. special representative to Sierra Leone,
said in Lome Friday that "the situation in Sierra Leone is very
grave," adding that there are about 150,000 displaced people in
capital Freetown alone, of whom only 30,000 are in government
camps.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are entering the rainy season and many people have no
shelter, so the humanitarian situation is very acute," Okelo
noted.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Imposes Ban on Belgium Meat, Dairy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The South African Agriculture
Department Friday announced a ban on imports of poultry, pork,
beef and dairy products from Belgium after the products were this
week found to have been contaminated.
</P>
<P>
Any of the products presently in containers in ships in South
African harbors would also be withheld, Gideon Bruckner, the
Agriculture Department' s director for food safety and veterinary
public health, said in the announcement.
</P>
<P>
This step was taken after products on Belgium farms were found
to contain high levels of dioxin, a highly toxic chemical linked
to cancer.
</P>
<P>
The source of the dioxin was traced to the contaminated fat
used in feed at a food manufacturing plant, Bruckner said.
</P>
<P>
The infected product had been distributed to a number of
Belgium farms. About 475 poultry farms, 150 cattle farms and 550
pig export-oriented farms had received the contaminated feed.
</P>
<P>
A worldwide ban had been placed on the importation of these
Belgium foods.
</P>
<P>
As a precautionary step consumers were advised not to buy any
of these products until further notice.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Headquarters Staff Celebrate World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) headquarters staff celebrated World Environment Day
(WED) here Friday in a bid to make the day "not just another day".
</P>
<P>
The message from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan which was
read by a UNEP official at the celebrating function says that
"today is a day to remember that the environment should be valued
in itself and not simply as a means to satisfy our needs".
</P>
<P>
"Although saving the Earth has become a popular cause, there
are clear signals that we are still making excessive demands on
the environment," the message says.
</P>
<P>
"It is a day to realize we should not take the environment for
granted, for it will not be there tomorrow if we do not make
strong commitment to protect it," it warns.
</P>
<P>
"Because all human activities affect the Earth, and the state
of the Earth affects us all, every day should be World
Environment Day," it notes.
</P>
<P>
After the message was delivered, seven children recited this
year's theme for WED --"our earth, our future, just save it" in
six United Nations official languages and Kiswahili, a language
spoken in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
UNEP Deputy Executive Director Shafqat Kakakhel also conveyed
the message of the UNEP chief Klaus Toepfer, who is in Tokyo,
Japan to host main celebrations of World Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
The message said that the theme for this year is a phrase that
 reflects "the inter-connectedness of all life on this planet and
our responsibilities as a member of one planetary family to
safeguard its future".
</P>
<P>
"Though we may be divided by our languages, cultures and
ideologies, we all have one thing in common, our common earth, a
factor that outweighs all these differences."
</P>
<P>
"On this day let us re-dedicate ourselves not only to
conserving the environment but spreading the message of
inter-connectedness," it said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Affey, Permanent Secretary of Kenya's Environmental
Conservation Ministry also made a speech in the celebration which
stressed that "the only way to secure a safer and more prosperous
future is to deal with environment and development issues
together in a balanced manner".
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Kenyan government has made great efforts
to turn short-term actions into a long-term approach to
environmental protection through drafting relevant laws, some of
which have been passed by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
A couple of trees were also planted by dignitaries in the
headquarters of the UNEP in memory of the unusual day.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Calls for Commitment to Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan voiced his hope on Friday that every day will be World
Environment Day as all human activities affect the earth and the
state of the earth affects the mankind.
</P>
<P>
In a message to mark this year's Environment Day, which falls
on June 5, Annan said there are signs that human beings are
making excessive demands on the environment.
</P>
<P>
"The environment should be valued in itself and not simply as
a means to satisfy our needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a day to realize we should not take the Environment
for granted, for it will not be there tomorrow, if we do not
make a strong commitment to protect it" he said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that in the long run, depletion of water resources,
reduction of biodiversity, disruption of ecosystems and climate
changes will have potentially disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
"This means that responsibility, equity and solidarity are as
crucial in environmental matters as they are in social and
economic ones," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Day was designated in 1971 by the U.N. General
Assembly to deepen public awareness of the need to preserve and
enhance the environment.
</P>
<P>
The date was chosen as it was the opening day of the U.N.
Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, which led to the
establishment of the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP), now based in
Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year's Day is: "Our Earth -- Our Future --
Just Save It!"

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Adopts New Police Statue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has recently adopted a
new police statue in a bid to qualify all police officers and
better their services, Interior Minister Almerino Manhenje said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Manhenje said that the new statue
has been adopted to improve service levels, set up promotion
standards and make regulations on the rights and obligations of
the police officers.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that according to the new statue, new
comers in the police force or applicants are required to be of age
between 19 and 30 years and have diplomas for formal education of
at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
New policemen must have done their compulsory service in the
military according to the new statue. But few meet the above
conditions because since 1990 virtually no one has been formally
recruited.
</P>
<P>
Manhenje noted that the ministries of defense and finance will
seek to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
For the junior and senior commissioned police officers, a
formal education of at least 12 years is required. "Our general
must have college diplomas," said the interior minister.
</P>
<P>
As those who don't have the required diplomas did not have the
opportunities to study, Manhenje said, they would be trained and
after training, they will return to the police force.
</P>
<P>
The new statue also set up a new minimum salary for police
officers, 814, 000 metical (some 65 U.S. dollars), a 60-percent
increase over the previous.
</P>
<P>
All Mozambican citizens can join the police force. The new
statue contains no discrimination on sex and complexion.
</P>
<P>
To serve the second general elections scheduled before the end
of this year, the minister said that the Mozambican police have
prepared themselves for protecting the districts with polling
stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
He added that Mozambique had sent a police observer team to
South Africa to learn from their South African counterparts in the
June 2 election so as to ensure that the Mozambican elections will
go on smoothly.

<HEADLINE> Committee on Eliminating Discrimination Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Committee on the
Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the only United
Nations human rights treaty-monitoring body concerned exclusively
with women, will convene the second of its two annual sessions at
headquarters from June 7 to 25, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Comprised of 23 experts serving in their individual
capacities, the Committee monitors implementation of the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women.
</P>
<P>
During the uncoming twenty-first session, the Committee will
evaluate progress made by seven States parties to the treaty.
Countries that have ratified or acceded to the Convention are
legally bound to put its provisions into effect. They are also
committed to submitting national reports on measures taken to
comply with their treaty obligations.
</P>
<P>
An initial report is required within one year of accession,
and periodic reports at least every four years.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports of Georgia and Nepal will be considered at
the forthcoming session.
</P>
<P>
The second and third periodic reports of Chile, the combined
second and third periodic reports of Ireland, and the third and
fourth periodic reports of Spain and the United Kingdom will be
reviewed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Committee will hear country-specific
information from non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Committee has considered 98 initial, 68 second,
42 third and 12 fourth periodic reports.
</P>
<P>
Adopted in 1979, the Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Discrimination against Women is the most comprehensive,
legally binding treaty on women's human rights. The first 16
articles of the Convention call on States parties to take
appropriate measures to ensure women's civil, political,
economic and cultural rights and legal equality.

<P>
OTTAWA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Canada's unemployment rate decreased
to 8.1 percent in May from 8.3 in April, Statistics Canada said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although the overall number of new jobs created in May was
little changed from the previous month, the number of full-time
positions has been gradually rising over the past year.
</P>
<P>
According to the agency, full-time work increased by 3.1
percent over May 1998, while the number of part-time jobs is
basically unchanged.
</P>
<P>
For the third month in a row, employment among adults didn't
change significantly in May, after climbing sharply from June 1998
to February of this year, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
During the last 12 months, employment among adults has
increased by 2.2 percent, or about 263,000 jobs all full-time.
</P>
<P>
It was mostly men who dropped out of the job hunt, pushing
their jobless rate down to 6.5 percent while the unemployment rate
for women remained at 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Close to 1.3 million people were looking for work last month in

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Mexico Pledge to Improve Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Mexico on
Saturday pledged to join hands with other oil producing
countries to further lift oil prices in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The two countries made the pledge in a joint statement
following talks between Saudi Minister of Petroleum and Mineral
Resources Ali Bin Ibrahim al-Naimi and visiting Mexican Secretary
of Energy, Mines and State-owned Industry Luis Tellez in the Saudi
capital of Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The statement said "both states are ready to cooperate and
coordinate with other oil producing countries to adopt extra
measures to help improve oil prices." But it did not specify
these measures.
</P>
<P>
Member states of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), including Saudi Arabia, and non-OPEC member
countries, such as Mexico, struck an agreement last March to cut
oil production by around 2 million barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and exporter,
made the biggest production cut of 585,000 bpd from some 8
million bpd, while Mexico reduced its output by 125,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have climbed back to about 17 U.S. dollars per
barrel since the oil producers began to make their pledged cuts on
April 1. The prices in the global oil market plunged to below 10
dollars per barrel at the end of last year, or a nearly ten-year
low.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican official arrived in Saudi Arabia on Friday for a
two-day visit. He is due to be here in Kuwait on Sunday for talks
with Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah on oil
issues, the Kuwait News Agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Mexico Pledge Efforts to Improve Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Mexico on
Saturday pledged to join hands with other oil producing
countries to further lift oil prices in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The two countries made the pledge in a joint statement
following talks between Saudi Minister of Petroleum and Mineral
Resources Ali Bin Ibrahim al-Naimi and visiting Mexican Secretary
of Energy, Mines and State-owned Industry Luis Tellez in the Saudi
capital of Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The statement said "both states are ready to cooperate and
coordinate with other oil producing countries to adopt extra
measures to help improve oil prices." But it did not specify
these measures.
</P>
<P>
Member states of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), including Saudi Arabia, and non-OPEC member
countries, such as Mexico, struck an agreement last March to cut
oil production by around 2 million barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and exporter,
made the biggest production cut of 585,000 bpd from some 8
million bpd, while Mexico reduced its output by 125,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have climbed back to about 17 U.S. dollars per
barrel since the oil producers began to make their pledged cuts on
April 1. The prices in the global oil market plunged to below 10
dollars per barrel at the end of last year, or a nearly ten-year
low.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican official arrived in Saudi Arabia on Friday for a
two-day visit. He is due to be here in Kuwait on Sunday for talks
with Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah on oil
issues, the Kuwait News Agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Restricts Selling, Consumption of Liquor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Narcotics Control Department
(NCD) of Bangladesh has strictly enforced restrictions on the
selling and consumption of liquor in different authorized bars and
hotels.
</P>
<P>
The NCD has found different malpractice in selling and
consuming liquor in different bars and hotels, the national news
agency BSS Saturday quoted NCD Director General Mudabbir Hossain
Chowdhury as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bar owners mix cheap chemicals including rectified spirit
with foreign liquor for extra benefit, he alleged.
</P>
<P>
"We have increased our vigilance of the bars and hotels but no
new restrictions were imposed in this regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NCD is trying to prevent smuggling of foreign liquor and
its mixing in clandestine factories, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The illegal selling and consumption of spurious liquor have
already caused several unnatural death, which must be stopped at
any cost," the NCD chief stressed.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 people died and 25 others fell sick after drinking
toxic liquor in the northeastern district of Narsingdi early May,
and similar things have occurred several times in the country in
recent years.

<HEADLINE> Graf Wins Second Set Against Hingis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Five-time champion Steffi Graf won
the second set 7-5 against top-ranked Martina Hingis to force a
third and decisive set in the women's final at the French Open
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hingis won the first 6-4, but Graf, who was playing her first
Grand Slam final in three years due to injuries, battled back
twice from a break down in the second.
</P>
<P>
In the first set, Graf was broken in the opening game and faced
two break points after lagged behind 0-2 against 18-year-old
Hingis.
</P>
<P>
However, Graf who has bagged in 21 Grand Slam titles, fired
back to deuce before Hingis committed two more errors for 1-2 and
broke her Swiss fourth game for 2-all.
</P>
<P>
In the fifth game, Graf fought back from 30-0 before Hingis
smashed her racket to the ground in frustration and got a warning.
</P>
<P>
Hingis smiled eventually with a forehand winner at the end of a
rally, breaking her 30-year-old German opponent the second time
before surging surging ahead 5-2 for her only Grand Slam title she
hasn't won.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Graf was not in any mood to surrender without fight, and
she did managed to claw back to 4-5 with top-spin backhands before
committing errors to award Hingis to keep her 10th game for the
first-set victory.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Graf again dropped her opening game,
awarding a 2-0 lead for Hingis who toppled Graf from the No. 1
ranking in March 1997, ending the German's record 377-week reign.
</P>
<P>
In the battle between the old guard and the new generation,
Hingis was upset by the umpire ruling of her shots and was
penalized a point for a court violation, helping Graf to take her
first game for 1-2.
</P>
<P>
With the crowd loudly behind Graf, the German veteran broke
back in the sixth game, and held her serve with another
questionable call.
</P>
<P>
The eighth game produced the most exhilarating moments with a
spectacular exchange of drop shots and lobs that ended with Graf
firing a simple smash into the net as Hingis pulled even at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
A backhand winner put Hingis a break up and let her serve for
the match, but netted a drop-shot attempt to put Graf back at 5-5
before she won the next game at love and broke Hingis again to win
the set.

<HEADLINE> Zhao Wei Breaks Asian Women's Hammer Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Wang Zijiang
</P>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Within one year, Zhao Wei jumped
from an unknown shot putter to a hammer star. And only one month
lapsed, she broke the women's Asian record twice.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old turned her own women's hammer Asian record into
history with a toss of 63.20 meters in the Chinese Grand Prix
finals here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, who set the previous Asian record of 63.10m at the Ji'nan
stage of the Grand Prix Series on May 1, displayed an outstanding
performance, setting the new mark in her fourth attempt.
</P>
<P>
"I had not expected to break the record," she said. "My
personal best in the training was never more than 63 meters."
</P>
<P>
The Liaoning native said she likes the tight competitive
atmosphere. "I like more competition than training. I think
competition is very interesting."
</P>
<P>
Zhao, who turned to hammer from shot put early 1998, said she
hopes to compete in the upcoming World Championships in Seville,
Spain, on August 20-29, in which women's hammer will be a medal
event for the first time in history.
</P>
<P>
"Zhao Wei's success was achieved through her own hard work and
talent," her coach Ji Shaoming said. "She is very young. I believe
she will have a bright future in the world arena."
</P>
<P>
Zhao's success was closely related to China's legendary track
coach Ma Junren, who led his "Ma's Family Army" to sweep the
women's middle and long-distance events in 1993 World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, Zhao was a student in a sports school in
Shenyang, Liaoning Province. Ma Junren, then head coach of the
provincial track and field team, selected her to his team.
</P>
<P>
"Without coach Ma, Zhao should have never had today's results,"
said Ji Shaoming.
</P>
<P>
But even her Asian record is short of 65 meters which the
world's track and field governing body has set as a qualifying
rule for the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
"Zhao's Asian mark stands within top 20 in the world, but it's
not enough for her to qualify for the World Championships," said
Kan Fulin, a coach of the Chinese national team.
</P>
<P>
Kan said that less than 10 hammer throwers this years have
registered results more than 65 meters. "The IAAF would have to
lower the standard of 65 meters if no more athletes achieve the
results before August 16," Kan said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao's happiness was former Asian record holder Gu Yuan's agony
as she crashed for the second time to Zhao in a space of one month.
</P>
<P>
Gu, whose Asian record of 62.78 meters was broken by Zhao last
month, finished second with 62.70 meters.
</P>
<P>
But in a training session yesterday, Gu stunned her coach and
herself by throwing the hammer as far as 78 meters.
</P>
<P>
"She was crazy in the training," coach Kan said. "It's the
fault of her coach. It's a serious mistake. The coach should not
encourage her to do her utmost in a training. She should find her
top form during competition."
</P>
<P>
The same thing happened to China's top sprinter Yin Hanzhao,
who ran inside 10 seconds twice in a row last week in training but
clocked a modest time of 10.38 in winning the men's 100 meters
title.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot maintain a good shape when I stood at the starting
point," Yin said. "The time is far behind my personal best."
</P>
<P>
Only one runner from Ma Junren's training camp, Dong Yanmei,
qualifyed for the Grand Prix finals. She will compete in the
women's 5,000 meters on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Prix finals will double as a qualifying meet for the
World Championships. The Chinese Athletics Association will
announced the roster after the Finals.
</P>
<P>
Chinese athletes, who returned from the Athens World
Championships, aim to win a medal in Seville.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to bring back a medal of any color from Seville,"
CAA General Secretary Shang Xiutang said.

SHANGHAI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- As part of a public campaign to
mark International Environment Day today, some primary and middle
school students in Shanghai were seen drawing cartoons with
pollution and the environment as their themes and displaying their
work on the city's streets.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's young people have shown their concern about
environmental deterioration in this way, according to Zhou Min, a
deputy secretary-general of the city's Environmental Science
Association for Young People.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that since March, nearly 3,000 students from 15

nearly 10,000 used batteries and many old newspapers since the end
of last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Take Two More Golds at FINA Diving GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese divers showed their
world class forms here on Saturday when they finished 1-2 in both
the women's three-meter springboard and the men's 10-meter
platform on the second day of the 1999 FINA World Diving Grand
Prix Hong Kong Meet.
</P>
<P>
They turned the meet into an all-Chinese show when Guo Jingjing
and Liang Xiaoqiao took the top two in the women's springboard
final while Tian Liang and Sun Shuwei came first and second in the
men's platform.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Sun tried hard to catch up with his teammate
Tian Liang from the very beginning but failed.
</P>
<P>
Tian Liang, in top form, was titled in the China Diving Open
days ago, led all the way to win the event on 721.86 points.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Chinese concluded the day's match with a superb
dive which earned him 97.92 points.
</P>
<P>
Asked for expectations in next year's Olympic Games, Tian said:
"My first step is to beat foreigners and then to compete against
my teammate."
</P>
<P>
Sun got the silver medal on 698.52 points while American David
Pichler finished third on 625.44 points.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen-year-old Guo Jingjing, crowned in the Bangkok Asian
Games last year, came from behind to overpass Liang Xiaoqiao after
she got 74.70 points, the highest of the day, in the eighth dive.
</P>
<P>
"My performance was not so good today," said Guo who collected
579.33 points to top the table.
</P>
<P>
China's rising star Liang, 15, who captured the title in the
World Cup early this year, finished second on 564.54 points,
followed by Australian Chantelle Michell with 513.18 points.
</P>
<P>
The three-day diving meet will close on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Dudley to Take Ewing's Place in Knicks-Pacers Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chris Dudley will start at
center for the New York Knicks in place of Patrick Ewing when the
Eastern Conference finals against the Indiana Pacers resumes
tonight.
</P>
<P>
Coach Jeff Van Gundy announced his choice yesterday, the third
straight day without a game in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
"To me, this is the simplest," Van Gundy said of his decision
to start the slow-footed Dudley. "You can get guys in as early as
you want, you can change early if that's what you need to happen."
</P>
<P>
Dudley started 16 games during the regular season, four
alongside Ewing and 12 when Ewing was out with Achilles'
tendinitis. In the 12 games without Ewing, the Knicks went 7-5.
</P>
<P>
"When Patrick's been out in the past, that's how we've been,"
Van Gundy said. "We've had some good wins, some tough losses.
We'll start the same, and everyone will stay in their same pattern.
"
</P>
<P>
That means Latrell Sprewell, the team's leading scorer, will
continue to come off the bench in the first and third quarters.

WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- As NATO air attacks against Yugoslavia continued into their
73rd days, military commanders from both sides prepared to meet on
Saturday to hammer out a detailed timetable for a withdrawal of
Yugoslav troops from Kosovo and an end to the NATO bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Friday that Americans
should be required to register guns as they do cars, waving a red
flag in front of gun owner advocates who long have argued that
registration could be a step toward new restrictions, even
confiscation.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton declared on Thursday that he was "
anxious to end the bombing" in Yugoslavia, and the Pentagon said
the 10-week-old air war could end as early as Sunday if Serbia
begins a troop withdrawal from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
-- A quarter-century after Congress gave citizens broad powers
to enforce environmental laws through private lawsuits, judges
across the country are cutting back on those suits so deeply that
environmental groups have lost much of their power in court, legal
experts on both sides of the issue said.

</P>
<P>
But he said that there had been a lot of "mixed signals" and
contradictory statements from Pakistan in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
On the eleventh day of the ongoing fighting in the mountainous
border area, the spokesman said India would continue its military
operations until what he termed as aggression against India was
vacated.
</P>
<P>
"It is an objective that we will pursue unwaveringly and with
the fullest determination," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indian army has banned movement of journalists
in the Kargil sector of Kashmir on the ground of "operation
secrecy," according to the Press Trust of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Defense Minister George Fernandes, during a
visit to Kargil, directed the army to allow the press to the area.

<HEADLINE> China Working on Plan to Protect Environment at Yangtze Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUOTUO RIVER (Qinghai), June 5 (Xinhua) -- At a ceremony today
for a monument at the source of the Yangtze River, Wang Yuqing, a
deputy director of China's State Environmental Protection
Administration, said that the ecology at the river's source is
fragile and will be the subject of a protection plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the plan will focus on protecting grasslands,
forests, and wetlands that have not been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
China Central Television ran a program live this morning on the
Tuotuo River, a major tributary of the Yangtze in Qinghai Province,
for the unveiling ceremony. The monument is inscribed with the
words "Source of the Yangtze" that are based on the handwriting of
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai in northwestern China is the source of both the Yangtze
and Yellow rivers, but because of the greenhouse effect and human
activities, the environment at the source of the Yangtze, the
longest in China, has deteriorated quickly in this century. As a
result, there has been desertification of nearby grassland and
rapidly spreading soil erosion. The amount of silt in the Yangtze
and Yellow rivers has been increasing, hindering social and
economic development and the lives of people along the middle and
lower reaches of the two rivers.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration will
cooperate with the Qinghai provincial government in building an
experimental zone for protecting the ecology at the river's source
that will take into consideration the lives of local farmers and
herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
A team of journalists, geologists, and environmental
specialists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences will travel from
the source of the river to Shanghai, where the Yangtze meets the
sea, over the next three months to thoroughly study the nature,
economy, and cultural conditions of it and areas along the 6,300-
km-long river.

TUOTUO RIVER (Qinghai) June 5 (Xinhua) -- Officials and
journalists from all parts of China gathered today along the
Tuotuo River, a major tributary of the Yangtze, for the unveiling
of a monument with the inscription "the Source of the Yangtze,"
which is based on the handwriting of President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Tibetans dressed in colorful clothing danced and
presented hada, the strips of white silk that are given as a token
of respect in Tibet, to leading officials and environmentalists.
The monument was unveiled by Song Ruixiang, the deputy director of
the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA), and Su
Sen, the deputy governor of Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuqing, another deputy director of the SEPA, presided over
today's unveiling ceremony. While addressing the gathering, wang
said that the purpose of today's activity was to increase public
awareness of the need to protect the ecology of major rivers.
Qinghai is the source of both the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, but
because of the greenhouse effect and man, the environment at the
river's source has deteriorated quickly in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
As a result, there has been desertification of nearby grassland,
with soil erosion spreading, and the amount of silt in the Yangtze
and Yellow rivers increasing, hindering social and economic
development and the lives of people along the middle and lower
reaches of the two rivers.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Governor Su Sen pledged that his province will redouble
efforts to protect the ecology and to contribute more to China's
sustained economic development.
</P>
<P>
A female representative of an environmental protection group in
Hong Kong said that she came especially to express the support of
Hongkong residents for the government's attempt to protect the
Yangtze's environment and that she will help raise funds for a
nature preserve at the source.
</P>
<P>
Yang Xin, an environmentalist who has built a nature preserve
center at the source, said that he is certain that the monument
will inspire organizations and people all across China to be
concerned about the environment along China's major rivers.
</P>
<P>
The State Environment Bureau will cooperate with the Qinghai
provincial government to build an experimental zone for protecting
the ecology at river's source that will take into consideration
the lives of local farmers and herdsmen.

</P>
<P>
The spokesman accused the Ethiopians for shelling Luq town
indiscriminately and subsequently devastating the town. He said
the Ethiopians are aiming at capturing the main Bur Dhubo town
bridge which links Gedo region to the rest of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows how many have died or wounded as the fighting
still continues and most of the radios are off the air," he said.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources from Luq town also confirmed the invasion
of Ethiopia forces. Eyewitnesses said the Ethiopian forces are
accompanied by Somali militiamen believed to be among the
sympathizers of Ahmed Sheikh Ali Buraleh opposing General Omar
Hajji Masalleh.
</P>
<P>
Burahel told Xinhua through VHF radio that he took control of
the town from General Masalleh. However, he denied Ethiopian
involvement in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Buraleh claimed that his forces have killed three opponents and
 confiscated a large stock of weapons including one battle wagon,
two rocket propelled grenades, a number of rifles and a large
quantity of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Reports also indicated that the Ethiopian forces have taken
control of Bur Dhuhunleh and Wajid towns, 120 and 100 kilometers
northwest of Baidoa town respectively and several other villages.
The sources said the Ethiopian forces have met no resistance in
either town and they set up checkpoints in both ends of these
towns.
</P>
<P>
The forces of Aidid in Bay region are taking precautions
against the advancing Ethiopian forces. Over 20 battle wagons
and a large number of infantry militiamen have already been
deployed about 40 km north of Baidoa town.
</P>
<P>
Reports received through the VHF radios in Baidoa town said
Hussein Aidid's forces have cleared all big trees from a large
terrain in their efforts of strengthening their defense against a
possible Ethiopian incursion.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian advance took place only a day after Hussein
Aidid, Mohamed Qanyareh Afrah and General Omar Hajji Masalleh left
home for Libya for a possible new diplomatic political initiative.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believe that Libya is trying to mend the
disrupted agreement between the factions of Hussein Aidid and Ali
Mahdi and General Masalleh following the Cairo peace deal in late
1997.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi recently toured Egypt and
Libya and the departure of Hussein Aidid to Libya might be a sign
for a possible political settlement between Ethiopia and the
factions of southern Somalia. Meles has long been having
political differences with Egypt and Libya which both supported
the Cairo peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cambodia Out to Arouse Environmental Awareness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia Saturday held a series
of activities to mark the World Environmental Day in the capital
and other parts of the country to arouse the people's
environmental awareness.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State in the Ministry of Environment To Gary said
at a function marking the World Environment Day that "it is
important to protect the natural environment by keeping the
natural ecosystem with the development of the national economy in
a sustainable way."
</P>
<P>
He said: "deforestation is the main issue in Cambodia,
provoking many natural disasters such as inundation, drought, soil
erosion, sheltering of water basins and rivers."
</P>
<P>
"This impact on the quality of the environment caused many
problems, such as people losing their shelters, food shortages and
poor public health," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the nation and the people to be mobilized to
protect and preserve the environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1972, delegates from more than 100 countries met in
Stockholm to discuss the status of environment and reached
agreement on the creation of the World Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has undertaken the National and World Environmental
Day since 1994 and the Cambodia government has taken many tough
measures to conserve natural resources including fish and forest.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week in Kandal province, the authorities rescued
60,000 baby fish destined for overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
This was one of the instances since the Council of Ministers
ordered in mid-April a major crackdown on illegal fishing. The
crackdown has cut fishing offenses by about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to revise the country's outdated,
ineffective 1950 Fisheries Law to control illegal fishing, which
was crucial for the long-term management of the natural resources.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, Prime Minister Hun Sen signed a
decree to order the concerned ministries and the armed forces to
take tough and effective measures to curb and crack down on
illegal logging, processing and transportation of wood products.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that nearly 800 sawmills and more than 200 wood
processing workshops had been closed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Environmental Ministry has worked out a plan
to turn some 20 communities where forests are being seriously
threatened into forest guardians. Under the plan, the communities
are to be trained to use the forests in a sustainable way for
their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
A pilot scheme in Takeo province covering 500 acres proved a
big success.
</P>
<P>
A royal decree in November 1993 identified 23 areas covering
3.3 million hectares that need special protection. They included
seven national parks, ten wildlife reserves, three multi-purpose
areas and three protected areas.
</P>
<P>
However problems like deforestation and over-fishing still
threaten to destroy the unique ecosystem of Tonle Sap lake.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that at least 20 species, including the Mekong
River dolphin, a fresh-water mammal, are endangered in Cambodia
and should be protected.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economic Recovery Process on Track: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The lower inflation and interest
rates are keeping the Philippines' economic recovery process on
track, economic managers of the government said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio program, Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla
said that with the lower inflation and interest rates now, the
country's gross national product (GNP) is more likely to achieve a
growth rate of 3 to 3.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone will benefit from this. We are now more confident of
meeting our target of 3 to 3.5 percent GNP growth this year,"
Medalla said.
</P>
<P>
Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said in the program that the
government is also taking steps to prepare for "unforeseen
developments."
</P>
<P>
The weakening of other economies such as that of the United
States may yet affect the Philippines' efforts to recover from the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the National Statistic Office (NSO) reported
that the inflation rate dropped to 6.7 percent in May, the lowest
in two years.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates also dropped as the central bank lowered
borrowing rates to 9.625 percent and lending rates to 11.625
percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Diokno said, the agricultural sector has recovered
this year, with rice production growing by 31 percent and corn by
62 percent in the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Blair Warns of Resumption of Bombing Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
insisted that NATO could resume its bombing campaign if Yugoslavia
fails to live up to its promises under a peace plan for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Airstrikes would resume immediately if the Serb withdrawal from
Kosovo faltered, Blair said in an article he wrote for the Times
newspaper which was published on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But he said bombing would be suspended if Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic was seen to be fulfilling the terms of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Blair also said Milosevic would face what he called a "war-
crimes trial" and that his country will be denied billions of
dollars in reconstruction aid until he is removed from power.

BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China Central Television ran a
program live this morning on the Tuotuo River, a major tributary
of the Yangtze, as part of an ecological protection drive for the
27th World Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province in northeast China started a pollution-
control and environment improvement project on the Liaohe River,
the most polluted of China's seven major rivers. On its lower
reaches, the province faces a serious pollution problem and has
developed a two-year plan to stop industrial sewage.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the province's cities along the river are making an
effort to build sewage treatment plants and four have gone
operational.
</P>
<P>
The Wuxian County government in Jiangsu Province, east China,
today closed three major concrete factories around Taihu Lake, a
tourism attraction that has had severe pollution problems in
recent years. The move will remove 8,000 tons of dust pollutants
every year, accounting for 59 percent of the dust in the lake area.
</P>
<P>
In the past ten years, the county has closed more than 300
enterprises that were polluters.
</P>
<P>
Zhaoqing, an historic city in Guangdong Province, south China,
also held an eco-protection promotion drive today. More than 10,
000 people signed a petition to fight pollution and further
protect the environment.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Delta Conflict Kills Seven More People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 5(Xinhua) -- Seven more people were added to the
death list Friday when Itsekiri youths attacked Urhobos of Warri,
an oil rich city of Nigeria's Delta State.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the death, several others were injured when some
armed Itsekiri youths attacked the houses of some Urbobos for
allegedly harboring their age-long arch enemy, the Ijaws,
reported Nigeria's newspaper Daily Times Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They had reportedly burnt down the houses, including that of
the newly installed Orusuen of Okere, a local ethnic leader,
Ojagbugbe I and the Okere-Urhobo shrine.
</P>
<P>
The Urbobos were said to have fought back and at the end of the
bloody duel, the deceased, including a 70-year old retiring
employer of an oil company, his son and a set of twins were
killed.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of killing was ignited when militant Ijaw
youths Monday touched the entire Itsekiri dominant village of
Aruton, killing about 200 people.
</P>
<P>
The Itsekiris are apparently in fighting back on Ijaw
communities, leading to death of more people.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian government had beefed up its security force in the
area and Delta State Governor James Ibori had also met the
leaders of Ijaw, Itsekiri,
</P>
<P>
and Urhobo, the three main ethnic groups in Warri region last
week, seeking solution to the conflict.

<HEADLINE> China Trying To Protect Environment Along Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUOTUOHE (Qinghai) June 5 (Xinhua) -- Officials and journalists
from all parts of China gathered today along the Tuotuo River, a
major tributary of the Yangtze, for the unveiling of a monument
with the inscription "the Source of the Yangtze," which is based
on the handwriting of President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Tibetans dressed in colorful clothing danced and
presented hada, the strips of white silk that are given as a token
of respect in Tibet, to leading officials and environmentalists.
The monument was unveiled by Song Ruixiang, the deputy director of
the State Environment Bureau (SEB), and Su Sen, the deputy
governor of Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuqing, the deputy head of the SEB, presided over today's
unveiling ceremony. While addressing the gathering, wang said that
the purpose of today's activity was to increase public awareness
of the need to protect the ecology of major rivers. Qinghai is the
source of both the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, but because of the
greenhouse effect and man, the environment at the river's source
has deteriorated quickly in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
As a result, there has been desertification of nearby grassland,
with soil erosion spreading, and the amount of silt in the Yangtze
and Yellow rivers increasing, hindering social and economic
development and the lives of people along the middle and lower
reaches of the two rivers.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Governor Su Sen pledged that his province will redouble
efforts to protect the ecology and to contribute more to China's
sustained economic development.
</P>
<P>
A female representative of an environmental protection group in
Hong Kong said that she came especially to express the support of
Hongkong residents for the government's attempt to protect the
Yangtze's environment and that she will help raise funds for a
nature preserve at the source.
</P>
<P>
Yang Xin, an environmentalist who has built a nature preserve
center at the source, said that he is certain that the monument
will inspire organizations and people all across China to be
concerned about the environment along China's major rivers.
</P>
<P>
The State Environment Bureau will cooperate with the Qinghai
provincial government to build an experimental zone for protecting
the ecology at river's source that will take into consideration
the lives of local farmers and herdsmen.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed by Landslide in Northern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- At least two persons were killed in
a landslide and over 6,000 others were stranded in Bicol, the
Northern Philippines, when typhoon Etang lashed the region in the
past three days, the authorities said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Civil Defense (OCD) in Manila said continuous
rains brought about by the typhoon triggered the landslide in San
Isidro, Albay province of the Bicol region, Thursday, killing two
persons.
</P>
<P>
In Sorsogon, over 6,000 commuters going to Samar and Leyte have
been stranded at the Matnog Ferry Terminal as big waves along the
Matnog-Allen Channel prevented ferry boats from crossing, the
office said.
</P>
<P>
Luzon and the Visayas have been battered simultaneously by two
cyclones, bringing in heavy rains and flood waters.
</P>
<P>
The office said that severely affected in Luzon were Apayao,
Mountain province, Benguet and Baguio city, where roads were
damaged.
</P>
<P>
Floods hit several roads in northern Luzon, forcing the
authorities to close traffic. In some areas, mud littered the
streets and only four-wheel drive vehicles could pass through.

elections slated for the coming October.
</P>
<P>
He urged all provincial and grass root governments to ensure

<HEADLINE> Philippines Creates Air Quality Police Unit to Curb Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has kicked
off the celebration of the Environment Month in June by launching
an air quality police unit that will help solve the country's air
pollution problem, a senior official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a report published here, Environment Secretary Antonio
Cerilles said that the new unit will meet head-on the air
pollution problem nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Cerilles said that starting this month, air quality police
units will be deployed along major roads and highways.
</P>
<P>
"This air quality police is tasked to apprehend smoke-belching
vehicles that are the major cause of air pollution," Cerilles
said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the unit will not simply apprehend violators
of the anti-smoke-belching campaign but will also initiate other
measures, such as checking the vehicles and advising owners to put
them in order.
</P>
<P>
"This will not be just a case of more apprehension, but
apprehension with a solution because the unit will have to check
the vehicle and put it in order so that we will have a better
environment," Cerilles said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government created a Presidential Air Quality
Commission precisely to solve the air pollution problem,
especially in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
The air pollution in Manila has been traced to the emissions of
1.2 million vehicles, and poisonous gas coming from various power
plants and industries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- NATO warplanes bombed Yugoslav
targets in Pristina, Prizren and many other regions as air strikes
against the nation entered its 74th day on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Around 1:00 a.m. in the day, sirens were heard in Belgrade but
NATO warplanes did not come. In the morning of the previous day, a
military airport in the suburb of Belgrade was targeted.
</P>
<P>
Several areas in Yugoslavia came under NATO attack from morning
till night on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Radoslav
Ilic, chairman of the Yugoslav Independent Trade Union, expressed
his support for Milosevic and the Serbian Parliament's decision to
accept the G-8 peace plan under the precondition of maintaining
state sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Ilic also urged an immediate stop of the NATO bombing so that
peace could be realized.
</P>
<P>
Svegtolik Kostadinovic, head of the Yugoslav railway
administration, on Friday called the acceptance of the peace plan
by Milosevic and the Serbian Parliament a wise, brave and highly
responsible move.
</P>
<P>
The incessant NATO airstrikes have inflicted heavy casualties
and material loss on Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Continue Helping End Kososo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin met
with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov Saturday to ponder over the
country's next moves on the settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Russia must continue seeking an end to the crisis in
Yugoslavia," Yeltsin said at the beginning of the meeting, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he has been in touch with Western leaders to "
elucidate Russia's position."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov briefed Yeltsin on the situation in Yugoslavia during
the half-hour meeting. Yeltsin said that NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia must be halted so that a political settlement may
become possible.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will be prepared to participate actively and
constructively in drawing up a pertinent resolution of the U.N.
Security Council after the bombing is stopped. (This resolution)
must provide a legal basis for settling the Yugoslav crisis,"
Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's involvement in a Kosovo peacekeeping force will depend
on what conditions are set for the international presence, Ivanov
said.
</P>
<P>
"If they coincide with Russia's interests and efforts for
Yugoslavia's revival, Moscow will consider this issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Any agreements on Yugoslavia as well as the Ivanov-
Chernomyrdin activity will be assessed according to their results,
" Ivanov said. "Rifts and differences should not be searched for
where there aren't any," he said in an apparent reference to media
reports of differences among the Russian delegate to the talks on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Yeltsin gave instructions to try and secure
international help to reconstruct Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The moral duty" of the countries that inflicted the huge
damage on Yugoslavia is to help the people revive it, he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia entered the 74th day on
Saturday. So far NATO's air strikes have killed and wounded
thousands of innocent civilians and destroyed many civilian
facilities such as roads, bridges and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
In the coming winter months, Yugoslavia may face an acute
humanitarian catastrophe on a scale which has not been seen since
World War II, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"This must not be allowed," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cook Rules out Possibility of Kosovo Partition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain insisted on Saturday that
the presence of Russian troops in a planned Kosovo peace
implementation force did not mean that the war-torn Serbian
province would be partitioned.
</P>
<P>
"There is not going to be a partition of Kosovo. We're not
going to agree to a large Russian zone," Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook told BBC Radio.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of there being a distinct independent
Russian zone not answering to the rest of the international
military force. There is not going to be an East German solution,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook said he was confident that NATO and Russian officials
would successfully negotiate a single chain of command for the
force, overcoming Moscow's reluctance to allow its troops to come
under direct Alliance control.
</P>
<P>
NATO hopes it can help bridge the gap with Moscow by drawing on
its experience of cooperating with Russian troops in the Bosnian
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
"But what they will do, and what we can do...is to reach an
agreement by which we do have a unified chain of command of which
Russia is part and cannot operate independently and separately
from that international force," he added.

<P>
TEHRAN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Saturday congratulated South Africa for
holding the second all-race presidential elections successfully.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that after the apartheid, the South African people,
by turning out in elections, have taken a new move towards
institutionalizing democracy and establishing a country free from

</P>
<P>
He wished prosperity for South Africa and underlined the need

</P>
<P>
Iran hopes that the African National Congress (ANC), which has

welfare and development of South Africa and would play an active
role in the restoration of peace worldwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling ANC won a two-third majority in South Africa's
second all-race elections held on Thursday, and the victory paved
the way for ANC president Thabo Mbeki to succeed President Nelson
Mandela.

<HEADLINE> Chendu Army Bends Under Mental Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, Anhui, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chendu Army was too earger to
taste the victory as they suffered another loss at the first AVC
Cup Men's Club Volleyball Tournament here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chendu Army, the third-placer of this season, was overwhelmed
rather by their mental pressure than the powerful spikes of Paykan
of Iran in a 25-20, 25-18, 32-30 loss.
</P>
<P>
"We are too earger for the win but the things turned against
our wish as we committed too many errors under the mental pressure,
" admitted head coach Yuan Chuan.
</P>
<P>
Yuan had made similar comments on the last match Friday against
Sichuan Fo Lan who scored a convincing 25-20, 25-20, 25-18 win.
</P>
<P>
"We became impatient as we trailed behind and committed
unworthy errors," Yuan referred to the match against Fo Lan.
</P>
<P>
Two sets down, Chendu still had a slim chance of earning a five-
setter showdown under the best-of-five format as they, inspired by
the partisan crowd, fought their way to 24-21.
</P>
<P>
But Paykan was thrown a life rope as they saved three set
points to pull it even at 24-all and traded with Chendu in
advantages until they were the first to win two points running to
settle the set and the match.
</P>
<P>
Chendu Army has taken the men's club tournament much to heart
as the setter Yang Liqun started in every match at an age of 37.
</P>
<P>
"We also had a new setter but he is too young to be started.
And as a debutant in such a big tournament, we regard it seriously
and hope to go as far as possible in this tournament," said Yang,
who is the de facto head coach in routine training.
</P>
<P>
"I always warn my players that good results in competitions
will concern the fate of our team," added Yang.
</P>
<P>
Chendu Army had the bitter experience when they were demoted to
the Serie B after they finished the eighth in the 96-97 season and
did not return to Serie A until the end of 1997.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Bomb Attack Kills One Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A woman was killed by a bomb thrown
into her home early on Saturday in Portadown, one of Northern
Ireland's sectarian flashpoints, before a second device exploded
at a house a short distance away.
</P>
<P>
Police blamed Protestant "loyalist" militants who have a long
record of attacking Roman Catholic nationalists, according to a
Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
"We can confirm that a woman in her late 50s died following the
explosion at a house in Corcrain Drive... The woman died in her
living room from injuries sustained in the explosion. Her husband
escaped physical injury," a police statement said.
</P>
<P>
"While no clear motive has been established at this stage,
police are satisfied that both incidents are the work of loyalist
extremists," Reuters quoted a police spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
People inside the second family which came under attack
sustained no injury.
</P>
<P>
Loyalist militants have carried out a string of sporadic
attacks on isolated Catholic families in recent months in a bid to
wreck last year's peace deal, the Good Friday agreement, which was
signed by Protestant and Catholic politicians.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Minister To Visit Kuwait Over Pan-Arab Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of Youth and
Sports Mohammad Kheir Mamsar is expected to visit Kuwait next week
to persuade the Gulf emirate to drop its threats to boycott the
ninth Pan-Arab Games in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Mamsar told the Jordanian News Agency Petra on Friday that his
talks in Kuwait would also touch upon Jordanian-Kuwaiti relations
in the fields of youth and sports, and how to enhance the
relations on Arab and Asian levels.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has repeatedly threatened not to take part in the August
15-31 Pan-Arab Games in Amman as Iraq has announced it would send
a powerful delegation to participate in the games.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has said it would allow Iraqi athletes to take part in
the contest.
</P>
<P>
"No Kuwaiti will compete in the ninth Pan-Arab Games should
Iraq compete even only on a symbolic level, and the boycott of the
Games by Kuwait is unquestionable," General Secretary of Kuwaiti
National Olympic Committee was quoted as saying in May.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait suffered from a seven-month occupation by Iraqi forces
during the 1989-90 Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hoped to use the ninth Pan-Arab Games to show Arab
solidarity and had encouraged all Arab countries, including
Kuwait's 1990 Gulf War enemy Iraq to compete in the games.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad had been expelled from the seventh and eighth Pan-Arab
Games, held in Damascus in 1992 and Beirut in 1997 respectively,
upon pressure from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Sports Minister Mamsar told reporters that it was
preferrable to separate sports from politics to bring about Arab
unity in the upcoming ninth Pan-Arab Games in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hoped Kuwait would take part in the largest gathering of
Arab youth as 4,000 athletes from a record 19 Arab countries have
confirmed their participation in the event.

<HEADLINE> More New Bank Apply for Licence in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen new banks have applied to
be licensed by the Central Bank of Kenya despite concerns in the
sector that the country is over-banked.
</P>
<P>
Making the remarks at a recent seminar on the bank crisis in
Nairobi, Isaac Awuondo, vice-chairman of the Kenya Bankers
Association, said new strict measures should be adopted as part of
the policy options to be taken by the central bank to steer out
of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
To make it stricter central bank's supervision of the sector,
Awuondo noted that the three key roles of the bank, monetary
policy, government banker and supervision of the sector, should
be separated.
</P>
<P>
Awuondo, also the managing director of the Commercial Bank of
Africa, argued that the new banks may not have the necessary
finances beyond the minimum capitalization requirement or
management expertise to stay in the business.
</P>
<P>
Licensing fee for new banks is set at 20 million shillings
(currently one U.S. dollar equals to 70 shillings) and
capitalization requirements are 200 million shillings at present,
although the figure is set to rise to 500 million shillings by
December.
</P>
<P>
The last quarter of 1998 saw the collapse of five banks in
Kenya, namely, Trust, City Finance, Bullion, Reliance and
Prudential, who were mainly hit by bad debts and poor management.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, bank depositors were challenged to form a
customer watch right group to keep track of development in the
sector and to take actions to safeguard their deposits.

of campaign activities and officials of the Jakarta city
administration, in the presence of the Jakarta governor and
Jakarta military chief, removed the flags of the 48 political
parties contesting in the election.

<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Officials in the U.S. administration are backing Michael

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Urged to help Overcome Economic Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Bin Mohamad said Saturday that the country has managed to
overcome its economic problems due to the people's confidence and
support for the government.
</P>
<P>
He said that even though the country was facing an economic
crisis, the people generally chose to maintain unity and racial
harmony. And this has enabled the government to focus fully on
efforts to revive the economy, he said in a loyalty pledge on
behalf of the people and the government at the investiture in
conjunction with the birthday of Supreme Head of State Yang
di-Pertuan Agong in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the people's confidence and support for the
government were greatly appreciated. And a lesson to be learnt
from the economic crisis was that the country needs to take a firm
stand and be confident in its ability and capability. It was this
firm stand and confidence which enabled the country to refrain
from seeking the assistance of international bodies like the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to overcome the nation's
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
"We also realize that to succeed, we must be bold to try out
something we feel could benefit the people and the country even if
such measures have never been carried out by others," he said,
adding "to achieve full economic recovery, all quarters especially
the private sector should play a more effective role, especially
in continuing to activate productive economic sectors like
construction, manufacturing and infrastructure development."
</P>
<P>
He said that the cooperation between the private and public
sectors, the workers and their trade unions was essential because
without smart partnership, the country would not be able to
achieve high economic growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports Council
(KONI) chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar Friday officially inaugurated
the centralized training center for the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA)
Games.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was attended by only 100 of the 454 athletes from
20 sports bodies competing in the biennial event, which is to be
held in Brunei Darussalam from August 7 to 15.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Wismoyo said that athletes were responsible in
giving their best achievement to the country, which was in crisis.
</P>
<P>
"If you fail to perform your best, you are sinful for misusing
people's money. We use their money to finance your training," he
was quoted by The Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
KONI plans to only send 448 athletes who are considered the
most prepared, to compete in the Games.
</P>
<P>
Despite the short training period of only two months, athletes
expressed optimism in improving records and winning medals.
</P>
<P>
Women's doubles specialist in tennis Irawati Moerid Iskandar is
eyed for a gold in the women's doubles.
</P>
<P>
Shooter Rina Dwi K., competing in women's double trap, hoped to
score more than 130 points, higher than her personal best two
years ago when she earned a silver medal.
</P>
<P>
Women's sprinter Supiati from West Nusa Tenggara said she
wanted to improve her personal best of 12.00 seconds in the 100-
meter dash created in a track and field simulation in July last
year.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 SEA Games training executive director Djoko Pramono
said Indonesia would have to fight hard in the Games to retain its
overall title due to the short training period.
</P>
<P>
"We only have two months left. Each sports organizations must
motivate their athletes, because motivation can overshadow the
lack of technical skill and physical endurance," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda: I'm Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda said that he automatically became Zambian by birth since he
was born in the country in 1924.
</P>
<P>
He also said the 1964 independence constitution granted him
Zambian citizenship as he was a British protected person.
</P>
<P>
The argument is contained in the records of appeal filed in the
supreme court of the country over the stateless judgement against
Kaunda by the Ndola High Court.
</P>
<P>
The court has not yet set a date for the hearing of the appeal,
 according to Saturday's Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Among the documents filed are an affidavit Kaunda swore on oath
in 1995 stating that his father arrived in Isoka, northeastern
Zambia from Malawi in 1904.
</P>
<P>
"We the undersigned, hereby certify that we have compiled this
record of appeal in accordance with the provisions of rules 10 and
58 of the supreme court rules," he said.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, Kaunda, who had been ruling the country
since its independence in 1964 until 1991, when he was defeated by
current president Frederick Chiluba, was declared stateless by
the Ndola High Court.
</P>
<P>
The judgement means Kaunda, who was born of Malawian parents,
is neither a Zambian nor a Malawian.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was barred from running for the presidency in the
elections held in 1996, when a constitutional amendment was
adopted under which foreign nationals and those with foreign
parentage are prohibited from contesting the position.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda has vowed to contest the post in the next elections in
2001.

In a report released on the eve of the World Environment Day,
the group said NATO created a millennium-lasting ecology disaster
in its war on Yugoslavia. Indiscriminate bombings of oil
refineries and fuel depots have produced a thick polluted air
layer over not only Yugoslavia itself but also neighboring
Bulgaria and Romania.

Even worse, NATO used depleted uranium missiles in its strikes,

<HEADLINE> Kenya Capable to Produce Artificial Limbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Medical Training College
can now produce low-cost artificial limbs after receiving
equipment worth 700,000 shillings (about 10,000 U.S. dollars)
donated by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said in a news release available here Saturday that
manufacturing prosthesis within Kenya would eliminate some of the
need to import expensive ready-made components and reduce the
cost of production per limb from 45,000 shillings to 10,000
shillings.
</P>
<P>
The college is to produce an initial 100 prosthetic limbs under
the supervision of two Kenyan lecturers who recently returned from
an ICRC- sponsored one-month training in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC set up a special fund for the disabled in Addis Ababa
in 1983 with its purpose to assist amputees and other physically
handicapped persons by means of durable projects.
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to wood and polyester resin, the ICRC has
been using thermoformable plastics, polyporpylene and polyethlene
which are used for the manufacture of sockets and other various
components such as knee joints, feet and alignment devices.
</P>
<P>
The advantage of this recyclable technology is that light and
modern prostheses can be produced at very low cost by local
workers, said the ICRC.

recovered" following objections, the audit report said.
</P>
<P>
The BWDB spent 44.7 million taka (about 920,000 dollars) more

drainage during the period, but the extra expenditure was not
clarified, it said.
</P>
<P>
The board spent 11.3 million taka (about 233,000 dollars) under
a food for work program and 26.7 million taka (about 550,500
dollars) for different projects in the period though there were no
such allocations, it said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the BWDB also misused a huge amount of money in some
development programs, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The audit was conducted by the Office of the Comptroller and
Auditor General, and the audit report was submitted to the
president on May 27 this year and will be presented in the
upcoming budget session of the parliament.
</P>

cargo ships for ransom during his three-year term as chief of
Lebanon's largest seaport.
</P>
<P>
Itani is the fourth ranking official to be arrested on charges
of corruption since Lebanese President Emile Lahoud came to power

Lahoud promised in his oath-taking speech that he would
eradicate corruption from Lebanese adminstrations on various
levels.

Lawsuit against Yugoslav Leaders -- a Political Plot
</P>
<P>
The Lawsuit against Yugoslav leaders by the United States and a

Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful Solution of Kashmir Issue Called
</P>
<P>
China called on India and Pakistan to settle their divergence
through peaceful dialogues in a "frank and patient" spirit.
</P>
<P>
The top priority at the moment is that both India and Pakistan
exercise restraint and relax the current tense situation, a
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday. He described
both India and Pakistan as friendly neighbors of China, saying
China is closely following the development of the situation there.
</P>
<P>

<P>
Comprehensive, Thorough and Fair Investigation of the Bombing

<HEADLINE> Kenya Arrests 30 Corrupted Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police have raided the
Attorney- General's Chambers and the Immigration Department in a
crackdown on corrupt civil servants.
</P>
<P>
They arrested 30 government officials and seized an unknown
amount of money and volumes of documents, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
About 30 detectives from the Criminal Investigation Department
 headquarters simultaneously struck at the Registrar of Companies
offices and the Immigration Department in surprise raids Friday.
</P>
<P>
The move came four days after Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
announced a new initiative to rid the country of corruption
during June 1 Madakara (internal self-rule) Day celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Moi said tough measures, including the speedy prosecution of
corrupt government officials, would be instituted to ensure the
vice was eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Peter Kimanthi said 21 people were arrested
from the civil registry and six from the registrar of companies
and three others were arrested from the Immigration Department.
</P>
<P>
Forged birth certificates were confiscated as well as fake
business registration certificates which were recovered from the
company registrar. Those arrested were mostly clerks and
sub-ordinate staff members, Kimanthi said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time, for many years, such an operation was
carried out in any government department in the east African
country.

<HEADLINE> PAL Calls for Public Support for Rehabilitation Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The support of the riding public is
critical if Philippine Airlines (PAL) is to successfully complete
its 10-year rehabilitation process, following the infusion of 200
million U.S. dollars in new capital into the airline, PAL Chief
Avelino L. Zapant said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The 200-million dollar investment is just the first step in a
long and difficult journey for PAL. We have to make the
rehabilitation plan work and that is by no means an easy task.
Now, more than ever, we need the full support of the Filipino
people," said PAL President Zapanta in a statement published here.
</P>
<P>
Zapanta said that with all the major stockholders in PAL
rallying behind the national flag carrier, it is up to the riding
public to translate this goodwill into actual sales.
</P>
<P>
"The rehabilitation plan is based on PAL's ability to generate
revenues. If we don't fill our planes with passengers and cargo,
we don't generate revenues. And if we don't generate enough
revenues, we can't pay our creditors. Then we're back to square
one. Everything hinges on the riding public," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PAL chief said that given the significant role of the
airline in the daily life of the nation, the consequences of its
failure would be ruinous for the economy and the country's
reputation in the international community.
</P>
<P>
"Business activity and confidence in the country will be
severely affected if the rehabilitation plan fails. The economy
will suffer, particularly the tourism and trade sectors," Zapanta
added.
</P>
<P>
PAL's rehabilitation plan cleared its final hurdle Friday when
the Securities and Exchange Commission announced the infusion of
200 million dollars in fresh equity -- fulfilling a principal
condition of the airline's creditors, to whom the airline owes 2.2
billion dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
Half of the new capital, or 100 million dollars, was injected
by the existing majority stockholder, the Lucio Tan Group of
Companies. The other half was contributed by Top Wealth
Enterprises Ltd. of Hong Kong, and two local holding companies,
Maxell Holdings Corp. and Richmark Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
The new capital investment realigned the equity structure of
PAL, with the Lucio Tan Group retaining its majority stake at
53.69 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new investors -- Top Wealth Enterprises, Maxell Holdings
and Richmark Holdings -- now hold 35.15 percent. The Philippine
government, which opted to waive its pre-emptive rights to the new
share offering, saw its stake diluted from 14.35 percent to 4.26
percent.

<HEADLINE> San Antonio Beats Portland 85-63 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- In alarmingly rapid regression,
the Portland Trail Blazers lost their shooting touch, their cool
and their season.
</P>
<P>
Failing to take advantage of their home court and the worst
game of the season by Tim Duncan, the Trail Blazers looked awful
in an 85-63 loss to the San Antonio Spurs, who are one win away
from their first trip to the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
Game Four is on Sunday at Portland, where the Blazers have lost
only four times this season. Tow of those setbacks have come to
the Spurs, who have won nine straight playoff games and improved
to 5-0 on the road in the postseason, looking stronger in each
series.
</P>
<P>
Portland managed only 37 points over the last 36 minutes and
shot below 25 percent (19-of-77) from the field, the third-worst
performance in NBA playoff history.
</P>
<P>
The total baskets were the lowest in postseason annals and the
points were second-lowest, surpassed only by Utah's 54-point
nightmare in Game Three of the 1998 NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
With the dominant Duncan on the bench for all but 40 seconds of
the third quarter, the Blazers scored only eight points, the
second-lowest total in playoff history.
</P>
<P>
Jaren Jackson made 6-of-11 3-pointers and scored 19 points.
David Robinson had 15 points, nine rebounds and seven blocks. And
Avery Johnson added 14 points and eight assists.

BANGKOK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- With the participation of Cuba and
Uzbekistan, Thai boxing team can only rank third in the 23rd
King's Cup Boxing tournament, which gets underway here Saturday,
Thailand's Cuban national head coach Juan Fontanial said.

from the tournament.
</P>
<P>
He said the main purpose of the event is to give Thai boxers
exposure so that they will gain valuable experience by competing
with the best in the business.
</P>
<P>
Thai fighters who win gold medals are expected to get 100,000
baht (2,702 U.S. dollars) as a special prize.

Some nine countries, including Cuba, the United States,
Uzbekistan, South Korea, Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Australia
and Thailand, are vying for the trophy.

<HEADLINE> Two Indian Women Await Repatriation in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Two Indian Women, including an
elderly one recently released from jail, are awaiting repatriation
in the Bangladeshi capital city, the Independent newspaper said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two women, Sumki Saha and Putul Ma Moitri, are both
residents of the Indian state of West Bengal and have been staying
for repatriation at Proshanti, the shelter home of the Bangladesh
National Women Lawyers Association (BNWLA), The newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Saha, 25, was rescued by police from human traffickers when she
arrived in Dhaka in February last year. She was soon after handed
over to the BNWLA at Mirpur, in the north part of the city.
</P>
<P>
The report said Saha believed that her Indian parents had taken
her away from southwestern Bangladesh's Jessore district when she
was a little child, and her belief strengthened when she grew up
and her mother began asking her to do household chores during her
undergraduate studies in a Calcutta college.
</P>
<P>
This belief landed her in the hands of some traffickers. When
she escaped from the custody of her abductors, she arrived in the
city and was handed over by the police to the BNWLA.
</P>
<P>
The BNWLA officials contacted officials of their associate
organizations in India and came to know that Saha was the eldest
of three daughters of her parents, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The other woman, 65-year-old Moitri, was released form the
Dhaka Central Jail last Wednesday after police investigators
reportedly found nothing to substantiate their earlier charge that
she was involved in terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
The police picked her up from Dhamrai Thana, 28 kilometers
northwest of here two years ago, suspecting her to be engaged in
terrorist activities, according to a BNWLA official.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka President Urges Global Efforts on Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Saturday urged all nations with a genuine commitment
to solve the emerging environmental issues worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"As we approach the new millennium, we face a range of complex
long-term environmental problems having consequences on the
economic well being and security of nations throughout the world,"
Kumaratunga said in a message to mark the World Environment Day on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The environmental threats include global warming, depletion of
the ozone layer, decline of biodiversity, the loss of soil and
forest, contamination of fresh water supplies, diminishing
fisheries and the flow of toxic substances entering the
environment.
</P>
<P>
"No country, whether developed or developing, can think of
overcoming them alone," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the process of resolving these environment issues, she said
all nations must get together to redress unsustainable lifestyles
of a section of the population and the unacceptable poverty level
of the majority of the population.
</P>
<P>
The World Environment Day is one of the principal vehicles
through which the United Nations stimulates worldwide awareness of
the environment and enhances political attention and action.
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year is "Our Earth, Our Future: Let's Save
it."
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is blessed with numerous natural ecosystems, which
warrants it to go on record as the country having the highest unit
area biological diversity in Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, around 600 flowering plants and about 700 animals have
been listed as threatened in Sri Lanka by the International Union
for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), the
world's largest non-governmental conservation body.

<HEADLINE> More Than 30 Refugees Abducted By Rebels in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 refugees at Mahazi
refugee camp in the northern Uganda's Adjumani district have been
abducted by rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA).
</P>
<P>
Wamala Katumba, commander of Uganda's forth division, confirmed
Friday the abductions by the rebels spearheaded by Joseph Kony,
the New Vision reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said about 20 rebels raided the camp and used their captives
to carry their loot and that the government army was containing
them.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were not a threat to the government troops stationed
in the Gulu district although their vehicles were sometimes
subject to rebels' attacks, he added.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the north last month, President Yoweri
Museveni extended amnesty to all rebels fighting the government if
they stop war and come out peacefully.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Kony was offered a ministerial post, an
offer he turned down immediately.
</P>
<P>
The LRA rebels have been fighting the government since the
National Resistance Movement came to power in 1986. The
government troops have tried to wipe them out but have not
succeeded so far due to the difficult typographic conditions of
the northern part of Uganda.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's environmental conservation
trends are still poor and analysts say the country might suffer
irreversible damage where rehabilitation costs will be very
prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Aanyu, a researcher with the National Environment
Management Authority (NEMA), has said that although the
organization had undertaken great strides in educating the public
about environmental concerns, problems still arise, the New Vision
daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Problems like deforestation, excavation of land for bricks and
the increasing population levels have claimed a great toll on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The problem is further compounded by the most popular belief
that environment is only about vegetation.
</P>
<P>
Simon Muhumuza, public relations officer with Kampala City
Council, was quoted as saying that about 70 percent of the capital
city's garbage is not collected.
</P>
<P>
He said Uganda would join the rest of the world Saturday in the
campaign of environmental conversation.
</P>
<P>
The World Environment Day, to be observed in more than 100
countries in the world, was established by the U.N. General
Assembly on December 15, 1972, as a principal vehicle for
stimulating worldwide environmental awareness. This year's theme

to work with him to avoid financial disaster in the west African
country.
</P>
<P>
He warned when addressing the Nigerian legislature for the
first time Friday that Nigeria's foreign reserves could be
depleted to an alarming level of 256 million U.S. dollars by the
year end if the present expending rate continues.
</P>
<P>
The country had a foreign currency reserve of 4.71 billion U.S.
dollars by January this year, which had already been greatly
dwindled from the about seven billion stock when General
Abdulsalami Abubakar took office in June last year.
</P>
<P>
The president asked the joint session of the National Assembly
to take " immediate actions" with him to stop the exhaustion of
the country's foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
The new Nigerian government is also confronted with the huge
task of reducing the burgeoning budget deficit, which amounts to
nearly 2.7 billion U.S. dollars and was inherited from the
Abubakar administration.
</P>
<P>
The president proposed rationalizing the bloated public sector,
freezing the extra-budgetary spending, reducing corruption and
wastes as anti-crisis measures.
</P>
<P>
Those to be retrenched would be "re-trained and re-positioned"
under an agreement arrangement with the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and some donor agencies, said the
president nearly a week after being sworn in.
</P>
<P>
The freeze on extra-budgetary spending will be geared not only
toward fiscal discipline but to save some 540 million U.S.
dollars as well, said Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
He said the 1999 budget will be reviewed in line with the
policy thrust of his administration and the country's economic
realities.
</P>
<P>
In order to stop the abuse of public funds, Obasanjo said
public expenditure will be under government's strict financial
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo reiterated his election promise of anti-corruption,
saying a bill on this will be sent to the legislature within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The bill will provide the framework for penalizing corrupt
public servants, said the president.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Aims to Draw 8.8 Million Tourists in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand aims to attract 8.8
million tourist arrivals in the year 2000 and receive 343.5
billion baht (9.28 billion U.S. dollars) in revenue, the Tourism
Authority of Thailand (TAT) said in a report on plans for the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
The report, available on Saturday, said the Amazing Thailand
1998-1999 campaign was so successful that it will be carried on
through 2000 with a new slogan "Enchantment for the Next
Millennium."
</P>
<P>
In 1998 alone, Thailand saw 7.79 million tourist arrivals and
received 275 billion baht (6.4 billion dollars) in revenue.
</P>
<P>
In the new millennium, TAT would highlight facilities for
cruising, natural health care and adventure holidays as well as
the country's Buddhist tradition to attract visitors, the report
quoted TAT Governor Seeree Wangpaichitr as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Thailand Travel Mart would be resurrected in a bid to
attract long-term buyers and sellers of holiday packages, and TAT
was also planning a conference on the outlook for global tourism
in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
TAT has been allocated a budget of 2.8 billion baht (75.7
million dollars) for the 2000 fiscal year, of which 1.2 billion
baht (32.4 million dollars) will be set aside for marketing
activities worldwide.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2.13 million foreign tourist arrivals were recorded
at the Bangkok International Airport in the first four months this
year, a rise of 8.8 percent compared with the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
TAT expected that some eight million foreign tourists will
arrive in Thailand this year, bringing the country 300 billion
baht (8.1 billion dollars) in revenue.

<HEADLINE> Sudirman Cup Underlines Deficiencies, Says PBSI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has yet to reach the
stage where it can dominate in the Sudirman Cup mixed team event
because it is only strong on the men's side, while the women
remain a weak link.
</P>
<P>
This conclusion was, once again, announced by Badminton
Association of Indonesia (PBSI) training director Christian
Hadinata on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Sudirman Cup emphasizes five different events. Those
events reflect the real strength of a badminton country. If we are
only strong in one event and weak in another, it shows that the
development (of badminton) in our country is not good," Christian
was quoted by The Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Sudirman Cup, staged for the first time in Jakarta in 1989,
features men's and women's singles and men's, women's and mixed
doubles. Each participating country must compete in each of the
five events.
</P>
<P>
So far, only three countries have won the trophy. They are
Indonesia in 1989, South Korea in 1991 and 1993 and China in 1995,
1997 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
In last month's Sudirman Cup, Indonesia failed to reach the
finals for the second time after being defeated by host Denmark.
Indonesia won the men's doubles and mixed doubles but lost in the
women's and men's singles and the women's doubles.
</P>
<P>
Christian said Indonesian shuttlers must work harder,
particularly the women, to improve their skills before the country
can again win the event.
</P>
<P>
"There's no way we can win if we don't have key players in all
five events," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Mar Final Election Campaigns in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Clashes marred final election
campaigns in several areas in Indonesia on Friday, The Jakarta
Post said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Residents and onlookers jeered and stoned ruling Golkar Party
supporters during their final campaign rallies on Friday in
Jakarta and several provinces.
</P>
<P>
At least 11 were injured during a Golkar rally in Manado, North
Sulawesi, as supporters of other parties pelted Golkar supporters
with rocks and attacked them with sharp weapons.
</P>
<P>
Riot troops fired warning shots to disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
In Senen, Central Jakarta, riot troops were forced to fire a
barrage of warning shots following the burning of a motorcycle
belonging to a Golkar supporter and dozens of flags, as Golkar
supporters became embroiled in an altercation with residents.
</P>
<P>
Golkar supporters were also stoned by unknown people in
Wonogiri regency in Central Java, with three injured and one
motorcycle damaged.
</P>
<P>
Despite the poor reception, Golkar Party Chairman Akbar Tanjung
and other Golkar officials expressed confidence in winning the
elections. From 1971 to 1997, Golkar won every general election by
a landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
In West Nusa Tenggara, The United Development Party's (PPP)
last round of campaigning was marred by a clash in which at least
four were injured and two vehicles were damaged.
</P>
<P>
It was the only recorded violent incident in the province
during the campaign which began on May 19 in the country.
</P>
<P>
The last campaign of PPP in Wonosobo, Central Java, also
witnessed a clash between thousands of supporters with those of
the National Awakening Party (PKB). Twelve people were injured and
three cars and five motorcycles were damaged.
</P>
<P>
Three PKB supporters sustained slash wounds in a clash with PPP
supporters in Kudus, Central Java, on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, dozens of the Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle supporters were pelted by unidentified people when
passing the Tanon district in Sragen regency, Central Java, with
three of them injured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, clashes in the three rounds of campaigning in
Ujungpandang, South Sulawesi, have led to one death, three people
in comas and eight still undergoing hospital treatment.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara News Agency, at least nine supporters of
the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle were killed and dozens
of others injured after the truck in which they were traveling hit
a telephone pole and a tree in Jember, East Java, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The truck reportedly carried some 60 supporters of the party. A
source said the party supporters were on their way home from
Yosowilangun where they attended the party's campaign rally.
</P>
<P>
June 4 is the last day of the parties' campaigning period and
the remaining two days before polling day on June 7 have been
designated as a "cooling-off" period.
</P>
<P>
General Elections Commission Chairman Rudini Friday met
President B.J. Habibie to report that the country in general is
ready for the polling.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations will open at 8 a.m. local time and close at 2
p.m. local time on Monday. The government has deployed a massive
number of security forces to maintain law and order and ensure
"fair and democratic" elections.

<HEADLINE> 90,000 Alien Workers in Thailand to be Repatriated </HEADLINE>

BANGKOK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Labor Ministry is firm on
its decision not to renew the work permits for about 90,000
foreigners which expire on August 4.
</P>
<P>
Authorities would help employers recruit Thais to fill the job
vacancies after the alien workers, most of them from Myanmar, are
repatriated, the Bangkok Post Saturday quoted Labor Minister
Sompong Amornvivat as saying.
</P>
<P>
But rubber and sugar cane planting, pig farms, rice mills,
fisheries and related businesses would be allowed to continue
employing alien labor.
</P>
<P>
These businesses could seek to extend work permits for foreign
workers before August 4, but only if they could prove that no Thai
workers were available.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Basket Price Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan oil basket price
wend down 0.32 U.S. dollars Friday to 12.95 dollars per barrel,
announced the Mines and Energy Ministry (MEM).
</P>
<P>
In its weekly statistics bulletin, the MEM attributed the drop
to the operation reduction in the refineries.
</P>
<P>
Other factors contributing to the falling oil prices included
the increase of oil exports by Iraq during the second semester of
this year, after Iraq accepted the United Nations conditions for
the sixth phase of the program of exports for humanitarian
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures, subject to revision, show that the
Venezuelan oil basket average price so far this year amounts to 11.
30 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The price of the Venezuelan crude closed the year 1998 with an
average of 10.57 dollars per barrel, far below the 16.32 dollars
reached in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) closed
the week with an average of 14.45 dollars per barrel, a 0.14-
dollar drop compared to the previous week, according to the MEM
bulletin.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Says He's Happier After Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan, who retired from
NBA six months ago, said Friday he's a happier person after
quitting playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
"I smile a lot more than I used to. I'm a much happier person
than a year or two ago because the pressures are different," he
said. "The pressures are more about life, but they're fun pressure.
Now all I have to pay attention to is my family and my kids."
</P>
<P>
Jordan said he was very happy with his decision. His life in
retirement includes spending time with his wife, Juanita, and
their children, traveling, playing golf, and developing new
business ventures.
</P>
<P>
He says he helps his kids with their homework, puts them to bed,
and eats breakfast and dinner with his family, activities he never
had time for during his playing days.
</P>
<P>
Jordan says he watches very little of the NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
"As much as I can stay away from it, the easier the ties are
broken," Jordan said. "I don't want to be in a situation that I
can't deal with being away from it, so I stay away from it."
</P>
<P>
"I must get away from it so that people can leave that part of
my life in the past. The only exercise I've had over the last
month or two months is walking in Ireland and Scotland on the golf
course," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan said his attempt two months ago to buy a half-interest
in the Charlotte Hornets is dead.
</P>
<P>
"Will that ever change? Maybe, but I'm not going to search it
out," he said. "I'm happy with the things I'm involved in."

<HEADLINE> China Launches Eco-Protection Drive (RPT) (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China kicked off a nationwide drive
on ecological protection on the World Environment Day by erecting
a monument bearing the words "Source of Yangtze River" inscribed
by Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the Tuotuo River, a major
tributary of Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Today is the 27th World Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
A grand ceremony for erecting the monument will be jointly held
by five government departments headed by the State Environment
Protection Bureau at the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau today.
</P>
<P>
The move shows that China's drive to improve water conservation
and environment protection on its major rivers, especially the
Yangtze and Yellow rivers, the country's first and second longest,
has entered a higher stage.
</P>
<P>
the drive aims at enhancing the whole nation's awareness of the
need to protect environment at the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Ecological environment in areas where the two longest river
systems originate has become the focus of attention of all walks
of life in China in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, a dozen of scientific study
groups composed of Chinese and overseas specialists have carried
out various surveys at heads of major rivers.
</P>
<P>
The 6,300-km Yangtze River rises in the Tanggula Mountain Range
and runs through 11 provinces, autonomous regions and cities,
covering a drainage area of 1.8 million square kilometers,
accounting for one-fifth of the national total and with a
population of 400 million, or one-third of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Due to "greenhouse effect" and such man-made destruction as
rampant and indiscriminative tree-felling and excessive washing
for gold as well as lack of funds for grassland development, the
ecological environment at the river's source area has deteriorated
quickly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the forest coverage rate at
the upper reaches of Yangtze was only two percent, and soil
erosion is common to more than 10 million hectares of land there.
The acreage of desert encroachment has expanded to 350,000 ha. and
is sprawling at an annual rate of 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Soil erosion has also resulted in an annual increase of silt,
causing a rising of riverbed and serious threats of flooding in
the lower sections of the river.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Optimistic About Ties With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov
said Friday he is optimistic about relations between his country
and Russia as he is preparing for an official visit to Russia on
June 6-8.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Russian reporters, Kostov described the
current state of bilateral ties as hopeful, adding he expected
early solutions to problems both countries are concerned with.
</P>
<P>
The falling bilateral trade, with Bulgaria registering a yearly
deficit of over 500 million U.S. dollars, is seen as a prominent
problem facing the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Last year the two countries signed a protocol on gas supply.
Last March, Bulgaria was included in Russia's preferential customs
system, and then Russia promised to pay off its debt of 100
million dollars to Bulgaria within two years.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Group Says NATO Creates Ecology Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish Ecology Movement
organization on Friday awarded the title of "top environmentalists
" to NATO leaders for their "exceptional contribution" to the
destruction of ecology in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
In a report released on the eve of the World Environment Day,
the group said NATO created a millennium-lasting ecology disaster
in its war on Yugoslavia. Indiscriminate bombings of oil
refineries and fuel depots have produced a thick polluted air
layer over not only Yugoslavia itself but also neighboring
Bulgaria and Romania.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, NATO used depleted uranium missiles in its strikes,
leading to serious soil contamination across the Balkans which may
last for another millennium and affect generations to come, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ecology Movement said at a press conference
here Friday that radiation from depleted uranium bombs is
extremely harmful to people's health. At least one in a thousand
people in the Balkans would be struck by some kind of cancer
because of this radiation.
</P>
<P>
He said it would take 50,000 to 100,000 tons of earthwork to
clear up and bury dangerous radiators in the Balkans after the war.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, members of the Ecology Movement set up a huge
poster at the door of the Defense Ministry building, which says "
Stop the War, Observe the World Environment Day."

<HEADLINE> Central America Calls for Faster Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Federation of Industrial
Chambers of Central America (FICCA) on Friday called for a faster
economic integration process of the region.
</P>
<P>
FICCA President, Chairman of Costa Rican Chamber of Industries
Marco Vinicio Ruiz, said the Central American Common Market is a
key factor in the development of the industries.
</P>
<P>
In a report presented to Costa Rican President Miguel Angel
Rodriguez, Ruiz called for a reform in the customs sector and the
creation of a regional council of industry modernization.
</P>
<P>
Ruiz said he was worried by unilateral tariffs elimination,
referring to decisions made by some countries of the region to cut
the agreed tariffs ceiling from 15 percent to 10.
</P>
<P>
Ruiz urged a more detailed study of the free trade agreement
which the region is negotiating with Chile. Costa Rica and Chile
are especially interested in that agreement.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume among Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua,
and Costa Rica was 2.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, said FICCA.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The 16th Binational Commission
Meeting between Mexico and the United States was inaugurated at
the Mexican Foreign Ministry here Friday morning..
</P>
<P>
The opening session was presided over by Mexican Foreign
Minister Rosario Green, and United States Attorney General Janet
Reno on behalf of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
canceled her trip to this city because of recent important events
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Green said in her speech that bilateral relations, from a
distant neighborhood to an active interaction, have undergone a
dramatic turnaround in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Mexico and the United States must reduce
disagreements and promote cooperation and complementarity, because
both countries face many challenges that none of them could solve
by itself in an adequate manner, said Green.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno proposed to expand her
country's relations with Mexico, as well as the improvement of law
enforcement and the reduction of violence along the common border.
</P>
<P>
She admitted that as in any relation, there are disagreements,
but that the challenge is to guarantee that the differences will
not cause a lack of understanding. The delegations of the two
countries will discuss a gamut of issues related to the
environment, the war against drugs, immigration and free trade.
</P>
<P>
The 16th Binational Commission Meeting will be divided into 16
workshops to discuss the same number of themes, according to a
communique from the Mexican Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be closed in the afternoon, after both
delegation sign some agreements.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1983, the commission is one of the most important
links between the two countries sharing a common border of more
than 3,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
As a reflection of the importance and complexity of the
relationship, the commitment of annual, bilateral Cabinet-level
meetings with Mexico is "almost unique" in U.S. foreign policy,
said U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Jeffrey Davidow on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Benefit From Government Grain Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in northeast China's
Liaoning Province have now sold 8.56 billion kilograms of surplus
grain from 1998 to the government.
</P>
<P>
The province had a good harvest of over 18 billion kilograms
last year. And the local government has ensured its control over
grain marketing and kindled farmers' enthusiasm for grain
production by sticking to the unlimited purchase of the surplus at
protected prices.
</P>
<P>
"In the past two-thirds of the surplus grain were bought by
individual purchasers," said Wang Chunhai, a town official in
charge of grain purchase. And the grain prices had been on the
decrease for several years, which had dampened the farmers'
initiative for grain production.
</P>
<P>
But now, "more than 20,000 kilograms of surplus grain has been
stored in the town barns this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Baolin, head of the Liaoning Provincial Grain Bureau,
said that they have improved the administration of grain marketing
by fixing the price last year, and revoking the purchase
certificates of over 380 individual grain purchasers.
</P>
<P>
With these measures among others taken, the 1998 income per mu
(0.067 hectare) for the farmers reached an average of 178 yuan (
about 21.4 U.S. dollars) with their profits up 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The reform in grain marketing has brought profits to us. I
once worried about the sale of surplus grain because of the low
prices and the uncertainty of individual buyers. But this year, I
have sold all my 7,500 kilograms of surplus grain to the
government." said Song Youyu, a farmer in the province's Fuxin
County.
</P>
<P>
The reform has in return further encouraged the province's
grain production. The director of the Liaoning Agricultural
Department, Li Wenke, said that the total sowing area of the
province this year reached three million hectares, and many
farmers have increased their input, paying greater attention to
the needs of the grain market.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Senator Piedad
Cordoba was released Friday after being held hostage for 14 days
by the right-wing United Self-Defenses of Colombia, Radio Caracol
reported.
</P>
<P>
The paramilitary group delivered Cordoba to a humanity
commission in the northwest of the country, in the presence of two
Caracol newsmen.
</P>
<P>
The senator was kidnapped on May 21 by a commando of more than
15 armed men from a Medellin clinic, where she was visiting a
hospitalized friend.
</P>
<P>
Cordoba, member of a congressional peace commission, had
reportedly met several times with leaders of a leading leftist
rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers said that the abduction of Cordoba was intended
to send a "peace message" to the government.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the government and the leftist
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are expected to be resumed
soon after months of stalemate.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Confirms Talks on Energy Cooperation With Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Energy and Mines
Minister Ali Rodriguez confirmed Friday that his country is in
talks with Cuba for a possible oil deal.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said the negotiations would permit Cuba to receive
oil supply under a joint agreement between Venezuela and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Following a visit here by Cuban oil officials soon after
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's inauguration in February, a
high-level delegation of the state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela S.A. visited Cuba in May, and the head of the Cuban
state oil company Fidel Rivera Prieto is coming soon for further
talks.
</P>
<P>
Besides supplying crude oil to Cuba, the two sides also studied
the possibility of allowing Venezuela to explore oil and invest in
oil refinery in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is subject to strict sanctions by the United States and
has been desperately short of oil since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that under the so-called Pact of San Jose,
Venezuela and Mexico provide oil under easy payment conditions to
11 Caribbean and Central America countries. Cuba, now excluded
from the group, will soon be covered, he added.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Mexico agreed to invest 200 million U.S. dollars in
Cuba's Cienfuegos refinery, which also involved an oil supply
agreement. But that deal fell apart on financial problems.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Calls for Immediate Halt to NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said Friday that NATO should immediately stop its bombing of
Yugoslavia as it would be unreasonable not to do so with
Belgrade's acceptance of the Group of Eight peace proposals.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the newspaper La Stampa, Dini said, "
Considering the agreement already reached in Belgrade, strikes on
Yugoslav towns and civilian facilities should not continue. It
would be unreasonable not to stop the bombings."
</P>
<P>
Asked on what would be the first thing for Italy to do after
the war, he said it would contribute to the implementation of the
peace deal by sending in its troops.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Secretary of the ruling Democratic Party of
the Left Walter Veltroni said in Florence that when peace was
making its way, it would be senseless to continue bombing.
</P>
<P>
However, media reports here said movements at NATO's Aviano
military base in northern Italy were going on as before, "as if
nothing had been changed between Yugoslavia and NATO." More than
100 take-offs were registered in the past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
A report by the ANSA news agency compared the military base to
a complicated machine, which would not be easily stopped once it
was set off.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Eco-Protection Drive (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China kicked off a nationwide drive
on ecological protection on the World Environment Day by erecting
a monument bearing the words "Source of Yangtze River" inscribed
by Chinese Present Jiang Zemin at the Tuotuo River, a major
tributary of Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Today is the 27th World Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
A grand ceremony for erecting the monument will be jointly held
by five government departments headed by the State Environment
Protection Bureau at the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau today.
</P>
<P>
The move shows that China's drive to improve water conservation
and environment protection on its major rivers, especially the
Yangtze and Yellow rivers, the country's first and second longest,
has entered a higher stage.
</P>
<P>
the drive aims at enhancing the whole nation's awareness of the
need to protect environment at the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Ecological environment in areas where the two longest river
systems originate has become the focus of attention of all walks
of life in China in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, a dozen of scientific study
groups composed of Chinese and overseas specialists have carried
out various surveys at heads of major rivers.
</P>
<P>
The 6,300-km Yangtze River rises in the Tanggula Mountain Range
and runs through 11 provinces, autonomous regions and cities,
covering a drainage area of 1.8 million square kilometers,
accounting for one-fifth of the national total and with a
population of 400 million, or one-third of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Due to "greenhouse effect" and such man-made destruction as
rampant and indiscriminative tree-felling and excessive washing
for gold as well as lack of funds for grassland development, the
ecological environment at the river's source area has deteriorated
quickly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the forest coverage rate at
the upper reaches of Yangtze was only two percent, and soil
erosion is common to more than 10 million hectares of land there.
The acreage of desert encroachment has expanded to 350,000 ha. and
is sprawling at an annual rate of 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Soil erosion has also resulted in an annual increase of silt,
causing a rising of riverbed and serious threats of flooding in
the lower sections of the river.

WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal agnets raided the
offices of boxing promoter Don King on Firday as part of an
investigation into whether the IBF sold rankings and arranged
fights for kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
According to a press report here today, FBI agents were looking
for records involving the International Boxing Federation, Don
King Productions and Monarch Productions, a company run by King's
son, Carl.
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury has been investigating the IBF for several
months -- even before the disputed draw in March between Evander
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I can tell you is we are serving search
warrants on his offices as part of an ongoing investigation," FBI
spokesman Mike Faregas said.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for IBF president Bob Lee Sr., said Friday he knew
nothing about the FBI raid and refused to say what he knew about
King's possible involvement.

<HEADLINE> Orlando Magic to Name Doc Rivers New Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Orlando Magic will name Doc
Rivers as their new ocach by Monday, according to a report from
the Orlando Sentinel here today.
</P>
<P>
Rivers met with team officials over the last two days and
expected to sign a four-year deal worth $6 million.
</P>
<P>
Rivers was regarded by most NBA executives as a strong general
manager or coaching candidate since he retired as a player in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Before hiring George Karl last season, the Milwaukee Bucks
offered Rivers a front office position. After firing general
manager Ernie Grunfeld in late April, the New York Knicks
contacted Rivers to gauge his interest in the job.
</P>
<P>
But Rivers, who is a basketball analyst for TNT, has admitted
to preferring a coaching position.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Wizards also had expressed interest in Rivers as
a possible coaching candidate.
</P>
<P>
Rivers, 37, would become the second-youngest coach in the NBA.
Jeff Van Gundy of the New York Knicks is also 37, but three months
younger than River.
</P>
<P>
The Magic coaching position became vacant when Chuck Daly
resigned on May 24. The 68-year-old Daly guided the Magic to a 33-
17 record and the third seed in the Eastern Conference this season,
but they were ousted by the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round
of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Rivers' first order of business will be try to convince star
guard Penny Hardaway to re-sign with the Magic. Hardaway is
eligible for free-agency in July and has hinted he may leave the
team.

PANAMA CITY, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of Colombia,
Chile, Peru, Panama, and Ecuador agreed Friday to develop
environmental education programs to combat the serious atmospheric
pollution on the American continent.
</P>
<P>
The delegates of the five countries discussed during their
three-day meeting the need of educating their governments and
populations on the feasibility to preserve their natural resources.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the advances in the programs of education, public
awareness, and training in the field of sustainable development
approved by the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Conference, were discussed
during the meeting, called "Forum for the Environmental Education
in the Southeast Pacific."
</P>
<P>
Attending the regional forum were also experts from the United
Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Union for Nature
Preservation of Nature (WUNP) and the South Pacific Permanent
Commission (SPPC).
</P>
<P>
UNEP representative for Latin America Enrique Leff said during
the discussions that the region's environmental problems are very
serious and endanger human survival.
</P>
<P>
Leff said that the accelerated environmental pollution causes
epidemics, skin cancer, respiratory diseases, and poisoning with
insecticides.
</P>
<P>
Environmental contamination is not limited to the cities, but
also affects the rural areas, where the spreading of toxic
substances used in agriculture activities causes serious problems,
Leff added.

<P>
Last year's flooding claimed more than 3,000 lives, inundated
21 million hectares of farmland, destroyed nearly five million
homes and resulted in direct economic losses of about 20.8 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A senior government official stressed that economic growth
should be effected in no way at the expense of environment
anywhere and at any time, and that officials at all levels must
carry out to the letter the measures necessary for improving the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the latest statistics, he said that 34.25 million
hectares of trees have been planted in the country, with the
current national average vegetation standing at about 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Projects fostering shelter forests along the middle and upper
reaches of the Yangtze River have been launched. The partially
completed first-phase project covers an area of 4.73 million
hectares.
</P>
<P>
China planted trees on an area of 5.2 million ha last year to
bring the country's total forest area to 130 million ha. It is
striving to increase its forest coverage rate to 19 percent and
its urban vegetation to 35 percent by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, the forest coverage rate in the
afforested area in the north, northeast and northwest China should
exceed 10 percent, with 30 percent of the desertified land
improved, 50 percent of soil-eroded area under effective control,
and more than 80 percent of farmland brought under the protection
by criss-crossed forest shelters.

dynasties from the 1,400-year old Yaozhou Kiln in northwest
China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The Yaozhou Kiln was built in the sixth century in the Tang
Dynasty (618-907). As one of the most famous kilns in north China,
the Yaozhou Kiln experienced its prosperous time over the
following 700 years in the Tang Dynasty, Five Dynasties (907-960),
Song Dynasty (960-1279), Jin Dynasty (1115-1234), Yuan Dynasty (
1271-1368) and Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
So far, some 21 workshops, four stoves and 28 ash pits have
been unearthed over the 2,000-square meter ruined site of the kiln.
</P>
<P>
The largest workshop among the relics covers an area of 85
square meters and is 24.5 meters long, four meters wide and 2.6
meters high. It can be dated back to the Song Dynasty, according
to an archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
The walls of the workshop were made of bricks and stones, the
expert said, adding that archaeologists have found two coins of
the dynasty in the fire tunnel of the workshop.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, more than 500 pieces of porcelain relics have
been excavated. Most of them are celadon articles, the others
include white porcelain, and glazes in black, brown, white plus a
three color glaze.
</P>
<P>
The discovery will provide valuable clues for study on the
country's history and development of porcelain production.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Tax administrations in north
China province of Hebei have been ordered to return cars, money
and other borrowings to businesses in a move to rebuild the image
of its tax officials in the province.
</P>
<P>
The image rebuilding program is aimed at fighting corruption
and improving tax collection in Hebei. Internal control is also
expected to be tightened in particular concerning the management
of state funds, automobiles, property, and other fixed assets of
the tax sector.
</P>
<P>
Statistics have shown that the provincial tax administrations
have borrowed from businesses at least 43.88 million yuan, 45
automobiles, and a large number of fax machines, mobile phones and
power generators.
</P>
<P>
"These improper activities by tax collectors have affected the
tax collection and resulted in rampant evasion of taxes and a
drain on state revenue," said a provincial tax official.
</P>
<P>
All the tax administrations are ordered to return what they
have borrowed from businesses before the end of June. A provincial
examination will be conducted in the tax sector after July, and
officials who are discovered to have stepped out of line will be
fired and even taken to court.

XINING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 successful cataract
operations have been carried out since May 16 on the "Lifeline
Express", a three-car hospital train donated by the people of Hong
Kong to the inland areas, ophthamologists here said.
</P>
<P>
In total some 3,800 blind people have had their eyesight
restored since the train was introduced in the summer of 1997, an
average of twenty operations a day. Local doctors have also been
given specialist training in eye care.
</P>
<P>
The train was presented to China's inland areas at a ceremony
officiated by Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, to mark Hong Kong's return to the
motherland in July of 1997. It operates with donations made by
Hong Kong residents and has been touring China's Qinghai Province
in the last two months.

It began its mercy mission tour to Fuyang, east China's Anhui

Huangpo in Hubei, Longyan and Sanming in Fujian and Jinhua and
Baise in Guangxi. Qinghai was the ninth destination.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Passenger Plane Crash Probe Finds System Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Investigators said Friday
that two systems designed to slow down a plane during landings may
have malfunctioned in the recent crash of an American Airlines
passenger plane.
</P>
<P>
The investigators will interview the co-pilot of Flight 1420,
First Officer Michael Origel, the only survivor among the cockpit
crew.
</P>
<P>
Nine people, including the pilot, were killed and 83 others
injured as an American Airlines flight with 145 people aboard
skidded off a rain-slicken runway, broke apart and burst into
flames in Arkansas State of the United States Tuesday, reports
reaching here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The flight, a Super MD-80, had 139 passengers and six crew
members and was due to arrive in Little Rock National Airport at
9:41 p.m.(local time). The flight from Dallas of Texas State was
delayed for more than two hours and arrived just as the storm was
hitting Little Rock, capital of Arkansas State, with lightning,
hail and winds gusting to nearly 90 mph (145 kph).
</P>
<P>
George Black, a spokesman for the National Transportation
Safety Board (NTSB), said a preliminary read of the data recorder
information indicates the slats did not go up automatically as
they should have when the airplane touched down.
</P>
<P>
Black also said that the investigators found the cockpit lever
that activates the spoilers in the wrong position but said it may
have been jarred by the crash.
</P>
<P>
The early black box data suggested the reverse thrusters may
have not fired steadily after landing, which would have been the
usual procedure, he said.
</P>
<P>
The investigators have also questioned why the crew decided to
land just as the most severe level of thunderstorm neared the
airport despite getting a steady stream of weather updates from
the airport tower.

ROME, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government Friday launched
a reform that will eventually cut the number of ministries from 26
to just eleven.
</P>
<P>
The reform will be achieved by incorporating some ministries

<P>
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema has been a strong
proponent of the move as a way of achieving a more wide and
efficient executive.

Italian government source said that no changes are envisaged
for the interior, foreign, justice and defense ministries.

<P>
Two economic ministries will be created, one merging the
treasury and finance ministries, the other merging the
communications, industry, farm and foreign trade ministries.
</P>
<P>
The labor ministry will be merged with that of social policy,
health and social solidarity. The education ministry will be

<P>
NEW YORK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stock prices rose
sharply Friday as the government's employment report eased
investors' fears about higher inflational and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 136.15 at
10,799.84. The index gained 85 points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 28.21 at 1,327.75 while the technology
heavy Nasdaq index rose 75.02 at 2,478.34.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that despite the unemployment
drop to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent in May, only 11,000 new
jobs were created in the same month, far below the 225,000
expected by economists. The report impressed investors because
it gave a sign that the U.S. economy is not overheating.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve warned earlier that it would raise
interest rates to cool off the economy if inflation is building
up. The warning had pulled the market down.
</P>
<P>
Today's sharp rise in stock prices was also attributed to
bargain hunting. Since hitting a record high on May 13, the Dow
index lost about 4 percent and the Nasdaq was down more than 9
percent from its all-time high on April 26.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 10.32 at 634.52 and the

<P>
The authors of the report were "incompetent in the field

for truth" by releasing such a report, Rarouche added.
</P>
<P>
Rarouche's spokesman Debra Freeman, speaking at a press
conference here Wednesday, said the Cox report is "absolutely
and completely ridiculous" and "it's hard for credible and
knowledgeable people to accept".
</P>
<P>
"The intention of the Cox Committee is to sabotage and destroy
President Clinton's state policy of strategic partnership with
China," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, X. Drew Liu, a scholar of China Strategic Institute
here, said the Cox report "may have done more damages than good to
the U.S. national interest due to some unintended consequences in
a long run".
</P>
<P>
One collateral damage of the report is felt by the ethnic
Chinese community who have constituted an indispensable part of
the brain and energy that keep the U.S. in the leading edge in
defense research and development, Liu said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Now many among them think their loyalty to this country is

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Friday that it has approved a loan of 16 million U.S. dollars and
a credit of 30 million dollars to support the Fourth Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Project in China.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, China has made significant gains in water
supply to rural areas, ranging from basic water source protection
to piped water supply to households, the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"But despite recent progress, more than 450 million rural
Chinese continue to draw water from unsafe sources or endure
insufficient supplies," said George Plant, task manager for the
project.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project is part of
a series of World Bank water and sanitation projects which aim to
complement China's efforts in improving rural water supply and
sanitation, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The project provides financing to four provinces -- Anhui,
Fujian, Guizhou, and Hainan -- which will combine the bank funds
with modest subsidies to provide new water supplies to villages in
poor counties.
</P>
<P>
The loan would be at the bank's standard interest rate for
LIBOR-based U.S. dollar single-currency loans, with a maturity of
20 years, including a five-year grace period. The credit would be
provided by the International Development Association (IDA), World
Bank's concessionary lending arm, on standard IDA terms with 35
years' maturity.

<HEADLINE> Canada, U.S. Sign Agreement on Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States
formally signed an agreement Friday ending the contentious
magazine dispute.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the United States won't take any
retaliatory trade action against Canada in response to Bill C-55.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, expected to be passed next week in the
Commons, Canada's lower house of parliament, is intended to
protect domestic publishers from Canadian editions of American
magazines, known as split-runs. Split-runs are seen as a threat
because they cost little to produce and can offer lower
advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
When Canada moved to ban split-runs, Americans threatened to
retaliate with trade sanction in areas such as steel and lumber.
</P>
<P>
After eight months of negotiations, the two countries agreed to
concessions last week.
</P>
<P>
The compromise would allow American publishers that produce
Canadian magazines to print up to 18 percent Canadian advertising
per issue, and the levels would be phased in over three years,
with 12 percent in first year, 15 in the second and 18 in the
third.
