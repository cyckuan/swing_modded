<HEADLINE> Van Dyken Rehabs Shoulder in Comeback Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. swimmer Amy Van Dyken,
who won four gold medals in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and became
the closest thing swimming has to a media icon, is betting she
will return to the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
She is slowly working her way back from June surgery on her
right shoulder, and a week ago she began gentle swimming in a
pool near her home.
</P>
<P>
By early next month, she plans to be back at the Olympic
Training Center in Colorado Springs, working toward a return to
competition this spring, national championships and possibly the
Pan Pacific Championships in the summer and the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Van Dyken, 25, thinks she is on schedule, but she says the
Sydney Olympics, which once seemed far away, now are approaching
like a freight train.
</P>
<P>
"The clock is ticking," she said. "I'm used to training a
certain amount of hours each day, and it doesn't feel right to
have all this spare time. I'm starting to feel some urgency."
</P>
<P>
Van Dyken has been working out since her surgery with mixed
results. "It's more painful and complex than I originally
envisioned," she says. "I lift weights and it's so depressing. My
left side looks like great, and my right side looks like a
4-year-old's. On the bright side, I have discovered that I can
run, not well, but I can run."

<P>
LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson and his American counterpart, William Cohen, Tuesday
threatened to use force against Iraq if Baghdad refuses to reverse
its decision to suspend all cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Robertson held one-hour emergency talks in London with Defense
Secretary Cohen, who is on a tour of European and Gulf allies, to
exchange views on the latest developments of the stand-off between
Iraq and the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The British Ministry of Defense said in a statement issued
after the talks that two ministers concurred that Iraq had to
reverse its weekend decision to stop cooperating with U.N.
inspectors looking for weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"George Robertson and Bill Cohen agreed that all options
remained on the table, including the use of force if required to
get (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein to submit to the will of the
United Nations," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed, "Saddam Hussein has to realize that
full compliance with the U.N. is the only way open to Iraq to
achieve the lifting of sanctions."
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced over the weekend that it decided to halt all
cooperation with the inspectors until a definite timetable was
laid out to lift the various sanctions against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Trade Account Improves 3.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's trade account
improved slightly by 3.5 percent from a deficit of 83.2 million U.S.
Dollars in August to that of 80.3 million U.S. Dollars during
September.
</P>
<P>
The decline in import bill by four percent that offset the
effect of 4.9 percent decrease in export earnings, is responsible for
this improvement, according to a latest report released by the Bank of
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in the import bill was mainly a result of a decline
in imports of intermediate and consumer goods, while the decrease
in export earnings was primarily due to poor performance of the
non-traditional sector, the bank said in a monthly economic review.
</P>
<P>
For the year ending September 1998, the trade account worsened,
recording a deficit of 805 million U.S. Dollars, compared with a
deficit of 594 million U.S. Dollars recorded during the corresponding
period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The trade account worsened mainly due to a significant decline of
export earnings from both traditional and non-traditional exports
due to both volume and price factors, coupled with the increase in
the import bill.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Police Chief Confident of Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior police
officer of Kosovo said Tuesday that although the Serbian
government had reduced police presence, security would not be out
of control in the autonomous province.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Bozidar Filic, deputy director of
the Kosovo police bureau, said that following the agreement
between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. Special
Envoy Richard Holbrooke, the level of police troops in Kosovo had
been reduced to that of February, with numerous police posts along
highways dismantled and Serbian police withdrawn from ethnic
Albanian villages.
</P>
<P>
Despite sporadic shooting, the situation in Kosovo had been
relatively calm recently due to two factors, he said.
</P>
<P>
First, Serbian police had crushed the Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA), the ethnic Albanian separatist armed groups, and retaken
control of all main highways in the region, said Filic, adding
that more than 10,000 weapons of all kinds had been seized from or
handed over by ethnic Albanian rebels.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Western countries had warned KLA not to provoke
while the government of the Serbian Republic was withdrawing
troops and observers of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were filling in, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, in the wake of troop withdrawal by the government, KLA
remanents disguised as refugees have returned to some 200
villages, compared with 1,400 villages in the whole of Kosovo, the
Serbian police chief said.
</P>
<P>
Filic said that KLA units were recruiting and preparing for
future attacks on the government police. But he predicted that it
would be difficult for the KLA to make up for the armament losses
since Yugoslav border security had effectively been beefed up.
</P>
<P>
When asked what police would do if they came under attack by
the KLA, Filic said that they would first seek intervention by
OSCE observers.
</P>
<P>
But if the observers turned a blind eye to the incidents, the
government police would have no other choice but defend themselves
as well as the sovereignty and integrity of the country in line
with law, the police officer said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council would meet in the afternoon on Iraq, the U.N.
spokesman's office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The council members would begin deliberation on a resolution
which is expected to condemn Iraq's Saturday decision that it had
decided to suspend all its ties with the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. diplomats, the resolution, which will not be
adopted until late this week, will demand Iraq reverse its
decision and resume cooperation with the UNSCOM and term Iraq's
decision as a flagrant violation of Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Iraq also demanded the Security Council
restructure the UNSCOM and lift U.N. sanctions against it which
have been in place since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

HOHHOT, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Horses which helped Mongol
Emperor Genghis Khan conquer most of Europe are gradually
disappearing from the daily lives of Mongolians, the largest
nomadic group in China.
</P>
<P>
Nashun, a herdsman from Ar Horqin Banner, today finally
presented a saddle handed down through generations of his family
to a nearby museum following several months of deliberations and
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, the family of six donned graceful Mongolian
clothing and gathered to reverently stroke the silver-inlaid
saddle.
</P>
<P>
"The museum will provide the same care as my relatives, and
will offer better conditions to preserve the saddle so that future
generations will know that we are the offspring of an ethnic group
which once lived on horseback," said Nashun.
</P>
<P>
The herdsman bade farewell to horse breeding over a decade
ago. "It wasn't because I didn't like horses, but simply because
raising horses did not produce good economic returns. Tractors and
motorcycles are much more efficient," he added.
</P>
<P>
Aldinv, a specialist in Mongolian studies, said: "Horses have
been the most important and inseparable working force in Mongolian
production for the past several thousand years . The vast Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region is home to most of China's Mongolian
nationality, and the Xilin Gol Prairie alone is the size as
Britain."
</P>
<P>
Herdsmen could not engage in any form of production without
horses activities, and thus Mongolians have often been referred to
"people living on horseback."
</P>
<P>
More than half of the herder households no longer raise horses,
the symbol of the ethnic Mongolian group. Horses have in fact
disappeared from the production stage, according to Nashun.
</P>
<P>
An official with regional Animal Husbandry Bureau said the
disappearance of horses from production represents only one aspect
of changes China's ethnic Mongolian people are undergoing in terms
of both production and life.

Statistics show that the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia are
amongst the leading areas in China in terms of the per household
availability of motor vehicles. The average ownership rate stands
1.5 motor vehicles per family.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Mongolian ethnic group in China have abandon the
nomadic life which focused on moving place to place in search of
water and grass, and have instead resorted to permanent
homes. Yurts have been replaced by houses made of bricks and tiles.
</P>
<P>
Mongolian people initially abandon the use of horses as early
as four decades ago, but major changes have taken place in the
past 20 years since the household responsibility contract system
was introduced to the vast pastoral areas in Inner Mongolia,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He said Inner Mongolia led the nation in the 1970s with a herd
of 2.4 million horses, but the herd has dropped by around one
million head.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the horses have been transferred to other jobs," said
Yun Zhenlong, deputy director of the regional Tourism Bureau. An
increasing number of herdsmen are currently selling horses to the
region's numerous tourist centers which host over six million
domestic and overseas tourists annually.
</P>
<P>
Herdsmen are still raising race horses for the thousands of
grand sports fairs, or "Nadamu," held in Inner Mongolia each
year. Horse races are one of the most popular events during the
fairs.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China's largest nomadic group has abandon horses
for a comparatively stable life is also closely related to
improvements in the region's transportation conditions.
</P>
<P>
Information from the regional transport administration shows
the region's highway network stretches over 50,000 km, including
some 80 percent constructed over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Railways link 11 leagues and cities in Inner Mongolia, with the
sole exception being the Alxa League located deep in Badain Jaran
Desert, the third largest desert in the nation. The region's seven
airports offer regularly scheduled flights to over 40 cities in
China and various major cities in other countries.

Septuagenarian Hazhab, a herdsman from Xilin Hot, said: "It
took me 10 full days to ride to Hohhot in the 1940s. Now, however,
I can make the trip to visit my grandson in only 40 minutes by
air."
</P>
<P>
Abandonment of the horse is a natural result of economic
development, said Bao Qingwu, an economist with Inner Mongolian
Academy of Social Sciences. The per capita annual income of
herdsmen in Inner Mongolia stands at 2,300 yuan now, 13 times the
figure two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Yidam, a herdsmen in Xilin Gol, visited Australia in 1995 at
his own expense. Yidam's family, which has assest of well over one
million yuan, continues to raise five horses.
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel I could be called a real Mongolian if no
horses are kept in the backyard," Yidam said.
</P>
<P>
Generations of the Mongolian Dalhut tribe have cared for the
mausoleum of Genghis Khan, and also guard two "holy horses" which
helped him conquer the world. The horses are quite obviously
statues, but were fashioned after the two best white horses
selected from all the entire herd in the pastoral area.
</P>
<P>
Qolubater, a herdsmen from Ih Ju League, takes great pride in
his horse which was selected to replace one of the "holy horses"
which died a short time ago.
</P>
<P>
"I could hardly hold back the tears when the Dalhut people left
with my horse." he added.
</P>
<P>
Xurigan, president of Inner Mongolia University, said: "One
could never fully understand Mongolians if they did not know
their feelings about horses."
</P>
<P>
About two million younger generations Mongolian herdsmen are
living in cities throughout the nation. However, their feelings
about horses remain intense in spite of having been away from
pastoral areas for many years.
</P>
<P>
A bowed stringed instrument with a scrool shaped like a horse
head is a common sight in urban Mongolian homes. Dedam, a female
Mongolian singer living in Beijing, has several fine saddles in
her home.
</P>
<P>
"I look at the saddles and feel as if I'm home," she said.
</P>
<P>
Mongolian composer Baogi said horseback riding is the spiritual
cradle of the Mongolian group and horses will never be completely
removed from the spiritual world of Mongolians.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, horses have emerged as kind of spiritual symbol and
sustenance of Mongolians, and the cultural significance of horses
has become increasingly prominent," Baogi said, adding that
"horses in this sense exist just like prairies, clouds, and the
sky, and will indeed move into modern civilization together with
Mongolian people."

<HEADLINE> Residential Building Permits Down in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The value of residential
building permits in Canada declined in the third quarter to its
lowest level in nearly two years, Statistics Canada said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, the value of residential permits decreased
1.6 percent from the second quarter to 4.3 billion dollars (2.8
billion U.S. dollars) in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
"This was the second consecutive quarterly decline and the
lowest figure since the fourth quarter of 1996," the statistics
agency said.
</P>
<P>
A second quarterly decline in the multi-residential component
of the sector more than offset an increase in plans for the
single-family dwellings.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the total value of residential permits for the
first nine months of this year was 3.3 percent lower than the same
period last year, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The decline is attributed to several factors, such as the
active resale market, the high vacancy rates on the rental market
in urban centers and labor strikes.
</P>
<P>
"Decreasing consumer confidence combined with slower than
expected economic growth, slowdowns in wages and salaries may have
contributed to the slowdown," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the value of building permits for
non-residential projects witnessed an increase of 3.7 percent to
4.1 billion dollars in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
This made the value of all permits issued by Canadian
municipalities increase 0.9 percent over the second quarter to 8.4
billion dollars, the agency said.

WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright intervened Tuesday in a dispute between Israel
and the Palestinian Authority over counter-terrorism measures on
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians have met their responsibilities" by
submitting a plan to combat terrorism, but "there are other

The U.S. spokesman reiterated the administration's position

tighter security, had gone into force Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also said U.S. mediator Dennis Ross and other State
Department officials would go to the region shortly.
</P>
<P>
Their assignment is to try to set the stage for further
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and to see whether Israel and
Syria can open peace talks.

In Jerusalem, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said
Israel was holding out for a list of 30 Palestinians the Authority

</P>
<P>
Mordechai said Israel was also seeking a timetable for the
arrests.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, meanwhile, postponed a Cabinet meeting that was to

<HEADLINE> Kenya Coffee Prices up on Tight Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Prices of Kenyan coffee rose
at the weekly export auction Tuesday on tight supply, according
to coffee board data.
</P>
<P>
The average market price rose to 127.97 U.S. Dollars per 50 kg
lot from 119.05 Dollars last week. Without the poorer-quality
miscellaneous grade, the market average rose to 154.08 Dollars
per 50 kg lot from 142.40 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The storms in Central American were worrying the market, a
senior official at the Kenya Coffee Auctions (KCA) said.
</P>
<P>
Further losses of good quality coffee from the region would
exacerbate the already tight global supply, the official added.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Butler Likely to Rearrange U.N. Arms Inspectors in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler said Tuesday that he might have to
reconsider arms inspectors in Iraq if it did not rescind its
decision in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the president of the Security Council, Peter
Burleigh of the United States, Butler said he was now keeping U.N.
personnel of more than 100 inspectors and support staff in place
for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Butler, executive chairman of the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction, said the commission was not in a position to
provide the council with any level of assurances regarding Iraq's
compliance with its obligation not to reestablish proscribed
activities.
</P>
<P>
He also said Iraq's decision to allow maintenance of cameras
monitoring specific sites was minor in terms of providing credible
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Iraq announced that it would suspend all its ties
with the UNSCOM until it got restructured, a move the Security
Council called a violation of relevant U.N. resolutions. The
council will meet Tuesday afternoon on a resolution which is
expected to condemn Iraq.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Urges to Forestall Climate Catastrophe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Environment Program
(UNEP) chief Klaus Toepfer has called for effective cooperation
among all the governments in order to "repair the environment
and forestall a climate catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
Toepfer urged the governments to "agree on a clear Plan of Action
and timetable to solve the many outstanding substantial and
methodological problems faced by both developed and developing
countries alike," according to a news release issued by the
Nairobi-based UNEP Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer made the remarks Monday, the opening day of the Fourth
Conference of the Parties (COP-4) to the U.N. Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Buenos Aires, the
capital of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to end on November 13, is focused on how to take
practical steps to reach the targets of the 1997 Kyoto meeting
where the world governments agreed to cut the production of the
greenhouse gases that cause climate change.
</P>
<P>
"Action from governments will help convince producers,
consumers, communities and individuals to adjust their activities
in ways that limit emissions, as the convention and its Kyoto
Protocol will only succeed if they are widely supported by the
public and by key constituencies and interest groups," he said.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer underlined that the "mechanisms" agreed to in Kyoto
cannot be a substitute for domestic action by industrialized
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that developed countries must start
cutting their emissions of greenhouse gases. They should adopt
win-win strategies, those that reduce emissions in ways that also
help the economy. All other action should be supplemental to this
effort," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is fundamental that we help fully integrate all countries
into the climate change debate and act as a forum for open,
informed dialogue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed: "UNEP will continue to play a
leading, integrated, role in this process."

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- France Tuesday asked Britain to
arrest former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet prior to an
official demand by Paris for his extradition for acts of
confinement and torture of French nationals.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted judicial sources as saying that the
request for the provisionary arrest of Pinochet was made by the
Public Prosecutor's Office of Paris and a demand for extradition
would be made within days through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
France and Britain signed an agreement of extradition in 1957.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Paris judge of investigation Rpger Le Loire
issued an international warrant of arrest against Pinochet, who is
also wanted by a number of other European countries for
confinement and torture of their citizens.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 82, was arrested on October 16 in London at the
request of a Spanish judge. He is now under judicial control in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The nine judges of the Chamber of Lords, who make up the
highest body of British judicial authorities, will decide whether
Pinochet should be given immunity as a life-time parliamentarian
of Chile.
</P>
<P>
A British High Court ruled that Pinochet be given immunity and
the arrest warrant against him issued by Spain was illegal.
</P>
<P>
The British government has made an appeal against the court
ruling.

NEW DELHI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- India and Pakistan started
Monday evening to exchange gunfire once again on Monday along the
Line of Control in the Kashmir area and both sides have suffered
casualties.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistani soldier and two Indian soldiers were killed and
four other Pakistani soldiers were injured in a heavy exchange of
gunfire along the border and Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir,
said official sources here.

<P>
So far, there have been no reports from the Pakistani side
about the firing between the two countries.

The two conflicting sides used to blame each other for the
exchange of gunfire around the Kashmir area. The India-Pakistan
relations grew tense following their nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
Since then, both sides have been exchanging fire over the
Kashmir issue, the main dispute between the two countries. Despite
bilateral talks, they remain far apart in their stands on the

<HEADLINE> Scientists Call for Protection of Environment in South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 3 (Xinhua) -- About 500 scientists from 27
countries Tuesday called for the establishment of an institute of
ecology and environment in South Asia to deal with transboundary
issues on environment and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a three-day conference here on environment and
agriculture, the scientists noted that ecologically sustainable
development requires the protection of indigenous bio-diversity
but these natural values are threatened in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is recommended that rapid progress be made
toward developing a full network of protected areas in the
agricultural and forested landscape of South Asia," the Kathmandu
Declaration issued after the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration recommended that the Ecological Society (ECOS)
of Nepal, the organizer of the international conference, take
initiative for the creation of a regional institute of ecology and
environment, with the cooperation of institutions of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries, to
deal with transboundary issues on environment and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
It stressed the need for rapid implementation of an appropriate
population policy by each of the SAARC member countries --
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
It urged universities and research organizations to give
priority to environmental and agricultural issues.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
South Asia occupies 3.15 percent of the global land but is
inhabited by over one fifth of the world's population. Half of its
population is still illiterate and living under poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Population growth rate in the region is higher than the world
average.
</P>
<P>
The region is engulfed in environmental and agricultural
problems with increasing frequency of flood and drought, said the
ECOS, a non-governmental organization.

<HEADLINE> EU to Finance 51 Anti-crime Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
finance 51 new projects under an anti-crime plan designed to boost
cooperation among law enforcement authorities in its member states.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission said Tuesday the plan, covering mainly
police and customs services, will receive 2.4 million European
currency unit (2.3 million U.S. dollars) under the 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the EU's executive body, listed the projects
under six headings: fight against drug trafficking, fight against
terrorism, improvement of police and customs cooperation,
technology as a means to defeat crime, fight against and
prevention of urban violence and urban crime, and crime analysis.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner Anita Gradin, in charge of justice and home,
said EU-wide anti-crime campaign is faced with severe obstacles,
due to the fact that the union has 15 different penal law systems.
</P>
<P>
The EU programs within the justice and home affairs area, she
said, are aimed at helping to overcome these obstacles.
</P>
<P>
"They provide the possibilities for officials in member states
to establish practical cooperation, get a better understanding for
how the systems in other member states work and to exchange
experience and best practice," the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
She expressed satisfaction with the results of the law
enforcement in 1997, during which suspect vehicles, heading for
the EU, were targeted and intercepted and considerable quantities
of narcotics were seized and many arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, counterfeit goods, smuggled cigarettes and antiques,
forged documents and fake money, military equipment and stolen
cars were also seized and a number of international arrest
warrants were issued.
</P>
<P>
"The ability of our police and customs authorities to cooperate
is particularly important since serious crime today is operating
more and more on an international scale," Gradin said.

<P>
PARIS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- France Tuesday recalled its
representative from Baghdad "for consultations" and sent a message
to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tarek Aziz warning against the
serious consequences which will come from Baghdad's decision last
Saturday to suspend cooperation with the United Nations arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
that France has informed the Iraqi government of its decision to
recall the French representative in Baghdad, Yves Aubin de la
Messuziere.
</P>
<P>
Messuziere had earlier delivered a letter from French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine to Aziz, in which Vedrine stressed the
seriousness of the possible consequences from Baghdad's decision
to suspend cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission in charge
of destroying Iraq's arms of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that Iraq's suspension of cooperation with the
UNSCOM will surely not help in having the U.N. sanctions lifted,
and he recalled that the U.N. Security Council had unanimously
condemned the Iraqi decision, according to the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council will meet again later Tuesday in New
York and is expected to approve more resolutions asking Iraq to
cancel its decision of suspending cooperation with the UNSCOM.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Ready to Cooperate With Israel in Various </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is ready to cooperate
with Israel in trade and other fields, government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the on-going official visit here by Israeli
President Ezer Weizman, which ends on Wednesday, the spokesman
described it as "very important."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus is ready to sign agreements with Israel in fields such
as trade, science, high technology and medical cooperation,
Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Cypriot government's concern over Israel's
military cooperation agreement with Turkey, Stylianides said
"Israel has taken note of the concerns we have expressed."
</P>
<P>
Weizman told his Cypriot counterpart Glafcos Clerides during an
official talk Monday that the agreement is not a threat to any
third party and is necessary because Israel is surrounded by
muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said that the Cypriot government does not meddle in
another government's foreign policy, but expresses its concerns
over the military agreement between Israel and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also expressed the hope that Cyprus would like to
see other countries of the region become more involved in the
Cyprus question.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government wants the international community to
exert more pressure on the Turkish side so that a substantive
dialog on the Cyprus issue can begin, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian first lady Fatima
Abubakar has called on parents to bring their children to
immunization centers nationwide for immunization against polio.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Tuesday in Abuja, the first lady said
immunization centers have been opened across the country so that
parents can take their children under the age of five to the
nearest center for immunization.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the national immunization campaign will
come this Wednesday and Thursday, while the second round is fixed
for November 9 and 10.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is the part of the global efforts to wipe out
polio, a disease that often results in paralysis in children,
before 2000.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is prosecuted under the auspices of the National
Program on Immunization (NPI), which was introduced by the
Nigerian government in 1997 to replace the Expanded Program on
Immunization sponsored by the United Nations Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the response level to
immunization fell to 15-30 percent in some parts of the country
in the last few years, but with the introduction of the NPI, the
response level has shot up to over 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 25 million Nigerian children will
be immunized against polio during the coming campaign.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's External Debt Rises by 1.9% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's external debt
reached 8,068.4 million U.S. Dollars by the end of September,
representing an increase of 1.9 percent from a year earlier,
according to a central bank report.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total debt committed, disbursed outstanding debt
was 6,623.3 million U.S. Dollars, while committed undisbursed
debt was 1445.1 million U.S. Dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The profile of disbursed outstanding debt by creditor category
reveals that multilateral and bilateral debts accounted for 49
and 43.5 percent of the total debt, respectively, the Bank of
Tanzania said in its newly published October report.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the profile of disbursed outstanding debt by
borrower category indicates that the central government is the
dominant borrower, accounting for as much as 93.4 percent of the
total debt. Public corporations and the private sector account
for only 2.7 and 3.9 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Classification of outstanding debt by economic sectors,
reveals that for the period ending September of 1998, 24.1
percent of the debt was disbursed in the form of balance of
payments support, while transport and telecommunications received
20.5 percent and agriculture received 14.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Energy and mining received 12.2 percent followed by industries
which absorbed 8.4 percent of the debt. Social welfare and
education, finance and insurance and tourism received 4.2, 3.0
and 1.2 percent of the debt, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 12.4 percent of the debt was absorbed by other
sectors, it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said during September, loans amounting
to 10.5 million U.S. Dollars were contracted, disbursements
amounting to 9.5 million U.S. Dollars were made and actual debt
service amounting to 15.3 million U.S. Dollars was effected.
Accordingly, there was a net outflow of 5.8 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Reiterates Support for Confederation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz Tuesday reiterated Turkey's support for a confederation as
a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on his arrival in Turkish Cypriot-controlled northern
Cyprus for a 24-hour visit, Yilmaz said the "two states," which
make of the confederation in Cyprus, must be "equal" and that
there should be trust between the two communities, Cyprus News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash's proposal
for a confederation is on the table, calling on the Greek Cypriot
side to accept it and to return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will "always be at the side of Turkish Cypriots," the
Turkish prime minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island has been divided into the
Greek Cypriot-dominated south and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north
since 1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took over the
northern third in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks have been deadlocked since summer last year
when Denktash walked out of a U.N.-sponsored direct talks between
the two communities' leaders in Switzerland to protest against a
European Union (EU) decision to start accession negotiations with
the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash, backed by Turkey, put forward a proposal for the
establishment of a confederation of two states in Cyprus last
August.
</P>
<P>
The proposal has been rejected by Cyprus and Greece as well as
the U.N. Security Council, because it is contrary to a bizonal,
bicommunal federation formula, as envisaged by two High Level
Agreements reached between the two sides in 1977 and 1979, as well
as numerous Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Cyprus' accession to the EU, Yilmaz reiterated
Turkish objections, saying that if relations between Cyprus and
the EU make progress, differences on the island will be
consolidated and the situation will worsen.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that if the Cyprus problem is not settled and a
balance between his country and Greece is not achieved, Cyprus can
not join the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister said that right after EU confirmed
its open accession talks with Cyprus, his country began to
cooperate more closely with the Turkish Cypriot regime, which was
declared in 1983 as a breakaway state, recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz vowed that Turkey will not make any concessions in the
Aegean and will not allow anyone to touch the Turkish Cypriots.

BRUSSELS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Citizens of the European Union
(EU) member states are increasingly seeking information on EU
legislation, to which access has not been too easy in the past,
said the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission indicated part of its integrate image in a news
release available here Tuesday, referring to an extended EUR-lex
website for EU legislation.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that new on EUR-lex is the electronic
version of the directory of legislation in force which contains
more than 1,000 pages of references to EU legislation covering
external relations, secondary legislation (regulations, decisions,
directives), supplementary legislation and a series of non-binding
acts.
</P>
<P>
Now the EU is building its single market in a bid to achieve,
in certain aspect, free movement of goods, capital, personnel and
labor. Stressing free access to the extended EUR-lex, the
commission said the website of http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex now
gives easier access to all EU legislation and at no cost.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the paper version, the directory of legislation in force
on the internet is updated monthly in all 11 EU languages and the
user is led directly to the relevant legal text, which includes
more than 50,000 pages of full text in each official language, the
commission said in its release, which shows the freedom of
information movement in the 15-member Union.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Addresses U.N., EU to Protest Israeli Soil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares
Boueiz Tuesday sent a letter to the United Nations and European
Union to protest Israeli ongoing soil theft in its occupied south
Lebanon, the official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said in the letter that Israelis are stealing fertile
top soil from an area between Hasbayah and al-Khiyem in the
eastern sector of its occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
They have trucked hundreds of tons of soil to the Israeli
northern area of Galilee and its occupied Golan Heights, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's operation came within the framework of its continuous
occupation of Lebanon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister called on the U.N. and EU to intervene and
help stop the Israeli plunder of Lebanese soil, a practice which
he said will force local residents in the occupied zone to leave
their farm land.
</P>
<P>
Last week, House Speaker Nabih Berri delivered similar letters
to parliament leaders of the U.N. Security Council's five permanent
member states and U.N. General Secretary Kofi Annan and other
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Although the issue of soil theft has stirred up a nation-wide
condemnation of Israel in Lebanon since last week, there has been
no official reaction from the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Lebanon's most influential Arabic-language newspaper
An Nahar published pictures showing Israeli bulldozers piling up
the earth in the environs of Kfar Chouba village as well as
truck-loading operations.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges U.S. to Force Turkey to Withdraw Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday urged the U.S. to
force Turkey to withdraw the armaments it had obtained from the
U.S. from northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a parliament debate, Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos said that what Greece wanted was for the U.S.
government to show basic respect and implement its own laws and to
force Turkey to withdraw the heavy arms of U.S. origin which it
had deployed in the occupied part of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
As for a Turkish proposal for dialogue with Greece, he said
that Greece asked Turkey to accept the general jurisdiction of the
international court at the Hague.
</P>
<P>
He added that this was also dictated within the framework of
Turkey's efforts to join the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The minister warned that sooner or later, Turkey would swallow
this bitter pill, so it would be better if it did so now so Greece
could get the whole thing over with.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO member states, have been at odds
for decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air
space limits, the demilitarization of the continental shelf in the
Aegean Sea and the protracted Cyprus problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Mitch has
killed some 7,000 people in Central America, leaving thousands
homeless, and devastated the countries' infrastructure, the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The worst hit are Nicaragua and Honduras, where whole villages
have been swept away and roads, schools and hospitals have been
destroyed. Lack of clean water is endangering the health of
thousands of people, especially children.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala, El Salvador and Belize have also been affected.
</P>
<P>
Mitch, one of the most powerful hurricanes to hit Central
America this century, has brought rains and floods. Weather
conditions have severely hampered access to the most affected
communities with most of them reachable only by air.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations system has appealed to the international
community for relief assistance to the affected countries.

<HEADLINE> Cook Talks Tough on U.N.-Iraq Standoff on Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Tuesday that the international community should stand
firm in its latest standoff with Iraq over the arms inspection
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Cook told the British parliament, "It would be too damaging for
the authority of the United Nations if (Iraqi President) Saddam
(Hussein) was allowed to break the agreement he entered with its
Secretary-General (Kofi Annan)."
</P>
<P>
"He (Saddam) cannot and will not be allowed to win," Cook said.
"We want to find a diplomatic solution, but we have always made
clear that all options remain open."
</P>
<P>
"His calculation is that we will eventually give up and abandon
the sanctions regime without requiring him to abandon his
ambitions for regional supremacy through weapons of terror. We
must remain ready and resolute to prove him wrong," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, British Defense Secretary George Robertson and
his American counterpart, William Cohen, threatened to use force
against Iraq if Baghdad refuses to reverse its decision to stop
all cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Zhirinovsky: Saddam Demands Timetable for Lifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
demands that a timetable for lifting U.N. trade embargo be
provided before he will allow U.N. arms inspectors to resume their
work in Iraq, said a visiting Russian party leader Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, chairman of the Russian Liberal
Democratic Party, made the remarks after two hours of talks with
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
"He (Saddam) would like to have information (on) when the
blockade (will be) lifted," Zhirinovsky said, adding "when? this
year? next year? next century? "
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky, who enjoys good relations with Iraq, said Saddam
"would like peace," complaining that "Iraq made everything to
fulfill all resolutions of the United Nations, but the United
Nations doesn't make anything for Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Saddam demanded the U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq
(UNSCOM) be recomposed to make it more objective, and UNSCOM
Chairman Richard Butler be replaced by someone from China, Russia
or France, Zhirinovsky quoted the Iraqi leader as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused UNSCOM and Butler of serving the United
States interests and trying to invent pretext to prolong
the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq since 1990 following its
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky arrived here Sunday as a member of the Russian
Duma (lower house of parliament) delegation led by Duma
Vice-Chairman Mikhail Gutsiriyev.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leadership last Saturday decided to halt all forms of
cooperation with UNSCOM until the U.N. Security Council considers
the lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Other conditions it set for revoking its decision include
the removal of UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler and restructuring
of UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq said the decision would not be applied to
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). On Tuesday, IAEA
monitoring teams continued their activities smoothly in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Saturday unanimously condemned
the Iraqi decision and urged Iraq to rescind its decision
"immediately and unconditionally."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Monday that "all
options remain open" to force Iraq into compliance with U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long blamed the United States and "its agents"
in UNSCOM for blocking the lifting of the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The embargo cannot be lifted until U.N. arms inspectors verify
that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and South
Africa stressed here Tuesday the need to develop a strategic
partnership between the two countries based on cooperation in all
fields, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made in a joint statement issued at the
conclusion of the visit by South African Executive Vice President
Thabo Mbeki to Saudi Arabia, SPA said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who arrived in Riyadh Sunday, held talks with Saudi
King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Crown Prince and Deputy Minister
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, as well as other senior Saudi officials,
on expanding bilateral cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki is the highest-ranking South African official to visit
here since President Nelson Mandela paid an official visit to
Riyadh in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Saudi Arabia and South Africa has seen rapid
growth in recent years, with the trade volume reaching 433.6
million U.S. dollars in 1996, 10 times higher than that of 1994,
when the two countries restored diplomatic relations.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urged to Exert Pressure on Turkish Cypriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government on
Tuesday urged Turkey to exercise pressure on Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash so that he returns to the negotiating table
to settle the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a 24-hour visit to the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
northern Cyprus by Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Tuesday,
Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides described the
visit as "a provocation."
</P>
<P>
However, Stylianides called on Yilmaz to "put pressure on
Denktash to return to the negotiating table instead of making
moves simply to impress."
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Yilmaz reiterated his country's support for
a confederal solution to the Cyprus problem, suggested by
Denktash last August.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides pointed out that the Cypriot government has
already made clear its positions on both the Cyprus issue and
Cyprus' European Union (EU) accession course and is expecting the
Turkish Cypriot side to be more flexible and return to the
negotiations table with good will.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Denktash's strong reaction to substantive
accession talks between Cyprus and the EU, which are scheduled to
start on November 10 in Brussels, Stylianides underlined that
"they can not make the EU change its position."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader has threatened to turn his back to
Europe and reinforce relations with Turkey, in view of EU
accession talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus submitted its application for EU membership in 1990,
and the EU started its initial accession negotiations with the
Cypriot government in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot regime have expressed their
objections to Cyprus' EU accession course, because they believe
that Cyprus can not join the EU unless the Cyprus problem is
settled.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a short-lived coup by supporters of union
with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, Congo (k) Cement Bilateral Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) Tuesday moved deeper to cement bilateral
ties in trade and investment following the recent conclusion of a
general cooperation pact.
</P>
<P>
A 20-member high level official Congolese delegation led by
Victor Mondonga from the DRC Ministry of International
Cooperation, began talks in Harare with representatives from the
Zimbabwean government to forge closer links between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The talks came just two days after the Zimbabwean and DRC
governments sealed a general cooperation agreement Sunday when
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was in Lubumbashi of the DRC
for talks with DRC President Laurent Kabila and Namibian
President Sam Nujoma on the DRC situation.
</P>
<P>
Christian Katsande from the office of the president and
cabinet led the Zimbabwean delegation and chaired the talks
attended by senior officials from the ministries of Industry and
Commerce, Mines, Environment and Tourism, Transport and Energy,
and Finance.
</P>
<P>
Katsande said in his opening remarks that the meeting was to
allow representatives from the various sectors in both countries
to get to know each other and then go into closer discussions on
establishing business ties.
</P>
<P>
Mondonga said the Congolese would want to invest in Zimbabwe
and go into joint venture business partnerships with Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwean goods are very welcome in Congo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Four sub-committees were set up to pursue more detailed
discussions which would form the basis of a report to be
presented to a joint permanent commission expected to be
established soon between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, along with Angola and Namibia, has deployed troops,
tanks and aircraft in the DRC at the invitation of Kabila to help
his government crush a rebellion by ethnic Congolese Tutsis.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Tuesday discussed with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev the
fulfillment of the plan for the military reform of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin now is spending his two-week vacation in the Black Sea
resort of Sochi.
</P>
<P>
According to the presidential press service, Yeltsin approved
of the results of the work done in this direction over the first
10 months of the year. He instructed the defense minister to again
analyze the situation in the armed forces at the conference due to
take place on November 11-12.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Sergeyev discussed drafting a document setting
forth the tasks of the state military organization to ensure
national defense and security in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The president has made a decision in principle to publish the
directive, the service said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting Sergeyev briefed Yeltsin in his own proposals
aimed at pulling the defense sphere out of the crisis, which have
been submitted to the government.
</P>
<P>
The two men also exchanged views on an army reform plan for
next year. The core of the plan provides for the transition to a
three-arm structure of the Russian armed forces by creating a
joint chief command of the strategic deterrence forces on the
basis of the strategic missile forces.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told Sergeyev that it had been decided to issue 7,000
housing certificates and 200 million rubles (about 13.3 million
U.S. dollars) to complete the housing construction project for
another 2,000 families of servicemen.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 22,000 army servicemen in Russia without
apartments are tipped for layoffs this year under the military
reform, the Itar-Tass said.

<HEADLINE> Former Nigerian Military Leader Declares Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Nigerian military leader
General Olusegun Obasanjo Tuesday declared his intention to run
for civilian presidency in elections under the country's
democratization program.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo made the announcement at a news conference at his Ota
Farm in Ogun State, southwest Nigeria. He is the first Nigerian
that has publicly declared his interest to contend for the coming
civilian presidency.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said he will run as the candidate of the People's
Democratic Party, which was recently registered along with eight
other parties by the Independent Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
He said he took the decision after many notable Nigerians had
asked him to take up the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"I am here to inform you that I have decided to offer myself
to serve our country," he said, "I, therefore, intend to seek
nomination of my party as its presidential candidate."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, who ruled Nigeria from 1976 to 1979, is one of the
few military rulers to voluntarily hand over to a civilian
government.
</P>
<P>
He was put into jail in 1995 in connection with an alleged
coup plot to overthrow former military leader General Sani Abacha
and was freed in June after the sudden death of Abacha.
</P>
<P>
While some people believe that Obasanjo's military background
will enable him to reconcile the military that has ruled Nigerian
in most of the time since its independence in 1960 and the
civilians, many other observers said that Nigerians are now tired
of the military and want nothing but of full civilian democracy.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria will hold its presidential elections in February 1999,
after which the current military government led by General
Abdulsalam Abubakar is expected to hand over to a civilian
president.

<HEADLINE> Challenges U.N. Faces Grow Ever More Complex, Annan Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Globalization is bringing a
number of other issues to the top of the U.N. agenda and the
challenges the U.N. faces grow ever more complex as the world
moves to the end of this century, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement while delivering a speech to the
International Council of the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
"Unprecedented wealth coexists with terrible deprivation, as a
quarter of the world's people remain mired in poverty," he said.
"Globalization knits us closer together while intolerance keeps us
apart."
</P>
<P>
He said, "All progress is fragile; the challenges we face grow
ever more complex. Modern communications mean that whether we like
it or not, we are connected, inextricably and irrevocably."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. chief said, "Globalization is bringing a
number of other issues to the top of our agenda. Drugs,
environmental degradation, terrorism, pandemics -- these are just
a few of what we call problems without passports. They require us
to think big -- to come up with blueprints without borders."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations "must as always learn on its feet. It must
learn to address those new issues -- most of which fall under the
one rubric of globalization -- as well as the more traditional
challenges within its remit such as peace and security."
</P>
<P>
As the world is currently plagued by a global economic crisis,
the 185 U.N. members mostly call upon the world body to do
something about the crisis, whose ripples are spreading throughout
the world.
</P>
<P>
On the global crisis, Annan said, "I believe it is not only
economic, but social and political as well. When you consider the
hair-raising statistics -- like the fact that more than half of
Indonesia's children under the age of two are now at the risk of
brain damage due to malnutrition."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, as commodity prices fall and investors take
flight, all parts of the developing world are affected, way beyond
east Asia, Annan said. "And the same sort of grim news is now
coming in from Russia."
</P>
<P>
Last week, Annan met with the heads of the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and all the other entities of the
U.N. system.
</P>
<P>
As a result, "we committed ourselves to helping individual
countries carry out structural and institutional reforms and to
strengthening or building basic social services and safety nets
for the least fortunate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And they cannot wait. In my own continent, Africa, AIDS is
taking a devastating toll with huge socio-economic implications,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the world's 34 most severely affected countries in the
world, 29 are in Africa. In 10 worst affected, life expectancy is
10 years less than it would otherwise have been.
</P>
<P>
"The challenges facing us on the peace and security front are
less urgent -- and no less difficult. You have all read about the
latest developments concerning our arms inspections in Iraq. The
situation in Kosovo remains volatile. Angola and Congo likewise.
Afghanistan is still ravaged by fighting. Relations between
Eritrea and Ethiopia could lead to resumed hostilities at any
time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These are all formidable challenges. And there are many more,"
he said. "But let me say that every challenge is also an
opportunity. An opportunity for us to show that we are capable of
acting together. That the United Nations is more than a name."
</P>
<P>
Brian Urquhart, chairman of the International Council of the
Museum of Modern Art, was former U.N. under-secretary-general for
peace-keeping.
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Modern Art, a highly famous building to house art
collections and exhibitions and also one of the well-known tourist
attractions in New York, has "strong and solid links" with the
United Nations, and "these have grown ever stronger throughout the
half century of the U.N.'s history, he said.

<P>
HARARE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
reiterated the need for a negotiated peaceful settlement of the
crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Peace could not be achieved through military means in the DRC,
said Susan Rice, visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
African Affairs, in Harare after meeting Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters that her country recognized the allied
forces from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia were invited by DRC
President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is aware that allied forces were invited by the
legitimate government to defend it from rebel invasion, but we
are concerned with the escalation of hostilities," said Rice.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe sent troops to the DRC following
a rebellion against the Kabila government in early August.
</P>
<P>
Rice said she and Mugabe have "agreed on the imperative need
to preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Congo
(K) and the need for an immediate cease-fire there."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said her talks with Mugabe were
"productive", but "a lot of work still needs to be done."
</P>
<P>
Rice also denied that Angola agreed to pull out its troops
from the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy was in Zimbabwe to discuss the termination of a
15-week period of hostilities in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Zimbabwe estimatedly has over 6,000
troops in the DRC in support of the Kabila government.
</P>
<P>
Sunday in Lubumbashi in southern DRC, Mugabe announced the
launching of an offensive against the rebel positions in the east
of the third largest African country.

KAMPALA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni Tuesday proposed creation of a road development unit in
the capital of the east African country in order to rid the city
of dust and mud.
</P>
<P>
He made the call when addressing local leaders at Pope Paul
Memorial Community Center in Lubaga South on the second day of
his tour of capital Kampala, Radio Uganda reported Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Museveni proposed launching of a campaign to tarmac all roads
in the city and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
The city has a critical mass of people whose property is worth
over 200 million Shillings (150,000 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The city council was also urged to acquire more land for
industrial development so that more employment opportunities are
created through new factories.
</P>
<P>
The president was reported to have addressed some other issues
concerning security, economy, water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure development, particularly building and
improving of roads in the country, has been one of the key
priorities of the ruling National Resistance Movement.
</P>
<P>
Roads in the east African country, mostly the feeder roads in
the up-country areas, are reportedly in bad conditions due to
lack of maintenance and annual flooding.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Rules out Ties With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's paramount leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated here Tuesday that Iran would not
resume relations with the United States, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Having no relations with the U.S is hundred percent in the
interests of the Iranian nation and the available experiences
around the world have proved this reality," said Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing a group of Iranian students who visited him
on the eve of the anniversary of the 1979 takeover of U.S. embassy
to Tehran by Iranian students.
</P>
<P>
The remark came one day after a group of pro-moderate students
showed a flexibility in their stance towards Washington by
claiming "there is no hostility between the two nations of Iran
and America" in a rally in front of the former U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
Over 3,000 Iranian students, who support the open-minded
policies of President Mohammad Khatami, participated the rally
Monday afternoon, stating they are not against the American
people, but the "arrogant policies" of the U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
The students' move was seen as a goodwill gesture to
Washington, which during the past months repeatedly voiced
readiness to break down the "wall of distrust" between the two
sworn enemies.
</P>
<P>
However, Khamenei said that "outwardly the tone of the
U.S. officials has become gentle, but inwardly they are the same
and trying to once again spread their political and economic
domination over the resources of the country."
</P>
<P>
They do not want to see a sovereign state of the Islamic
Republic of Iran which is against the continuation of their
illegitimate domination, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the takeover of the former U.S. embassy in
Tehran, he said the move was a reaction by the students to the
U.S. plots and satanic measures against the Islamic revolution and
the interests of the Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
He also called on all nations to preserve their alertness and
resistance against the "arrogant powers" who are seeking the
"continuation of their domination over other nations."

<HEADLINE> U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to Visit Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Tuesday that
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR), Sadako
Ogata, will make an official visit to Canada from November 4 to 6.
</P>
<P>
"Of all the challenges to global human security, refugee issues
rank among the most serious," Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy said in a release.
</P>
<P>
"Canada has actively worked with the High Commissioner over the
years to address the needs of refugees, but has also worked to
find peaceful solutions to the political upheavals and civil
conflicts that are so often at the root of refugee crisis," added
Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
"Canada and the UNHCR believe that the best way to resolve the
problems facing refugees is to ensure that they can return safely
to their homes. But we also recognize that for some refugees,
resettlement in third country is the preferred option," said
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Lucienne Robillard in the
same release.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Ottawa, the High Commissioner will meet with
Axworthy and Robillard, as well as with Minister for International
Cooperation and Minister Responsible for La Francophonie Diane
Marleau and Minister of National Defense Art Eggleton.
</P>
<P>
This is Ogata's second official visit to Canada since becoming
High Commissioner for Refugees in 1989. The High Commission, based
in Geneva, Switzerland, is mandated to protect and assist refugees
and promote durable solutions to their problems.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Receives Arafat's Message on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid received a message Tuesday from Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat on the latest developments in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian permanent representative to the Arab League Mohamed
Sobeih, who conveyed the message, told reporters after the meeting
that Arafat informed Abdel-Meguid about Israel's attempts to avoid
honoring the recent peace agreement signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel signed on October 23 in Washington
the peace accord on phased Israeli withdrawal from another 13
percent of the West Bank and Palestinians' tougher measures
against anti-Israeli violence.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih said the situation does not bode well and the Arab
countries are "extremely suspicious of how far Israel will honor
its obligations under the agreement."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday postponed a
cabinet meeting during which the accord was to have been ratified
for what he said Palestinians' failure to submit a plan for
fighting Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians have said they have handed a security work
plan to the United States, which has promised to brief Israel on
the plan.
</P>
<P>
The normalization of ties between the Arab countries and Israel
depends on Israel's implementation of the agreement and other
pacts, Sobeih said, referring to a recent U.S. call on Arab
countries to be friendlier to the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Proposes Three-Party Meeting on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa on Tuesday
proposed a three-party meeting among the U.N. Security Council,
the U.N. chief and Iraq to help solve the current standoff between
the United Nations and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that a round-table meeting between the Security
Council, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and Iraq to discuss
the current Iraqi-U.N. standoff may formulate a settlement to
this crisis," said South African Executive Vice President
Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki made the remarks at a press conference in Riyadh at the
end of his three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said "I'm confident if the three parties sit and discuss
means of setting up a clear policy and specific objectives, they
will surely succeed in reaching a settlement to the current
standoff."
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident that the three parties would be keen
on sitting together and assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on Saturday decided to halt all forms of cooperation with
U.N. arms inspectors and monitors, saying the decision will not be
rescinded before the U.N. Security Council considers the lifting of
sanctions imposed on it after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Other conditions it set for revoking its decision include the
removal of Richard Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq, and the restructuring of the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on Saturday unanimously condemned the
Iraqi decision and urged Iraq to rescind it "immediately and
unconditionally."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long blamed the U.S. and "its agents" in UNSCOM for
blocking the lifting of the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The embargo can not be lifted until U.N. arms inspectors verify
that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Force Near Iraq Sufficient for Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that a U.S. force of 21 warships and 174 aircraft now in
the Gulf region is sufficient for any military action against Iraq
over the U.N. arms inspection dispute.
</P>
<P>
"There are no plans to change our posture," said Defense
Department spokesman Pat Sivigny.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration had indicated that it would not rule out
any options for dealing with Iraq unless it agrees to allow the
U.N. inspectors to finish their job.
</P>
<P>
Iraq last week decided to suspend all cooperation with the
inspection team until the U.N. Security Council cancels sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The United States maintains a substantial, capable and ready
military force in the region, postured to respond to any
contingencies," Sivigny told reporters.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the aircraft carrier Eisenhower, the United
States had 20 other combat and support ships in and near the Gulf,
including seven capable of firing long-range Tomahawk cruise
missiles, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
There are 174 U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine combat and
support aircraft in the area, including more than 50 on the
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
In London, the defense ministers of Britain and the United
States agreed on Tuesday that force could be used against Iraq
unless it backed down in the standoff over U.N. weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and British Defense
Minister George Robertson agreed during an hour-long meeting that
Iraq had to reverse its decision.
</P>
<P>
Cohen began his Europe and Gulf tour on Monday after cutting
short an Asian trip to consult with U.S. allies on how to respond
to the new crisis.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientist On Risks of Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Long-term climate change
such as global warming could have major impacts on human health,
the environment, the economy and society, said Dr. James Baker,
Director of U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the Washington Post Monday when the Fourth Session
of the Conference of the Parties to U.N. Framework Convention on
Climate Change begins in Buenos Aires, the U.S. scientist said that
global warming chould affect everything from energy use and
transportation to water resource management and agriculture to
international trade and development.
</P>
<P>
Baker said that over the past century, greenhouse gases have
increased steadly: fossil fuel combustion now accounts for about
85 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time,
agriculture, changing land-use patterns and deforestation are
playing a significant role in altering the atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases. Since 1860, the atmospheric
concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by 30 percent.
Overall emissions of greenhouse gases have been growing at about
1 percent each year, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the risks of a warmer world, Baker said that a relatively
small change in mean global temperature can lead to a large
change in extreme events. This year's El Nino has increased
rainfall, flooding and droughts. Increased duration and
frequency of heat waves would heighten mortality rates, and the
potential for transmitting serious infectious diseases would be
increased, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
According to a scientific assessment, the globally averaged
temperature will increase about 2 to 6 degrees by the year 2100.
The related rise in sea level will be about 6 to 37 inches. With
50 percent of the U.S. population and 50 to 70 percent of the
global population currently living in coastal areas, future sea
level rises, alterations in storm patterns and higher storm
surges could have devastating effects. Even with current global
populations, a 20-inch rise in the sea level without adaptive
measures would directly threaten 92 million people, wrote
Director Baker.

KUWAIT CITY, November 3 (Xinhua) -- United States Defense
Secretary William Cohen arrived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Tuesday
for discussions with Saudi leaders on issues believed focusing on
the Iraqi situation.
</P>
<P>
He went into talks with King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz right after
his arrival, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency gave no details about the meeting which it said was
attended by Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal and the
Saudi Chief of Staff Saleh Al-Mahia.
</P>
<P>
However, other reports reaching here quoted a Saudi official
who spoke on condition of anonymity as saying that King Fahd told
Cohen he will not allow his country to be used as a "springboard"
for attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is on a Gulf tour which will bring him to Kuwait
Wednesday. He came to this region after Iraq decided on last
Saturday to halt all forms of cooperation with the United Nations
arms inspectors and monitors.
</P>
<P>
Another standoff over weapons inspections early this year
almost led to military strikes on Iraq by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. allies in the Gulf region, including Saudi Arabia,
had been reluctant, during that standoff, to allow the allied
forces to use their military bases to launch an attack against

<HEADLINE> Seven Companies Receive HK Awards for Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 Hong Kong Awards for
Industry were presented Wednesday evening by Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa to seven companies in recognition of their excellence in
industrial performance.
</P>
<P>
For each of the seven award categories -- consumer product
design, machinery and equipment design, productivity, quality,
environmental performance, export marketing and technological
achievement, there was one winner.
</P>
<P>
Introduced in 1989, the award scheme is held annually to
commend distinguished companies which have achieved excellence in
different aspects of industrial performance. Competition in each
category is organized by a different organization, including the
Industry Department of the government, the Trade Development
Council, the Productivity Council and local business chambers.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered to the awards presentation ceremony, Tung
said, the diversity of 200 entries this year, covering a wide
range of products from electronics to textiles to toys, underlines
the dynamism of Hong Kong's manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
He noted: "Hong Kong, as you know, is a free market
economy. But the government does recognize that it has to play the
role of a promoter and facilitator. The Hong Kong Awards for
Industry is a good example of how the government works with the
private sector to encourage the industry itself to push forward
the boundaries of innovation and quality."
</P>
<P>
He recalled that a number of new initiatives to sustain and
sharpen Hong Kong's competitive edge was put forward in his Policy
Address last month.
</P>
<P>
These initiatives included an Innovation and Technology Fund to
provide a secure source of funding for technology-related
projects, an Applied Science and Technology Research Institute to
strengthen Hong Kong's capability in mid-stream research, and a
Small and Medium Enterprises Office in the Industry Department to
provide one-stop services to small and medium-sized
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Circular Urges Strong Measures to Combat Infidelity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangzhou City
recently issued a circular urging local governments and legal
departments to adopt strong measures to combat activities such as
bigamy, cohabitation with concubines and supporting mistresses.
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to safeguard legal marriages and protect
the rights and interests of women, married men involved in related
activities will be punished according to either administrative
regulations or law, according to an official with the All-China
Women's Federation (ACWF).
</P>
<P>
The fact that the number of cases in which married men
"cohabitate with concubines" or otherwise "support mistresses" is
rising in the city led to the formulation of the circular,
according to Ding Lu, director of the ACWF Legal Protection
Department.
</P>
<P>
Victims in bigamy can seek legal assistance from either local
courts or public security departments. Related departments will
interfere in cases deemed harmful to society even if victims
refuse to lodge complaints, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
Related departments will order married couples involved in
illegal cohabitation to cease the practise and those who ignore
warnings will be subject to administrative punishment or
reeducation through labor.
</P>
<P>
Married men who provide financial support for mistresses and
otherwise threat as a spouse will be punished as bigamists, and
those who cohabitate with prostitutes will be subject to
administrative punishment or be reeducated through labor.
</P>
<P>
The circular also suggested the introduction of punishment for
domestic violence which results from infidelity and favorable
policies to protect the innocent party and children involved in
divorce cases resulting from infidelity.
</P>
<P>
The circular will be perfected following implementation, said
Ding. She expressed hoped that legal departments will continue to
work on relevant laws and regulations in order to better protect
marriages and families, as well as the rights and interests of
women and children.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China has approved less
overseas-funded enterprises and used less foreign funds during the
first nine months of the year, reported today's International
Business Daily.
</P>
<P>
During the nine months, China approved 14,741 overseas-funded
enterprises, down 2.16 percent from the same 1997 period. However,
the contractual overseas fund stood at 35.77 billion U.S. dollars,
up 2.45 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of the investment from Asian countries to the
national total from the world dropped by 11.98 percent during the
three quarters as compared with the same period last year. But
investment from Europe and the United States continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
European investment rose at an annual rate of 64.19 percent to

<HEADLINE> Eritrean President Visits Yemen for Border Discussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean President Isayas
Aferworki arrived in Yemen Wednesday for talks with Yemeni
President Ali Abdullah Saleh to define bilateral naval borders
following the successful peaceful settlement of dispute on the
Hanish islands in the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Aferworki at the airport in Aden, Yemen's southern port
city, Saleh described the incident between the two countries as
casual and exceptional. "We have closed this file, and we are
opening a new chapter in consolidating fraternal relations," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks between the two presidents during the
three-day visit will also deal with various aspects of economic,
cultural and political cooperation as well as maritime security in
the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
Disputes of sovereignty over the strategically important Hanish
islands sparked an armed conflict between Yemen and Eritrea in
December 1995, in which Eritrea captured most of the archipelago.
</P>
<P>
But they later agreed to an arbitration over the issue. On
October 9, the London-based five-member International Arbitration
Committee ruled that Yemen has sovereignty over most of the Hanish
Islands, a decision accepted by the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni troops took over the control of the Greater Hanish
island on November 1 from the Eritrean troops.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Yemen intends to bring the issue of border
differences with Saudi Arabia to international arbitration, Saleh
said "contacts are underway between Yemen and Saudi Arabia and we
are seeking a cordial resolution based on understanding."
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Eritrean president said that relations with
Yemen are those of a family and shall always remain that way.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Eritrea intends to resolve its border disputes
with Ethiopia and others in the same manner as with Yemen, the
Eritrean president said that peaceful settlement of border issues
is the ideal approach even if the problems were other than border
disputes. Such ideal solution is a model for the resolution of all
problems, he said.

<HEADLINE> Article Addresses Repatriation of Hijackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The November issue of
"Cross-Straits Relations" will carry an article urging Taiwan
authorities to repatriate all the hijackers in custody and
participate in cross-Straits political negotiations at the
earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
The magazine is published by the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).
</P>
<P>
The article by Liao Liangkai reviews the October 28 hijacking
of an Air China flight from Beijing to Kunming in southwest China,
and notes that the incident has rekindled concern over the
cross-Straits repatriation of hijackers.
</P>
<P>
Liao points out that the two sides set a precedent in terms of
the mutual repatriation of hijackers in 1997, and noted that facts
demonstrate that a similar arrangement is practical under the
current status of cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
Regretfully, however, unnamed perpetrators in Taiwan are
attempting to use the incident as a catalyst to resume
negotiations on practical matters only, according to Liao. He goes
on to say that the repatriation of hijackers had never before been
settled through negotiations on practical matters due to fact that
Taiwan authorities adhere to so-called "rule of separate regimes".
</P>
<P>
The article notes that a review of past practices shows that
the success of negotiations on practical matters will depend on
the settlement of "judicial jurisdiction" between the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Chinese mainland has repeatedly asserted that
both sides across the Taiwan Straits must hold talks concerning
procedural matters related to political negotiations at the
earliest possible date, according to Liao.
</P>
<P>
While the Taiwan side has not as yet provided a positive
response, last year's successful mutual repatriation of hijackers
provides the only feasible way for the two side to proceed.
</P>
<P>
Liao points out that hijacking cases of civilian planes on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits in recent years have largely
resulted from the state of hostilities remaining across the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative for boths sides across the Taiwan Straits to
hold talks on ending the state of hostilities in order to
fundamentally prevent hijacking cases. Liao contends that the
Taiwan side should immediately repatriate all the hijackers
remaining in custody in Taiwan.

<P>
CAIRO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
will visit Egypt Thursday for talks with President Hosni Mubarak
on the latest developments in the Middle East peace process,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Permanent Representative to the Arab League Mohamed
Sobeih told the agency that the upcoming talks are part of the
consultations between the two leaders about the situation in the
peace process after the signing of an agreement between the
Palestinians and Israel in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the visit reflects Arafat's keenness on
coordinating stances with Mubarak on the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed on
October 23 in Washington the accord, under which Israel will
withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinian tougher measures against anti-Israeli violence.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian diplomat said that frustration and
tensions are prevailing the region due to Israel's evasiveness to
fulfill its obligations, referring to Israel's delay of
ratification of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
For the second time in two days, Netanyahu postponed a cabinet
meeting Tuesday, during which the agreement was to have been
ratified, a must besides the approval of the Israeli Knesset
(Parliament) before the implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have said the ministers would not be convened
until Israel receives written guarantees from the United States
that 30 Palestinian fugitives will be arrested.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have said they have handed a work plan for
fighting Islamic extremists to the U.S., which is to brief Israel.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih called on the U.S., sponsor of the accord, to help
promote the implementation of the agreement.

<HEADLINE> China's Computer Peripherals Market Grows Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China's computer peripherals
market is expanding in pace with the rapid growth of its personal
computer market.
</P>
<P>
Today, the world's top laser printer manufacturer Hewlett
Packer (HP) released a series of the latest peripheral products in
the Chinese market, including laser printers, scanners, ink-jet
printers, network printer management software and machines that
combine the functions of printer, scanner and copy machine.
</P>
<P>
It held a big-bang inauguration of a one-month, eight-city
touring show of the new products in China in the Big Bell Temple
in north Beijing this morning.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Morgan, general director of the Asia-Pacific
Peripherals Marketing Center of HP, said that multi-functional
machines has become a trend in today's office equipment market. He
predicts that by 2001, machines combining functions of printer,
scanner, copy and fax machines will take up one-fourth of the
world peripherals market.
</P>
<P>
An official from China HP Co. Ltd. said that China has become
the largest market of HP laser printers in Asia Pacific. He said
that China market is larger than those of the ROK, Indonesia and
several other countries combined. HP now occupies 80 percent of
China's laser printer market.
</P>
<P>
He noted that by the end of 2000, the country will become the
second largest personal computer market in the world, following
Japan. At the same time, China's peripherals market is growing in
pace with the PC market.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the number of laser printers that HP sold in China
increased by 80 percent over 1996, with sales value increasing by
60 percent. At the same time, the company's sales of laser printer
in Asia Pacific as a whole increased by only 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, China has become a driving force in
developing the peripherals market in Asia Pacific.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, HP accounted for about 70 percent of the
network printer market in Asia. It has already signed contracts
with seven Chinese companies to sell its printers in China.
</P>
<P>
One of the companies is the Legend Group, the largest PC
manufacturer in the country. Legend also has cooperation with IBM

<HEADLINE> Peace in Afghanistan Only Through Indigenous Process: Pak FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Describing peace in
Afghanistan "no longer a far fetched dream," Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz Wednesday said it can be achieved only
through the indigenous Afghan process.
</P>
<P>
The main elements for ending the conflict are in place and "the
promotion of this objective will be our foremost and immediate
endeavor," said Aziz at the concluding session of a seminar on
Pak-German dialogue held in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The indigenous Afghan process can lead to the establishment of
a multi-ethnic government, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taliban militia now virtually control all of
Afghanistan and "anarchy of the past has been replaced by
stability."
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban are not averse to a multi-ethnic government," he
said, "they have announced a general amnesty and declared that
their agenda is purely domestic and poses no threat to any other
country."
</P>
<P>
Referring to Pakistan's efforts to bring peace to the war-torn
country, he said Pakistan established intensive contact with
Afghan parties on both sides of the political divide which led to
the meeting of Afghan groups in a Steering Committee under the
auspices of the U.N. and the Organization of Islamic Conference in
Islamabad in April this year.
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterwards, Pakistan and Iran launched a joint
initiative to promote the Afghan peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We consider the military success or failures of an group to be
an internal affair of that country. Our only interest is the early
restoration of durable peace," he said.

BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, the chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress,
emphasized the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) in
China's reforms and opening up today in his closing remarks at the
Fifth Meeting of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Party propositions need to be made law through the
legal process in the People's Congress and the Party's basic line
and principles need to be guaranteed in the law and in practice.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Party's goal is to develop socialist democracy
and to perfect the socialist legal system and that the reforms,
opening up and modernization need the backing of the Party.
</P>
<P>
These, in turn, need improvements in the People's Congressional
system, he said, and no matter whether the NPC is engaged in
legislation, supervision, or other work, it should bring together
the people's will, represent the people's interests, reflect the
people's demands and have the people's supervision.
</P>
<P>
The work of the NPC and the Standing Committee should be
understood by the people to get broader support from them, and
this means increasing publicity in the news media, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Political parties in Sao Tome &AMP;
Principe, an island African country in Atlantic Ocean, have been
engaged, since the end of October, in hot competition for seats
in the parliamentary elections to be held on November 8.
</P>
<P>
Sao Tome &AMP; Principe Liberation Movement--the Social Democratic
Party (MLSTP), though having served as the ruling party in the
past four years, had to form a coalition government with
Independent Democratic Party (ADI) and Democratic Unification
Party (PCD).
</P>
<P>
Manuel Pinto Da Costa, Chairman of MLSTP which has 27 of the
55 seats in parliament, wishes to win the majority of the voters
in the forthcoming elections and thus lay a sound foundation for
a one-party government.
</P>
<P>
In a recent election campaign gathering, Munuel Pinto Da Costa
urged electors to cast votes for a party capable of governing the
country alone, so that the country could get rid of social
turmoil and create conditions for economic development and social
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Munuel Pinto Da Costa has served as the first president of the
country after it won its independence in 1975.
</P>
<P>
He said he has confidence to win the elections.
</P>
<P>
Though apparently weaker than the ruling MLSTP, the other
seven parties have not formed any allies and seem to be trying to
win the vote for a one-party governance.
</P>
<P>
Sao Tome &AMP; Principe, with a population of 130,000, is one of
the poorest countries in the world with Cocoa and other cash
crops as its staple produce.
</P>
<P>
Angola, which has sent hundres of troops to help safeguard
the defense of Sao Tome &AMP; Principe, has a great impact on the
island country.

JOHANNESBURG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Namibians who entered
Botswana illegally last week are still being interviewed to
determine the kind of protection they need, Southern African
Broadcasting Association (SABA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
SABA quoted a Botswana presidential spokesman as saying in
Gaborone that the people have not yet said what kind of
protection they need. He denied media reports that the group had
applied for asylum.
</P>
<P>
Botswana also denied having labeled the Namibians as soldiers
who did not want to be sent to the Democratic Republic of the
Congo to quell the rebellion against President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The 104 Namibians, including former Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance leader Mishake Muyongo and Mafwe tribe chief Boniface
Mamili, crossed into Botswana in two groups last Tuesday and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They were detained by the Botswana authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government Monday described these people as
"terrorists" and said they were in a plot to secede the Caprivi
region in the northeast border with Botswana, Angola, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.
</P>

The Mafwe is one of five tribes living in the region.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Apply for Licenses for Arms Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian civilians have
applied for licenses to sell weapons under a controversial
government decision on the liberalization of the arms trade.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the Tanzania Police Force, Senior Assistant
Commissioner of Police Aden Mwamunyange, has said that 25 people,
mostly retired public servants, operators of hunting safaris and
businessmen, have made their applications.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman, quoted by media here Wednesday,
said that the government would only announce the five names of
the companies or individuals who would be granted the licenses.
</P>
<P>
He said that weapons trade is only allowed in six authorized
zones: Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Mwanza, Mbeya, Mtwara and Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
The applications will be studied by the Inspector General of
Police, Omar Mahita, and the Director of Criminal Investigations
(DCI), Adadi Rajabu, when they come back from an Interpol meeting
in Egypt this week.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania decided last month to practice the liberalization of
the arms trade which has since been met by a large public outcry
for possible increased armed robbery and dynamite fishing.
</P>
<P>
However, the Minister for Home Affairs, Ali Ameir Mohammed,
has argued that the trade will be strictly under the government
supervision in order to assure citizens of the safety of their
lives and property.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Risks COMESA Tariff Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambia risks being booted out
of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) for
continued non-compliance of the grouping's tariff reduction
time-table, reported Times of Zambia Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The warning was issued by COMESA senior program analyst Alick
Tembo, at a tax consultative meeting of the Zambia Revenue
Authority (ZRA) held Tuesday in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The 21-member regional grouping, said Tembo, planned to
achieve a zero tariff rate in all member countries by the year
2000 in order to create a free trade region.
</P>
<P>
"But Zambia is lagging behind and is not sticking to the
grouping's tariff reduction schedule," Tembo noted.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the country has only achieved a 60 percent
tariff reduction rate up till now and has not achieved the
stipulated rates for the past years.
</P>
<P>
All members are committed to have reduced tariffs by 80
percent as at October 1996 and by 90 percent by October 1998,
according to a tariff reduction program of COMESA, which was
established in 1994 to replace the Preferential Trade Area for
Eastern and Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Unless Zambia hastens to implement the tariff reductions and
adheres to the time-table, said Tembo, it risks being kicked out
of the Lusaka-based grouping.
</P>
<P>
He said that to date only Madagascar has achieved a 90
percent tariff reduction rate while other member states are still
trying to meet the target.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Calls for Continued SFOR Presence in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- United Nations special envoy
to Bosnia-Herzegovina Elizabeth Rehn asked Wednesday the NATO-led
multinational peacekeeping force remain in Bosnia for "some years."
</P>
<P>
Rehn briefed NATO's decision-making North Atlantic Council and
Secretary-General Javier Solana about the work of the
U.N.-designated International Police Task Force (IPTF) in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meetings at the NATO headquarters here, the
U.N. envoy told the press that the Stabilization Force (SFOR) led
by NATO should stay in the Balkan country for some more years.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the two years suggested by some are enough for
the IPTF to well train local police for effectively maintaining
the function of the state," the U.N. envoy said.
</P>
<P>
The SFOR's presence is still needed for quite a while to secure
the safety of the 2,000-strong unarmed IPTF, which comes from a
total of 43 countries worldwide, she added.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult for U.N. to stay while others are leaving," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The IPTF mission becomes dangerous, Rehn said, when its
training starts to involve the investigation and dealing with
corruption cases, especially those concerning government officials.
</P>
<P>
She told the North Atlantic Council that smugglers had killed a
couple of local police in the summer to threaten police away from
investigation into corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
The SFOR is needed more while the next focus of the IPTF will
be on the training and establishing of a new border control police
force in Bosnia to curb illegal imports, exports and drug
trafficking, she said.
</P>
<P>
The SFOR is the continuation of the NATO-led peacekeeping force
which entered Bosnia after the December 1995 signing of the Dayton
peace accord in Dayton, Ohio, of the United States.
</P>
<P>
NATO has decided to maintain the SFOR's current force level
after taking into consideration of the status quo of Bosnia, but
has been thinking of downsizing the force or replacing it with a
smaller deterrence force.

<HEADLINE> Outdoor Quest on Your Mark By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALI, China, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Mild Seven Outdoor
Quest will kick off here on Thursday to mark the largest
gathering ever of adventure racers.
</P>
<P>
Athletes from six continents will showcase their running, moun
tain biking, paddling and rock climbing skills in and around
Dali's daunting mountain-and-forest terrain. When the dust has
settled, one team will fly home with the lion's share of a
200,000 U.S. dollars purse.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you'll ever see a more tightly-contested
athletic competition than this year's MSOQ," said course designer
Don Baker, who's also traing Team China.
</P>
<P>
"You've got last year's champions back to defend, you've got
the Raid Gouloises champions here looking for another win, and
you've got ironman triathletes seeking a chance test adventure
racing for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"No other race in the world has this many top endurance
athletes competing for so much money under such grueling
conditions. I can't wait to watch."
</P>
<P>
The race will be held in four stages. Like all adventure
races, MSOQ is a team races. Each four-person squad is required
to have at least one individual from the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
This is to ensure a balanced team dynamic and promote the sort
of team dynamic so often found in major expeditions and even the
corporate world.
</P>
<P>
Team will race from four to six hours per day. Each day's
competitive stage will ask competitors to perform a number of
events, whether they be running and mountain biking, inline
skating and mountain biking, climbing and paddling, or a
combination of all three. The team with the lowest elapsed time
after the four days will be declared winner.
</P>
<P>
Like the Tour de France cycling race, which uses a similar
stage format, the teams are often tightly bunched upon arrival at
the finish. Last year's champions, Team SCAR, won by just two
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Of the 24 teams, almost all have either a world champion,
Olympic champion, or national champion on board. Team China is a
great example of athletic talent, with a pool of runners,
swimmers, cyclists and even wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
The squad which all teams fear is Team SCAR. Led by captain
David Kelly, a longtime veteran adventure racer, SCAR boast a
balanced blend of adventure racers and triathletes.
</P>
<P>
The two adventure racers -- Kelly and Terry Schneider -- bring
a calm efficiency to the team. When the pressure's on they'll be
the ones who remind all others to calm down and think clearly
before forging ahead.
</P>
<P>
The triathletes -- Mike Pigg and Paul Huddle -- bring their
own desire for speed to the team. These accomplished veterans
race hard and they race fast.
</P>
<P>
The bald Pigg is a dauntless competitor, while the witty
Huddle masks his drive with a wry sense of humor. During the
1997 MSOQ they were seen towing their adventure racing teammates
through the more grueling running and mountain biking sections.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Rural Autonomy Promotes Real Democracy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A villager from east China's
Zhejiang Province once wrote to the country's top legislature,
saying that "the law should provide means for my village head to
manage me and it should also give me a means to supervise him."
</P>
<P>
His dream came true today with approval of the Amendments to
the Organic Law of Villagers' Committees which guarantees
villagers full rights to autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The amended law, which was approved by the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress (NPC) and signed by President
Jiang Zemin, went into effect today.
</P>
<P>
"The law is closely associated with the interests of 900
million people in the rural areas and the trial implementation of
the law in the past decade has greatly promoted the development of
democracy and legal system in rural China," NPC Chairman Li Peng
said.
</P>
<P>
"The amendments were made to improve detailed procedures
for direct elections, democratic decision-making and management,
and public supervision over village affairs, as well as to further
improve the autonomy of villagers," Li Peng added.
</P>
<P>
"The law was worked in a true democratic manner and
incorporated the opinions of people from all walks of life from Li
Peng, the nation's top lawmaker down to villagers," said Zhang
Chunsheng, a renowned jurist and deputy director of the NPC's
Legislative Work Committee, who has been directly responsible for
drafting the amendments.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee solicited opinions on over 1,000
revisions for the draft law, and the NPC chairman visited rural
households to solicit ideas from villagers, NPC sources said.
</P>
<P>
The law contained detailed procedures covering direct elections
of village leaders, the daily operations of villagers' committees
and public supervision.
</P>
<P>
"The details will ensure the autonomy of villagers," according
to Zhang.

</P>
<P>
The delegation was led by Pakistan Defense Secretary Iftikhar
Ali Khan. The two sides would hold talks on the Siachen issue

<TEXT>
<P>
To guarantees democratic elections, the law stipulates that the
village head, deputy head and members of villagers' committees
will be directly elected by villagers. No organization can appoint
or dismiss elected officials without the permission from the
committee.
</P>
<P>
All villagers, at the age of 18 and above, with the exception
of individuals who have lost their political rights, have the
right to vote and stand for election.
</P>
<P>
The law stipulates that means of threat, bribery or forged
ballots will void the election of candidates involved, and all
conspirators in the act will be subject to severe punishment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it clearly stipulates procedures for the
nomination of candidates, and both the election and removal of
village leaders.
</P>
<P>
In terms of ensuring democratic policies and management, the
law contains a stipulation that all matters involving the rights
of villagers, including contracted land and allocating land for
housing, should be submitted to the villagers' committee for
review.
</P>
<P>
The committee should practise an open door policy and publish a
village financial report every six months.
</P>
<P>
One of the major revisions in the law is contained in the added
clause concerning the relationship between the grass-roots
organizations of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) and villagers'
committees.
</P>
<P>
The clause states that a village Party branch should conduct
its work in line with CPC policies, play its due leadership role,
and support and guarantee that the villagers' committee exercises
its autonomy in line with the Constitution and law.
</P>
<P>
The clause was added by members of the NPC Standing Committee
in line with the guidelines set forth at the Third Plenum of 15th
CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The amended law also retained the draft law clause stipulating
that township governments play simply a guiding role over
villagers' committees and have no leadership position.
</P>
<P>
Members of the NPC Standing Committee expressed great
satisfaction with the revised Villagers' Committee Law.
</P>
<P>
Standing Committee member Feng Zhijun quoted late NPC Chairman
Peng Zhen as saying that "villagers' committees will help
villagers learn how to administer their villages and then they
will administer townships and counties."
</P>
<P>
"Democracy at the grass-roots level will advance on a step by
step basis along with improvements in village autonomy," Feng
added.

<HEADLINE> IMF Mission Arrives This week to Resume Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Islamabad November 4 (Xinhua) -- The third round of talks
between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Pakistan will
resume this week for the revival of a stalled financial program
and approval of a new package.
</P>
<P>
An eight-member IMF mission, headed by senior director A. Eken,
is scheduled to arrive here this week to hold extensive talks with
Pakistan on the restoration of a suspended program of 1.6 billion
U.S. dollars and approval of a new financial package for Pakistan,
official sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier two rounds of talks between IMF and Pakistan were held
in Islamabad and Washington to finalize the restoration of the old
program, stalled after the nuclear blasts by Pakistan on May 28.
</P>
<P>
The talks with the IMF mission, which is to stay here for 10
days, are now expected to finalize the agreement which would be
then submitted to the Board's meeting for final approval.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has proposed certain conditionalities to revive the old
program and approve a new bail out package.
</P>
<P>
It also demanded upward revision in power tariffs and switching
over to unified exchange rate, the sources said adding the Fund's
officials were earlier convinced that there was no need to
incorporate any increase in power tariffs.

<HEADLINE> Radio, TV Services Growing in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China now has 923 TV stations
and 1,363 radio stations, according to Tian Congming, director of
the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television.
</P>
<P>
Tian told the 35th Conference of the Asian-Pacific Broadcasting
Union today that designing programs and delivering them to more
than 1.2 billion people in such a vast area with its varied
topography is a very difficult job.
</P>
<P>
Tian said that China's broadcasting services have developed
partly because of modern science and technology. The government
began spending on satellites in 1985, he said, and China Central
Television and 26 provincial stations now use satellites for their
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
China has about 150,000 satellite earth stations, most of which
are located in remote rural areas, Tian said, and the number of
broadcasting and relay stations has grown to more than 40,000.
</P>
<P>
China is now taking measures to ensure that every village will
have access to radio and television by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Cable television service has also developed a great deal and is
providing more programs that meet the various needs of different
kinds of people.
</P>
<P>
China had 756 cable television stations and 70 million
customers by the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Official Forecasts Faster Fourth Quarter Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China's current efforts to
increase infrastructure investments is expected to result in
accelerated economic growth in the fourth quarter of the year,
compared with the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Ye Zhen, a spokesman for the State Statistics Bureau, made the
comment today during in an exclusive interview with Xinhua News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese economy is sure to grow at an accelerated rate in
the fourth quarter," said Ye. However, he stopped short of
predicting the actual growth rate, and simply noted that growth
will depend on various changing factors in both China and the
world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that July-September gross domestic
product grew by 7.6 percent on the 1997 period, with growth for
the first nine months standing at 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The effectiveness of the government's latest programs to spur
the economy by bolstering demand on the domestic market and
increasing investments in infrastructure will be revealed in the
last three months of the year, according to Ye.
</P>
<P>
Investments in the state sector grew by 20 percent in the first
nine months, with the September figure alone hitting 33.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Reconstruction efforts following heavy summer flooding and the
accelerated construction of water conservation projects are also
expected to boost the economy, according to the spokesman.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ye noted that official statistics show optimistic figures
implying faster growth in the fourth quarter accompanied by
increases in the money supply and investment, as well as
rebounding prices for industrial products such rolled steel and
plate glass.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, improving situations for both the industrial
sector and the consumer market show the optimism of local
entrepreneurs and consumers.
</P>
<P>
However, the official noted that China's economy continues to
face a number of changing factors such as the current financial
turmoils in Asia and the orientation of demand on the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
Reaching the annual target will require fourth quarter growth
of at least nine percent, Ye said, adding that "it will be quite
difficult to achieve the goal judging from the current situation,
but it is nonetheless possible if we extend greater efforts."
</P>
<P>
Ye predicted that China will develop at an "appropriate and
possibly even higher speed" next year.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the "eight-percent goal is simply a guiding
target and stressed that statistics departments will follow the
principle of 'seeking truth from facts' when reporting this year's
growth rate regardless of the ending figures.
</P>
<P>
"China's growth rate will continue to lead the world even if
the figure is lower than the targeted eight percent. The most
important thing is for China to determine exactly how to regulate
the economic structure and improve the quality of the economic
growth, while simultaneously maintaining an appropriate growth
rate."

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Not to Clarify Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
said Wednesday the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) will not
provide any "clarification" on a security plan it has submitted to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Dahlan, PNA security chief in Gaza, made the remarks
as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu postponed once more
Wednesday a cabinet meeting that was to ratify the peace agreement
signed in Washington, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, said that the cabinet
meeting will not be convened until Israel receives written
guarantees from the U.S. that 30 Palestinian fugitives will be
arrested.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Netanyahu held up the cabinet session that was to
start a two-day debate on the peace agreement, citing the same
reasons.
</P>
<P>
He said the PNA security plan was incomplete and an important
element is missing.
</P>
<P>
The agreement should have gone into effect last Monday
regardless of ratification, but Netanyahu said due to Israel's
legal constraints, the accord will be effective only after being
approved by the cabinet and the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Tuesday that
the failure of the PNA to give a specific timetable for arresting
30 Palestinians suspected of murdering Israelis was holding up the
ratification.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials accused Netanyahu of "playing political
games" in order to delay the implementation of the land-for-peace
deal, which envisages that Israel pulls back its troops from 13.1
more percent of the West Bank within three months while the
Palestinians intensify crackdown on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Washington said Tuesday it was "astonished" by Netanyahu's
decision to delay the cabinet ratification while describing the
PNA's plan as satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Wednesday that
the Wye Plantation agreement did not mention the issue over the
arrest of the 30 Palestinian suspects.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Israel and the Palestinians reached a
verbal agreement over the issue, but Netanyahu now insisted that
the guarantee be written into the security plan.

<HEADLINE> UN Welcomes Release of Staffer by Afghan Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Wednesday welcomed
the release of one of its staff members by the Afghan Taliban but
was disappointed over the slow pace of the implementation of the
agreement signed in Islamabad last month.
</P>
<P>
"We welcomed the release of one of the U.N. staff members but
are disappointed over the slow progress on the full implementation
of the agreement with Taliban." U.N. spokesperson Saraah Russell
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations is concerned about the another staff member
who is still in Taliban custody," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and the U.N. inked an 11-point "Security Agreement"
in Islamabad on October 23 that had made the Taliban responsible
for the security of U.N. personnel in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Taliban would have to give a
satisfactory report about the killing of three U.N. staff members
in Taliban controlled areas this year.
</P>
<P>
"We are also disappointed about Taliban response to the
submitting of a detailed report about the killing of three U.N.
staff members in Jalalabad and Kabul," the spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. pulled about 50 foreign workers out of war-torn
Afghanistan on August 21 after the killing of an Italian U.N.
worker Carmine Calo who was killed during an angry demonstration
against the U.S. cruise missile attack on Saudi dissident Osama
bin Laden in Khost on August 21.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesperson said that "there is no possibility of
the return of U.N. international staff to Kabul until the full
compliance of the agreement by Taliban."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Armed Forces to Follow Up Fact-Finding Team Report: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister and
Chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) Gen. Wiranto said he
respects and will follow up the findings of the
government-appointed team investigating the May riots.
</P>
<P>
"What the team announced yesterday (Tuesday) are the facts that
will be submitted to relevant government bodies for follow up," he
told reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We really appreciate the three-month investigation carried out
by the team. They have spent time and energy (on it)," he said
after speaking before the 1,500 participants of the ongoing
Indonesian Muslim People's Congress here.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Joint Fact-Finding Team Marzuki Darusman on Tuesday
night announced the results of their investigations on the May
riots that forced former president Soeharto to resign from office.
</P>
<P>
Their findings showed that more than 1,000 people were killed
during the riots and that 52 women were raped, 14 more fell victim
to rape with violence, 10 to sexual attacks, and 9 to sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
The team is urging the government to investigate a secret
meeting held at the Army's Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad)
headquarters on May 14, and the possible role of Soeharto's
son-in-law Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subiyanto and former Jakarta military
commander Maj. Gen. Sjafrie Sjamsoedin.
</P>
<P>
"The analysis that the team has made is not the final one. It
was based on the facts the team has collected. But of course, we
will pay attention to the findings," Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto further said that he would compare the team's findings
and analysis with those of other government bodies.
</P>
<P>
ABRI spokesman Maj. Gen. Syamsul Ma'arif said the ABRI will
clarify the May 14 meeting held at the Kostrad headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Head Of NPC Standing Committee On Party's Legislative Role (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, the chairman of tding Committee of China's National
People's Congress,
emphasized the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) in
China's reforms and opening up today in his closing remarks at the
Fifth Meeting of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Party propositions need to be made law through the
legal process in the People's Congress and the Party's basic line
and principles need to be guaranteed in the law and in practice.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Party's goal is to develop socialist democracy
and to perfect the socialist legal system and that the reforms,
opening up and modernization need the backing of the Party.
</P>
<P>
These, in turn, need improvements in the People's Congressional
system, he said, and no matter whether the NPC is engaged in
legislation, supervision, or other work, it should bring together
the people's will, represent the people's interests, reflect the
people's demands and have the people's supervision.
</P>
<P>
The work of the NPC and the Standing Committee should be
understood by the people to get broader support from them, and
this means increasing publicity in the news media, he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Rules Out Interfering in Forex Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Wednesday that it will not interfere in the continued appreciation
of the peso.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said the strengthening of
the Philippine currency is a welcome relief for the nation.
</P>
<P>
"The good performance of the peso in the foreign exchange
market can be traced to the country's sound macro-economic
fundamentals and fiscal policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barican made the remarks in response to a published report
saying that the rapid strengthening of the peso is likely to tip
the exchange rate to against U.S. dollar before the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The report said this possible development is worrying traders
and market analysts.
</P>
<P>
The peso exchange rate Wednesday closed at 39.08 against U.S.
dollar compared with the rate of 39.38 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Local currency traders reportedly claimed that there was room
for peso to keep appreciating due to strong dollar inflows and
slow dollar demand.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Continues to Support Open University: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) will continue to support
the Open University of Hong Kong (OUHK) in its future development,
said Anson Chan, administrative secretary of the SAR, here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government is helping it to develop into a center of
excellence in adult and distance learning so that it can serve as
a resource center not just for Hong Kong, but for the region as
well, Chan said when addressing the opening ceremony of the 12th
Annual Conference of the Asian Association of Open Universities
(AAOU) at the OUHK.
</P>
<P>
A one-off grant of about 50 million HK dollars (6.41 million
U.S. dollars) will be provided for this purpose, Chan said. The
government will also inject another 50 million HK dollars (6.41
million U.S. dollars) to OUHK's Student Loan Fund so that current
and prospective students will not be denied the opportunity of
continuing their studies because of a lack of means, she added.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that innovation and value-adding is very important in
today's economy for it is innovation that is driving the world
and fueling the growth engine.
</P>
<P>
A society or nation aspiring to continual prosperity must
create and maintain a pool of talents equipped with the most
up-to-date knowledge, Chan said. To bring in as many people as
possible into this pool, it is necessary to ensure that education
is accessible to all regardless of age or means, she noted.
</P>
<P>
"This is what we in Hong Kong firmly believe, as embodied in
our principles of 'education for all' and 'education for life',"
Chan said. Education is the single biggest item of Hong Kong's
public expenditure, accounting for some 22 percent of the total
recurrent budget, and despite the economic downturn, spending will
continue to rise, Chan disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"We provide nine years of free and compulsory education,
beginning at the age of 6 and up to 15. Beyond that, about 95
percent of children complete heavily subsidized upper secondary or
equivalent technical education," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"We also provide subsidized tertiary education to about 24
percent of the relevant age group. This is further proof of our
commitment to providing quality education at all levels," she
added.
</P>
<P>
So, "Education for all" -- an ideology propounded by Confucius
centuries ago -- is well-respected and widely practiced in Hong
Kong today and is perpetuated in the motto of the OUHK, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
For those who aspire to receiving tertiary education but have
missed out or were deprived of the chance to do so, open learning
has made their aspirations come true.
</P>
<P>
Turning to "education for life," Chan said that nowadays, it is
simplistic to regard education as a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
</P>
<P>
In this Information Age, the shelf life of knowledge and
expertise is getting shorter and shorter and this is not only
confined to the so-called hi-tech industry, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Even more traditional industries such as finance and banking
are quickly capitalizing on the latest breakthrough in information
technology, she added.
</P>
<P>
Those who fail to catch up with the latest market trend and
production technique will be left behind, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated there are about 320 000 people in Hong Kong
engaged in some form of continuing and professional education at
the higher education level -- that's about one in ten of Hong
Kong's working population, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
The Open University is one of the biggest providers in this
field, Chan said. The Open University has developed and matured
into a key component of our education system, she added.
</P>
<P>
Over 6 000 people have graduated from OUHK. Its student
population has grown from 4 200 in 1989, the year it was
established, to about 24 000 at present.
</P>
<P>
The 12th Annual Conference of the AAOU has attracted more than
180 academics and senior administrators from 22 countries around
the world.
</P>
<P>
The conference was sponsored by the World Bank, the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the
Commonwealth of Learning, the Croucher foundation and the Lam Kin
Chung Morning Sun Charity Fund and others.
</P>
<P>
The AAOU was founded in 1987 to promote the development of open
and distance education in the Asian region and currently has 37
members.
</P>
<P>
Its membership not only covers the whole Asian continent but
also includes major open universities in Britain, South Africa,
Australia, New Zealand and Canada.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Secretary Ends Visit to Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen left here Wednesday for Bahrain after his brief
talks with Kuwaiti leaders on the recent Iraqi-U.N. standoff over
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived here earlier Wednesday, met with Kuwaiti
Emir Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and Crown Prince and Prime Minister
Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah on ways to force Iraq to abide
by relevant U.N. resolutions, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Cohen began his Mideast tour Tuesday in Saudi Arabia where he
held talks with King Fahd on drumming up support for possible
U.S. military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
There have been different accounts of the talks in the Saudi
Arabia. The Pentagon has said that Cohen was assured of Saudi
backing in the event of military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But an unnamed Saudi official has said that the king told Cohen
he will not allow his country to be used as a "springboard" for
attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq suspended all its relations with the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq last Saturday, which aroused
strong criticism from the U.S. and some of its allies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said that it will not rescind the decision unless the
U.N. reviews the Iraq's progress in disarmament "in an honest and
positive way, leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust
sanction," imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. will not remove the sanctions until UNSCOM certifies
that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused UNSCOM of serving U.S. interests and
trying to prolong the devastating sanctions. It announced to
suspend cooperation with UNSCOM in early August but allowed
monitoring activities to proceed.
</P>
<P>
During the last Iraqi-U.N. standoff over weapons inspections in
February, Kuwait was alone among Arab states in opening its air
bases to American and British warplanes to carry out possible
strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, a spokesman for Kuwait's Defense Ministry said
Kuwait "was not a side in the current standoff between Iraq and
the United Nations Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait always strives for peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cohen will arrive in Turkey Friday for a brief visit to solicit
Ankara's support.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Closes Weaker at 8,275 to US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah closed at
8,275/8,775 to the U.S. dollar here Wednesday, weakening 25 points
compared to Tuesday's close of 8,250/8,400 to the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was traded at a range of 850 points, with the
highest level at 8,150 to the U.S. dollar and the lowest at 9,000
to the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was stabilized after Coordinating Minister for
Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita said that
there is no postponement in the disbursement of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) fund for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"There is no problem. It is just a matter of rearranging. On
Friday, it will have been cleared," Ginandjar said before
attending a limited cabinet meeting on economy, finance and
industry in the presidential office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
IMF has planned to clear a fund of 1 billion U.S. dollars every
month for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar believes that the fund will be received next week on
Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the rupiah continued to decline in the
Jakarta spot market as U.S. dollar demand ahead of the People's
Consultative Assembly's (MPR's) session next week continued to
increase.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen quite a huge dollar demand by domestic banks," a
chief dealer with a joint venture bank said.
</P>
<P>
The MPR is scheduled to hold a special session on November 10
to 13 in Jakarta to discuss next year's general, presidential and
vice presidential elections.

<HEADLINE> China's Small Businesses to Get More Bank Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China's medium-sized and small
businesses may expect more bank loans as the government calls
for more support to such businesses.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China (BOC), one of the nation's biggest state
commercial banks, has worked out special guidelines concerning
servicing such enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The bank said it will focus its support to profitable firms in
more developed areas and areas with good repaying record.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises in power, transportation, telecommunications, and
electronics sectors and firms in promising and high-tech
industries such as information technology and new materials may
also expect support.
</P>
<P>
Medium-sized and small firms have always remained an important
client group for the BOC. They have received 30 percent of the BOC
loans in foreign exchanges and 60 percent in renminbi loans.
</P>
<P>
The bank extended a total of 10.4 billion yuan to such
enterprises during the January-September period, about 31 percent
of the total amount.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than ten million medium-sized and small
enterprises, more than 80 percent of the total. Such enterprises
contribute 60 percent of the national industrial output value and
40 percent of the total industrial profits. They also provided
jobs for 75 percent urban working force.

<HEADLINE> HK Official Calls for More IT Cooperation with Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Secretary for
Information Technology and Broadcasting K. C. Kwong Wednesday
called for closer business relationship in the information
technology (IT) field between Hong Kong and Canada.
</P>
<P>
He said that following the signing of the Memorandum of
Understanding on cooperation in information and communications
technology in May this year, Hong Kong "will organize even more
cooperative ventures that will involve not just the two
governments, but also the IT industry, business and professionals
as well as academics in our two places."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a breakfast gathering of the Canadian Chamber of
Commerce in Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Information Technology
Federation, Kwong outlined five specific areas in IT which would
provide business opportunities for Canadian companies.
</P>
<P>
These include the outsourcing of government IT projects,
applications and services relating to electronic commerce, IT in
education, rectification of the Year 2000 problem, and development
of services and content on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
On government IT projects, Kwong noted that HK government
spending on IT was expected to reach 2.1 billion HK dollars (269
million U.S. dollars) in 1998-1999, an increase of 11 percent over
the previous year. And starting from 1999-2000, all new IT
development and maintenance projects will be outsourced unless
there are over-riding reasons from retaining the work in-house.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to outsource some two-thirds of all new IT projects
in government by 2001-2002," he said, adding that this should
create a market of sufficient size to stimulate the development of
and investment in the local IT industry.
</P>
<P>
Kwong said that the Year 2000 problem would also generate
business opportunities for IT companies. "To IT practitioners,
this is probably the largest ever maintenance project they would
see in the IT history," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The heightened awareness of the Year 2000 problem in Hong Kong
means more business opportunities for IT companies, including
Canadian ones, to provide consultancy services and compliance
solutions to the local companies," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Republican Party
retained control of both houses of the US Congress following
national congressional elections, television networks said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the 100-seat Senate, the balance of power remained unchanged
with Republicans holding a 55-to-45 majority over the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
In the 435-seat House of Representatives, the Republican
majority was diminished from a 22-seat advantage to about a
14-seat lead, according to network projections.
</P>
<P>
That drop marked the first time since 1934 that the party
controlling the White House also picked up seats in the House of
Representatives in a midterm election.
</P>
<P>
Democratic politicians interpreted the results of the House
voting as a signal from voters that impeachment hearings against
President Bill Clinton, scheduled to get under way next week,
should be wrapped up as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
The House voted last month to open an impeachment inquiry into
the scandal surrounding Clinton's sexual relationship with a young
White House intern and his subsequent testimony about it under
oath.

</P>
<P>
Running up 21 points in succession, the Dutch dominated the

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Strengthen Futures Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Securities
Commission (SC) Wednesday announced guidelines aimed at
strengthening the domestic futures industry.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines concern application of futures fund manager's
license, futures fund manager representative's license and the
registration of compliance officers, the SC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines, an application for a futures fund
manager's license requires a paid-up capital of 2 million ringgit
(about 0.526 million U.S. dollars) and a deposit of 150,000
ringgit (about 39,473 U.S. dollars) to be paid to the commission.
</P>
<P>
However, the SC said that current holders of fund manager's
license under the Securities Industry Act 1983 would not be
required to add to their existing paid-up capital or deposit an
additional 150,000 ringgit to the SC.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that to ensure the interests of investors
are protected, the applicants for futures fund manager's license
would also be required to provide comprehensive policy and
operational manuals/procedures inclusive of, but not limited to,
its risk management system, organization structure, investment
policies, procedures for compliance with the applicable laws,
regulations, rules and guidelines, its system and internal
control.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a futures fund manager must have a compliance
officer who would ensure compliance with the laws, rules and
regulations, and the said officer must be registered with the SC.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines were prepared after consultation with relevant
industry groups in conjunction with the amendments on the Futures
Industry Act 1993 which came into force on November 1, 1998, the
SC said.

<P>
NICOSIA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
left here Wednesday after a three-day state visit to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
No statements were made at the airport before his departure.
</P>
<P>
During his stay on the island, Weizman held official talks
with his Cypriot counterpart Glafcos Clerides on bilateral and
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has expressed concern over the island's security in view
of Israel's growing military cooperation with Turkey, a long-time
foe of the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Weizman assured Cyprus during the talks that the cooperation
agreement between Israel and Turkey is not aimed at any third
party, including Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Greece coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has so far maintained 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus,
which was declared unilaterally in 1983 by Turkish Cypriots as a
breakaway Turkish republic recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the visit, the Cypriot government said the
Israeli president's trip is a "very important" effort to develop
further bilateral relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Cyprus and Israel have been enchanced since
Cyprus opened its embassy in Tel Aviv five years ago.

<P>
BEIRUT, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Three members of the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) were killed and another
one wounded by a roadside bomb in south Lebanon Tuesday, the
Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The remote-controlled bomb was detonated by Lebanese guerrillas
when a SLA armored personnel carrier passed by on a road in
Jezzine, just north of the Israeli occupied border strip in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack, saying the blast totally destroyed
the tank and killed all people on board.
</P>
<P>
The fresh casualties raised to 31 the number of SLA militiamen
killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year. Another 39
were wounded over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to dislodge Israeli troops and their
proxy SLA militia there.

MANILA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Wednesday that Philippine Airlines (PAL) and
Cathay Pacific Airways are likely to reach an agreement soon on
the Hong Kong-based firm's plan to buy into PAL.
</P>
<P>
The issue of PAL's management remains the only major point
which the two airlines need to discuss, Estrada told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"On a scale of 1 to 10, they could have already reached level
6," he said when asked about the progress of the PAL-Cathay
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the desire of Cathay Pacific to acquire a stake in
PAL demonstrates the renewed investor confidence in the Philippine
economy.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that the government will wait for the outcome of
the PAL-Cathay talks before finally deciding on whether to sell
its shares in the national flag carrier.
</P>
<P>
PAL folded in September under more than two billion dollars
worth of debt, but resumed domestic and international flights last
month after trade unions accepted a 10-year no strike deal in
exchange for four board seats and a 20 percent stake in the
company.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that he will consider the government's best
interests in deciding on whether to sell its share in PAL.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Planet Hollywood
restaurant in Cape Town, which was damaged in a horror bomb blast
in August, reopened Wednesday, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-franchised restaurant at the busy waterfront
entertaining complex was closed after the August 25 bombing,
which killed two people and injured 26.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which happened shortly after the U.S. air strikes
on alleged Moslem terrorists in Sudan and Afghanistan, was
suspected to be linked to Islamic extremists who was trying to
protest the U.S. move.
</P>
<P>
The restaurant's chief executive Bradley Michael said they
have beefed up security to ensure the safety of the staff and
customers.
</P>
<P>
The measures include two metal detectors at the front entrance
through which diners pass, 24-hour closed circuit television
cameras, security guards and sniffer dogs.
</P>
<P>
"From today we are quite confident the restaurant will pick up
to what it was before the tragic event," Michael said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the August blast would affect business,
restaurant manager Bill Lally said a reservation for 120 diners
for Wednesday night had been made. He said corporate parties had
also booked for the holiday season.

Police spokesman John Sterrenberg said the investigation into
the blast was proceeding. " We are following up all leads. Calls

<P>
This was stated by State Minister for Investment Hamzah Haz
following a four-hour cabinet meeting at the presidential office
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Over the period, foreign investments slid from 25 billion U.S.
dollars last year to 12 billion this year, while domestic
investments slipped from 103 trillion rupiah last year to 57.3
trillion (7.16 billion U.S. dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Haz said that the country would hopefully be able to attract 5
billion to 6 billion U.S. dollars this month.
</P>
<P>
The minister however expressed concern over the low
implementation of these investment projects.
</P>
<P>
Since the Investment Law was issued in 1967, some 217.3 billion
U.S. dollars worth of foreign investment projects have been
approved by the government, but only 58.4 billion U.S. dollars or
26 percent have been carried out.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic scene, some 650.6 trillion rupiah worth of
domestic investment projects have been approved by the government
since 1967, but only 213.7 trillion rupiah or 33 percent have been
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, the minister said, he is optimistic that
investments will show better prospects with the improvement in the
exchange rate of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar and the
decrease in banking interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Cut Scholarships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will cut
scholarships and only offer university scholarships to those
"desperately in need", a senior education ministry official has
said.
</P>
<P>
The Post newspaper Wednesday quoted Deputy Education Minister
Mathias Mpande as saying that Zambians will have to learn to pay
for education as "time for free education was gone."
</P>
<P>
He said, "the government is paying for sons and daughters of
my fellow ministers, businessmen, industrialists, commercial
farmers and directors who otherwise can afford to pay for their
children."
</P>
<P>
"If people can pay 30,000 U.S. Dollars for their children in
private schools abroad, why can't they pay in the Zambian
environment? " he asked.
</P>
<P>
He said the notion that Zambians are poor and could thus not
afford economical fees is wrong.
</P>
<P>
Acting registrar of University of Zambia, Joseph Chileshe,
announced Monday the learning fees ranged from two to three
million Kwacha (about 1,000 to 1,500 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government will use a testing method to determine
desperate ones to help, he said.
</P>
<P>
But former minister of state for education Njekwa Anamela said
there is still a role for the government to play to ensure that
education is affordable for all.
</P>
<P>
"Human resource development is vital for development," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Quite clearly the government revenue base is low but every
Zambian is affected by the poor economy so they can't afford
these fees," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are two universities in the southern African country,
whose per capita gross domestic products (GDP) stands at 350
Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Wu Hongbo Becomes JLG Chinese Senior Representative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Office of the Chinese
Senior Representative of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group
(JLG) here announced Wednesday that Mr. Wu Hongbo has succeeded
Ambassador Wang Guisheng as Chinese Senior Representative of the
JLG.
</P>
<P>
"I feel very honored with the appointment. My diplomatic
career has been associated closely with Hong Kong affairs since
1983. I myself have special feelings for Hong Kong," Wu told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, 1997 opened
a new chapter for the Sino-British relationship and the
successful exchange of visit by the heads of government of the
two countries earlier this year forged an all-round Sino-British
partnership with a perspective of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the past year or so, the Chinese government
has strictly implemented the Sino-British Joint Declaration and
the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has
been functioning well in all fields, and the "one country, two
systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree
of autonomy have all become indisputable realities.
</P>
<P>
"All these have created favorable conditions for our work in
future," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the confidence that, as long as the two sides
continue to fully implement the Joint Declaration and make joint
efforts, the JLG will undoubtedly fulfill its historical tasks
endowed by the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Wu, born in 1952, worked for the Office of Chinese Senior
Representative of the JLG between 1988 and 1991 as second
secretary and was Chinese representative on the JLG between 1995
and 1997. He became counselor in the Office of the Commissioner
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Distribution of Improved Seed Variety Urged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Getenet Gebeyehu, general
manager of Ethiopia's National Seed Industry Agency, has called
for the distribution of improved seed variety to develop the
country's agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Getenet made the call Tuesday when he was opening a two-day
meeting on seed regulation at Debre Zeit, some 40 kilometers away
from Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has drawn representatives of government
ministries, state farms, seed producers, agricultural research
centers, farmers and agricultural investors.
</P>
<P>
Getenet noted that all methods are needed to develop and
enhance the agricultural sector properly.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, which is the backbone of the national economy,
covers 90 percent of the export trade and creates job opportunity
for more than 85 percent of the population, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the general manager, out of 113 million hectares
of land in Ethiopia, 65 percent is believed to be arable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on about seven million hectares of agricultural
land, some major food crops are being cultivated, with 80 to 85
percent of the land being used to produce various cereals and the
remaining portion left for legumes and oil seed production.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, said Getenet, Ethiopia had been a food exporter
but in the last three decades, the country has turned into a
recipient of aid "as a result of recurrent drought caused by
persistent weather change."
</P>
<P>
In the last 30 years, agricultural development in Ethiopia
declined due to the inability to replace backward farming methods
by modern technology, failure to use farm inputs effectively and
absence of clear government agricultural development policies.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural sector has been showing tremendous changes since
1992 because the government has paid attention to rural
agricultural development, food sufficiency and private farm
activity through the distribution of selected seeds, fertilizers,
pesticides and farms tools.

<HEADLINE> Rice Fields Damaged by Grasshoppers in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Grasshoppers have damaged
hundreds of hectares of rice fields in Prey Veng province and
other districts in Cambodia, promoting officials to send out teams
of farmers to catch the pests.
</P>
<P>
These rice-eating insects have been devouring rice paddies
since mid-October and caused worries in the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Short of effective pesticides, the ministry has launched a
campaign to call on the farmers to catch grasshoppers. The
agronomy department and World Food Program provided money and rice
to buy grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
Five kilograms of grasshoppers can get five kilograms of rice.
The dead insects will be used as fertilizer or feed.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than eleven tons of bugs have already been caught
in Prey Veng district alone. But a lot more still need to be
collected to prevent further crop damage.
</P>
<P>
Farmers across the country have been plagued by a variety of
insects this year. Officials in Kratie said last week that rice
bugs had infested 70 percent of the crop in the province.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Kandal, Kompong Speu and Takeo provinces have been
battling with rice-eating plant hoppers in the worst outbreak
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The grasshoppers are less destructive at the moment as the
fields are flooded with water. But if the water level drops, more
crops could be devoured.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stages Massive Anti-U.S. Rallies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Iranian
university and high school students launched a massive rally
Wednesday morning in front of the former embassy of the United
States in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Terming the U.S. as "the No. 1 enemy" of the Islamic Republic
of Iran, the students burned U.S.and Israeli flags, and images of
"Uncle Sam."
</P>
<P>
"Down with the U.S.," the students chanted throughout the
two-hour rally to mark the 19th anniversary of the takeover of the
U.S. embassy by Iranian students, who claimed to be followers of
the late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Islamic Propagation Organization, the students
also chanted slogans such as "No compromise with the U.S.," "No
talks with the U.S." and "No relations with the U.S."
</P>
<P>
The rally was believed to be the most massive and hard-line
anti-U.S. gathering over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
It came one day after Iran's paramount leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei reiterated that Tehran would not want relations with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
"Having no relations with the U.S is one hundred percent in the
interest of the Iranian nation and the available experiences
around the world have proved this reality," Khamenei told a group
of Iranian students on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Holding such a hard-line rally, the powerful Iranian
conservatives want to deal a blow at the moderate foreign
policies of President Mohammad Khatami, a student told Xinhua News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said that "today's rally
is in a striking contrast to Monday's rally held by pro-Khatami
students," who stated that "there is no hostility between the two
nations of Iran and America."
</P>
<P>
"You see, the pro-Khatami students did not burn U.S. flag, but
only an image of 'Uncle Sam' on Monday. But today they burned
U.S. flags from the beginning to the end," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over 3,000 Iranian students from the left-wing factions said
Monday that they are not against the American people, but the
"arrogant policies" of the U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
The students' move was seen as a goodwill gesture to
Washington, which has recently repeatedly voiced readiness to map
out the route to break down the "wall of distrust" between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In January, Khatami called for a dialogue between the Iran and
the U.S. in order to pave the way to remove mistrust between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, secretary of the State Expediency Council Mohsen
Rezai set four conditions for Iranian-U.S. talks: the U.S. must
make an official apology to Iran, drop the policy of interfering
Iran's internal affairs, withdraw its forces from the Persian Gulf
and release Iran's assets frozen in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Rezai, the former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps, said that without such conditions "any talks and relations
with the U.S. would not in the interest of Iran."

<P>
SINGAPORE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Share prices sustained rally
on Singapore Stock Market Wednesday spurred by latest cuts in
interest rates by two local banks.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) gained 37.58 points to
close at 1,301.05 points, hitting a new six-month high and
breaching the 1,300-point level for the first time in half a year.
</P>
<P>
The total volume slipped to 432.81 million units valued at
632.21 Singapore dollars (389.41 million U.S. dollars). Gainers
thrashed losers by 230 to 54 with 136 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The larger block was the 27.59 million units of Wing T which
topped the active chart of the day. It was followed by DBS Land
which had a volume of 23.06 million shares done. TChongInt was
next with 22.29 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
DBS F topped the gainers of the day as it lifted 50 cents to
close at 11.50 Singapore dollars. Robinson rose by 49 cents to
finish at 5.45 Singapore dollars. Bukit Sem gained 30 cents to end
at 9.10 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, CMSport led the descent of the day with a loss
of 2.56 dollars to 2.35 Hong Kong dollars. Rothmans retreated 15
cents to close at 7.75 Singapore dollars. JurCem slid off 14 cents
to end at 2.61 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said at the open many shares lost ground on
profit-taking shrugging off the latest round of interest cuts.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, earlier profit-taking on blue chips after recent
gains gave way to fresh buying when European markets opened, they
noted.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that cuts in prime rates by the United Overseas
Bank and the Development Bank of Singapore, the two largest banks
in the country, in the past two days had suddenly eased the debt
burden of many companies, making their shares more attractive.

CANBERRA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar strode
ahead in late trading to close higher and above the 63 U.S. cents
mark for the first time in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The lack of a cut in official interest rates by the Reserve
Bank of Australia (RBA) offered support to the local currency
early and talk of a large parcel of Australian dollars bought for
British pounds held it up in late trade.
</P>
<P>
The RBA board met Tuesday and ,contrary to speculation by many
market dealers, made no decision to cut interest rates.
</P>

The Australian dollar gained more than three quarters of a U.S.

Tuesday.

The Australian dollar finished at 73.06 Japanese yen from 71.90

Liberation:
</P>
<P>

<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> More Information Technology Cooperation with Canada Called for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Secretary for
Information Technology and Broadcasting K. C. Kwong on Wednesday
called for closer business relationship in the information
technology (IT) field between Hong Kong and Canada.
</P>
<P>
He said that following the signing of the Memorandum of
Understanding on cooperation in information and communications
technology in May this year, Hong Kong "will organize even more
cooperative ventures that will involve not just the two
governments, but also the IT industry, business and professionals
as well as academics in our two places."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a breakfast gathering of the Canadian Chamber of
Commerce in Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Information Technology
Federation, Kwong outlined five specific areas in IT which would
provide business opportunities for Canadian companies.
</P>
<P>
These include the outsourcing of government IT projects,
applications and services relating to electronic commerce, IT in
education, rectification of the Year 2000 problem, and development
of services and content on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
On government IT projects, Kwong noted that HK government
spending on IT was expected to reach 2.1 billion HK dollars (269
million U.S. dollars) in 1998-1999, an increase of 11 percent over
the previous year. And starting from 1999-2000, all new IT
development and maintenance projects will be outsourced unless
there are over-riding reasons from retaining the work in-house.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to outsource some two-thirds of all new IT projects
in government by 2001-2002," he said, adding that this should
create a market of sufficient size to stimulate the development of
and investment in the local IT industry.
</P>
<P>
Kwong said that the Year 2000 problem would also generate
business opportunities for IT companies. "To IT practitioners,
this is probably the largest ever maintenance project they would
see in the IT history," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The heightened awareness of the Year 2000 problem in Hong Kong
means more business opportunities for IT companies, including
Canadian ones, to provide consultancy services and compliance
solutions to the local companies," he added.

<HEADLINE> Wu Hongbo Becomes JLG Chinese Senior Representative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Office of the Chinese
Senior Representative of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group
(JLG) here announced Wednesday that Wu Hongbo has succeeded
Ambassador Wang Guisheng as Chinese Senior Representative of the
JLG.
</P>
<P>
"I feel very honored with the appointment. My diplomatic
career has been associated closely with Hong Kong affairs since
1983. I myself have special feelings for Hong Kong," Wu told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, 1997 opened
a new chapter for the Sino-British relationship and the successful
exchange of visit by the heads of government of the two countries
earlier this year forged an all-round Sino-British partnership
with a perspective of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the past year or so, the Chinese government
has strictly implemented the Sino-British Joint Declaration and
the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has
been functioning well in all fields, and the "one country, two
systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree
of autonomy have all become indisputable realities.
</P>
<P>
"All these have created favorable conditions for our work in
future," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the confidence that, as long as the two sides
continue to fully implement the Joint Declaration and make joint
efforts, the JLG will undoubtedly fulfill its historical tasks
endowed by the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Wu, born in 1952, worked for the Office of Chinese Senior
Representative of the JLG between 1988 and 1991 as second
secretary and was Chinese representative on the JLG between 1995
and 1997. He became counselor in the Office of the Commissioner
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region in 1997.

<HEADLINE> FM on Impact of Asian Financial Crisis on Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Australia's close economic
ties with East Asia meant its trade was inevitably affected by the
Asian financial crisis, but the crisis helped enhance Australia's
standing in the region, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the past financial year ending June 30, 1998, Australia's
merchandise exports to East Asia increased by 5.5 percent over the
previous year to 47.2 billion Australian dollars (28.3 billion
U.S. dollars), the foreign minister said in a speech to members of
Sydney Stock Exchange board Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"But Australia's merchandise exports to the region declined
sharply in the first two months of 1998, contributing to a
downturn of 5 percent in the first eight months of this calendar
year compared with the same period in 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of Australia's total exports of goods and
services go to Asia.
</P>
<P>
"While our exports to East Asia have declined, Australia's
merchandise imports from the region have been climbing," said
Downer.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the increase (in imports) has been in manufactured
items, but because many of the items concerned are not produced in
Australia our consumers and producers are benefiting from the
lower prices, a fact reflected in the latest excellent quarterly
figure for inflation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Bureau of Statistics said last week the country's
consumer price index rose 0.2 percent for the September quarter
for a rise of 1.3 percent in the year, a figure below the targeted
inflation range of two to three percent set by the country's
central bank.
</P>
<P>
But "in some areas, such as apparel and paper, domestic
producers are facing increased competition from East Asian
exporters," said Downer.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's overall trade performance has, despite the East
Asian crisis, held up remarkable well," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Australia's exports of goods and services in the past financial
year grew by 8.2 percent over the previous one, but figures
released last week indicated that for the first nine months of
1998 Australia had registered an increase of 2.7 percent in the
export of goods and services over the same period in 1997, Downer
said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say the effects of the regional crisis and its
implications for Australia were not limited to economic effects.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's economic and strategic future is, after all, tied
to the prosperity and stability of the region in a way matched by
no other nation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
That may help explain why Australia was one of only two
countries to contribute to all three International Monetary Fund
(IMF) assistance packages for South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia,
and led efforts earlier this year to lobby the IMF for a more
flexible and appropriate approach in the design and implementation
of the package for Indonesia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Japan also made contributions to the three packages.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Australia's standing in the region and beyond had
been enhanced as a result of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The nature and effectiveness of our response (mainly
contributions to the three packages totaling 3 billion U.S.
dollars, increased humanitarian aid and lobbying the IMF for
Indonesia) to the crisis was important," he explained.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that this crisis has also helped us to understand
better the nature of Australia's relationship with Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It has brought into relief how we are different - our large
and developed economy; our multicultural society with its strong
Western democratic values, and mature and open political and
economic institutions; and the significant ties we have outside
the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Australia's economy grew at 3.9 percent during the financial
year ending June 30, 1998 and official forecasts put the growth
rate for the current financial year at 2.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time it has shown how relevant we are to the
region, and has highlighted the close economic interdependence
between ourselves and the countries of East Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The substance of our relationships and of our close
involvement in the search for solutions to East Asia's problems
have defined, as no amount of words could ever do, our role in the
region," Downer stressed.
</P>
<P>
"I have always felt that the endless arguments about
Australia's so-called 'proper' role in the region and whether we
are part of Asia have been quite unproductive, a contemporary
equivalent to debate on how many angels could dance on the head of
a pin," he added.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Dismisses Fears of Foreign Takeover of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Wednesday dismissed fears of a foreign takeover of the
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT), saying that the
country's constitution will prevent such a thing from happening.
</P>
<P>
During a press briefing here, President Estrada said that the
constitutional provision bars foreigners from owning beyond 40
percent of any company in the country.
</P>
<P>
Senator Juan Ponce Enrile warned of a national security breach
with the impending takeover of PLDT, after reports hinted that the
Hong Kong-based First Pacific was already close to gaining
controlling stake in the telephone company.
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports said that 60 percent or 75.3 million of the
PLDT's 14.57 million common voting shares, is already controlled
by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the entry of First Pacific could further
dilute Filipino ownership in the telephone company.
</P>
<P>
But President Estrada remained optimistic, saying that the
constitution will ensure the protection of the national security,
with its provision limiting foreign ownership to just 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Under our constitution, this cannot happen because no
foreigner shall be allowed to own more than 40 percent of any
business. This is why no foreign capitalist can control any
industry in the country," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He added that the matter of the entry of First Pacific in PLDT
should be encouraged, because the government tries to attract more
foreign investors to enter the Philippines, especially at a time
when the country needs more dollars to boost its foreign reserves
during the Asian currency crisis.

<P>
ANKARA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1684 members of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed in the first
ten months of this year by Turkish security forces, Daily News
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
312 PKK militants were captured and 111 surrendered to the
authorities, the paper quoted official statements issued by the
Office of Emergency Rule Region as saying.
</P>
<P>
Turkish security troops suffered the loss of 280 armymen during
the military operations in the southeastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
One of the significant blows against the PKK was the arrest of
Semdin Sakik, the number two figure of the Kurdish organization,
in northern Iraq in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was forced to leave
Syria, which allegedly supports the PKK, because of Turkey's
strong military pressure on Damascus.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting the Turkish government since 1984 in
an attempt to establish a Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.

MANILA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday that the peso rebound and the stock market
rally were "good signs" that the country is well on its way to
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a radio interview, Estrada said, "This clearly
shows the increasing confidence of businessmen, especially the
foreign capitalists."
</P>
<P>
The president made this statement a day after the peso closed
at 39.97 peso against the U.S dollar and the composite index at
the Manila Stock Exchange went up 2.6 percent to 1,801.54 points,
its highest in almost four months.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has repeatedly expressed optimism that because of the
market-oriented reform pursued by the previous Ramos
administration and his, the Philippines will recover faster than
its neighbors from the economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the president pledged that his administration would
give "clear and credible" signals to enable the economy to know
exactly what to expect from his administration.

ANKARA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
is expected to come to Ankara Friday to rally support for a
possible military strike against Iraq, the English newspaper
Daily News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman
Sermet Atacanli as saying that Cohen will come to Ankara following
his hasty visits to the Gulf countries started on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He added that the visit will take "no more than two hours."
</P>
<P>
Cohen is expected to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz and Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ismet
Sezgin.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said that Cohen will ask for Turkey's
approval of the use of the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey in
case a military action is launched against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. fighters have been stationed in the base to monitor
northern Iraq following the Gulf War.

<P>
The U.S. administration has said that it will keep the military
option open against Baghdad after the Iraqi government declared
last Saturday that it would end all cooperation with the United
Nations Special Commission on disarming Iraq.
</P>

U.S. President Bill Clinton, who termed the latest Iraqi
decision "unacceptable", made it clear that "all options are

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Iraq to Cooperate with U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia has urged the Iraqi
leadership to renounce its unilateral decision to halt cooperation
with the U.N. special disarmament commission, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said in an interview with
the TV program Vremya Tuesday night that Baghdad's unilateral
decision had unfortunately been "taken at a time when an agreement
on comprehensive monitoring of all of the Iraq-related disarmament
problems had been reached."
</P>
<P>
Russia calls for Baghdad's withdrawing its decision put forth
last Saturday to suspend cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission Supervising the Destruction of Iraq's Chemical,
Biological and Nuclear Weapons, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that "Iraq must resume to the full volume
cooperation with the United Nations and its special commission."
</P>
<P>
According to Ivanov, Moscow has informed the Iraqi leadership
of its position. Russia is currently maintaining active contacts
both with the U.N. Secretary-General and a number of states in
order to prevent a further escalation of tension in the Gulf
region, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"I would not exclude any steps. The main thing now is to act in
unison within the framework of the international community and to
bring home to Baghdad that this path of unilateral decisions is a
path to a crisis," said Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Russia intends to come out with any initiatives
in the U.N. Security Council, the minister said that "the first
and foremost initiative is to have Baghdad annul its unilateral
decision." Otherwise, it would be very difficult to speak about
any new initiatives, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov expressed confidence that the possibilities of a
political settlement have not yet been exhausted, saying he
believed that the problem cannot be solved by means of force.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has said Osama
Bin Laden, a former Saudi millionaire now in exile in Afghanistan,
was not responsible for the two major explosions in two Saudi
cities two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"It has been reported that the two explosions in Riyadh and
Khobar were planned by Bin Laden. This is not true." said Saudi
Interior Minister Prince Nayef Ibn Abdel-Aziz, in an exclusive
interview with local English-language daily Arab Times.
</P>
<P>
But the prince, who is here to attend the interior ministers'
meeting of the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council, admitted that
"maybe there are people who adopt his ideas. This is possible."
</P>
<P>
A powerful bomb ripped through a building filled with U.S. and
Saudi military personnel, killing seven, five of them American,
and injuring at least 60 in Saudi capital Riyadh on November 13,
1995.
</P>
<P>
Six months later, a second deadly truck bomb tored through a
U.S. Air Force housing complex in Al-Khobar, near the eastern
Saudi city of Dhahran on June 25, 1996, killing 23 Americans and
wounding 345 others.
</P>
<P>
Nayef said that Bin Laden, striped of Saudi citizenship in 1994
for his opposition activities, is no longer a Saudi and
constitutes no security risk to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Nayef said that Riyadh would announce "everything it has" on
the Khobar blast at an appropriate time. The U.S. has blamed
Riyadh for being slow in coming up with investigation results of
the one of the worst attacks on U.S. servicemen since the 1991
Gulf War.

ZHENGZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- It's getting hard to find any
two people dressed alike in Zhengzhou, the capital of central
China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
No one likes to see anyone else wearing the same clothes as
he is so you don't see any more than five or ten suits of one
kind, says Ma Mingli, who owns four clothing stores in Zhengzhou.
</P>
<P>
People are also trying to express their own taste in their
house decorations, photographs, or other aspects of their daily
lives. People here used to like to pose like film stars with the
help of a photographer. But, these went out of date because
everyone seemed to look just the same, with the clothes and the
same facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
Now, people like taking pictures that best demonstrate their
true self and some older people say with a bit of envy that young
people these days are so lucky, wearing any clothes they like and
not getting criticized no matter how strange they look.
</P>
<P>
People didn't dare dress differently just twenty years ago, out
of fear that they would be criticized for being "strange" or
"weird". Most Chinese dressed in black or blue in the 1970s and
things like jeans, Western suits and dresses, and sporty clothing
were nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
Improved living conditions have made interior decorating quite
fashionable in this city and thousands of types of decoration
materials are now on the market to cater to different needs.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Province's Marine Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The People's Congress of China's
Fujian Province has approved an ambitious plan to make its marine
sector a pillar industry in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
It plans to increase the output of its marine sector to 170
billion yuan by 2010, making it account for 15 percent of the
province's GDP. To do this, the province will build at least 100
deepwater berths with a combined annual capacity of 150 million
tons of cargo and a number of aquatic production centers and
wholesale markets, shipyards and coastal scenic spots by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Vice-governor Xi Jinping says that a special investment system
will be set up to back this development, along with foundations
and investment companies. The province is also encouraging
overseas investors to get involved in coastal infrastructure
construction and marine resources.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has more than 3,000 km of coastline and 1,200
islands. Last year, marine industry constituted 10 percent of
Fujian's GDP.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Skyrocket in Tokyo </HEADLINE>

<P>
TOKYO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices soared in Tokyo on
Wednesday, hitting their highest levels in nearly two months on
news that Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, a major U.S. investment
bank, has decided to bulk up on Japanese equities.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped by 575.06 points, or
4.12 percent, from Monday's close to end at 14,527.81. The Tokyo
market was closed on Tuesday for a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, gained 41.52 points or 3.90 percent to
1,107.36.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section soared to an estimated 687
million shares, nearly twice the 373.94 million shares traded on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the sharp rise to the news that Morgan
Stanley will lift the Japanese weighting of its global equity
portfolio from 40 percent to 75 percent because of the Tokyo
market's relatively low price levels.
</P>
<P>
The Morgan Stanley news "certainly gave the market a strong
psychological boost," a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Some traders noted that news of improved Japanese domestic
sales in personal computers and a recent slight increase in public
works projects also supported the market.
</P>
<P>
Bank shares continued to dominate trading activity and grew by
5.33 percent as a group, as investors applauded recent efforts
among the big lenders to restructure themselves.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,345 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
overwhelmed losers by 1,020 to 133, with 114 issues unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Dr. Leung Ping-chun Approved as NPC Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong professor was
approved today as a deputy to China's highest legislature, the
National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Dr. Leung Ping-chun, a 57-year-old professor of
medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, will fill the
vacancy left by Liu Lit-for who died shortly after being elected
as an NPC deputy.
</P>
<P>
The fifth meeting of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee, which
concluded here today, approved the examining report by the
qualification authentication committee of the NPC Standing
Committee concerning Leung's qualifications.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Leung thereafter officially became a deputy to the NPC from
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR elected 36 NPC deputies on December 8, 1997 in
accordance with election rules adopted during the fifth session of
the Eighth NPC. The death of Deputy Liu Lit-for created a vacancy
shortly after the election.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Leung ranked 37 in votes received in that election.
</P>
<P>
According to a decision of the NPC Standing Committee on
by-elections for Hong Kong deputies to the NPC, vacancies will be
filled by unelected candidates according to the number of votes
they received.
</P>
<P>
Since the first plenum of the Ninth NPC this March, four
deputies have died, one resigned, and one was dismissed. There are
now 2,974 deputies to the NPC.

<HEADLINE> "Reform Cradle" Village Readied for New Take-Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Yan Hongchang smiled after
signing a contract with the local government that allows him to
work on his contracted farmland for another 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"Land is the life of farmers and the government's policy to
renew the contract with farmers will encourage us to do a better
job," says the 48-year-old villager of Xiaogang Village, known as
the "Cradle of China's Rural Reform".
</P>
<P>
Fengyang County in Anhui Province, where Xiaogang is located,
used to be one of the poorest in the country, with beggars as its
main "products".
</P>
<P>
In late 1978, when the Communist Party of China's Eleventh
Central Committee was holding the landmark Third Plenary Session
to launch the rural reform and opening policy, Yan and 19 of his
fellow villagers were coincidentally risking their lives to sign
a secret "contract" among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Under the "contract", Xiaogang would break the People's
Commune-owned farmland into pieces for each family to cultivate on
its own, and what is more, it reads, "Had any of us been arrested,
the others should raise his children to as old as 18 years."
</P>
<P>
They did face severe punishment, even a death penalty, since
the action was deemed by the Chinese government as a pure
capitalist way at that time.
</P>
<P>
According to the then dominant "leftist" thinking, farmers
should only work on a collective basis, not on a family basis.
Otherwise, "landlords", who were said to live on the blood and
sweat of peasants, would come back to let rural people "taste the
bitterness of the old society for the second time."
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, these brave villagers were not persecuted for
their dangerous scheme, and instead, they were enthroned as heros
and pioneers of China's 20-year-old reform that was masterminded
by late Deng Xiaoping and other reformist Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
What Xiaogang villagers adopted is one of the forms of the
much-talked about "household contract responsibility system which
links output with income". Following the bold, successful
experience by Xiaogang and other remote villages, the
responsibility system was soon popularized throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, the time-tested responsibility
system has benefited the whole country as China has been widely
praised by people in the world for its ability to feed and
clothe a population of 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
In a recent trip to Anhui, Chinese President Jiang Zemin paid a
visit to Xiaogang and said that the government will take a
long-term stance on the issue. He pointed out that the land
contract may remain unchanged even after its second term expires.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Cong'an, secretary of the Party committee at Xiaogang
village, told Xinhua that the village is striving for a greater
goal. "Over the past two decades, we have resolved the problem of
food and wears, and from now on, we will try hard to turn Xiaogang
into a civilized and rich village, to help the villagers become
well-off," he said.

LOS ANGELES, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Walt Disney Co. on Tuesday
reported a 28-percent drop in its fiscal fourth-quarter net income
and a 4-percent increase in its fiscal year profits.
</P>
<P>
For the quarter ended on September 30, the Los Angeles-based
entertainment company earned 296 million U.S. dollars, down 28
percent from the 411 million dollars earned a year ago, due to
losses from assorted new ventures and unsuccessful movies and home
video sales.
</P>
<P>
Fourth-quarter revenues increased by 13 percent from 5.4
billion dollars to 6.1 billion dollars thanks to theme park and
resort growth.
</P>
<P>
For the year, Disney said its net income increased by 4 percent
to 1.9 billion dollars and revenues for the year increased by 6
percent to 23 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Disney said results for the quarter and the fiscal year also
reflected charges of 64 million dollar due to downsizing in the
company's consumer product business, particularly in response to
Asian economic difficulties and consolidation of certain studio
operations in its movie business.

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. credited the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Tuesday with providing a clear plan to combat terrorism on the
West Bank. But it said it is not blaming Israel for delaying
implementation of the Wye accord and hopes the matter will be
resolved Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has asked Israel
for "clarifications" over the last two days about how the current
Israeli construction in East Jerusalem's Ras al Amud district
complies "with an explicit assurance delivered a year ago that
Israel will not change the status quo in Ras al Amud."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Washington pledged Tuesday that it will ensure that 30
Palestinians suspected of murdering Israelis would be arrested.
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said earlier Tuesday
that the PNA's failure to arrest the 30 suspects was holding up an
Israeli cabinet meeting on the Wye accord.

JAKARTA -- The Indonesian government-sponsored fact-finding
team investigating the May riots said that the unrest was
triggered by a power struggle within the political elite and a
rapid deterioration of the economy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Reading from a 27-page report on Tuesday night, team Chairman
Marzuki Darusman said the riots were caused by "a dual crossover
between two major processes" -- a political struggle within the
elite and a declining economic situation. Marzuki said the May
riots had been the culmination of a series of previous acts of
violence, intelligence activities which could not be effectively
controlled, and the Trisakti incident in which a number of
students were killed. (Indonesia-Riots-Team Findings)

<HEADLINE> Private Economy Booms in Economic Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Private firms in the Shenzhen
Special Economic Zone has developed rapidly, with the number of
them growing from 27,000 to 31,000 in six months to July this year.
</P>
<P>
The registered capital of these firms increased from 150
million yuan in 1991 to 49 billion yuan at the end of last June.
</P>
<P>
Productive enterprises have grown to 6,000, with last year's
total output value increasing 60 percent year on year to 23
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The number of private enterprises engaging in high-tech
development and production now exceeds 200, generating 6.67
billion yuan in output value last year, and the annual output
value of eight of these firms has surpassed 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of the private sector has derived from local
government policy. Shenzhen divided enterprises into two types --
productive and non-productive -- instead of classifying them by
ownership, as practised in other Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
The private sector in the city now enjoys the same treatment as
enterprises with other types of ownership, without
discrimination.

<HEADLINE> Ashanti's Gold Output Record High in Third </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Ashanti Goldfields Company
(AGC), one of the world's leading mining companies, said its gold
production for the third quarter hit a record of 420,162 ounces,
according to Ghana News Agency (GNA).
</P>
<P>
This feat represents a 12 percent increase over the preceding
quarter and a 45 percent increase from the third quarter of 1997,
Kwamena Anaman, AGC corporate affairs manager, said in Accra,
capital of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
He said the money that AGC puts in its operation was also
reduced to 209 Dollars an ounce, which was achieved through an
enhanced waste management strategy, sustained productivity
improvements at Obuasi, the principle mine, and the successful
development of new cost efficient projects at Bibiani and
Sanguiri mines.
</P>
<P>
AGC also reduced its labor strength by 800 -- about 10 percent
of the total work force through a special voluntary retirement
package and another 10 percent cut in cost to the company's
suppliers, said Anaman.
</P>
<P>
"These and other measures have put us in a good position to
achieve our group target of 1.5 million ounces of gold by the end
of the year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anaman said Ashanti's operating cost for the year is likely to
close at 222 Dollars per ounce, but that will reflect a recently
announced increase in the industrial power tariff which came into
effect in September.
</P>
<P>
"The new power tariff adds 15 Dollars to our cash cost and
that is why we are still talking to the power producers to take a
second look at the increase," Anaman noted.
</P>
<P>
Ashanti's earnings for the quarter was also up to 20.3 million
Dollars, about 30 percent higher than the previous year's 15
million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Our hedging portfolio also increased to 7.6 million ounces at
an average price of 391 per ounce, providing substantial
protection for the group cash flows," Anaman said.
</P>
<P>
Anaman added that Obuasi mine continues to be the power drive
of Ashanti's "growth strategy" producing 230,709 ounces at a cash
cost of 230 Dollars per ounce.
</P>
<P>
He said steady improvements in underground tonnage and grade
and tight controls on spending have contributed to the reductions
in cash cost.
</P>
<P>
"These were 11 Dollars per ounce lower than in the second
quarter and 40 Dollars lower than the third quarter of 1997,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Ashanti's operations in a dozen of other African countries,
Anaman said, will continue to push the company to perform at all
times.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is the second gold producer in Africa next just to South
Africa and the AGC is the most important gold producer in the
west African country.

<HEADLINE> Somali Bandit Killed in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The police have shot
dead a Somali bandit for his involvement in killing nine people
in north Tanzania's Arusha Region.
</P>
<P>
The killed gangster was identified as Yusuf Mohamed and had
come from Kajiado District of Kenya, Tanzanian newspapers Tuesday
quoted a statement from the police headquarters in Dar es Salaam
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Eight Somali bandits, armed with sub-machine guns and
light-machine guns, raided Malambo village in Arusha on Saturday
evening and killed nine men of Maasai tribe.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident, the police mounted an operation to
track down the bandits and exchanged fires with them at Makorongo
area.
</P>
<P>
During the clash, Mohamed was killed but other bandits managed
to escape. The police are still searching for them.
</P>
<P>
The police have recovered from the bandits two sub-machine
guns (SMGs), three magazines, 74 rounds of ammunition for SMGs,
one bullet belt with 47 rounds of ammunition for light
sub-machine guns, one pair of binoculars and a membership card of
Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), Tanzanian ruling party, according to
the statement released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arusha Regional Commissioner Daniel ole Njoolay said the
Somalis are suspected to be using CCM cards to infiltrate
villages and then stole properties.
</P>
<P>
He also said the bandits have come to raid the area possibly
on a revenge mission.
</P>
<P>
In August this year, a group of Somali gangsters killed a
district police commander in Arusha. Following the incident, the
police launched a special operation against banditry in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The bandits often crossed the Kenya-Tanzanian border into the
region and assaulted local villagers, stealing cattle and other
properties.
</P>
<P>
Njoolay has appealed to the government to work out a joint
strategy against the bandits with the Kenyan side.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Trade Union Unity (OATUU) has called on Ethiopia and
Eritrea to maintain the present cease-fire and cooperate with the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) in its mediation efforts.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to the OAU and the countries concerned, OATUU
also called for the return of the disputed areas to the situation
prevailing before May 6 and for the resumption of negotiations to
settle all disputes peacefully, the Ethiopian Herald reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The organization urged the parties to the conflict to respect
the human and trade union right of each other's citizens living
or working in their respective countries in the interest of
peace, good neighborliness and collective development.
</P>
<P>
The OATUU letter said it has been following with anxiety and
sadness the unfortunate conflict between the two brotherly
countries since the conflict erupted in early May.
</P>
<P>
The letter went on to express its concern that the resort to
war, and the unnecessary loss of human lives and infrastructure
as well as importation of costly arms and armaments will
accelerate the impoverishment of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Presidents from Burkina Faso, Djibouti and Zimbabwe as well as
leaders from Ethiopia and Eritrea will hold a two-day summit
meeting in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, from November 7 to 8 to
seek a peaceful settlement of the six-month territorial dispute
between the two Horn of Africa countries.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Business Leaders Wary of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan business leaders have
said they were apprehensive about the European Union (EU)'s
planned single currency, the Euro, because they knew too little
about how it would affect them.
</P>
<P>
Isaac Awuondo, the executive director of the Commercial Bank
of Africa, said manufacturers' basic fear has been that "if they
are importing raw material there will be heavy fluctuation" in
currency values.
</P>
<P>
"We are telling them that it will be easier for them dealing
in the Euro because they will have a common base (for
transactions)," he was quoted by Wednesday's East African
Standard newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan exporters, most of whom dealt in Dollars, were worried
about how a new currency of payment and settlement might affect
them.
</P>
<P>
Experts urge Kenyan businesses with European links to get
ready for the advent of the Euro on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Freidrich Verspohl, a leading specialist on the Euro, said the
introduction of the new continental currency was important to
Kenya as Europe remains the country's largest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
Most tourists also come from Europe, apart from the EU's being
a major source of donor funds.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lack of knowledge (in Africa) and that has a
psychological effect on business. People feel insecure," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Verspohl told local business community to immediately start
the process of having their book-keeping systems ready to process
Euro and other currencies, enquire when trading partners plan to
change to the Euro and also familiarize their staff with the new
Euro Travelers Checks.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is Kenya's largest foreign currency earner.

MANILA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
announced here Wednesday that it is providing a technical
assistance grant of 150,000 U.S. dollars to assist the
Philippines' peace and development efforts in the southern part of
the country.
</P>

In a statement issued here, the Manila-based ADB said that the
grant will be used to build up the capacity of the Southern
Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD) and the
Regional Planning and Development Office of the Autonomous Region

</P>
<P>
The SPCPD was formed two years ago when the Philippine
government and the rebel Moro National Liberation Front signed a

ZHUHAI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- You Haiping, a TV director with
the Zhejiang provincial television station, rushed to the city of
Zhuhai from Macao this morning with her production unit to get
some shots of the meeting of the work group of legal affairs under
the Preparatory Committee of the Macao Special Administrative
Region.
</P>
<P>
At noon, she had to rush back to Macao to continue working
on a documentary about the territory which will return to China's
sovereignty on December 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth time this year You and her unit were in
Macao to conduct interviews and filming for the documentary.
</P>
<P>
As the day of its return to China draws near, Macao is becoming
the focus of media attention on the Chinese mainland. This year
alone more than 20 TV stations have sent teams to Macao on various
assignments.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch are busy
handling requests from the mainland media for appointments for
interviews with Portuguese officials and Macao notables.
</P>
<P>
You's works for Beijing Cable TV, but Beijing Television
Station is also in Macao doing a documentary on Macao.
</P>
<P>
You argued that there should be no repetitions or duplicates as
each TV station has its own perspective and style. She said China
Central Television, which is also making a TV series in Macao,
tends to focus on history and political affairs, while her
documentary emphasizes everyday life in Macao to reflect the
territory's distinctiveness.
</P>
<P>
"Macao's return to the motherland is a big event next year. We
are sure to attract many viewers as long as the documentary itself
is well-made," You said.

<HEADLINE> Hot Peppers Valuable as Medical Treatment: U.S. Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Hot pepper or capsicum is
the source of an important medication to treat a variety of skin
conditions, according to a study in the latest issue of the
Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.
</P>
<P>
Capsaicin, the white fibrous material that holds the seeds
inside the pepper, has been used as a medication for centuries.
Modern day dermatologists use tropical capsaicin to relieve the
pain and burning of many diseases from diabetic neuropathy to
plantar warts to reflex sympathetic dystrophy to shingles.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the medical usefulness of capsaicin
comes from its ability to deaden neuronal pain fibers. Research
has shown that the transmission of pain messages from the skin to
the brain stops with continuous exposure to capsaicin.
</P>
<P>
"Many people are rediscovering the benefits of natural

therapeutic aspects of peppers are among the many natural remedies

<P>
In its pure form, capsaicin has virtually no flavor or odor --
just the sensation of heat. In addition, the active ingredients
in the spice do not cause reddening of the skin.
</P>
<P>
The same peppers that provide capsaicin for medicinal uses are
also made into the personal defense pepper sprays used by police
and private citizens in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Capsaicin's repellent effects are also used by boatmen who find
the compound deters barnacles from attaching to ship hulls and by
ranchers who apply the scent to the necks of sheep to deter coyote
attacks.

<HEADLINE> Former Philippine Rebel Group Responsible for Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Disgruntled members of a former
rebel group were responsible for the spate of bombings in
Mindanao, the southern Philippines, Monday, the Philippine News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ade G. Nikabulin, task force commander of the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) in Mindanao, was quoted by the news agency
as saying that negotiations are going on to appease these
disgruntled MNLF members.
</P>
<P>
He said the negotiations are being carried out by the MNLF in
coordination with various agencies of the local government in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Four bombings rocked Mindanao's key cities -- Zamboanga, Davao,
Cagayan de Oro and Iligan -- Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Cagayan De Oro city, one was killed while 22 others were
injured when a bomb planted in a passenger bus exploded.
</P>
<P>
Moments after the bomb incident in Cagayan de Oro city, another
bomb exploded in Iligan in a passenger bus bound for Kolambugan in
Lanao del Norte. Nineteen passengers were injured in the bombing.

The MNLF and the government signed a peace agreement in
Mindanao two years ago. Since then most of the former rebels have
been integrated into the government army and the national police.

<HEADLINE> Henan to Cut Electricity Costs in Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan
Province plans to invest 7.2 billion yuan into improving the
power grid in its rural areas in a bid to cut electricity costs
and expand the household electric-appliance market.
</P>
<P>
The province initiated electricity reform in rural areas in
1997, and increased the annual power consumption to 14.4 billion
kwh that year as a result, 22 percent of the province's total
power consumption for the year.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of Henan's population lives in rural areas,
however, their annual power consumption accounts for only
one-fifteenth that of urbanites due to high electricity costs,
local officials said.
</P>
<P>
The planned investment, the largest sum the province has ever
spent for power-grid construction, is expected to help cut
electricity prices by 60 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the supply of some industrial products,
household electric appliances in particular, are more than enough
in cities and towns at present, but still have great potential in
the rural market.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, the central government has decided to
provide 130 billion yuan (about 16 billion U.S. dollars) before
2000 to speed up power-grid construction and facilitate wider
utilization of household electric appliances in the countryside.

<HEADLINE> Boy with Artificial Penis Can Live Normal Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A six-year-old Chinese boy
whose penis was bitten off by a donkey is recovering well from an
operation to give him an artificial penis in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The boy, Jiang Rongming, was quite happy when he told reporters
that he can urinate again. Doctor Ma Fushun, of the People's
Liberation Army's Hospital No.262 who performed the operation,
says that his sexual functions will be normal if he has another
restoration operation when he is 18, or sometime before he marries
and that he can be a father if his vas deferens is not blocked.
</P>
<P>
The boy, who lives in the city of Jilin in Jilin Province, was
playing in front of his home when an old man came by with his
donkey collecting scrap. The boy walked over to the donkey to pat
its head when suddenly, the seemingly meek donkey bit the boy's
penis.
</P>
<P>
His mother rushed out and found that his penis had been cut off.
</P>
<P>
After several operations in Jilin Province, the boy still had
to squat to urinate because his urethra had been diverted to below
the scrotum. Sometimes he had to ask doctors to help him when his
kidneys were swollen and he could not relieve himself.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Ma decided to help the boy when he read of the
misfortune in a newspaper. By the time the boy had arrived in
Beijing, the bitten part had festered, his scrotum was swollen, and
his kidneys and urathra were hurting him.
</P>
<P>
The doctor explains that the boy would have had no chance to
lead a normal life if they had not operated and that the growth of
his testes would have been affected.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Ma and his colleague, Prof. Chen Zongji created a penis
by using skin and subcutaneous tissue from the boy's abdominal
region, and a urethra by using subcutaneous tissue from his
perineum.
</P>
<P>
After two weeks of observation, the transplant was taking, the
wound was healing, there was no infection, and the urethra was not
blocked.
</P>
<P>
The hospital also decided to waive payment of fees for the
operation, which has cost more than 10,000 yuan (over 1,200
U.S. dollars) to date.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Business Leaders Wary of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan business leaders have
said they were apprehensive about the European Union (EU)'s
planned single currency, the Euro, because they knew too little
about how it would affect them.
</P>
<P>
Isaac Awuondo, the executive director of the Commercial Bank
of Africa, said manufacturers' basic fear has been that "if they
are importing raw material there will be heavy fluctuation" in
currency values.
</P>
<P>
"We are telling them that it will be easier for them dealing
in the Euro because they will have a common base (for
transactions)," he was quoted by Wednesday's East African
Standard newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan exporters, most of whom dealt in Dollars, were worried
about how a new currency of payment and settlement might affect
them.
</P>
<P>
Experts urge Kenyan businesses with European links to get
ready for the advent of the Euro on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Freidrich Verspohl, a leading specialist on the Euro, said the
introduction of the new continental currency was important to
Kenya as Europe remains the country's largest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
Most tourists also come from Europe, apart from the EU's being
a major source of donor funds.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lack of knowledge (in Africa) and that has a
psychological effect on business. People feel insecure," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Verspohl told local business community to immediately start
the process of having their book-keeping systems ready to process
Euro and other currencies, enquire when trading partners plan to
change to the Euro and also familiarize their staff with the new
Euro Travelers Checks.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is Kenya's largest foreign currency earner.

<HEADLINE> House Prices in New Zealand Weakening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's house prices
continue to weaken this year, the Dominion reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted figures issued by
Quotable Value NZ as saying that house prices in New Zealand
dropped by six percent for the first nine months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Prices fell by 2.1 percent in the third quarter, 2.9 percent in
the second quarter, and one percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
According to economists of the Bank of New Zealand (BNZ), the
last time house prices dropped in three consecutive quarters was
during the 1991-1992 recession. Prices then dropped by 2.8
percent over 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The latest 12-month figures to the end of September show a drop
in house prices of 4.6 percent. Prices in the third quarter of
this year were 4.5 percent down on the corresponding period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Auckland, the biggest city in the country, suffered the biggest
 drop of 2.2 percent in the third quarter. But in Wellington,
capital of the country, house prices fell only by 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
BNZ chief economist Tony Alexander was quoted as predicting
that house prices in New Zealand would drop again in the fourth
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
He attributed falling house prices to rising unemployment,
which could reach nine percent by late 1999; slowing wages growth
due to unemployment; a worsening world economy and its effect on
commodity prices and the wider New Zealand economy; falling
immigration, down 15 percent in the third quarter compared with
the previous year; rising emigration, up 14 percent for that
matching period; and talk of possibly higher taxes.

<HEADLINE> ADB Aids Sri Lanka's Urban Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has granted Sri Lanka a loan of 70 million U.S. dollars to help
improve its urban infrastructure and finance housing improvements
for low-income households, ADB sources here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The project will support efforts to give local authorities more
responsibilities in providing and financing infrastructure and
municipal services, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Deficiencies in basic infrastructure are restraining urban
areas from playing a more active role in the economy's growth,
they said. Though most towns have piped water supply but up to 40
percent of the water is lost due to poor construction and lack of
maintenance of the facilitates.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate drainage systems lead to flooding during monsoon
seasons. Roads are of poor quality and poorly maintained, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB-supported project aims to improve roads, water supply
and drainage, bus terminals and public markets in 27 secondary
towns in seven provinces, and also to improve people's health and
their environment to help sustain social development and economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said nearly 1 million Sri Lankans will benefit
from this project which is expected to be completed by the end of
2004.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is 100 million dollars. The ADB
loan of 70 million dollars will come from its Special Funds
resources, which means it is interest-free and repayable over 40
years, including a grace period of 10 years, according to the
sources.

<HEADLINE> Unstable Rouble Impacts Sino-Russian Border Trade (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) - To residents of Suifenhe, one of
the big cities in northeastern China on the Sino-Russian
border, the devalued rouble and slumping Russian economy are not
so foreign as to most Chinese in the interior areas, since these
factors are eating away their fortunes these days.
</P>
<P>
A market favored by Russians, and one that prospered from
trade with its needy neighbor, the city has been suffering
recession as a result of the weak Russian currency and economy.
</P>
<P>
"Only two Russians crossed the border in two days when the
rouble plunged against the U.S. dollar in mid-August. Before that,
the number of travelers was more than 1,000 a day," local Customs
director Qing Chenglu told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Suifenhe is a leading border trader with Russia in northeastern
Heilongjiang Province, the largest province-level
contributor to the Sino-Russian border trade. Last year, the city had a
turnover of 540 million U.S. dollars in trade with Russia, compared
to one billion dollars for the entire province.
</P>
<P>
Suifenhe is not the only victim of the Russian financial
crisis. According to Zhang Chunlai, deputy director of the
Department of European Studies of a research institute under the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation,
Sino-Russian trade is expected to fall to 5.5 billion dollars
this year from 6.12 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
"A stable rouble is of vital importance to the Sino-Russian border
trade," said Zhang Chunlai, "their relations can be described
this way: if Russia catches a cold, border cities on the China
side will sneeze."
</P>
<P>
The weak rouble has also resulted in financial difficulties for
Russian travel agencies, which once made good money sponsoring
package tours for Russians who came to China more for shopping
than for sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
"The financial crisis has impacted our business seriously," a
travel agent named Dania complained to Xinhua. "People had to sign
up and wait if they wanted to travel to China in the past, but
after the rouble devaluation, especially when the financial crisis
hit Russia most severely in August and September, we could not
even find enough people to form a tour group."

<HEADLINE> Unstable Rouble Impacts Sino-Russian Border Trade (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the Qingyun Market, the biggest along the Sino-Russian
border, businesspeople are grumbling about the sluggish trade, in
sharp contrast to the old days when eager Russian buyers packed
the four-story market. Rambling through the second floor of the
market, the reporter spotted only a dozen Russians shopping.
</P>
<P>
In spite of all these adversities, however, people are trying
to see the bright side of things. Because Russia is presently
crippled in its light industry but has a high demand for such
commodities, and the two nations have put aside the hostility and
bitterness of the past and have forged a friendly relationship,
there is room to enhance bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the exchange rate for the rouble does not fluctuate
widely in the near future, border trade may possibly have a minor
impact and experience gradual recovery," said Guo Xiaohua, the
mayor of Suifenhe. Guo said this possibility, slim though it is,
still may allow the city to reach its border trade goal of 600
million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The situation on the Russia side is expected to improve, and
the rouble may stabilize gradually by year's end if the government
pursues proper policies, trade expert Zhang Chunlai pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government, both central and local, are also doing
their utmost to offset the negative impact of the rouble
devaluation. China is expected to continue the preferential
policy of reducing tariff rates by 50 percent in border trade
zones.
</P>
<P>
The city government of Suifenhe, for instance, exempted private
businesses from all local taxes and fees in September and reduced
fee levies by half in October.
</P>
<P>
The traders, on the other hand, are resuming the barter trade
to protect themselves against rouble devaluation risks by trading
foodstuffs, cloths, shoes and articles for daily use for
seafood, timber, chemicals and paper with their Russian
colleagues..
</P>
<P>
The overall picture also seems to show signs of recovery. The
monthly passenger flow through Suifenhe, for example, rebounded
to 37,000 people in October after plunging to this year's all-time
low of 28,000 in September.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka-Calcutta Bus Service Likely to Start Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The long-waited regular bus
service between Bangladesh and India is likely to go into
operation sometime next month after the signing of an agreement in
this respect between the two neighboring countries, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At an inter-ministerial meeting held in Dhaka recently, the
Bangladeshi government decided to take necessary steps in signing
the agreement, a competent source was quoted by the New Nation as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The inter-ministerial meeting proposed some amendments to the
draft agreement between the two countries for regulation of
passenger buses that would be pressed into service initially on
the Dhaka-Calcutta route.
</P>
<P>
If the initial arrangements are found acceptable to both sides
through practical demonstration, more routes may be opened, he
said.
</P>
<P>
At present, buses ply between Dhaka and Ajmer (India) on
selected occasions under special arrangements for the pilgrims,
and some private companies are also operating bus services for
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The buses plying on the route will have quite a large number of
passengers, and thousands of people visit India, especially
Calcutta for various purposes, and about 400,000 pilgrims visit
Ajmer Sharif every year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided that instead of the initial Bangladeshi
proposal to introduce Dhaka-Calcutta-Ajmer, the Dhaka-Calcutta
route would be opened, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Beats Croatia in World Volleyball Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAGOSHIMA, Japan, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Olympic runner-up
China rallied from the first set deficit and survived a big scare
to outwit Croatia 9-15, 15-5, 15-4, 12-15, 15-11 in a Group D
match of the Women's World Volleyball Championship here Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
China squandered its 10-5 lead in the fourth set as Croatia
spasmly recovered its stamina to force a protracted fifth set
which China eventually won 15-11.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women spikers had an early surge of 8-4 but lost
their paces to concede nine points in a row as their Croatian
peers resorted to one-woman tactic through Jelic in No. eight
jersey.
</P>
<P>
The 9-15 first set loss only prompted the Chinese to focus
more on the blocks as they again rushed to a 5-0 lead in the
second set. After the Croats managed to claw back 5-6, the
Chinese outwitted their European counterparts with five ace
services and varified tactics to level the scoreboard 15-5.
</P>
<P>
With exchange of service five times, China scored the first
point in the third set and enjoyed its upperhands 7-4 after both
sides featured a tit-for-tat battle from 1-1 to 4-4. From 4-all,
China scored 11 points in a row to win the set 15-4 through fast
attacks and unforced errors from the Croats.
</P>
<P>
From 5-2, China again seized the dominance through good
teamwork to lead 10-5 despite four failed services. However,
Jelic's two killing shots and two solid blocks helped Croatia to
claw back 9-10 and overtook the lead again through Jelic's shot.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lina won the service right for China which levelled the
score 12-all as Wu Yongmei capitalized in the war of fatigue
before the Croatians scored three points in a row as the Chinese
women lost their form in a click of second.
</P>
<P>
In the decisive set where each serve scores one point for
either side, China had a good start 3-0, exchanged the courts 8-5
in its favor and sealed the competition 15-11.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, China won its opener against Thailand 15-9, 15-2,
15-5, while Croatia was surprisingly defeated by South Korea
15-12, 9-15, 15-12, 7-15, 15-11.

<HEADLINE> Automakers Report Strong Sales in U.S Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Chrysler Corp., as
well as Japanese and German automakers, reported record sales in
the U.S. market in October, according to reports from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler, the third-biggest U.S. automaker, said sales of
U.S.-built cars and trucks rose 20 percent to 226,179 last month,
its fourth record in the last six months, from 188,263 a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., the U.S. No. 1 and
No. 2 automakers, planned to report their October sales Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Toyota Motor Corp., the biggest Japanese automaker, said its
sales in the U.S. market rose 27 percent in October compared to a
year ago. Other Japanese automakers also reported remarkable
increases in sales. Honda Motor Co. said its sales rose 9.5
percent while Mitsubishi Motors Corp was up 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
German automakers again posted some of their largest percentage
gains last month in the U.S. market. Audi had a 137 percent
improvement over October 1997, its best sales month of the year so
far, and its best October since 1986. Volkswagen's U.S. sales were
up almost 69 percent, its best October since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Nissan Motor Co. is the only automaker that reported a
decrease. They said sales fell 6.8 percent despite 2,000
U.S. dollar rebates on its leftover '98s and a 19 percent
improvement in its Infiniti luxury brand.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts believe the record increase in sales indicates
that American consumers are less worried about the stock market
and economy than some on Wall Street had feared.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers seem to be looking beyond the recent market turmoil
with optimism," said Toyota vice president Yale Gieszl, adding
that strong industry sales continue to be driven by competitive
pricing and tempting lending rates.

<HEADLINE> Moldovan Currency Plummets 40 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Moldovan currency, the
leu, has lost 40 percent of its value over the last week, media
reports here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Moldovan foreign exchange market, the leu dropped from six
to the U.S. dollar on Monday morning to 10 to the dollar in the
afternoon. Although the government Tuesday fixed the price at 6.4
lei, the actual exchange rate was ten to one.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange reserves were used up and the Moldovan
government lost its ability to intervene the market, causing the
leu to nosedive.
</P>
<P>
The Moldovan National Bank decreed that all commercial banks
must deposit 15 percent of their social capital into the National
Bank before Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a panic over the devaluation, gasoline prices rose from 2.9
lei per liter to 4.8 lei, many stores selling imported goods
closed, and residents rushed to change lei to foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts attributed the Moldovan financial crisis to
the economic recession and shock of the Russian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Moldovan national economy relied heavily on the Russian
economy. The Moldovan exports have decreased 80 percent since the
Russian financial crisis broke out three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, international financial institutes refused to
provide loans for the country which announced independence in
1991. Thus, the government is lack of dollars to save the market
now after it spent 80 million dollars September to maintain the
exchange rate.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Effective In Preventing AIDS Spread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Hungary has managed to curb
the spread of the deadly AIDS disease through a series of
effective measures over the past decade, a medical seminar heard
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian medical expert Denes Banhegyi said the country had
managed to check the increase in the number of AIDS patients at
around 30 to 40 annually.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the growth in the number of the Human
Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) carriers was kept at a low rate of
40 to 60 new cases a year, successfully containing the spread
compared with neighboring countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Hungary managed to check the spread of AIDS
at a time when there was an increase in the number of illegal
immigrants and poor people in the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
The first AIDS patient was reported in Hungary in 1986. By the
end of 1995, there were 188 patients with full-blown AIDS and more
than 150 deaths.

<HEADLINE> Coffee, Sugar Prices Sore on US Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Coffee and sugar prices
closed sharply higher Tuesday on the U.S. market as heavy rains
caused by Hurricane Mitch damaged crops in Central America.
</P>
<P>
At the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, arabica
coffee for December delivery rose 9.25 cents, or 7.7 percent, to
1.29 U.S. dollars a pond, the highest price since May 22.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, March refined sugar rose 0.27 cent, or 3.6 percent,
to 7.87 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's rise marked the fifth consecutive day of gains in the
wake of Hurricane Mitch, the most powerful storm in a
decade. Mitch claimed 7,000 lives in Central American nations,
destroyed bridges and roads as well as sugar and coffee crops, the
main export items of the region.
</P>
<P>
While Central America produces only about 8 percent of the
world's coffee supplies, market analysts said arabica beans are
shipped mainly to the U.S. Warehouse inventories are reportedly at
their lowest in months as U.S. roasters stock up for the peak
winter consumption period.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Likely to Hike Tax Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
considering several measures including a mid-term hike of tax
rates to prevent the fiscal situation from going out of control,
Finance Ministry sources said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On current revenue and expenditure trends, senior Finance
Ministry officials do not expect the fiscal deficit to be less
than 6 percent. Gross domestic product growth during the current
fiscal, which was earlier projected at 6.5 percent, is now
expected to be at 5.5 percent. This is likely to severely affect
indirect tax collections, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has swung into action after a
communication from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said that any
increase in the level of borrowings could trigger off a financial
crisis by jeopardizing the viability of banks and financial
institutions, they said.
</P>
<P>
It is under active consideration now that the fiscal outlook
has turned adverse in the face of flagging revenues, dim prospects
for attaining the disinvestment target and the need to absorb
additional expenditures which had not been budgeted for.
</P>
<P>
The department of economic affairs in the Finance Ministry and
the RBI brass are among those pitching for a mid-term hike of tax
rates to partially salvage the fiscal situation. The government
has faced an unexpected spurt in payments under the heads of
defense, subsidies and pension payments.

<HEADLINE> India to Give More Incentives to Non-Resident Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee is expected to announce a package of incentives for
non-resident Indians (NRIs) on November 12 at a two-day global
entrepreneurs conference to be held here to attract more
investments from NRIs.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being organized by the Indian government, the
India Investment Center and the Federation of Indian Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FICCI). The package is likely to include
the much-debated dual citizenship for NRIs, the Business Standard
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in its election
manifesto early this year had promised the dual citizenship for
NRIs. NRIs' circles are hopeful that the prime minister will
announce at least an in-principle decision for dual citizenship as
the conference is the first of its kind and provides the right
platform for such an announcement.
</P>
<P>
Dual citizenship will allow NRIs to retain their Indian
citizenship while obtaining the citizenship of their country of
residence and entitle them to various taxation and other benefits
in India.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Exports Drop as Economy Affected by Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's export growth will
start to bottom out by the end of this year as the effects of the
Asian economic firestorm take hold on the economy, the Vietnam
Investment Review reported in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
Plummeting international prices and dissolving regional markets
were the main causes for the decline in export growth, the
English-language weekly quoted Deputy Prime Minster Nguyen Tan
Dung as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said Vietnam's total export volume increased by
nine percent, but prices have dropped by about 21 to 22 percent.
The low prices are the main reason behind the decline in export
value.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister warned that export growth would hit
zero by the end of the year if market solutions are not
immediately adopted.
</P>
<P>
"We could not avoid the effect of external influences, despite
our strong ambitions and solutions. For example, the price of
crude oil has decreased to 87 U.S. dollars per ton from 100 U.S.
dollars per ton since August this year," added Dung who is also
the governor of the State Bank of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Export growth increased by only 3.6 percent to 7.7 billion
dollars during the first 10 months, while industry output
increased by 12.2 percent year-on-year, according to recent
government figures.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's total imports during the first 10 months were 9.583
billion dollars, around 79.2 percent of the annual plan, a drop of
0.2 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
This brought Vietnam's 10-months trade deficit to 1.9 billion
dollars.

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial center, reported a year-to-year 117 percent growth in
foreign investment in its manufacturing sector for the first nine
months this year.
</P>
<P>
The city approved 540 foreign-funded industrial projects with
committed overseas investments totalling 3.68 billion U.S. dollars
in the nine months. The amount of foreign investment involved
accounted for 72 percent of the city's total contractual overseas
investment for the period.
</P>
<P>
Of these projects, 52 are technology intensive, and each
involves a total investment of more than 10 million
U.S. dollars. Investment from the United States and Europe rose 40
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qifan, director of the Shanghai Municipal Economic
Commission, attributed the surge to the city's efforts to further
improve its investment environment. He also pointed to good
performance by many overseas-funded enterprises in the city as a
major stimulus to foreign investment increase.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will use more foreign capital to help restructure and
upgrade its manufacturing sector, Huang said, and will take
effective steps to support multinationals and other investors who
wish to operate in the city.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia's Opposition Coalition Wins Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The opposition coalition in
Macedonia has won the third parliamentary elections since the
country became independent in 1991, the State Electoral Committee
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The coalition is made up of the Democratic Party for Macedonian
National Unity (IMRO-DPMNU) and the Democratic Alternative.
</P>
<P>
The committee said at a press conference in the city of Skoplje
that 117 of the 120-seat legislature have been filled after the
first-round election on October 18 and the second-round on
November 1.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results indicated that the center-right conservative
coalition has won 58 seats.
</P>
<P>
The two-term ruling Socialist Democratic Alliance of Macedonia
(SDAM) garnered only 28 seats and was reduced to an opposition
party.
</P>
<P>
Another coalition, consisting of the Party for Democratic
Prosperity (PDP) and the Albanian Democratic Party, gained 25
seats and became the third largest political force in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. Local
media believed that the incumbent SDAM has done a lot in
maintaining internal stability and developing relations with
neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
But domestic economic problems, coupled with corruption, high
unemployment and declining personal incomes, led to a lower voter
confidence in the ruling party, reports said.
</P>
<P>
IMRO-DPMNU Chairman Ljupco Georgievski will become the new
prime minister while Chairman of the Democratic Alternative Vasil
Purkovski will be the speaker of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Georgievski said Monday that he would give top priority to
economic issues. Meanwhile, Purkovski said the new government will
seek a continuity between its policies and those of the outgoing
government.
</P>
<P>
The coalition is expected to woo the support of several
deputies from other parties to secure a parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary elections proceeded peacefully, and the
voter turnout was about 70 percent.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Myanmar Strives to Protect Mangroves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 4 (Xinhua)-- Myanmar has been striving to
protect and preserve its mangroves as they are essential for
sustainable food security of the country's delta population.
</P>
<P>
Mangrove is one of the most productive ecosystems for the
maintenance of food web in an aquatic environment. It also plays a
role in protecting soil, and as a moderator for salinity and
resource of timber, fuelwood, charcoal and a range of non-wood
forest products.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3.14 million acres (1.27 million hectares) of
mangroves in Myanmar, covering about 4 percent of the country's
forest and making up over 48 percent of the 2.61-million-hectare
global mangrove resources.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's mangroves, about 46 percent are in Ayeyawady
division, a delta region in the country's southwestern part.
</P>
<P>
The landsat study shows that the Ayeyawady mangroves were being
depleted three times faster than the other forests in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Depletion of the region's mangroves was mainly due to high
demand of firewood and charcoal from the capital of Yangon and
conversion for agriculture land.
</P>
<P>
In view of the serious and alarming effects of the depletion of
mangroves, the government has called for international assistance
to redress the increasing fuelwood demand in the Ayeyawady delta
and develop the planting technology for rehabilitating degraded
and demanded areas to conserve the mangrove environment.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with the United Nations Development Program and
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Myanmar conducted a
pilot mangrove project, a feasibility study on mangrove
reforestation from March 1991 to December 1993 and an Ayeyawady
mangrove community development project from February 1994 to
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The projects were aimed at promoting sustainable human
development by improving the socio-economic welfare of
disadvantageous communities in critical areas in the coastal
Ayeyawady delta, through mangrove environment regeneration and
protection, fisheries income generation and promotion of
sufficiency in wood fuel and wood products.
</P>
<P>
A total of 48 villages, 16 from Laputta township and 32 from
Bogalay township in the Ayeyawady division which mainly involve in
agriculture, forestry and fishery, were selected as project
villages.
</P>
<P>
The projects' personnel attended various short courses and
workshops, toured Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam in 1995 and
planted 3.6 million seedlings and cuttings with the participation
of the villagers.

<P>
ALMA ATA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh Minister of Foreign
Affairs Kasymzhomart Tokayev on Tuesday emphasized the necessity
for a political solution to the bloody conflict in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Meeting here with visiting Pakistani Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Muhammed Kanju, Tokayev said Kazakhstan opposes
any kinds of intervention in Afghanistan's internal affairs, which
he said would cause further deterioration of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Only peaceful negotiations can lead to a political solution to
the conflicts and peace within Afghanistan, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan has suffered for years from civil wars between the
Taliban forces, which have imposed strict Islamic law on 90
percent of the country, and the anti-Taliban alliance, which
comprises the country's minorities such as Shiite Muslims,
Tajiks, Uzbeks and Turkmen.
</P>
<P>
Kanju arrived here Tuesday and exchanged views with Tokayev on

BELGRADE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States will back
Milorad Dodik as the new prime minister of the Serb Republic of

said in Banjaluka Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tanjag news agency, Gelbard expressed his

</P>
<P>
Since then, the hardliners and the moderates have been
wrangling over who should become the new prime minister. While the

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises in the
city of Shantou, one of the special economic zones in south China,
have become a pillar of the local economy after more than a decade
of development.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters this year, the total output value
of these enterprises reached 35.7 billion yuan (4.3 billion
U.S. dollars), up 22.73 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, their output value stood at 40.7 billion yuan,
accounting for nearly 70 percent of the city's total and 13 times
greater than in 1980. There are altogether 46 township enterprises
each registering an output value of more than 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
To ward off the impact of the Asian financial crisis, township
enterprises in the special economic zone have adjusted their sales
strategy by shifting the focus from urban to rural areas, and from
markets in southeast Asia to northern America and western Europe.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 53 local township enterprises have been authorized
to engage in foreign trade, which delivered 6.73 billion yuan of
products for export in the first nine months, an increase of 46.78

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
targeted 53 million U.S. dollars on housing for 1999, the highest
ever investment in the history of housing development, according
to the Housing Ministry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 50,000-house program for this year was nearing completion
with the government having launched suitable housing schemes for
the benefit of low income families, the ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources stated that in addition to giving housing loans,
the ministry had expanded its activities and made a bigger
contribution towards housing development.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Sri Lanka will need another 500,000 houses
during the next five years. Last year the ministry had spent 1,500
 million RS (23 million dollars) on housing development
activities.
</P>
<P>
This money had been raised by the transfer of ownership of
rented houses, recovering housing loans in a more efficient manner
and selling unutilized lands, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Good Day for France and Spain in UEFA Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- French and Spanish clubs
enjoyed a good day while English and German ones disappointed
themselves on a busy night of the UEFA Cup second round second
leg matches across Europe on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
World champions France saw all four sides through to the last
16 and the Spanish clubs won four out of five encounters, while
Liverpool was the only English side to survive in a match with
Valencia of Spain which saw three players were booked the red
cards in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
German teams also suffered, and if Bayer Leverkusen cannot
turn around the table when facing Glasgow Rangers, 2-1 ahead from
the first leg, on Thursday night, there would be no German sides
after VfB Stuttgart fell 2-3 to FC Brugge of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
France had their most impressive performance coming from
Monaco, who crushed Graz AK of Austria 4-0 at home to advance 7-3
on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Marseille, thanks to goals from Florian Maurice, Pierre Issa
and Christophe Dugarry, beat Germany's Werder Bremen 3-2 at home.
</P>
<P>
Lyon won 3-2 at home against former European champions Red
Star Belgrade to go through 5-3 and Bordeaux downed Vitesse
Arnhem of Holland 2-1 to progress 3-1 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool saved Britain's face by holding out 2-2 despite
having Steve McManaman and Paul Ince sent off and advancing by
away goals rule after the home leg 0-0 draw two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Valencia's Amedeo Carboni was also dimissed in the final
minute.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the English sides tumbled as Premiership leaders
Aston Villa crashed to a shock 3-1 home defeat to Celta Vigo of
Spain and out of the tournament on a 2-3 aggregate, and Leeds
United failed to offset one goal first leg deficit and also went
out after a goalless draw at home to AS Roma of Italy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italian side Fiorentina's match with Swiss side
Grasshopper Zurich was called off after a firework explosion
disrupted the game.
</P>

A match official, Philippe Flament of Belgium, fell to the
ground and had to be stretchered off before being rushed to
hospital.
</P>
<P>
The match was called off with the Italians leading 2-1 at
halfway.
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina, who was already serving a ban from playing at its
home ground after crowd trouble in its 1997 European Cup Winners'
Cup semi-final against Barcelona, could face fines, a further
suspension or possibly even being ordered to forfeit the match.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Shakespeare Dramas in Chinese Operas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people came to know
Shakespeare around 100 years ago, and now the renowned playwright
is becoming increasingly popular in China as many of his plays are
staged in the form of traditional Chinese operas.
</P>
<P>
A Sixuan Opera Troupe in central China's Hebei Province began
the practice of performing Shakespeare's dramas in traditional art
forms fours years ago. Their performance of King Lear attracted a
large local audience including many farmers during the troupe's
provincial tour of Hebei.
</P>
<P>
At a recent seminar on Shakespeare held in Shanghai, King Lear
as performed in Sixuan-Opera style was also well received by the
Shakespearean scholars from both China and abroad.
</P>
<P>
To date, 26 of Shakespeare's plays have been performed in
different Chinese traditional operas such as Peking
Opera, Kunju Opera, Yueju Opera and Chuanju Opera, according to
Sun Fuliang, a Shanghai-based authority on Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
These plays include Romeo and Juliet, Othello, King Lear,
Macbeth and Much Ado About Nothing, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
"From urban to rural areas, from coastal cities to inland
provinces, Shakespeare's drama has played an important part in
people's cultural activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sun added that Shakespeare's plays are included in the
repertoires of students troupes in colleges and universities
during campus art festivals and cultural celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The plays are nearly the same as the original works, though the
language is Chinese and costumes in the Chinese style. Some
aspects are quite different from the original works, such as the
names of the dramas and characters, and the background history.
</P>
<P>
"Shakespeare's plays and their performance in Chinese versions
are good examples of art exchange," said a foreign expert
attending the seminar with 60 other scholars from China and a dozen
foreign countries.

WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. astronauts aboard space
shuttle Discovery successfully got back the satellite Spartan with
hundreds of sun images Tuesday after it had been released into
space for two days.
</P>
<P>
Shuttle commander Curtis Brown Jr. pulled up alongside Spartan,
and Stephen Robinson slowly latched onto the satellite with the
50-feet robot arm as the spacecraft soared some 340 miles over
South America.
</P>

NASA expects the Spartan to bring back some 1200 images about
the sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, and charged particles
coming from the sun's surface. Currently about 500 images already
have been sent down to ground controllers, including pictures of
one solar flare.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Brazil Protests Against Colombian Air Force Landings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazil on Tuesday sent Bogota
a "strong" protest after Colombian air force planes illegally used
one of its landing strips to retake the control of a city seized
by guerrilla on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's foreign ministry said in a statement that the
Colombian government on Sunday had twice requested permission to
use the Querari airstrip near the common border, but the Brazilian
side had twice denied permission.
</P>
<P>
Colombia had sent its air force to retake the Amazon town of
Mitu, where at least 100 people were killed during an attack by
fighters from the country's main rebel group, the Colombian
Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC).
</P>
<P>
The Colombian Air Force "used the airstrip of Querari as a
support base for their military operations in Colombian
territory," Brazil complained.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that due to the seriousness of the incident,
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso had discussed the situation
Tuesday with the chiefs of the navy, army and air force and
foreign minister Luis Felipe Lampreia.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Cardoso asked Lampreia to call the Colombian
ambassador in Brazil to lodge a strong protest.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry said, however, that for "humanitarian
reasons", the Brazilian government had allowed the Colombian army
to use the airstrip until Tuesday evening to evacuate the people
killed and wounded in the attack.

<HEADLINE> Euro Bank Chief Rejects Call for Lower Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- European Central Bank (ECB)
President Wim Duisenberg Tuesday indicated that the bank was
unimpressed with the new German government's call for lower
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Monetary policy could not solve existing structural problems,
which should be the task of governments, said Duisenberg in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg made the comment after new German Finance Minister
Oskar Lafontaine criticized the tight monetary policy adopted by
the country's central bank, the Bundesbank, as too restrictive and
called for an interest rate cut to spur economic growth and
employment.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine's criticism triggered a sensitive debate about the
Bundesbank's long-cherished status of political independence.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg said he believed that the debate about the
Bundesbank's role was actually directed at the new central bank of
the single European currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
He added that this would not effect the decision-making of the
ECB.
</P>
<P>
The monetary policy's best contribution to economic growth and
employment was keeping price stability, Duisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed doubt that a further interest rate cut could
stimulate private consumption and investment.
</P>
<P>
The ECB, which is charged with the task of administering the
euro, will set a common interest rate for the 11 European Union
countries which are due to introduce the single currency on
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The bank indicated last month that Germany's current short-term
rate of 3.3 percent could be the target for the whole euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg on Tuesday also expressed the belief that global
economic turmoil had calmed down recently.
</P>
<P>
Although the worldwide crisis would dampen the economic growth
of the euro zone next year, the slowdown would be temporary and
stronger growth could be expected in the euro zone in the year
2000, Duisenberg said.

XI'AN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China's largest metallic fiber
production center began operations on Friday in Xi'an, capital of
northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The center, involving a total investment of 69 million yuan
(8.3 million U.S. dollars), has an annual production capacity of
20 tons of metallic fibers and 15,000 square meters of metallic
fiber felt.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the project by the Northwest Nonferrous
Research Institute makes China the world's fourth largest producer
of metallic fibers and associated products after the United
States, Belgium and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Metallic fiber is a new industrial material developed in the
last 20 years. Because of its unique qualities combining the
characteristics of both chemical fibers and metals, it has become
a key supporting material in the national economy and the defense
industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria is going to open
investment offices in Tokyo, Paris, London and Washington,
Bulgarian Foreign Investment Agency (BFIA) President Iliyan
Vassilev said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The offices will provide foreign investors with information
about Bulgaria. It will also help Bulgarian businessmen explore
local markets in different regions, Vassilev said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the BFIA offices will help organize Bulgaria's
various economic sectors and explore investment prospects and
market opportunities abroad.
</P>
<P>
The first office will soon open in Tokyo, Vassilev said.
</P>
<P>
The BFIA, established in 1995, is the agency in charge of
providing information and legal counseling to foreign investors
seeking cooperative opportunities. It also helps coordinate
policies with other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is an eastern European country that has attracted few
investors in recent years. Last year's foreign investment amounted
to only 700 million U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar Morning Post began
publishing here Wednesday in Chinese language. This is the first
time in 30 years that Myanmar allowed a newspaper in the Chinese
language to be published.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Morning Post will be initially published on a
weekly basis with a circulation of 5,000 on every Wednesday and be
distributed across Myanmar and to other countries and regions such
as Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, the United States, Britain,
Canada, China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, which is planned to increase its publication
from once a week to twice or thrice a week, is made up of 16 pages
containing columns of local and foreign news, economic, trade and
investment information, culture and advertisements.
</P>
<P>
Before the middle of the 1960s, there were six newspapers in
the Chinese language in Myanmar. They are the People's Post, the
China Daily, the China Commerce Post, the New Yangon Post, the
Freedom Daily and the Times.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, 1966, all the newspapers terminated their
publication because the Myanmar authorities stopped issuing
permits to them.

BONN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A German on suspicion of beating
a French policeman into coma has been released, the German sports

<HEADLINE> Dialogue Over East Timor Ends Without Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.-sponsored East Timor
talks broke down Tuesday in Austria with no agreement on a joint
declaration.
</P>
<P>
The four-day talks, the fourth annual inter-Timorese meeting
organized by the United Nations, began Saturday at a castle in
Krumbach, 80 kilometres south of Vienna.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Special Representative Jamsheed Marker said the agenda of
the talks was the main sticking point.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of integration with Jarkata and a group which wants
a referendum on independence for the territory failed to iron out
their differences.
</P>
<P>
A proposal to discuss political issues instead of merely the
situation of the Indonesian occupied territory was turned down.
</P>
<P>
Under the previous agreement, the final legal status of East
Timor was not on the agenda of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese overseas territory in
1975 and annexed it the following year. But the U.N. continues to
regard Lisbon as the official administrator of East Timor and its
secretary-general has sponsored peace talks between Portugal and
Indonesia since 1983.
</P>
<P>
After the ouster of former Indonesian President Suharto, new
President B.J. Habibie agreed to grant autonomy to East Timor, but
it would be difficult for East Timor to gain "real autonomy."

<HEADLINE> Coffee Prices Soar on Hurricane Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Coffee exports could drop to
record lows this year as heavy rains brought on by Hurricane Mitch
damaged crops in Central America.
</P>
<P>
"There will be an impact on production and exports," Costa
Rica's Coffee Institute Director Guillermo Canet said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Canet however declined to give an estimation of damages to
coffee crops in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and
Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
Honduras, which was expecting its biggest coffee harvest ever
with 4 million 46-kilo bags in the 1998-99 period, is now
estimating it has lost about two-thirds of the harvest.
</P>
<P>
Canet said Costa Rica has lost about 8 percent of its crop and
could register heavier losses if recently-harvested grains are not
processed in time.
</P>
<P>
A 133-million bag harvest had been expected in 1998-1999 in
Central America, as a demand of only 129 million bags could have
decreased prices.
</P>
<P>
Honduras and Nicaragua were hit hard by Mitch during the
weekend. Roads and bridges were washed away at a time when
producers transport crops to the ports.
</P>
<P>
In New York, coffee prices soared nearly 7 percent on Monday on
concerns that Central American exports had been disrupted by Mitch
at a time of low inventories.
</P>
<P>
As the hurricane devastated Central America, U.S. stockpiles
were described as critical for better-quality coffee.
</P>
<P>
Coffee for December delivery surged 7.5 cents to reach 1,175
dollars per metric ton, a 6.8 percent increase on the New York
Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, its biggest daily gain since
July 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Colombian coffee for November delivery closed Tuesday up at
1,355 dollars a ton, compared to Monday's 1,283 dollars, the
Colombian National Coffee Producers Federation reported in
Bogota.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 600 Million Computers-in-Use Worldwide in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 3 (Xinhua) -- There will be over 579
million computers-in-use worldwide by the end of the year 2000,
according to the Internet Industry Almanac published in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, there were 360 million computers-in-use worldwide,
said the almanac, which is loaded with statistics, rankings,
technology trends, forecasts and projections about the Internet
and computer industry.
</P>
<P>
The United States is projected to have more than 164 million
computers-in-use or 28 percent of the world's total in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The numbers include all computers, from PCs to supercomputers,
used in business, educational institutions and homes. Over 95
percent of the computers-in-use are PCs, according to the
reference book.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide yearly shipments of computers will surpass 90 million
units in 1998, but only half of them will add to the installed
base as nearly half will be replacing existing computers.
</P>
<P>
About five percent of the 30 million PCs sold in the United
States in 1998 will be sold via the Internet, which will grow to
10 percent of nearly 40 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The top 16 countries, accounting for over 70 percent of the
worldwide computers-in-use in 2000, are, in order of rank: the
United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada,
China, Australia, South Korea, Russia, Brazil, Spain, the
Netherlands, India and Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Automobile Loans Welcomed in East China's Fuzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Six automobile buyers in Fuzhou,
capital of east China's Fujian Province, excitedly got the keys to
the new cars they had just purchased from a local sales agent with
loans provided by the Fuzhou branch of the Construction Bank of
China (CBC).
</P>
<P>
They became the branch's first group of clients to use
automobile loans, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou is also the first city in Fujian to introduce the
automobile loan program.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Construction Bank of China announced it
would begin granting automobile loans nationwide beginning on
October 20. This decision was greeted with an enthusiastic welcome
by Chinese consumers, manufacturers and sales agent alike.
</P>
<P>
The loans, which carry terms ranging between three to five
years, will be limited to 80 percent of the total cost of a
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
In Fuzhou, over 20 automobile sales agents have shown interests
in cooperating with the branch on the automobile loan program, and
six of them have reached agreements with the branch.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 potential automobile buyers in the city have consulted

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Ruling Golkar Chairman Denies Groups' Apology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian ruling Golkar
(Functional Group) Chairman Akbar Tandjung said the ruling group
has never apologized for its myriad mistakes of the past, and sees
no reason to do so, national newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said Monday's apology issued by Golkar executive Marzuki
Darusman cannot be classified as an official statement from the
group.
</P>
<P>
"There is an idea among some of us that Golkar should
apologize. But officially, the organization will not apologize
because we have done both good and bad in the past," Akbar said
after meeting with President B.J. Habibie on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki, who is chairman of the Golkar faction in the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR), apologized Monday for the party's
political wrongdoing. It was not clear whether he was speaking as
an individual or on behalf of Golkar.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Marzuki failed to persuade other Golkar executives
to apologize at a party leadership meeting. He said Monday's
apology was the result of further evaluations within the group.
</P>
<P>
Golkar came under fire last month after it rejected public
calls that it apologize for past political mistakes, including
those contributing to the social and economic crisis besetting the
country.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1964, the once all-powerful functional group was
former president Soeharto's loyal political vehicle, which never
dared to disagree with its leader until May this year, when the
aging autocrat was forced to resign amid rising socio-economic
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Following Soeharto's downfall on May 21, Golkar was blamed as
the main culprit behind the economic crisis, as most of its
members in parliament were accused of being greedy practitioners
of corruption, collusion and nepotism.

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Former Co-Manager Sues Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- John K. Horne, former
co-manager of Miky Tyson, filed a lawsuit against the former
heavyweight champion on Tuesday, claiming breach of contract and
seeking damages in excess of 14 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Horne had filed a suit against Tyson's new adviser Shelley
Finkel last month, seeking a 10 percent share in any money Tyson
makes from his next five fights.
</P>
<P>
Tyson might return to the ring on January 6 against Francois
Botha of South Africa in Las Vegas. The fight would be promoted
by Amercia Presents.
</P>
<P>
Horne filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court, claming
Tyson breached a contract that the two entered into with Showtime
Networks Inc. along with co-manager Rory Holloway and promoter
Don King on March 17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit said that Horne, Holloway and King - known as Team
Tyson - signed a contract with Showtime on March 17 that called
for the group to handle Tyson's first 10 fights after Tyson was
freed from an Indiana prison on rape charges, and that Horne
would be paid 10 percent of Tyson's earnings.
</P>
<P>
It was during the fifth fight under that contract that Tyson
bit Evander Holyfield's ears.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges the purses from the five bouts under the
Showtime agreement totaled 140 million US dollars, and the
remaining five bouts required under the agreement will yield
similar purses.
</P>
<P>
Tyson broke from the Team Tyson last March, filing lawsuits
against each of the three. He accused King of cheating him out of
tens of million of dollars, and his co-managers of betraying him
by arranging a deal that made King his exclusive promoter.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Likely to Fight January 16 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson, who got his
license back last month, would have his first comeback fight
against Francois Botha of South Africa on January 16, according
to the press report here today.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the fight would be held at the MGM Grand
at Las Vegas, and the bout would be promoted by America
Presents. But Tyson's adviser Shelly Finkel said no deal had
been finalized.
</P>
<P>
"Our plan is for him to fight in January, but Mike has not
concluded a deal to fight anybody in January," Finkel said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Frank Warren, Botha's adviser, would not
confirm the Tyson fight had been made, saying only that Warren's
company was "advising" Botha until January.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's possible opponents include Vaughn Bean and Germany's
Axel Schultz, according to a spokeswoman for Showtime, the cable
company that will televise the fight. She added that the deal
could be closed by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
Botha has lost only once in 37 fights. Michael Moorer of the
United States stopped him in the 12th round in an IBF title
challenge two years ago. He is the No. 1 contender for
Holyfield's IBF title.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Riots Team Announces Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian
government-sponsored fact-finding team investigating the May riots
said that the unrest was triggered by a power struggle within the
political elite and a rapid deterioration of the economy in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Reading from a 27-page written report on Tuesday night, team
Chairman Marzuki Darusman said the riots were caused by "a dual
crossover between two major processes," a political struggle
within the elite and a declining economic situation.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the struggle within the political elite,
Marzuki said, certain elements in the field had played their role
during the riots.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the meeting at the Army's Strategic Reserves
Command (Kostrad) headquarters on May 14, 1998, might be able to
reveal the role played by these certain perpetrators and the
pattern of the struggle which had led to the riots.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki assured that the May riots had been the culmination of
a series of previous acts of violence, including abductions --
which had actually been going on for quite a long time -- and
intelligence activities which could not be effectively controlled,
and the Trisakti incident in which a number of students was
killed.
</P>
<P>
The team directly or indirectly verified 52 victims of rape,
another 14 victims of rape accompanied by violence and a further
10 victims of sexual attacks. There were an additional four cases
of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
"Not all the victims of sexual violence were from the ethnic
Chinese, but the majority were women from the ethnic Chinese,"
Marzuki said.
</P>
<P>
The team also "found the majority of the rapes were gang rapes,
where the victims were raped by a number of people at the same
time and in the same place," Marzuki said, adding most of the
rapes were committed before onlookers.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited report did not mention any figures for those
who died during the riots but cited those earlier given by the
Volunteers for Humanity, the police and the military.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers claimed that 1,190 people died in fires in
Jakarta, and 27 others were killed by weapons. Another 33 people
died in riots outside Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Police said 451 people were killed during the riots in Jakarta
and 32 outside Jakarta, while the military said 463 were killed in
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The team said it had found a common pattern during the rioting
in various places, namely the presence of people with certain
physical characteristics (including well-built physiques sporting
crew cuts) who incited residents into violence.
</P>
<P>
The instigators were usually strangers in the areas where
violence took place, appeared trained, highly mobile and were also
equipped with destructive means, including fuel and Molotov
cocktails, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report contained a total of eight recommendations to the
government.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations include the publication of a white paper
detailing the roles and responsibilities of "everyone," military
and civilian, connected when the riots took place; investigation
of the May 14 meeting in order to uncover the roles of then
Kostrad Commander Lieut. Gen. Prabowo and other individuals in the
process leading up to the riots; the trial of Prabowo and his
inner circle for their involvement in the abduction of some 24
political activists.
</P>
<P>
The team also suggested victims and witnesses of the riots be
provided with a witness and victim protection program, financial
and physical rehabilitation and compensation.
</P>
<P>
The government was also urged to draft a new bill stipulating
the functions and responsibilities of state intelligence agencies,
as well as access to them.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Fact-Finding Team was formed on July 23 under a joint
decree of the Defense and Security Ministry, Justice Ministry,
Attorney General's Office, and the Ministries of Women Affairs,
Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The 18-member team was entrusted with the task of investigating
and, if possible, unveiling the instigators and perpetrators of
the May riots, which some say were organized.
</P>
<P>
Mandated to report to the government on October 23, the team
have been twice delayed in the announcement of their findings due
to a conflict in the schedule for a final meeting of the six
government representatives.

<HEADLINE> Pudong's Real Estate Faces Oversupply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area in
Shanghai will face pressure from the supply of six million square
meters of office and business space and 10 million square meters
of open-market apartments in its real estate market over the next
two to three years.
</P>
<P>
But real estate dealers say this will be a phased contradiction
between supply and demand. They believe Pudong's real estate
market is healthy on the whole and enjoys good prospects.
</P>
<P>
The real estate market has been expanding rapidly since the
Pudong New Area started development and opening up in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Comprehensive Planning and Land Bureau of
the Pudong New Area said that by late 1997, Pudong had had 773
real estate companies and 40 square kilometers of land had been
developed.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 65 billion yuan were spent in real estate
fixed- assets investment, accounting for 38 percent of the area's
total fixed assets investment for the the same period.
</P>
<P>
The real estate sector generated 4.8 billion yuan in added
value, accounting for eight percent of Pudong's gross domestic
product (GDP) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Some measures taken by China's central government and the local
government, such as the State Council's approval of foreign banks
in Pudong handling business in Chinese currency on a trial basis
will have positive effects in alleviating the pressure of
oversupply.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A chief conservationist
expressed concern over the decreasing number of Javanese eagles in
Indonesia, Antara News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The population of Javanese eagles is estimated at not more than
200 and it is feared they continue to dwindle, the head of Meru
Betiri National Park Indra Arinal said.
</P>
<P>
He feared the endangered species would become extinct in the
next several years.
</P>
<P>
He said efforts had been made to save them by among others
breeding the endangered large birds, but still of no avail.
</P>
<P>
"All efforts have failed because of the difficulty in creating
the right habitat for them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Javanese eagles live in 25-30 meters high tree tops where they
lay eggs only once in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
He said no more than 12 of these Javanese eagles live in Meru
Betiri.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Announces Job-Creating Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazil on Tuesday announced
that the government is taking measures to reduce expected
unemployment due to a new austerity policy.
</P>
<P>
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso will present two programs
to the Congress. The first will grant unemployment benefits to
people who had not worked for one year. The second will allow
employers to dismiss workers only if they offer them job training
courses.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Cardoso announced a strict austerity program to
raise taxes and slash budget in order to save 24 million dollars
next year.
</P>
<P>
But the plan is expected to increase unemployment above its
current official rate of 7.8 percent. Independent figures show
joblessness rate is close to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The first program will extend the monthly payment of 255
dollars for each worker unemployed for 12 months for another three
months starting in January.
</P>
<P>
The second measure will allow employers to suspend work
contracts for two to six months, during which workers will be
retrained and receiving lower wages.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Hangzhou, a well-known tourist
city in east China's Zhejiang Province, plans to rebuild a
long-abandoned scenic spot near famous West Lake.
</P>
<P>
This scenic area, called West Stream, is a region of rivers and
flowers on the western outskirts of the city, and is thought by
many to be comparable to the natural beauty of West Lake itself.
</P>
<P>
Historical records reveal that West Stream attracted many men
of letters from all over China from the time of the Southern Song
Dynasty (1129-1279) with its temples and inscribed tablets handed
down from ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Wu Heren, who is in charge of the overall design of West
Stream, said the city will restore most of the historical sites
while maintaining the natural landscape.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they will build new tourist facilities including
the reproduction of a Song military drilling ground, a flower
display platform on the water and a high-tech agricultural park.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost about 180 million yuan and is scheduled
for to be completed within two years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's October trade
deficit rose to 472 U.S.million dollars, the Industry and Trade
Ministry reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Brazil exported 4.5 billion dollars worth of
products, while its imports totalled over five billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that Brazil's accumulated deficit in the
past ten months totalled 4.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since January, Brazil's exports have amounted to 44 billion
dollars, and its imports 48.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government is expecting a trade deficit of
between five and six billion dollars this year due to low world
prices for commodities like soybeans, coffee and orange juice,
which are the country's main export products.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's trade deficit reached 8.3 billion dollars in 1997.

<P>
GENEVA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- UEFA and Europe's leading
soccer clubs Tuesday began discussing the financial aspects of a
revamped Champions' League format.
</P>
<P>
The 12 clubs reached basic agreement of cooperation with the
governing body's Task Force last month at their last meeting
here. But now it seemed that they had little common in how the
money will be divided.
</P>
<P>
UEFA general secretary Gerhard Aigner emerged from the meeting
saying: "There was not a uniformity of view."
</P>
<P>
The clubs want half the income to be distributed according to
market value (the countries with big-money leagues) and half to
be performance-related, he said.
</P>
<P>
UEFA was forced to reform its European competitions to head
off the threat of a privately-organised Super League promoted by
the Milan-based company "Media Partner". The Champions' League
currently has 24 teams.
</P>
<P>
The clubs attending the meeting were: Ajax Amsterdam, AC
Milan, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan,
Juventus, Liverpool, Manchester United, Olympique Marseille,
Porto and Real Madrid.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Economic Index Holds Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy will continue
to grow into next year although some economists have expected a
slight decline, according to a latest report of the Conference
Board.
</P>
<P>
The Board reported Tuesday that its Index of Leading Economic
Indicators stood at 105.5 in September, the same level as in July
and August.
</P>
<P>
The leading index, which is designed to forecast economic
activity six to nine months in advance, operates from a base of
100, set in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board is a worldwide research and business
membership group, with more than 2,700 corporate and other
members in 60 nations.
</P>
<P>
"The economy will be hard-pressed to match the robust growth
posted the past few years," said Michael Boldin, a Conference
Board economist in a press release Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Still, the leading index is considerably higher now compared
with last year, and rising consumer spending and low interest
rates should keep us out of a recession," Boldin added.
</P>
<P>
The consumer spendings slightly decreased in the third quarter
compared with the first and second quarters of this year, but are
still keeping at a healthy level.
</P>
<P>
The New York stock market has been rallying since late October
amid good news at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates twice since
September 29 to stimulate the country's economy and protect it
from the global financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the U.S. Department of Commerce reported surprising
economic growth for the third quarter as consumer spending boomed.
The U.S. GDP increased by 3.3 percent in the quarter compared with
1.8 percent in the second quarter.

WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approved a new drug called Enbrel for rheumatoid
arthritis, the New York Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The drug, developed by Immunex Corporation which is a
biotechnology company in Seattle, was shown in clinical trials to
reduce pain and swelling in the joints of many patients with
severe arthritis. However it does not cure arthritis or reverse
damage that has already been done to bones and cartilage.
</P>
<P>
The drug agency said that the drug is only for people with
moderate or severe arthritis for whom existing drugs have failed.
</P>
<P>
Patients take the drug by injection twice a week, and its
main side effect is irritation at the site of the injections.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Blair Discuss Iraq on Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair Tuesday discussed the latest
crisis on Iraqi weapons inspection over the phone.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Blair discussed "our joint view that...all options
to respond remain on the table," including military force,
spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to possible options to respond to Iraq's
decision to stop cooperating with U.N. arms inspectors. Clinton on
Monday sent Cohen on a trip to Europe and the Gulf to discuss the
Iraq situation with allies.
</P>
<P>
The telephone conversation followed a meeting earlier in the
day in London between U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and his
British counterpart, George Robertson.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the Pentagon said that a U.S. force of 21
warships and 174 aircraft now in the Gulf region is sufficient for
any military action against Iraq over the U.N. arms inspection
dispute.
</P>
<P>
"There are no plans to change our posture," said Defense
Department spokesman Pat Sivigny.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration had indicated that it will not rule out
any options for dealing with Iraq unless it agrees to allow the
U.N. inspectors to finish their job.
</P>
<P>
Iraq last week decided to suspend all cooperation with the
inspection team until the U.N. Security Council cancels sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The United States maintains a substantial, capable and ready
military force in the region, postured to respond to any
contingencies," Sivigny told reporters.

NEW YORK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks closed mixed on
Tuesday, with an unchanged Dow Jones industrial average at
8706.15, a decline in technology shares and rises in most other
stocks.
</P>
<P>
The Dow, which ended a three-session winning streak advancing
340 points, saw a 38-point gain and a 28-point loss amid profit
taking.
</P>
<P>
The market lacked vitality in a mid-term Election Day, and a
promising economic outlook index had little impact on trading.
</P>
<P>
The private research group Conference Board said on Tuesday
that its index of Leading Economic Indicators remained unchanged
for the second straight month.
</P>
<P>
The September level at 105.5, the same as in August and July,
was in line with prevailing projection that the U.S. economy is to
continue growing into 1999 but at a slower pace as a result of the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>

According to preliminary figures, the technology-laced Nasdaq
composite index fell 12.47 to 1788.44 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy is forecast
to continue growing but at a slower pace into 1999, as indicated
by the index released Tuesday by a private research group called
the Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
The Board said its Index of Leading Economic Indicators
remained unchanged at 105.5 in September, the same as in August
and July, beating economists' projection for a slight fall.
</P>
<P>
The index, designed to forecast economic activity six to nine
months ahead, is in line with prevailing view that the U.S.
economy will grow slower due to the contagion effects of the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The index, higher than last year, and rising consumer spending
and low interest rates should keep the U.S. out of a recession,
said Conference Board economist Michael Boldin.
</P>
<P>
The government reported a 3.3 percent economic growth for the
third quarter, also surpassing economists' projection.
</P>
<P>
The latest report shows that country's consumer spending was
rising but its exports falling as a result of declining purchasing
power of those countries affected by the economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Brown Cuts Growth Hopes Amid Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor Gordon Brown
predicted Tuesday a downturn in UK's economic growth in his
pre-budget statement to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Brown said that gross domestic product growth would be 1.0-1.5
percent in 1999-2000, and GDP growth of 2.25-2.75 percent in
2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor said that long-term strength was the main aim
and he would meet his target for keeping public borrowing under
control.
</P>
<P>
Decisions the Government had taken in its first year placed
Britain better than most to weather current global financial
instability, Brown added.
</P>
<P>
Brown said: "In this year's pre-budget report we seek to steer
a course of stability amid a world economic downturn."
</P>
<P>
On debt, the Chancellor said this would fall as a proportion of
national income to 39 percent by the next financial year.
</P>
<P>
But the Shadow Chancellor Francis Maude accused Brown of
"arrogant complacency" and said the measures were "just moving the
deck chairs around on the Titanic".

DAR ES SALAAM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's trade account
improved slightly by 3.5 percent from a deficit of 83.2 million U.S.
Dollars in August to that of 80.3 million U.S. Dollars during
September.
</P>
<P>
The decline in import bill by four percent that offset the
effect of 4.9 percent decrease in export earnings, is responsible for
this improvement, according to a latest report released by the Bank of
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in the import bill was mainly a result of a decline
in imports of intermediate and consumer goods, while the decrease
in export earnings was primarily due to poor performance of the
non-traditional sector, the bank said in a monthly economic review.
</P>
<P>
For the year ending September 1998, the trade account worsened,
recording a deficit of 805 million U.S. Dollars, compared with a
deficit of 594 million U.S. Dollars recorded during the corresponding
period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The trade account worsened mainly due to a significant decline of
export earnings from both traditional and non-traditional exports

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Prices of Kenyan coffee rose
at the weekly export auction Tuesday on tight supply, according
to coffee board data.
</P>
<P>
The average market price rose to 127.97 U.S. Dollars per 50 kg
lot from 119.05 Dollars last week. Without the poorer-quality
miscellaneous grade, the market average rose to 154.08 Dollars
per 50 kg lot from 142.40 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The storms in Central American were worrying the market, a
senior official at the Kenya Coffee Auctions (KCA) said.
</P>
<P>
Further losses of good quality coffee from the region would
exacerbate the already tight global supply, the official added.
</P>
<P>
At Kenya's auction, traders said that coffee quality on offer
was not good and was not expected to improve in the near term.
</P>
<P>
"Despite that, the market showed a firmer trend, moving at
around 10 Dollars above last week," the KCA official said.
</P>
<P>
Traders said they expected tight supply to persist until the
end of the calendar year.
</P>
<P>
The Coffee Board of Kenya said it sold all 13,656 60-kg bags
of coffee it offered for sale compared with 15,573 last week.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, coffee is weighed in 60 kg bags and sold in 50 kg
lots.

<P>
HARARE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
reiterated the need for a negotiated peaceful settlement of the
crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Peace could not be achieved through military meXs in the DRC,
said Susan Rice, visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
African Affairs, in Harare after meeting Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters that her country recognized the allied
forces from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia were invited by DRC
President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is aware that allied forces were invited by the
legitimate government to defend it from rebel invasion, but we
are concerned with the escalation of hostilities," said Rice.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe sent troops to the DRC following
a rebellion against the Kabila government in early August.
</P>
<P>
Rice said she and Mugabe have "agreed on the imperative need
to preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Congo
(K) and the need for an immediate cease-fire there."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said her talks with Mugabe were
"productive", but "a lot of work still needs to be done."
</P>
<P>
Rice also denied that Angola agreed to pull out its troops
from the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy was in Zimbabwe to discuss the termination of a
15-week period of hostilities in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Zimbabwe estimatedly has over 6,000
troops in the DRC in support of the Kabila government.
</P>
<P>
Sunday in Lubumbashi in southern DRC, Mugabe announced the
launching of an offensive against the rebel positions in the east
of the third largest African country.

Liberation Army" (KLA) has struck another serious blow to the
efforts of the international community and the Yugoslav
authorities to resolve the Kosovo issue peacefully, a Yugoslav
minister said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Information Secretary Goran Matic said in a
statement that the criminal act of passing a "sentence" ahead of
the continuation of a political dialogue, has shown that KLA urges
a "parallel" government, rather than autonomy in keeping with
international standards.
</P>
<P>
The conduct of the KLA towards Tanjug's two reporters, Nebojsa
Radosevic and Vladimir Dobricic, "is yet another proof that KLA
has no intention of giving up separatist aspirations for the
violent secession of Kosovo from Serbia and Yugoslavia," Matic
said.
</P>
<P>
The two journalists working for the Yugoslav news agency were
abducted on October 18 in Kosovo by the KLA and were sentenced
each to 60 days of jail last Sunday by a so called martial court
of the Albanian guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
"This confirms that the separatist-terrorist forces in Kosovo
are not in the least ready to use political means to overcome the
situation in Serbia's southern province," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KLA's political representative Adem Demaci said on
Tuesday the KLA would allow no one to visit the two Tanjug
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Pristina, provincial capital
of Kosovo, Demaci said not even officials of the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) had the
right to visit the two jailed reporters because of the situation
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"One should not ask too much and especially not to visit the
reporters because that is very complicated at this point," he
said, adding that even he himself had not been allowed to see them
either.
</P>
<P>
Demaci said he had been told that the two reporters had
received food and clothes sent by their families through the IFRC.

transitional body to prepare for fresh elections in the southern
African country within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Political Authority Bill, which was introduced
during a sitting of parliament Monday, was rushed through the
lower house Tuesday after a heated debate, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>

parties in Lesotho will be represented by two members each in the

<P>
OTTAWA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada Tuesday strongly
condemned Iraq's decision on October 31, 1998, to halt
co-operation with United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"Canada fully supports the U.N. Security Council's November 1
resolution denouncing this action as a 'flagrant violation' of
U.N. resolutions," said Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy in
a release. "We join the Council in calling upon Iraq to rescind
its decision immediately and unconditionally."
</P>
<P>
"Iraq must recognize that the only road to lifting sanctions is
through co-operation with UNSCOM and compliance with U.N.
resolutions," added the Foreign Minister.
</P>
<P>
Canada stands behind UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) and values the commitment and dedication of their
inspectors in carrying out a difficult task. UNSCOM's role is
central to ensuring that Iraq complies with its disarmament
obligations.
</P>
<P>
Once Iraq resumes its full co-operation with UNSCOM and the
IAEA, the U.N. remains ready to implement a comprehensive review
of Iraq's compliance with relevant U.N. resolutions, said the
release.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Kurdish Rival Leaders to Meet in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Kurdish Democratic Party
(KDP) leader Massoud Barzani said here Tuesday that he and his
rival Iraq's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Jalal
Talabani will meet in Ankara to discuss the Kurdish issue in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Barzani, an ally of Turkey in northern Iraq against the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), made the remarks upon his
arrival at Ankara Esenboga Airport.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Talabani will be in Ankara, probably on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Talabani will be with me soon. U.S. and British officials will
also participate in the talks in Ankara to discuss the Washington
Accord and the Ankara peace process," Barzani added.
</P>
<P>
The two rival Kurdish groups signed the Washington Accord in
the U.S. in September to ease the tensions between them with the
mediation of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Barzani said during his visit to Turkey, he will also hold
talks with high-ranking Turkish officials on the latest
developments, his group's relations with Turkey and the Washington
Accord.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was annoyed by the accord which it feels may open the
door to the establishment of an independent Kurdish state in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Barzani pointed out that "I will paint an accurate picture of
the Washington Accord in my talks with the Turkish officials."
</P>
<P>
In March, Talabani sent a letter to Barzani seeking a broad
reconciliation in a bid to set up a permanent peace in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Talabani proposed a high-level meeting between
the two factions to sort out their differences.
</P>
<P>
The two rival groups have fought for control of northern Iraq
after the 1991 Gulf War undermined Baghdad's ability to exert
influence there.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Says Refugees Disaster in Kosovo Averted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The humanitarian disaster in
Kosovo had been averted and that the situation was much better
than two months ago, a U.S. official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State in charge of population, refugees and migrations Julia Taft
at a press conference in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said
about 250,000 people were driven out of their homes during the
seven-month conflict between Serb forces and the ethnic Albanian
guerrillas that ended last month.
</P>
<P>
Most refugees have come back to their villages and towns after
the Serb troops pulled out of Kosovo in late October.
</P>
<P>
Taft said that Serbs were still holding about 800 ethnic
Albanians in prison, and 121 Serbs had also been kidnapped by the
ethnic Albanians so far. She urged both sides to free these
detained innocent people.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there were any information about the fate of
Serbs, including two Tanjug reporters, kidnapped by ethnic
Albanian radical guerrilla groups, Taft said that there were no
good news for the time being but she would continue to be engaged
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Taft quoted well-known figures about U.S. humanitarian
assistance to Kosovo and the locations and numbers of displaced
ethnic Albanians, but said that she did not have exact information
about displaced Serbs from Kosovo, though she had heard that they
existed.
</P>
<P>
Taft also said that additional funds had been secured for
assistance to refugees from Krajina in Croatia and Bosnia who fled
their homes to Yugoslavia during the Bosnian war from 1992 to
1995.
