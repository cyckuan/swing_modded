<HEADLINE> Study Suggests Monkeys Have Ability to Think </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A study by U.S. scientists
shows that monkey can be taught to count at least to the number
nine, according to a report in the latest issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
This study challenges a longstanding view among many scientists
that humans are unique in their ability to grasp the concepts of
number, numerical order and basic arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Brannon and Herbert Terrace, two psychologists at the
University of Columbia said their study shows the monkeys can
arrange things in serial order.
</P>
<P>
Their repeated experiments show that pressing at panels on a
computer screen, the two monkeys, Rosencrantz and MacDuff, have
shown they can touch in correct numerical order, displays
containing one to nine objects.
</P>
<P>
Experts said exploring how animals think is important because
it promises to shed light on the abilities from which the human
mind evolved.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Visit Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said on Saturday that relations between Russia and Austria are
free of problems, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Austrian newspaper Neue
Kronen-Zeitung on the eve of his visit to Austria, Yeltsin said
political contacts between the two countries have revived over
the past few years, as have inter-parliamentary and regional ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that considerable potential exists for cooperation and
development in finance, economics, science and technology, and
culture between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The documents to be signed in Vienna during the visit will
contribute to realizing this potential," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Austria's membership in NATO would hinder
bilateral ties, Yeltsin emphasized that Russia rejects in
principle the military bloc approach to constructing European
security.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that NATO expansion is a "serious mistake, the
negative consequences of which, unfortunately, is already evident
and will continue to surface."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said Austria's example confirms the ability of a
neutral state to be a full-scale member of the European security
system, and its ability to make an efficient contribution to
maintaining peace and mutual understanding in Europe and
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
On nuclear arms, the president said that Russia considers the
Treaty for Non-proliferation of Nuclear Arms as the basis for the
existing non-proliferation regime.
</P>
<P>
He noted that despite the current financial situation, Russia
"is managing to find the necessary resources for maintaining the
appropriate level of security at nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic crisis, Yeltsin is "absolutely sure" that
Russia is capable of surmounting the current crisis through
democratic means.
</P>
<P>
"We will abandon neither reforms aimed at constructing a
socially oriented market economy, nor further democratization of
society," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Russia does however have to correct its economic policy
somewhat, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped European countries would "encourage the arrival
of foreign investments (in Russia), seriously and for a long
time."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Europe could extend its support by influencing the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to disburse
previously agreed funds, Yeltsin added.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Crisis Should Be Justly Settled: French Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 24 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard stressed on Saturday that the Kosovo crisis should be
settled in an impartial way to guarantee the interest of all
residents there.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who is on a visit here, also reaffirmed that it
is necessary for NATO to continue imposing its military pressure
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Richard made the remarks to the press following his meeting
with his Romanian counterpart Victor Babiuc.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo crisis is a big problem of all Europe that can not
be solved without the participation of the United States and
Russia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Richard also appreciated Romania's stand in the Kosovo issue,
praising the country a stable power in Southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that France would support Romania in its efforts
to join the NATO.
</P>
<P>
Babiuc pointed out that Romania has been paying close attention
to the developments in Kosovo, which is neighbor to his
country. Romania will send its observers and dispatch a plane for
an air inspection task to Kosovo, he added.
</P>
<P>
Richard arrived here Friday for a two-day visit. On his visit
here, he met with Babiuc for the issues of bilateral relations,
NATO expansion and the Kosovo situation. The two also agreed to
promote military exchanges between their countries and reached a
bilateral military cooperation accord.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Ministry issued
on Saturday a statement hailing the signature of the
Palestinian-Israeli agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency cited the statement as saying, the
agreement signed in the United States specifies the obligations of
the Palestinian Authorities and the Israeli government, including
redeployment of Israeli troops from the occupied palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ministry noted that besides implementing all
aspects and details of the agreement by the sides, they should
start discussing critical issues concerning further redeployment
of Israeli troops and especially the final status of palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "Russia as a cosponsor of the Middle
East peace process has taken energetic efforts to create
conditions for bridging the gap in the positions of the sides."
</P>
<P>
Moscow hopes that having overcome the barrier of mistrust and
reached understanding on such sensitive components of relations,
the Palestinian and Israeli sides will show a constructive approach
and goodwill in practical implementation of measures and
continuation of constructive dialogue, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Russia will continue to render the most active assistance
in order to further the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue and
cooperation on the basis of principles and obligations confirmed
by the sides, the Russian ministry stated.

Under the agreement, Israel is to pull its forces out of 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian security
measures against violent extremists.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal would also pave the way to "final status" talks
which involve the even more contentious issues of fixing borders
and the status of Jerusalem and of the Palestinian self-rule area.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Rebel Leader Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The High Court in Sierra Leone
has sentenced rebel leader Fodeh Sankoh to death for his role in
the May 1997 coup that overthrew elected President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
A report by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) said
the judge sentenced Sankoh to hang after a jury found him guilty
on seven counts of treason.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh has been leading a rebellion against successive
governments in Nigeria since early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said the death sentence is not for
rebellion - a line was supposed to have been drawn under that in
a peace agreement signed two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The treason verdict was for his role in the coup last year and
the period of military rule under Major Johhny Paul Koroma who
emerged after the coup.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was actually under house arrest in Nigeria before the
coup, and was extradited to Sierra Leone for trial only after the
Koroma junta was toppled by the west African intervention force
ECOMOG in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
But according to the BBC report, he still had access to the
phone during the detention, and immediately after the coup, he
gave an interview, broadcast on the BBC, in which he called on
his followers to come out of bush and join the coup makers.
</P>
<P>
Even now, his men are still fighting along with the Koroma men
against the ECOMOG in the mountainous areas in east Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was the 62nd person to be sentenced to death in
connection with the coup. Before him was 27 civilians and 34
members of the armed forces, of whom 24 have been executed and 10
had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh has the right to appeal but the chances of a reprieve
look slim, the report said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, EU Agree to Go on With Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and the
European Union (EU) have agreed on how to go forward in the trade
talks and the negotiating teams would meet again in mid-November,
</P>
<P>
This was announced after a meeting Saturday between South
African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin and EU
commissioner Joan Deus Pinheiro to assess and discuss progress in
free trade negotiations between the two sides, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Erwin commended the negotiating teams but said: "There comes a
moment when politicians must take their responsibility and
identify a way forward to achieve the objectives."
</P>
<P>
Pinheiro said both he and Erwin were moving along a tightrope
with little maneuvering room to achieve a compromise. The talks
were at a very difficult stage, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, they were aiming to comply with the imposed
time-frame for finalizing an agreement in November.
</P>
<P>
Three days of trade talks, which ended last Friday, failed to
resolve an impasse over the EU's agricultural products tariff
reduction offer.
</P>
<P>
The talks stalled in Brussels last month on the EU's
insistence that the names "port" and "sherry" (both are the names
for wine) no longer be used by South African producers, who said
they had been using the names for hundreds of years.

<HEADLINE> UK Says Government Can't Intervene in Pinochet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain said Saturday that its
government can not intervene in the case on former Chilean
president Augusto Pinochet, saying it was "neither proper nor
possible".
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook held talks with Chile's Deputy
Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez in London Saturday after Chile
formally requested the release of 82-year-old Pinochet, who was
under arrest for alleged involvement in genocide and torture.
</P>
<P>
Chile has insisted that Pinochet, now a lifelong senator in
Chile, has diplomatic immunity from arrest and that Chile has sole
jurisdiction to judge crimes that took place on its soil.
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office spokeswoman was quoted by Reuters as
saying that Cook had given Fernandez a full hearing and had
explained the importance of following the due legal process.
</P>
<P>
"He (Cook) said it was neither proper nor possible (for the
government) to intervene," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday, lawyers for Pinochet launched a legal challenge
to Pinochet's arrest in a bid to free him and two High Court
judges adjourned until Monday the hearing of the challenge to the
warrant under which Pinochet was arrest.

CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
will arrive here Saturday evening to brief Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak about the latest Palestinian-Israeli summit in the
U.S. and the resulting West Bank accord.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Mubarak talks will be held on Sunday Morning, an
official source told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador to Cairo Zohdy al Aidra told Egypt's
Middle East News Agency that Arafat is keen on making Cairo the
first stop in the Arab world to explain the agreement in view of
the Egyptian-Palestinian relations with a special nature.
</P>
<P>
Arafat appreciates the key and basic role Egypt plays in the
Middle East peace process, al Aidra said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader frequently visits Cairo to inform
Mubarak about the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and coordinate
stances on the issue.
</P>
<P>
After the nine-day tough negotiations mediated by
U.S. President Bill Clinton, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu signed Friday the agreement on Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will pull back troops from an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank and free hundreds of jailed
Palestinians. The Palestinians will step up efforts to crack down
on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will set up a joint committee to discuss a third
Israeli troop withdrawal. A Palestinian airport in Gaza and a safe
passage for Palestinians moving between Gaza and other Palestinian
areas will be opened.

<HEADLINE> UAE Press Cautious Over Palestinian-Israeli Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU-DHABI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Newspapers of the United Arab
Emirates Saturday appeared to be cautious over the Israeli sides'
commitment to the West Bank redeployment agreement signed Friday
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In its commentary, the official daily Al-Ittihad said that the
Palestinian side has a great deal of concern over Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's commitment to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, the daily expressed its belief that Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat is able to put Israel in front of a new
choice.
</P>
<P>
The coming days will be the start of a new stage for the peace
process and the Palestinian-Israeli relations, it said.
</P>
<P>
Concluding its commentary, the paper said that the United
States should shoulder its responsibility towards the
implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Al-Bayan in Dubai said that the deal raises
many questions as it does not satisfy the legitimate rights of the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The deal provides for the release of 750 out of thousands of
Palestinian detainees so it falls short of meeting the
Palestinians' demand for the release of all Palestinian detainees,
thus showing the imbalance of power between the two sides, the
paper added.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Khaleej daily of Al-Sharija city said the deal is a
framework reference worked out by Netanyahu to secure his security
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
After nine-day tough negotiations mediated by U.S. President
Bill Clinton, Arafat and Netanyahu signed Friday the agreement on
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will pull back troops from an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank and free Palestinian
prisoners. The Palestinians will step up efforts to crack down on
Islamic militants.
</P>

Israeli troop withdrawal. A Palestinian airport in Gaza and a safe
passage for Palestinians moving between Gaza and other Palestinian
areas will be opened.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Flooding Hits Ghanaian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Persistent downpour has killed
three people and caused wide-spread damage to property in most
parts of Ghana's capital Accra, the Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"At least three people have died and there is massive damage
to property which we cannot immediately quantify," GNA quoted
Police Inspector Noble Banini as saying after a tour of the city
early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Two men were killed at Kaneshie, a commercial suburb of Accra
and the other was swept off his feet into the Odaw Stream which
runs through the city.
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off roads leading to low-lying areas in order to
avert further trouble.
</P>
<P>
Major roads within the city were flooded while houses were
submerged as overflowing drains and connecting bridges caved in,
bringing general vehicular traffic to a standstill Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Meteorological Services said the downpour,
the heaviest since July 1995, signifies the normalization of
Ghana's rainfall pattern after the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
"It's a complete replacement of the El Nino phenomenon by El
Nino which is characterized by sea surface temperature becoming
colder than normal," GNA quoted Principal Meteorologist Ato
Wilson as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that average rainfall projections for the month of
October for Accra was 64.2 millimeters but the rainfall for
Friday and Saturday alone recorded 196.2mm.
</P>
<P>
At least 21 people died throughout Accra when heavy rains
flooded streets and homes in low-lying areas in July 1995. It
was considered the heaviest at the time in 20 years, GNA said.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Pilot to Be Withdrawn From Iraq for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official said on
Saturday that the U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq
(UNSCOM) has decided to withdraw a Chilean pilot working for the
commission on charge of espionage.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Nils Carlstrom, director of the U.N. Baghdad
Monitoring and Verification Center, said that the decision to
withdraw the Chilean pilot Julio Menose was made after UNSCOM
discussed the matter with the Chilean authorities.
</P>
<P>
Carlstrom said the Chilean pilot would leave Iraq on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate
Hussam Mohammed Ameen alleged on Wednesday that the Chilean pilot
tried to shoot pictures from his helicopter to an Iraqi missile
testing field on October 20.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been accusing some U.N. arms inspectors of spying on
Iraq's important military installations.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Carlstrom confirmed that an American weapons
inspector with UNSCOM had been recalled by the commission on
charge of espionage in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Carlstrom said the American inspector, whose name he did not
mention, shot pictures of an Iraqi missile site with his own
camera on October 8, an act that violates the rules of UNSCOM,
adding that the American inspector had been withdrawn on October
12.
</P>
<P>
Ameen on Wednesday also affirmed that such acts of
espionage had been repeated by the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Ameen referred to the case of the American inspector Scott
Ritter, who he said had frankly admitted through the
international TV channels of spying in the interests of the
American and Israeli intelligence and delivering to them
information concerning Iraq's security and its sensitive sites.
</P>
<P>
Ritter, who was in the center of several weapons inspection
crisis between UNSCOM and Iraq, resigned in August as an
important U.N. weapons inspector, criticizing the U.S. government
and UNSCOM for not taking a tough stance toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, Iraq decided to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), complaining
that they are dominated by the U.S. and adopt procrastination
policy regarding their disarmament mission in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
So far, Iraq has not announced its revocation of the August 5
decision, though it is widely expected that Baghdad will resume
cooperation with UNSCOM and IAEA.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. economic sanctions imposed on Iraq since 1990
following its invasion of Kuwait will not be lifted unless
U.N. weapons inspectors verify that it is free of weapons of mass
destruction.

<P>
JERUSALEM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A number of Palestinian
political parties and cabinet ministers Saturday expressed their
support to the Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement signed in
Washington on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Fatah Movement, the mainstream faction of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, said in a statement that it fully
supports President Yasser Arafat and his signing of the peace
agreement with Israel as well as all political steps taken by the
Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Liberation Front expressed its appreciation for
the Palestinian negotiating team and Arafat's firm commitments to
the right of the Palestinian people showed during the peace talks
in the United States, the Voice of Palestine radio said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several cabinet ministers of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) also expressed their welcome to the
agreement on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Hikmat Zeid said that the agreement
reached at the Wye Plantation outside Washington is a Palestinian
achievement towards an independent Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Amr, minister of parliamentary affairs stressed the
importance of the implementation of the agreement, saying that
this agreement will be fully implemented because the United
States is included in overseeing its implementation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed at the White House by Arafat, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Bill Clinton
after nine days of intensive negotiations.
</P>

The agreement stipulates the scope of Israel's troop
redeployment in the West Bank and measures for
Israeli-Palestinian security cooperations.

<HEADLINE> Botswana, Zimbabwe Differed on Repatriation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and Botswana are said
to be haggling over how to identify and repatriate the bodies of 18
people who suffocated in an unventilated container truck in Botswana,
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Home Affairs Minister, Dumiso Dabengwa, confirmed on
Saturday that police in the two countries were deadlocked over how the
bodies should be repatriated to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The 18 people, suspected to be Zimbabweans, were found dead on
Wednesday in Botswana's Tlokweng village, 20 kilometers from the
capital of Gaborone. They were dumped by the container truck driver
after he realized they had suffocated.
</P>
<P>
The people were allegedly trying to enter South Africa illegally.
Two others survived.
</P>
<P>
Botswana police insisted that relatives of the dead people be taken
to Gaborone to identify the bodies before the bodies be taken to
Zimbabwe for burial.
</P>
<P>
One Zimbabwean officer hinted that Botswana authorities wanted to
avoid an international wrangle caused by releasing bodies of
non-Zimbabweans because border jumping involved people from almost all
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries.
</P>
<P>
"There are people who have no identification on them and they may
not necessarily be Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
"In border jumping, there are also people who steal other people's
identification particulars and it is only after positive
identification from relatives that we can be sure of their
identities," said the officer, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean authorities cited the same argument to justify their
demand that the bodies be repatriated to Zimbabwe immediately so
relatives could made positive identifications.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabweans argued that while relatives of the 18 people found
with passports on them were notified, the bodies in Botswana might not
necessarily be those of the owners of the passports.
</P>
<P>
There were also eight people whose bodies were found without
identity particulars and Zimbabwean authorities argued that it would
be unreasonable to ask anybody who suspected that their relatives were
among the dead to travel to Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Dabengwa said it would also be costly for the people to travel to
Botswana.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Cautiously Welcomes West Bank Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Saturday expressed cautious welcome to a West Bank accord signed
between the Palestinians and Israelis, stressing faithful
implementation, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Since the Palestinians have accepted the Wye Plantation
agreement, we welcome this because it is their own affair,"
Mubarak told a meeting at Egypt's Third Field Army headquarters in
Suez, a town 125 kilometers east of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president stressed that the agreement should be
faithfully carried out, saying "we have to wait and follow up what
takes place as regards the implementation of the agreement."
</P>
<P>
After nine-day tough negotiations in the Wye Plantation,
Maryland, the United States, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Friday signed the deal
on Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Israel will withdraw from 13 percent of the
West Bank and free hundreds of jailed Palestinians in exchange of
Palestinians' tougher crackdown on Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to form a joint committee to discuss
a third phase of Israeli withdrawal and open a Palestinian airport
in Gaza and a safe passage for Palestinians moving between Gaza
and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports that Egypt has promised to set free the
Israeli spy Azam Azam who is serving a sentence of 15-year
imprisonment in Egypt, Mubarak said "Egypt has not given any
promise to release him and the reports in this respect are without
substance."
</P>
<P>
"We did not accept pressure from anyone," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported Friday that Egypt has agreed to release
Azam, who was jailed last year, as part of the West Bank
agreement.

<HEADLINE> World Nations Urged to Find Solutions to Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Defense Minister
Moven Mabachi Saturday urged world nations to harness their
resources and experience in order to find solutions to common
challenges facing the new world order.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the call here at the commemoration of the
50th anniversary of United Nations peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we share common borders and are interdependent
in our interaction and relationships on the global village,
mandates us to understand and cooperate with each other more
effectively," said Mabachi.
</P>
<P>
He called for cooperation among world nations in their efforts
to eliminate areas of potential conflicts as the world has become
volatile and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
However, Mabachi noted that the celebrations took place
against a background of hostilities and conflicts which had
ravaged some countries and left a trail of destruction of
economic and social fabric of societies.
</P>
<P>
"These conflicts remain the most pressing of all challenges
facing humanity today as they cast a dark shadow over the
prospects of a united, secure and prosperous world which we seek
to create, " said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, he said, would continue to support the cause for
regional and international peace in recognitio of its
importance to the realization of hopes for unimpeded and
sustainable socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same occasion, U.N. Information Center
Director in Harare, Cesiwe Khonje, said that the decision by the
Zimbabwean government to commemorate the anniversary was
testimony of its commitment to the world peace and its
obligations under the U.N. charter.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Says Justice Outweighs Privilege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The needs of the criminal
justice system outweigh a president's right to keep secret
information shared with aides, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The needs of the criminal justice system are paramount, and
they should carry the day," The Associated Press quoted Starr as
telling a legal forum at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
Starr joined other legal experts in dissecting United States
vs. Richard Nixon, the 1974 Supreme Court ruling that curbed
claims of executive privilege and forced President Nixon to
release the tapes that led to his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Starr has challenged President Bill Clinton's claims of
executive privilege and cited the Nixon case in his report to
Congress, but did not mention the Clinton case directly Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The president continues to use executive privilege claims to
shield White House lawyers from answering certain questions about
the Monica Lewinsky matter. Clinton claims the executive privilege
doctrine entitles him to discuss matters freely with his aides
without fear that the information will be released to the public.
</P>
<P>
A federal district court has already ruled against the White
House on the question, but the president has renewed the claims on
behalf of some of his aides.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Faction Opposes West Bank Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian faction opposing
the peace process with Israel has decried as "a bitter fruit" for
Palestinians the new Palestinian-Israeli deal signed in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus-based the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine (DFLP) said in a statement, a copy of which was obtained
by Xinhua, that it condemns the deal as a security document in
favour of Israel rather than the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The DFLP is considered the third largest group in the
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). Founded in 1969, it
joined other nine Palestinian groups in opposing the Oslo
agreement the Yasser Arafat-led PLO mainstream signed with Israel
in 1993 and has boycotted PLO activities ever since.
</P>
<P>
The many concessions offered by the Palestinian National
Authority will further fuel the tension inside the Palestinian
territories and the Middle East as a whole, the DFLP said.
</P>
<P>
The deal was "a bitter fruit" in the series of concessions
under the conditions of the occupation.
</P>
<P>
"It is a dictation from the powerful to the weak with a
flagrant U.S. bias to the aggressive expansionist Israeli policy,"
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed at the White House by Arafat, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Bill Clinton
after nine days of intensive negotiations.
</P>

The agreement stipulates the scope of Israel's troop
redeployment in the West Bank and measures for
Israeli-Palestinian security cooperations.

DAR ES SALAAM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A Dar es Salaam woman
has lost one million Shillings (about 1,490 U.S. Dollars) after
being attacked by a taxi driver she hired.
</P>
<P>
Babra Kobelskar, 36, showed reporters Saturday at the
Muhimbili orthopaedic Institute (MOI) that she sustained deep cut
on her head which got eight stitches.
</P>
<P>
The woman, a sales and marketing officer of a South African
building materials company, said she was attacked on Friday
evening after collecting one million shillings from a customer.
</P>
<P>
After completing the deal she hired a taxi. On the way to her
home in the Mtoni Kwa Azizi area, the driver switched off the car
engine alleging that its patrol tank was empty.
</P>
<P>
"The taxi driver then suggested me get out of the taxi to
change another one while he is going to go to a patrol station to
get patrol," Kobelskar recalled.
</P>
<P>
Then she walked away but felt a heavy object suddenly hit her
head, she said. The woman shouted for help and then fell down
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
"I gained consciousness this morning and found by handbag
which contained one million Shillings have gone," she said. "But
the police told me that my gold jewels are still safe."

With such confidence, the Middle East peace process can be

Moussa arrived here earlier in the day on a two-day official

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. NASA launched a
spacecraft named Deep Space 1 Saturday at Cape Canaveral,
Florida.
</P>
<P>
Aboard an unmanned rocket, the spacecraft will travel 450
million miles before meeting with an asteroid 1992 KD 120 million
miles away next July.
</P>
<P>
This launching symbolizes the starting point of NASA's New
Millennium program of "high risk, high payoff" technology missions
that NASA hopes will lead to frequent, affordable trips into
space, NASA officials said.
</P>
<P>
A solar-powered engine will provide the extra kick needed for
the winged, drum-shaped spacecraft, which weighs just over 1000
pounds, to rendezvous with the asteroid next July.
</P>
<P>
If without the ion engine, Deep Space 1 would need 10 times
more fuel to reach the asteroid. As it is, the spacecraft carries
a scant 180 pounds of xenon gas to run the engine, thus reducing
the size of the probe and the cost of the 152 million U.S. Dollars
mission.
</P>
<P>
With a self-navigating system, the space probe will meet within
a distance of 6 miles with the asteroid.
</P>
<P>
It is reportedly that Deep Space 2 is scheduled to fly in
January.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Criticizes Greek Military Exercise in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said on Saturday that an
on-going Greek Cypriot military exercise jointly held with Greek
troops serves to increase tension on the divided island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Foreign Ministry described the war game as
an "irresponsible act," adding it shows the Greek Cypriots and
Greek are insincere to U.N. efforts to built trust on the island.
</P>
<P>
The military exercise comes at a time when the United Nations
is trying to revive dialog between the two rival Cypriot
communities through proximity talks, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
following a coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greek and Greek Cypriots have been holding live-fire military
exercise, code-named Nikiforos-Toksitis, since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the exercise was designed to stage mock
attacks against the "Turkish side" and will hurt regional security.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that "Turkey is taking all measures against
military preparations which pose a direct threat to its territory
and northern Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over the limits of air space,
sovereignty over some Aegean islands and the Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> German Greens OKs Coalition Government with SPD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A party convention of Germany's
ecologist Greens Saturday overwhelmingly approved a final
agreement on forming a center-left coalition government with
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democratic Party
(SPD).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the party convention attended by some 750
delegates, Greens leader Joschka Fischer described the approval as
the most important decision made in the party's history.
</P>
<P>
The coalition accord, which was negotiated by SPD and Greens
leaders over the past two weeks, lays down the blueprint and
structure for the first new government in Bonn after 16 years of
conservative rule under Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
It would enter the Greens into the federal government for the
first time in Germany's post-war history and would award it with
three cabinet posts, with Fischer to take the key one as foreign
minister and vice-chancellor.
</P>
<P>
The endorsement of the coalition deal allowed Greens leaders to
claim victory for not only bringing the party into the federal
government, but also onto a more pragmatic path as a more
disciplined governing party.
</P>
<P>
For years, the Greens, which arose out of the environmental and
pacifist movements of the 1970s, has been plagued by a split
between the so-called "Fundis" and "Realos", the committed
pacifists and the pragmatists.
</P>
<P>
Despite great controversies, left-wingers of the Greens pushed
through a series of radical demands at a party congress just half
a year ago, calling for tripling gasolene prices, a heavy cut in
German military spendings, rejection of the NATO eastward
expansion and a total shutdown of the country's nuclear power
plants.
</P>
<P>
These positions were either dropped or watered down by Greens
leaders during their coalition negotiations with the SPD as it
became clear that they would pose great obstacles to such an
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the failure to asserting those demands was still
criticized by many delegates speaking at the party convention on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Juergen Trittin, another Greens leader who will be environment
minister in the new government, admitted that there had been
"bitter disappointments" for his party in talks with the SPD, but
he also hailed as a Greens victory the inclusion of those elements
in the coalition deal, including the liberalization of German
citizenship law.
</P>
<P>
"This is a compromise, but a workable compromise," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Fischer also said the decision made by the party convention
indicated that the Greens was now ready to take responsibility as
a governing party.
</P>
<P>
If the coalition agreement was approved by a SPD party
convention on Sunday, which is virtually certain, Schroeder will
be formally elected chancellor by the new parliament on October 27
and the new government will take office soon afterwards.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security

<HEADLINE> Tunisia Satisfied With Detente Between Syria, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Tunisia Saturday expressed its
satisfaction with the detente of the crisis between Syria and
Turkey and welcomed the security deal between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Tunisian Foreign Minister Saeed Bin Mustafa said in a statement
that the deal, reached through dialog, warded off the dangers of a
possible conflict that serves no interests of any party.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that the Tunisian government always
calls for solving the disputes through peaceful means and non-use
of force in international relations.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Syria and Turkey were running high in the past
weeks after Ankara threatened to resort to military actions to
stop what it said Syria's support for Kurdish rebels fighting for
an independent state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
After two-day meetings between the two sides, they signed an
agreement last Tuesday, under which Damascus pledged to ban
Kurdish rebels' activities in its territory and the
Syrian-controlled Bekka Valley in Lebanon. Syria also agreed not
to allow Kurdish rebels to stage cross-border attacks on Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian government hopes that the two neighbors would
continue their efforts to reach a peaceful comprehensive
settlement of their differences on the basis of understanding and
reconciliation, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The deal is in line with common interests between the two
nations and serves solidarity and fraternity of the Islamic
countries as well as security and stability in the region, it
underlined.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Schedules Hearing on Impeachment History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A Judiciary subcommittee has
agreed to hold a hearing on the history of impeachment in early
November in an apparent effort to mollify the White House and
committee Democrats demanding that impeachment conduct be defined
before a formal inquiry can begin.
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee on the Constitution said in a notice sent to
all Judiciary members Friday that the hearing, originally
scheduled for October 22, would occur November 9, six days after
midterm elections, Judiciary Committee spokesman Paul McNulty
said, The Washington Post reported in its Saturday edition.
</P>
<P>
Committee Democrats have carried on a running argument with
Republicans for weeks over the need to determine what constitutes
an impeachment offense before proceeding to a formal inquiry
against President Bill Clinton for his conduct with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Republicans argued that the inquiry could proceed while
committee members made their own judgments about the
impeachmentability of the alleged offenses. Nevertheless,
Constitutional subcommittee Chairman Charles T. Canady, a
Republican, set October 22 for an informational hearing on the
history of impeachment, but it was later canceled.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the White House sent a letter to Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, a Republican, and the ranking
minority member John Conyers Jr.,urging the panel to convene a
hearing the week of November 9 to analyze what the Constitution
meant by "high crimes and misdemeanors."

<HEADLINE> G.Bissau Calls for Peacekeeping Force from ECOWAS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A Guinea Bissau minister has
asked for the deployment of a peacekeeping force from the
16-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a
report from Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Guinea Bissau Transport and Communications Minister
Joao Gomes Cardosa made the request Friday when he met with
Burkinese President Blaise Compaore in Ouagadougou.
</P>
<P>
Cardosa said an ECOWAS force will help implement the
cease-fire accord signed between his government and the
mutineers.
</P>
<P>
He rejected that his country had called for the withdrawal of
Senegalese and Guinean troops, saying that their presence is
related to defense and security agreements signed since 1975, the
Pan-African News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Cardosa accused the mutineers of not complying with the
cease-fire agreement signed on July 26 and having taken advantage
of it to occupy more territory when hostilities resumed a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
Senegal and Guinea sent troops to support Bissau's President
Joao Bernardo Vieira to quell the rebellion which broke out in
June when a section of the army mutinied following the dismissal
of army chief of staff General Ansumane Mane.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has led to the exodus of thousands of people of
the tiny west African country to neighboring countries,
especially Senegal.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Begins Formal Consultations on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Saturday afternoon began formal consultations on the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo after several hours of rare Saturday
consultations and tough closed-door discussions on a draft
resolution hammered out by such countries as Japan, the United
Kingdom and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The 15 Security Council members are scheduled to cast votes on
a revised draft which, according to some Western diplomats, had
substantially softened language about the threat of force to
implement the agreement between ethnic Albanians and Yugoslav and
Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
However, before the council kicked off formal consultations,
Hiro Ueki, U.N. spokesman, told Xinhua that "there is only
slight amendment" in the draft.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia, two of the five permanent council members
which have veto power, are opposed to any language threatening
Yugoslavia with force.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ranfeng, spokesman for the Chinese Mission to the United
Nations, told Xinhua that many of its concerns had been taken into
consideration in the latest draft, which was put to vote later
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A draft resolution tabled Friday night would have allowed NATO
to take "appropriate steps" to ensure the agreement is enforced.
It noted that "in the event of an emergency, action may be needed"
to ensure the safety of unarmed monitors.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's revised draft deleted reference to international
organizations taking "appropriate steps" and instead demanded
Yugoslavia implement the accord fully and promptly. The draft
still said that action may be needed to protect the monitors, but
referred to Yugoslavia's duty to ensure their safety under the
October 16 accord between Yugoslavia and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Vladislav Jovanovic,
charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations,
voiced his thanks for China to uphold justice at the United
Nations and its stance to oppose any interference in the internal
affairs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia over the issue of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo in February this year after
ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the province's
population of 2 million, have been battling with Serbs for
independence.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Interference in Yugoslavia's Internal  Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China is opposed to
using the Security Council Resolutions to pressure the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia or interfere in its internal affairs, a
senior Chinese diplomat said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, made the statement at the U.N. Security Council after the
council's voting on a draft resolution on Kosovo, which was
sponsored by such countries as Japan, Germany, France, the United
Kingdom and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"China welcomes the positive developments on the question of
Kosovo of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). We understand
the agreements on the question of Kosovo reached between FRY and
relevant parties and evaluate positively the efforts made by the
Government of FRY in alleviating the humanitarian situation in
Kosovo and pursuing a lasting peace and reconciliation in the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that the international community should try
to maintain and promote this momentum of solving the question of
Kosovo peacefully," said the Chinese envoy.
</P>
<P>
"However, very regrettably, almost simultaneously while the
above agreement was concluded, a regional organization concerned
made the decision to take military actions against FRY and
interfere in its internal affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"More disturbingly, such a decision was made unilaterally
without consulting the Security Council or seeking a Council
authorization," he said, "Such irresponsible act does not befit
the peaceful atmosphere surrounding the question of Kosovo and
will not help solve the issue."
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, it has violated the purposes, principles and
relevant provisions of the U.N. Charter, as well as international
law and widely acknowledged norms governing relationships between
the States," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a contempt and a challenge to the authority of the U.N.
and the Security Council, and has created an extremely dangerous
precedent in international relations," he said. "China is gravely
concerned about this."
</P>
<P>
To maintain the sovereignty and territorial integrity of FRY
conforms to the provisions and requirements of the U.N. Charter,
and is also a common commitment by the international community, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The question of Kosovo should be solved on this basis," he
said, "The implementation of the completed through full
consultation and cooperation with the FRY Serbian Government."
</P>
<P>
"In principle, China does not oppose the adoption of a
well-focused technical resolution by the Council to endorse the
agreements reached between FRY and relevant parties and to
encourage the peaceful approaches on the question of Kosovo," he
said, adding that "We believe that this is in line with the
understandings between FRY and relevant parties."
</P>
<P>
"However, we do not favor the inclusion in the resolution of
contents beyond the above agreements," he said, "We are even more
opposed to using Council Resolutions to pressure FRY or interfere
in its internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Delegation had put forward our amendments during
the Council's consultations, among which the request to delete
those elements authorizing use of force or threatening to use
force was accommodated," he said.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia on Saturday afternoon abstained from the
voting while 13 voted in favor.
</P>
<P>
"The resolution just adopted does not entail any authorization
of using force or threatening to use force against FRY, nor should
it be interpreted anyhow as authorizing the use of force or
threatening to use force against FRY," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, the resolution just adopted still contains
some elements beyond agreements reached between FRY and relevant
parties, as well as contents such as invoking Chapter VII of the
(U.N.) Charter and interference in the internal affairs of FRY,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Further explaining the Chinese stance on the just-adopted
resolution, Qin said, "To our deep regret, our amendments
concerning these questions were not accommodated. Therefore, the
Chinese Delegation abstained from voting on the resolution."

"It couldn't have been more supportive of them and of all

to Italian referee Pierluigi Collina as Ince left the field in
Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
The FA has also vowed to "get to the bottom of the matter" and
Ince is likely to suffer more punishment before the incident is
finally laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
England coach Glenn Hoddle has maintained a resolute silence
as the arguments have dragged on.
</P>
<P>
But Evans has leapt to the defense of the man he bought from
Inter Milan and he clearly feels that unless Ince starts to
receive some support from the men from Lancaster Gate, the
31-year-old may consider quitting the international arena for
good.
</P>
<P>
"This is going too far," Evans said.
</P>
<P>
"Paul is disappointed with the charge and he doesn't feel the
FA are on his side at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"If Glenn (Hoddle) thinks Paul is so important for England he
should back him, shouldn't he?"
</P>
<P>
Ince has 14 days to respond to the misconduct charge - and
Liverpool will be giving him their full support.
</P>
<P>
"We will look at the video and discuss the circumstances,"
Evans said.
</P>
<P>
"But the FA seem hell bent on punishing Paul twice.
</P>
<P>
"Now there are going to have to look at every sending off and,
because people aren't happy when they are sent off, they could
end up banning everyone in the world," he added.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Adopts New Resolution on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Saturday adopted a resolution on Kosovo, asking both
the Yugoslav authorities and the Kosovo Albanian leadership to
"comply fully and swiftly" with relevant U.N. resolutions, and
"cooperate fully with" the verification missions in and over
Serbia's province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia abstained from the voting on the resolution
while 13 other Security Council members voted in favor.
</P>
<P>
The resolution reaffirmed that "under the Charter of the United
Nations, primary responsibility for the maintenance of
international peace and security is conferred on the Security
Council."
</P>
<P>
The resolution condemned "all acts of violence by any party, as
well as terrorism in pursuit of political goals by any group or
individual, and all external support for such activities in
Kosovo, including the supply of arms and training for terrorist
activities in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
The resolution stressed "the need to ensure the safety and
security" of members of the Verification Mission in Kosovo and the
Air Verification Mission over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged countries and international organizations
to make available personnel to the Verification Mission in Kosovo,
organized by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council requested the U.N. Secretary-General,
"acting in consultation with the parties concerned," to report
regularly to the Security Council regarding the implementation of
this resolution.
</P>
<P>
After the vote, observers here said China has won a hard
struggle to uphold the authority of the United Nations and the
Security Council as the universally recognized bodies mainly
responsible for the peace and security in the world.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, told the Security Council after the voting that a
regional organization concerned, without consulting the Security
Council or seeking a Security Council authorization, unilaterally
decided to take military action against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Such irresponsible act does not befit the peaceful atmosphere
surrounding the question of Kosovo and will not help solve the
issue," he said, "Furthermore, it has violated the purposes,
principles and relevant provisions of the U.N. Charter, as well as
international law and widely acknowledged norms governing
relationships between States."
</P>
<P>
"It is a contempt and a challenge to the authority of the U.N.
and the Security Council, and has created an extremely dangerous
precedent in international relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
China's concerns were largely echoed by other Security Council
members, such as Brazil and Costa Rica, two non-permanent member
of the Security Council. Besides, Russia, a permanent member with
a veto power on the council, is opposed to any use of force
against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM in Iran to Express Appreciation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa arrived here Sunday afternoon to thank Iran for its
mediation in easing tension between Syria and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Sharaa said he was in Tehran to submit a
message from Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to his Iranian
counterpart Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
He did not disclose the content of the message, the official
news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the Syria's leadership is thankful for
mediation efforts made by Iran to ease its tension with Ankara,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi has visited Syria and
Turkey, persuading the two Muslim countries to solve their disputes
peacefully, after the neighbors run to the verge of military
confrontation over the issue of Turkish Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of harboring Turkish Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) rebels who have been fighting since 1984 for
autonomy for the Kurdish minority in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria, denying the charges, has repeatedly voiced its concern
and fear over Turkey's close military ties with Israel, with which
Arab states have territorial disputes, including Syria.
</P>
<P>
Turkey then threatened to wipe out the alleged Kurdish camps in
Syria by force if Damascus failed to drive the rebels out the
country.
</P>
<P>
Turkish warlike rhetoric aroused fear of a regional conflict
and Egypt and Iran have shuttled between the two hostile neighbors
in a bid to defuse the crisis.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Turkey and Syria signed an agreement Tuesday, under
which Damascus reassured Ankara that Syria will not support the
PKK.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa termed the current relations between Syria and Iran as
"strong and deep," saying that he will hold talks with Iranian
officials on various regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kharrazi, who greeted Sharaa at the airport, said
that Iran has always endeavored to reduce tension among Muslim and
regional countries through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Iran's mediation efforts to solve Damascus-Ankara dispute can
be seen in line with such a policy, he said, adding that "we were
not a mediator in the issue but rather we facilitated negotiations
between Syria and Ankara."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Iran will pursue its mediation until the two
sides reach a concrete solution to the problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese Army, who has always struggled in the season, failed
to grasp the last chance when it dropped to host Sichuan Quanxing
1-0 in Chengdu in the final and 26th round of the professional
league.
</P>
<P>
The army team gathered a total of 29 points with eight wins,
five draws and 13 losses. Guangzhou Apollo, who won only four
games this season, had been a sure squad to be relegated earlier.
</P>
<P>
Peng Xiaofang shattered Chinese Army's hope to stay in the
first division league by scoring the lone goal 10 minutes into
action.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guojiang, head coach of Chinese Army, said that the Army
team must adapt itself to soccer's professionalization-oriented
reform if it want to keep alive in the league.
</P>
<P>
"We must learn from the failure and step up reform," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The Apollo scored a precious but meaningless point after a 1-1
draw with the visiting Qingdao Hainiu. It finished bottom in the
14-team league by accumulating 20 points with a record of 4-8-14
in wins, draws and defeats.
</P>
<P>
In day's other matches, Shandong Luneng drew Wuhan Hongjinlong
1-0, Vanguards Huandao ousted Shenzhen Ping'an 2-0, Shenyang
Haishi tied Yanbian Aodong 0-0 and Beijing Guo'an beat Guangzhou
Songri 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Wanda, who had ensured its third league champion in
four years four rounds before, played a goalless draw with
Shanghai Shenhua on Thursday when it concluded the season.
</P>
<P>
Shenhua, the champion in the 1996 season, took second place
for the second successive year with 45 points and Guo'an finished
third with 43.

<HEADLINE> Russia Expects to Sign Package of Agreements With Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia hopes to reach over 10
bilateral economic agreements with Austria during the visit by
Russian President Boris Yeltsin to the country on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These agreements and relevant contracts will give Russia up to
600 million U.S. dollars in direct investments, create 10,000 new
jobs and get a chance to win a foothold on the West-European
market for Russia's Advanced high technologies, the Itar-Tass news
agency said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a senior Kremlin official as saying that
the signing of this large-scale package of contracts and
agreements "means for Russia a breakthrough at the European
direction of investment, trade and economic cooperation, most
important for the country."
</P>
<P>
The official emphasized the special importance "in the
conditions of the financial crisis in Russia and stagnation of
investment and economic cooperation between Russia and the West."
</P>
<P>
According the Interfax news agency, Yeltsin flies to Vienna for
talks with Austrian President Thomas Klestil and Chancellor Viktor
Kilima on a wide range of international and bilateral issues. A
Russia-European Union summit will be held within the framework of
the visit.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president will be accompanied by Deputy Prime
Minister Vladimir Bulgak, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadornov, Economic Minister Andrei Shapovalyants
and other senior officials.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trade Unions Facing Challenge (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A third of the 145,000 overseas-funded companies in China have
had trade unions and Chinese trade unions are facing more problems
in protecting the rights of workers in non-public firms, Tian
says. This is what they would never see under the planned economy.
</P>
<P>
He says that China is in urgent need of laws that give more
powerful backing to trade unions in solving labor-capital disputes.
</P>
<P>
Protecting workers' rights and creating a nice environment for
overseas investors should not be regarded as being in conflict
with each other, Tian points out, adding overseas investors who
really want to develop business in China will never be scared away
by trade unions.
</P>
<P>
The experience of Zhu Rongyong, chairman of the trade union at
the Holiday Hotel in Chongqing, illustrates Tian's idea. Zhu says
that when the trade union was first set up in the hotel, the foreign
management was worried that there would be an interminable war
over increasing salaries and reducing working hours.
</P>
<P>
But the employers soon learned that the union was taking care
of employees's benefits in order to improve cohesion and promote
the healthy growth of the hotel, Zhu explains, and the hotel has
been awarded the Prize of Good Service for three years in a row by
Holiday Hotel Group, out of the organization's 2,600 hotels in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has started a
nationwide campaign with trade unions in overseas-funded
enterprises to encourage workers to make a greater contribution to
their companies while getting overseas management to keep workers'
interests in mind.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating labor and management is a never-ending topic in
overseas-funded enterprises, says Liu Qiurong, chairman of the
Shenzhen Trade Union Council, and Chinese trade unions need to
function as a bridge between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trade Unions Facing Challenges (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of disputes between
employees and employers has been increasing in China in recent
years, as a result of growth in overseas-funded and private
enterprises, according to Tian Yukun, director of the
Foreign-Funded Enterprises Office at the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
The disputes are usually related to payments, too long working
hours, a lack of safety measures, insults to workers' dignity and
physical abuse, Tian said, and these disputes sometimes lead to
strikes especially in companies without trade unions.
</P>
<P>
One such event at a foreign-funded shoe factory in Guangdong
Province, south China, is still fresh in the mind of Chen
Weiguang, chairman of the Guangzhou City Trade Union Council. "I
knew the situation was tense when I arrived there and saw angry
workers standing on the stairs of the factory building," Chen
recalls. "All the 1,200 workers in the factory had joined the
strike to protest their Taiwanese boss' not paying them enough."
</P>
<P>
The dispute, however, was soon settled through negotiations
between the factory owner and the district trade union, and the
owner agreed to raise wages for workers.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in favor of striking, but the rights of workers
should be protected," Tian says, and trade unions can be a great
help in conveying workers' suggestions to management and smoothing
conflicts between them, thus promoting development of
enterprises.

International Trade of Japan Yoshio Nakata praised the fair for
providing information for foreign companies about investment in
China.
</P>
<P>
The fair is the oldest in China and held twice a year, in
spring and autumn. Every time the fair exhibits around 100,000
Chinese goods and has more than 60,000 participants from some 160
countries who get a chance to look at China's and the world's
market. Therefore, the function of the information center has been
placed at the top of the agenda this time.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Starts Preparing for Hosting 13th NAM Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The preparation for hosting the
13th summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in Bangladesh in
2001 formally began Sunday with the holding of the first meeting
of the National Preparatory Committee (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The 16-member inter-ministerial NPC, headed by Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina, will take all preparations for the biggest ever
diplomatic event in this South Asian country, the official BSS
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed several aspects of the preparations for
the summit including accommodations for delegates and building of
a big conference center.
</P>
<P>
The committee estimated that about 4,000 hotel rooms would be
needed for the summit, Foreign Secretary Mustafizur Rahman was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are about 1,000 first class rooms in Dhaka
and it is hoped that by the year 2001, 2,500 hotel rooms would be
added when several hotel development projects were completed, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Works has been entrusted with the task of
building a convention center with the capacity of accommodating
5,000 people, Rahman said. Besides, the Commerce and Industries
Ministry has also been asked to speed up the building of a
convention center for the world trade center which could be used
during the summit.
</P>
<P>
The NPC meeting also discussed building of fly-overs,
construction of roads, improvement of the traffic system and
beautification of the capital to turn it into an international
city worthy of holding such a big convention.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said that 750 million taka (15.5 million U.S. dollars)
has been earmarked as government expenditure for the summit and
expenditure on road development, beautification and other works
will be met by the municipal corporation and funds from annual
development program.
</P>
<P>
The government does not to buy vehicles, rather it would go for
hiring to save money, Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
The summit is likely to be held in the second half of 2001, and
Bangladesh expects that there would be 4,000 delegates to the
summit, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was elected chairman
for the next summit to be held in Dhaka at the 12th NAM summit
held last month in Durban, South Africa. Hasina did not attend the
summit owing to the devastating floods in the country. Foreign
Minister Abdus Samad Azad attended the summit instead.

<HEADLINE>   NBA, Union Officials Meet with No Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A small group of NBA and
players' union officials met for three hours Saturday without
making progress toward resolving their labor dispute, spokesmen
for both sides said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, union chief Billy Hunter and NBA deputy commissioner
Russ Granik were scheduled to speak by telephone again Monday,
the spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
That is the eve of a two-day NBA owners' meeting at which
Hunter is seeking to set up a bargaining session with owners and
any player who want to attend.
</P>
<P>
The NBA and the union agreed to a news blackout on details of
the meeting at a midtown Manhattan hotel. In additional to
Hunter, union president Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks and
Jeffrey Kessler, chief outside counsel, represented the players'
association Commissioner David Stern; Joel Litvin, the league's
general counsel; and Stephen Mills, vice president for basketball
development, joined Granik.
</P>
<P>
The union, at a meeting with players in Las Vegas on Thursday,
vowed to sit out the season if the owners insist on creating an
inflexible ceiling on team payrolls, or a hard salary cap, as
they have proposed in various forms.
</P>
<P>
The owners locked out the players on July 1 and two weeks ago
canceled the first two weeks of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting this week, team owners will decide whether to
cancel additional games. Granik has said the league would cancel
games in two-week increments; it will take approximately a month
after a deal is struck to sign free agents and hold abbreviated
training camps.
</P>
<P>
That means games are unlikely to begin before December even if
a deal is struck by next week.
</P>
<P>
In other developments, the union has put two local agents,
David Falk of FAME and Jeff Austin of Advantage International, in
charge of setting up televised exhibition games as a way to
produce funds for financially strapped players if the lockout be
comes protracted.

<HEADLINE> French Defense Minister in Kuwait for Short Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 25 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister
Alain Richard arrived here Sunday for a short visit aimed at
enhancing military cooperation between the two countries, the
Kuwait News Agency (Kuna) reported.
</P>
<P>
Richard paid his visit, which might be as short as several
hours, at the invitation of Kuwait's Deputy Prime Minister and
Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Kuna on Saturday, Sheikh Salem said that he
would hold talks with Richard on boosting military cooperation
between Kuwait and France.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kuwaiti-French ties are "deep-rooted, particularly
in the military sphere."
</P>
<P>
The visit by Richard aims at enhancing coordination and
cooperation between Kuwait City and Paris, he said, adding that
Kuwait plans to further strengthen the relations.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti defense minister lauded the role France played
in the 1991 liberation of Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, defense sources said that the minister's trip to
Kuwait is designed to help "maintain the links" that were
established between the two countries during the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Richard came here from Doha, Qatar, where he signed an expanded
defense pact with Qatar after arrival Saturday. Details of the
agreement are not available, but it is an enlarged military pact
signed in 1994. Qatar buys more than 70 percent of its weapons
from France.
</P>
<P>
France, which was a major participant in the "Desert Storm"
operation to drive out the Iraqi forces, signed a defense
cooperation agreement with Kuwait in August 1992, which is still
in force.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has purchased eight highly-advanced war ships from
France and first deliveries of these vessels are due before
the end of 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji told a
meeting on cracking down on smuggling and foreign exchange crime
held here today that the police need a modern anti-smuggling
force to keep up the struggle against smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also emphasized the importance of cracking down on illegal
foreign exchange activities and said that purchasing foreign
exchange with forged documents, foreign exchange arbitrages, and
evading foreign exchange payments should be stopped and the law
breakers should be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
He said that banks' computer systems need to be connected with
foreign exchange offices and customs to prevent foreign exchange
crimes to maintain economic order in the socialist market economy
and ensure a sound development of the reform, opening up and
economic construction.
</P>
<P>
He said that stopping smuggling is hard and requires a constant
effort and said that departments concerned should focus on big
smuggling cases and that smugglers who are at large abroad must be
seized no matter where they go.
</P>
<P>
He also called for harsher penalties for smuggling by corporate
bodies, no matter what special background they have.
</P>
<P>
Corruption in customs offices, police, and industrial and
commercial administrative departments also needs to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the State Council, today's meeting was attended by
leading officials from Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang,
Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan provinces and Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Everton chairman Peter Johnson
has been given until New Year's Eve to dispose of his interests
in either Everton or Tranmere.
</P>
<P>
Johnson completed an 11 million pounds takeover of Everton in
July 1994 but the Football League has discovered he retained an
interest in First Division Tranmere.
</P>
<P>
Now Johnson must relinquish his interests in one of the clubs
by the end of the year or the Football League and the Premier
League will launch an investigation into the situation.
</P>
<P>
That investigation will establish whether Johnson's interests
in both clubs amounts to a breach of Football League and Premier
League regulations in terms of multi-ownership.
</P>
<P>
Football League chief executive Richard Scudamore said: "When
we became aware that Mr. Johnson had an interest in Tranmere as
well as Everton, we gave limited consent for the situation to
exist for a further 90 days in order to effect a quick disposal
of interest in one of the clubs.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Johnson intimated that it would be Tranmere and we have
sought to protect the interests of Tranmere in keeping the club
alive.
</P>
<P>
"After December 31 it will be the responsibility of the
Football League and the Premier League to examine jointly the
entire situation to ascertain any breach of regulations and
determine what action should be taken, " Scudamore added.

The side jumped 14 places after their 3-1 win over Cameroon three
weeks ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. Newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- By signing the latest Middle East peace pact Friday at the
White House, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may have given Palestinian
statehood a potent shove toward reality -- and in the process,
reshape the politics of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Democrats around the country are making extraordinary
efforts to get black voters to the polls November 3, convinced
that a high turnout would give the party the edge in more than two
dozen competitive congressional races and a handful of Senate and
gubernatorial races.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States, China and the north and south of the
Korean peninsula agreed to create two working parties to explore a
peace treaty and to examine confidence-building measures on the
peninsula. Concluding four days of talks in Geneva, the four
parties agreed to hold a fourth round of discussions in Geneva in
January.
</P>
<P>
The United States is preparing to commit American funds as part
of a 30 billion U.S. dollar program to try to insulate Brazil and
the rest of Latin America from the worst effects of world
financial turmoil, according to officials assembling the program.

<HEADLINE> Peace Moves in G. Bissau Fail: ECOWAS Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Peace initiatives have failed to
resolve the crisis in Guinea Bissau and the conflict in the
country has escalated in the last few days, a senior official
said.
</P>
<P>
Lansana Kouyate, Executive Secretary of the Economic Community
of the West African States (ECOWAS), made the remarks Saturday in
his annual report to the on-going Council of Ministers meeting in
Nigerian capital Abuja, the Post Express reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that despite concerted efforts by the ECOWAS
Committee of Seven and the Contact Group of the Community of
Portuguese-Speaking Countries, the conflict in Guinea Bissau had
escalated last week with many lives lost and the flow of refugees
into neighboring countries rising in great number.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the death toll in the fighting between
the mutinous troops and loyalist forces backed by Senegal and
Guinea increased to more than 100 as President Joad Bernardo
Vieira announced an unilateral ceasefire last week.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 200 Guinean troops were reportedly missing after
the country's second city of Bafata fell into the hands of the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Senegalese army said in a communique last Thursday that "our
forces continue to ensure the security of the city (Bafata) and
control every access".
</P>
<P>
But, diplomats said that the rebels now had the upper hand
militarily after surrounding the capital and capturing Bafata.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate told the six-day meeting which began on October 23
that with the breach of the ceasefire agreement accepted by all
parties except the rebels and the real threat to security posed
by the conflict, something more serious ought to be done to put
the matter in firm and total control.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "ECOWAS should continue to give the peace
initiative every needed support it deserves."
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS chief pointed out that ECOWAS had set up a draft
mechanism which provides for a regional observation and
monitoring center to give warning of impending crisis in the West
African region as well as providing a joint approach to the
control of movement of light arms and ammunition, drug
trafficking and cross border crime.
</P>
<P>
"We shall establish a community court of justice and
parliament which would continually contribute greatly toward
accelerating the implementation of ECOWAS priority programs," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Guinea Bissau will be one of the subjects to be
discussed at the forthcoming 21st summit meeting of ECOWAS to be
held on October 30 and 31.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Strike Spreads to All Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The strike launched by
Israeli university students spread on Sunday to all higher
education institutions in the country, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
It said that universities, colleges and academies throughout
the country were shut down due to the strike, leaving 175,000
students out of class.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of students, who ask for lower tuition fees, also
held demonstrations in the major cities on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the coastal city of Haifa, students blocked a high way and
clashed with police. And several students were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Lior Rothbart, leader of National Union of Israeli Students,
called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is due to return
from the U.S. Sunday afternoon, to "meet the challenge" and
deal with the student's demands.
</P>
<P>
The students are demanding that tuition fees, currently about
9,500 shekels (about 2,200 U.S. dollars) a year, be reduced by
half.
</P>
<P>
The strike was launched last Wednesday after the Finance
Ministry turned down the student's demand.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's officials said that the demand is unreasonable,
noting that the tuition level was set by a joint commission
established after a student strike in 1996, which also included
student representatives.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Spokesman On UN Resolution On Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING October 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Tang Guoqiang said here today that China will continue
to work with the international community on a peaceful settlement
to the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Some progress has recently been made on the Kosovo issue and
China understands and welcomes the agreement reached between
Yugoslavia and the parties concerned, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
However, certain regional organizations have unilaterally
decided on a military action without consulting the UN Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
This irresponsible action, he added, is not in line with the
actual conditions and runs counter to the principles outlined in
the UN Charter and in international laws and sets a dangerous
precedent in international relations.
</P>
<P>
In principle, China does not oppose the Security Council
passing a technical resolution to endorse the agreement reached
between Yugoslavia and the parties concerned, Tang said, but the
draft proposed by some countries includes authorizing the use of
force against Yugoslavia and interferring in the internal affairs
of a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
China has made it clear that it will not accept the contents
and has tabled amendment proposals, Tang said, and China has
pointed out that it will have to veto the draft if the
authorization of force is not deleted.
</P>
<P>
China's proposals were adoped on the whole, he said, so it did
not prevent the draft resolution from passing, although some of
the wording is still unsatisfactory, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
China reiterates that the sovereignty and territorial integrity
of a country should not be infringed upon and its right to choose
its own path of development should be respected, he said.
</P>
<P>
China opposes any interference in another country's internal
affairs under any pretext whatever and the use of force or the
threat of use of force in international affairs.

<HEADLINE> Local People Important In Protecting Ruins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The demands of local people must
be taken into account while protecting historical ruins, according
to Prof. Zhao Rong, the head of the research group at Northwest
China University, who explains that for a long time many ruins
have been protected at the price of local development because
production was restricted.
</P>
<P>
He says that his group is now working on a new plan to
coordinate protection of historical ruins and local economic
development, which will first be used at the Chang'an Town Ruins
of the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.--220 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
The average income of people living in the Chang'an protection
zone in a northern suburb of Xi'an is about a third less than for
people living outside.
</P>
<P>
Government restrictions on economic activities have resulted in
complaints from residents, but the results are not as good as what
one might expect, Zhao says, and about 120 illegal township
enterprises and 50 fish ponds have appeared inside the protection
zone of the Chang'an ruins in suburban Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Tinghao, Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Bureau of
Cultural Relics, admits that similar problems exist in other major
ruins in China and there is an urgent need to change the
traditional way of protecting ruins.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Protect Computer Systems From Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Estrada administration has
started efforts to protect the government's "mission-critical"
computer systems from potential disruption by the so-called
millennium or "Y2K" bug.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here Sunday by the Presidential Office,
Amable Aguiluz, presidential consultant for computer education,
identified these sectors as power and utilities, health care,
insurance, and telecommunications and transportation.
</P>
<P>
Aguiluz said that limited resources have prompted the
government to focus its main attention on these areas for now.
</P>
<P>
"The main problem is to manage resources and recommend to the
president such measures as contingency planning, risk management
and business continuity planning," Aguiluz said.
</P>
<P>
Other "non-critical" systems will be addressed as soon as funds
 become available, said Aguiluz while citing the need to push for
greater cooperation between the government and the private sector
in licking the threat posed by the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
In August, President Joseph Estrada created the Presidential
Commission on Year 2000 Compliance, headed by Aguiluz, to
coordinate government efforts in averting the threat posed by the
"Y2K" bug.
</P>
<P>
The president has directed the commission to craft a two-year
2000 Compliance Plan and initiate actions against the dumping into
the country of hardware and software and information
technology-based products infected with the "Y2K" bug.
</P>
<P>
If not fixed, the "Y2K" bug may affect domestic business and
the financial community as it may result to warranty disclaimers,
 liability caps, corporate mismanagement liabilities, and
potential third-party damages in computer-based and
computer-assisted systems, the president said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Mahathir Condemns Rioters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Sunday condemned those involved in violent
demonstrations in the federal capital Saturday night, saying the
rioters purportedly sought to preserve the rule of law whereas
they themselves were indeed the law-breakers.
</P>
<P>
"The groups calling themselves reformists seeking to uphold
justice are the ones who are breaking the law," Mahathir, who is
also home minister, said in Langkawi, northern Malaysia, according
to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
He said no one benefited from the incident and instead the
country's image suffered.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he believed the demonstrations were meant to
prevent Anwar Ibrahim from being tried in open court.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked from the cabinet on September 2, is
currently under remand and faces 10 counts of charges of
corruption and unnatural sex acts.
</P>
<P>
His trial on four counts of corrupt practices has been fixed
for November 2.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations were held in several areas in Kuala Lumpur which
turned violent when rioters assaulted and injured two policemen.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were believed to be Anwar's supporters as
many of them carried pro-Anwar leaflets and banners.
</P>
<P>
They threw stones, bottles, wooden and steel rods at policemen
who resorted to water cannons to disperse the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 241 demonstrators Saturday night.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Pagoda In Beijing Re-Open To Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A 600-year-old Tibetan-style
pagoda in Beijing re-opened today to the public after a year of
refurbishment.
</P>
<P>
According to Buddhist scriptures, the pagoda was built during
the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) and is one of the 8 largest pagodas
in the world. The temple where it is located is called the "White
Pagoda Temple".
</P>
<P>
In the past decades, however, people and units had occupied
part of the temple, leaving it in danger of catching on fire.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city's historical sites protection department
came up with a plan to rebuild it and removed about 3,000 square
meters of housing and office buildings for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the re-opening, the temple is holding an
exhibition of its collection of cultural relics.

<HEADLINE> Subic Eyed as Philippines "Silicon Valley" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Subic freeport in northern
Philippines is being eyed as the country's' information technology
center like the "Silicon Valley" in the United States, an official
report said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Subic Metropolitan Development
Authority (SBMA) plans to transform Central Luzon into a major
growth area, which will comprise the conversion of the freeport
into a Silicon Valley-type multimedia center, promotion of
eco-tourism, modernization of its seaport facilities and the
full-development of the other economic zones in the region.
</P>
<P>
In the report, SBMA Chairman Felicito Payumo said: "Foreign
investors are already exploring the possibility of turning the
Subic freeport into a multimedia corridor like the Silicon Valley,
a western region in California known for its high-technology
computer design and manufacturing industries."
</P>
<P>
Given its advanced telecommunications facilities, he said, "The
Subic freeport can really be transformed into an information
technology center for the Philippines."
</P>
<P>
He said that with its relatively unspoiled rainforest and
beaches, software creative people would find Subic an ideal place
to work and live in -- devoid of the metropolitan traffic and
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Subic, about 80 kilometers north of Manila, is a former U.S.
naval base. After the U.S. withdrawal from Subic in 1992, the
Philippine government turned the area into a special economic
zone.

<HEADLINE> Unemployed Chinese Get Supports From Trade Unions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- About two million Chinese
workers who were laid off from money-losing enterprises have found
employment with the help of China's trade unions, which have over
100 million members.
</P>
<P>
Unions are organized to protect workers' rights and interests
and have the duty of helping unemployed people find new jobs, says
Chen Zhigang, director of the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions' Social Security Department.
</P>
<P>
Wu Ruiling did not expect to become a successful professional
woman when she lost her job at a semiconductor factory seven years
ago and was desperate with no idea about the future and about
being jobless and problems for her family.
</P>
<P>
But, Wu got a temporary job at a supermarket when the trade
union in her hometown of Bengbu City in Anhui Province started a
re-employment project. She worked so hard that she was promoted to
assistant manager.
</P>
<P>
She says she cherished the opportunity even though she was paid
only 100 yuan (about 12 U.S. dollars) per month at first.
</P>
<P>
People need support and jobs to struggle against financial
problems and overwhelming psychological pressures in the wake of
losing a job, Chen says, pointing to the many employees of
state-owned enterprises who had gotten used to cradle-to-grave
welfare under the planned economic system.
</P>
<P>
He says that trade unions across the country have been playing
a major role in the national re-employment work that hopes to help
more than 10 million jobless workers.
</P>
<P>
According to the ACFTU, the number of job agencies for
unemployed people has grown to 800 and they have helped more than
500,000 jobless workers since the first office was established in
Shanghai in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Professional training service has been offered for some 2.1
million people without jobs, half of whom have found jobs
afterwards. A foundation that helps laid-off workers with
financial difficulties has raised 2.2 billion yuan so far.

<P>
CAIRO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Center of Studies and Strategic Research of
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has announced that it is currently
engaged in working out a strategy and estimates of the production
of petroleum and natural gas in the Caspian Sea and its impact on
the Arab Gulf region, Sunday's Arab daily "Al Hayat" reported.
</P>
<P>
The center is scheduled to hold its fourth annual meeting on
energy starting from Sunday and lasting until Monday in Abu Dhabi
with the participation of prominent international economy and
energy experts.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Under a new arrangement to facilitate foreign
businessmen's entry into Kuwait, they can arrive in Kuwait first
and then have their visas issued within hours.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait will open two centers Monday for issuing visas for
foreign businessmen within 24 hours, English daily Arab Times
quoted Rashed Al-Mujren, undersecretary of Kuwait's Ministry of
Commerce and Industry, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mujren said that one center will be opened at Kuwait
International Airport and the other will be located in Mansouriya
area, near Kuwait City.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign businessmen coming to Kuwait must have the
sponsorship of Kuwaiti companies.
</P>
<P>
The facility applies to company managers, its representatives,
engineers, doctors, accountants and auditors and rare specialists,
said Mujren, adding that all these categories are allowed to
bring their families.
</P>
<P>
The official said the two centers will operate for a
three-month trial period. After an assessment, more centers will
be opened in other parts of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Lebanese trade deficit reached 4.72 billion
U.S. dollars in the first nine months of this year, compared with
5.1 billion dollars in the same period of 1997, down by 7.41
percent, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Lebanese Finance Ministry were quoted by
Egypt's daily Al-Alam Al-Yom on Saturday as attributing the
retreat of the deficit to the rise of Lebanon's exports by 5.56
percent to 513 million dollars in the first nine months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the imports went down by 6.28 percent from
5.589 billion dollars to 5.238 billion in the same period this
year, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan and Iraq agreed that joint technical ad hoc
committees will start probing the building of an oil pipeline
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian mission headed by Minister of Energy and Mineral
Resources Hani Malki reached an agreement with the Iraqi side on
working out feasibility study and other technical aspects of the
project, Saturday's "Al-Hayat" newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement envisages the extension of the pipeline from
Al-Haditha city in Iraq near the borders with Jordan to Al-Zarqaa
city, northeast Amman.
</P>
<P>
The project that will cost some 60 million U.S. dollars will
carry up to 150,000 barrels of oil per day.

<HEADLINE> More Palestinians Allowed to Work in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Additional 20,000 Palestinian
workers are allowed to enter Israel from Sunday, making the total
number of Palestinians authorized to work in Israel reach 47,000,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The move came less than two days after Israel and the
Palestinians signed a new "land-for-peace" deal at the White
House Friday. U.S. President Bill Clinton has said that the
agreement was designed to rebuild trust between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army eased a closure on Gaza and the West Bank 12
days ago, allowing more than 20,000 Palestinians into Israel. The
closure was imposed last month following the threats by Islamic
militant group Hamas to attack Israel in retaliation of the
killing of two Hamas members by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israel Radio reported that Palestinian
security forces arrested two Hamas members Saturday in the
Palestinian-controlled city of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
A leading Hamas member was arrested at his home Saturday night
following his public condemnation of the interim peace agreement
signed by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Radio reports said a Hamas student member at a university near
Nablus was also arrested in a raid by the security forces. Two
other students fled the campus and were being wanted by
Palestinian police.

<P>
ANKARA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police seized 26.39
kilograms of pure heroin in a recent operation in eastern Turkey
bordering Iran, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip-off, the Turkish police closely followed three
suspected drug smugglers in eastern province of Van and a bus
bound for Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The police stopped the bus and found the heroin in 26 packets.
</P>
<P>
However, the news agency did not say when the drug was seized.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is on a transit route of drugs to Europe from the border
areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 1996, Turkish police seized
4.4 tonnes of heroin, which accounted for 40 percent of the
world's total haul.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in Indian capital
New Delhi claimed to have developed a new drug which can boost the
immune system to fight leprosy and multi-drug resistant
tuberculosis, Scientist Navin Khanna said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The drug is a naturally found protein, gamma-interferon, which
also has anti-viral and anti-cancerous properties. Toxicological
studies at the Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) found the
protein to be safe for human use and it can be stored up to six
months, he said.
</P>
<P>
The protein has been developed by cloning and expressing a
piece of human interferon gene inside "e. coli" bacteria. The
human gene is chemically synthesized by the International Center
for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB).
</P>
<P>
The "e. coli" strain produces the protein in a solidified form
which is processed by novel technique, developed at ICGEB, to get
about 97 percent pure protein, he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Primakov Opposes Early Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov has expressed his opposition to an early presidential
election in his country, the Interfax news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An early presidential election means clashes of interests and
mud-slinging, Primakov said in an interview with Russia's ORT TV
station on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the health of the president will allow him to
finish his term in office," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that he "firmly decided not to" run for the
2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the anti-crisis measures drafted by the government,
Primakov confirmed that Russia will put the increase of export as
its priority.
</P>
<P>
The anti-crisis program would be discussed at a government
meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
As for the delay of the IMF credits, Primakov said "whether or
not the International Monetary Fund (IMF) extends Russia a loan,
we shall get back on our feet. It will just be more difficult for
us to recover. And we shall settle all our debts."
</P>
<P>
"The current crisis will absolutely not influence Russia's
policy. We have our interests and we shall defend them," he
stressed.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russia to Make Silicon for India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia has agreed to covert
one of its dismantled nuclear facilities at Krasnoyarsk in Siberia
into a plant for manufacturing silicon in a joint venture project
with India, Press Trust of India (PTI) said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The project will help India meet its civilian and defense
requirements of silicon wafers which are used to convert sunlight
into electricity and also to make semiconductor devices, called
integrated "chips".
</P>
<P>
Imports of chips, especially for India's space and missile
programs, are often subject to embargoes and it is hoped that the
Indian-Russian venture will provide India with an assured supply
of this critical material, PTI quoted officials here as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 150 million U.S. dollar joint venture will consist of two
units. The Siberian unit will produce pure silicon crystal ingots
while the unit in India will convert the ingots into thin polished
wafers.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Most Israelis Favor Peace Deal, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed his confidence that the
newly-signed "land for peace" deal would be ratified by the
parliament as latest polls showed that most Israelis are in favor
of it.
</P>
<P>
But Jewish settlers resumed their protests Sunday morning
after the Jewish weekend, Shabbat, and leaders of the
right-wingers in Netanyahu's government are moving to split from
the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who is on his way back after signing the new interim
agreement with Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat Friday, was quoted by Israel Radio as saying that he was
confident that the Knesset (Parliament) will approve the deal by a
large majority.
</P>
<P>
The radio report quoted senior sources as saying that
Netanyahu also said he preferred the current government to
continue in office and opposed ideas of holding early elections
or forming a unity government.
</P>
<P>
A latest opinion survey, conducted Saturday night by the
Yedioth Ahronoth, the most widely distributed newspaper in Israel,
showed that 74 percent of the Israelis are in favor of the new
peace deal and 53 percent believed it is no need to hold early
elections.
</P>
<P>
The result is similar to that of a previous poll, conducted at
a time when the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were engaged
in intensive talks at the Wye Plantation near Washington, which
showed that 82 percent of the Israelis hoped a deal would be
reached.
</P>
<P>
After the signing of the accord, President Ezer Weizman praised
Netanyahu and the Israeli delegation for reaching the peace
agreement, saying the deal was "an important chapter" on the road
to peace.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Shimon Peres described the peace deal as
a "big victory" for the Oslo peace process, urging the Labor
Party to provide a "safety net" for the deal in the Knesset and
at the same time continue its effort to seek early elections.
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo, who is forming a new centerist party
in preparation for the next election, also welcomed the peace
deal and called for early elections.
</P>
<P>
The Israel daily The Jerusalem Post reported Sunday that
senior members of the Labor Party met Saturday night to debate on
how to react if the Likud invites the Labor to join the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlers, who held several days of protests last week
to warn Netanyahu against an agreement, blocked intersections and
highways for about two hours in the West Bank Sunday
morning. Clashes broke out between them and Israeli policemen on
some points. police said at least 20 settlers were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Michael Kleiner, leader of the rightist block in the Knesset,
Land of Israel, has reportedly begun to form a new party which he
hoped to include all right-wingers in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Land of Israel has repeatedly threatened that it would move to
opposition at the moment Netanyahu signed an agreement with
Arafat and take every opportunity to topple the government.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Supports China In Human Rights Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine unswervingly supports
China on international stage when it comes to human rights issues,
Nina Karpacheva, plenipotentiary of human rights issues in the
Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, or parliament, said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Karpacheva, who just attended a human rights-related
international seminar held October 20 to 21 in Beijing, met
Chinese government officials, deputies to the National People's
Congress, representatives from the all-China Women's Federation
and some Chinese scholars during her stay in China.
</P>
<P>
She spoke highly of the tremendous achievements made by China
in politics, economy and social life in recent years, and believed
the most important outcome of the seminar is that the west and the
east, which have different cultural backgrounds, now had a candid
dialogue on human rights.
</P>
<P>
The seminar on the topic -- "International Human Rights Toward
The 21st Century" -- provided the west and the east with a chance
to find a joining point at the turn of this century, she said.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for China to host such a large-scale human
rights international seminar, Karpacheva said.
</P>
<P>
She described China's inviting Ukraine to the seminar as a
major step toward developing Sino-Ukrainian ties in the fields of
common concerns.
</P>
<P>
She also believed the two countries have great potential to tap
not only in trade but also in the political field.
</P>
<P>
She had proposed establishing a partnership in human rights
affairs with China, Karpacheva said, adding that the proposal was
widely accepted in China.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have already started preparing documents on
mutual extradition of criminals and prisoners, and on mutual
acknowledgement of diplomas issued by institutions of middle-level
and higher education, Karpacheva said.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Conservatives Win Election of Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Although the final result has
not been announced, Iran's conservatives have won a clear victory
in Friday's election of the Experts Assembly which has the right
to determine and dismiss the country's supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
According to a report carried by the pro-moderate daily Iran
on Sunday, the conservatives have gained at least 44 seats in the
assembly out of 62 announced in 25 provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, only 19 winners belonged to the list
of the moderate Party of Constructive Executives of Iran (CEI),
but 10 of them also appeared in the list of the
conservatives. Nine others were considered as independent.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing groups, which formed a coalition with the
moderates in the presidential elections in May last year, refused
to announce their list for Friday's election after their key
nominees were rejected by the conservative Guardians Council.
</P>
<P>
The council, which is empowered to review the qualifications
of candidates for elections in the country, approved 167
candidates for the election out of 394 applicants. But at least
four candidates from the left-wing factions withdrew in protest
of the council's screening policy.
</P>
<P>
According to the moderate daily Hamshahri, about 17.9 million
out of more than 38 million electorates cast their votes to elect
the third Expert Assembly, which was formed in 1983 under the
order of late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
The election was in a striking contrast with the presidential
election in May last year, in which about 30 million cast ballots
and more than 20 million voted for moderate President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
By late Saturday, 70 out of the 86 seats in the Experts
Assembly have been announced in 27 of the country's 28
provinces. The remaining 16 seats in the capital of Tehran will
be made known later on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The latest report by the official news agency IRNA said that
former President Hashemi Rafsanjani led in Tehran province with
1,535,467 votes and behind him was the conservative candidate Ali
Meshkini, current chairman of the Experts Assembly, with 1,133,382
votes.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the conservative factions would gain at
least 10 seats from Tehran while the moderate four.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian police and
the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents are
interrogating an estate agent in connection with the bombing of
United States embassy in Dar es Salaam, press reports said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, said the Sunday Observer, is an estate agent
named as Juma Mkingiti with no regular residence.
</P>
<P>
But the paper did not identify the nationality of the suspect
nor did it say where the person was seized.
</P>
<P>
Scores of suspects have been seized and later released after
the bombing incident took place on August 7 in this east African
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the English-language newspaper said the police and
FBI have discovered a device believed to be used in mixing
chemicals of the bomb which devastated the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blast killed 11 people and injured more than 70
others. So far two suspects, an Egyptian national Mustafa Mahmoud
Said Ahmed and a Tanzanian citizen Rashid Saleh Hemed, have
appeared in court in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The paper also carried a picture in the front page, showing
that FBI and local Criminal Investigation Department (CID) agents
were removing one of the five colanders they used to sift heaps
of sand collected from a house in the Ilala Bungoni B area in the
city, possibly attempting to find some clues.
</P>
<P>
The house, suspected to be where the bomb was assembled, has
been put under 24-hour surveillance by the FBI and CID.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Rules Out Compromises on DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will not compromise
its position on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) due to the
capture of 16 Zimbabwean soldiers in the eastern town of Kabalo.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Minister of Foreign Affairs Stan Mudenge, told the
Sunday Mail on the eve of Monday's crucial Organization of
African Unity (OAU) summit on the DRC in Lusaka, there was no way
Zimbabwe was going to entertain the use of the captured soldiers
as a negotiating tool.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the rebels being backed by Uganda and Rwanda
will be attending the Lusaka summit, Mudenge said there will be
no rebels at the conference.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that ways would be found of consulting the
rebels as happened at the meeting in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
On assertions that some quarters in Zimbabwe were opposed to
the country's military presence in the DRC, Mudenge said the
government had an obligation to assist the legitimate Congolese
government of President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"The obligation on us is even more compelling. We are
expected to give leadership in a situation of that nature. That
is why for many years we expected other countries to sort out our
mess. It is now time Africa accepted its responsibility and
solved its own problems. We are making our own contribution just
as Europe is doing in Kosovo and Bosnia," said Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister reiterated that Rwanda and Uganda invaded
the DRC against the United Nations and OAU charters.
</P>
<P>
"If you allow aggressors to go against one country, where will
it stop?" he asked.

<HEADLINE> Iran Expresses Concern Over Palestinian-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran has expressed its concern
over the Palestinian-Israeli agreement signed in the U.S., warning
that so-called peace talks would never guarantee the denied rights
of the Palestinians, because Israel could not be trusted.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said on Saturday
that the commitment assumed by the Palestinian delegation in
relation to Israel was a cause for much concern, the official news
agency IRNA reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel is not to be trusted, Mohammadi said, adding that such
agreements would only entail a widening gap among the
Palestinians themselves, and would in the end, turn out to be the
advantage of Israel.
</P>
<P>
After nine days of tough negotiations, Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Friday
signed an agreement in Washington, breaking a 19-month deadlock in
the Palestinian-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw troops from 13.1
percent of the West Bank and free hundreds of Palestinian
detainees, while the Palestinians will step up efforts to crack
down on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said he believes that Israel wants to survive under
the aegis of similar accords so that it can continue conducting
terrorist activities, such as the practice of state terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Jerusalem remain to be the issues of the
Muslim community despite the fact that both the United States and
supporters of Israel are trying to trample the rights of
Palestinians and bring the holy city under the absolute rule of
the Israeli regime, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"All the Muslim nations consider themselves to have a share in
the fate of holy Qods (Jerusalem)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi also refuted the recent remarks of a U.S. navy
commander stationing the Persian Gulf about the possibility of
Iran's access to nuclear weapons within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Such statements are evidence of the U.S. fear of improving
relations between Iran and Persian Gulf states, and such remarks
are aimed only to raise fear among Persian Gulf states and
encourage them to enter an arms race that would mean dollars for
the U.S. arms, he said.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Re-employment System Covers Nearly All Laid-Off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A report shows that nearly
all workers laid off by state-owned enterprises in south China's
Guangdong Province, a showcase of the country's economic reforms,
are now covered by a newly-established re-employment service
system.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on inspections by the Provincial Leading
Group on Re-employment, reveals that 99.6 percent of workers laid
off by state-owned units in the province have received services
from re-employment service centers or other related institutions,
41.6 percent up from the figure in August this year.
</P>
<P>
As part of a national effort to extend re-employment services
to all laid-off workers, Guangdong has set up nearly 8,000
re-employment service centers over the past four months, compared
with only 179 by the end of May this year.
</P>
<P>
The centers are trying hard to help displaced workers find new
jobs. In the city of Huizhou, for instance, more than 4,000 local
laid-off people have been re-employed in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the province has raised 170 million yuan as a special
fund to ensure basic living standards for laid-off people. Over
half of them are now receiving regular subsidies.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, about 534,000 workers in the
province were laid off last year, with 289,000 finding new jobs in
the same year. In the first five months of this year, some 366,000
workers were displaced, 132,000 of whom were later re-employed.

<HEADLINE> Floods Displace Families in W. Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people in Busia
District, western Kenya, are threatened with disease and famine
as flood waters continue to rise, a local media report said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Many families have had to shift to higher ground taking their
animals and other belongings with them to escape the raging
waters.
</P>
<P>
The worst-hit part in the district bordering Uganda is
Budalangi Division, where local leaders estimate 13,000 families
have been displaced.
</P>
<P>
Flooding has intensified in the past four days as the River
Nzoia flowing through the area into Lake Victoria burst its banks
due to heavy rains. Four camps on higher ground have been set
up.
</P>
<P>
There is a strong fear that cholera and other water-borne
disease might break out in the camps as what happened early this
year, when at least 23 people died of cholera in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The area suffered from similar floods in late 1997 and early
this year during the El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
"The problem of floods in this area can not end unless the
government builds permanent dikes," said member of parliament
Raphael Wanjala.
</P>
<P>
Severe flooding countrywide, a result of the El Nino rains,
claimed at least 89 lives, displaced thousands and caused damage
estimated at millions of Shillings in the east African country
from late 1997 to early this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A natural gas well exploded
and caught fire in Louisiana of the United States Saturday
afternoon, killing seven of the 13 workers on the scene.
</P>
<P>
At least one of four injured workers remained hospitalized,
media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Two of the workers were uninjured, said Bob Lane, chief
operating officer for Sonat Exploration Co., which owns the well.
</P>
<P>
The intense heat from the fire prevented rescue crews from
getting close enough to remove some of the bodies of those who
were killed.
</P>
<P>
The crew was completing a new well when it blew at about 2:00
in the afternoon, Lane said.
</P>
<P>
The fire was expected to burn through the night. The cause of
the blaze was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
Six workers apparently died at the scene, and the seventh
victim was pronounced dead at LSU Medical Center, where another
worker was in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
Two others were treated and released at Lincoln General
Hospital, nursing supervisors said. Lane said another worker was
taken to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were pouring water onto drums of methanol, which
is used for drilling, to try to keep those from exploding. Well
control teams from Texas were heading to the site.

<HEADLINE> Drug Problems Worsen in Thailand: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Drug problems in Thailand are
getting worse, with amphetamines as the biggest challenge, and
financial support for handling the problems is insufficient, a
survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Suppression is ineffective due to lack of coordination among
state agencies concerned, said the survey, made public on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Assumption University during
October 1 and 23, sought comments from governors and their
deputies, police chiefs, attorneys, prison wardens, council
presidents and administrative organization officials in all 76
provinces.
</P>
<P>
A total of 656 people replied to the survey by mail, and 77.8
percent of them warned that the drug problems were intensifying
due mainly to increasing local addiction.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the respondents -- 96.6 percent -- identified
amphetamines as the most widespread choice of addicts, followed by
solvents, marijuana, heroin, opium and ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
Despite the government's movement to set up anti-narcotics
units at local levels, 65.9 percent of the respondents noted that
insufficient coordination among state agencies concerned was still
the biggest obstacle to effective suppression.
</P>
<P>
Insufficient intelligence, and unattractive rewards for active
officials also obstructed anti-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
Due to the obstacles, half of the respondents said
anti-narcotics units at provincial, district and community levels
had only modest capacity in mobilizing forces to cope with drug
problems and the performance of such units should reflect that
level of readiness.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Expects Zero GDP Growth in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government
foresees a zero growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in
1999, Budget Secretary Waldemar Giomi said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said that this forecast will be included in the government's
budget program for 1999, which will be presented to the congress
early next month.
</P>
<P>
The government predicted that the country's economy must
undergo a process of recession next year because of the global
financial crisis and economic adjustment measures to be announced
by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso next week.
</P>
<P>
Before the financial crisis, the country's economy was expected
to grow four percent next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The four percent growth was part of the budget proposal the
government presented to the congress two months ago.
</P>
<P>
But the financial crisis caused a flight of more than 33
billion U.S. dollars in foreign investments in Brazil and forced
the government to announce a program of budget adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The new forecast indicated that the government admits that the
current interest rates, which amount to 50 percent a year, can not
be reduced as fast as the entrepreneurs desire for.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the interest rates, decreed two months ago as
one of the government's instruments to stem the flight of capital,
as well as the foreseen spending cuts and the increase in taxes
will have recessive effects on its economy.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund and other world financial
organizations last Tuesday agreed to assemble a 30 billion dollar
bailout package for Brazil, hoping to erect a fire wall that will
keep the Latin America's largest economy from going into crisis
like those of Asia and Russia.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt stressed the important role of
veterinary doctors in the country for their technical support and
expansion of the livestock services.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the 7th Veterinary Conference here Saturday,
organized by the Myanmar Veterinary Association (MVA), Khin Nyunt,
first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council, called for efforts to increase the number of cattle for
farming, and distribution of healthy and nutritious meat for the
public.
</P>
<P>
The MVA, formed in 1974, is engaged in activities for uplifting
the standard of veterinary science and livestock technology and
boosting production in the livestock and fisheries sector.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar promulgated its Animal Health and Development Law in
1993 and Veterinary Science Council Law in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's meat and fish
sector increased by 6.4 percent in its output value in the 1997-98
fiscal year which ended in March. The production of meat increased
to 283,294 tons in the 1997-98 fiscal year from 268,135 tons in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The sector is also the third largest contributor towards gross
domestic product (GDP) after agriculture and manufacturing,
sharing 7.3 percent of GDP in the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the meat and fish sector reached 275.35
million dollars in 18 projects at the end of March this year.

BANGKOK, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is poised to ratify
the Mine Ban Treaty of 1997 after the army submitted the letter of
affirmation to the Foreign Ministry on Thursday, The Nation
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After several months of vetting and delay, the Permanent
Secretary's Office of Defense informed the Foreign Ministry, which
is coordinating preparations for the ratification process of the
treaty, that it is agreeable to the original text and the Thai
translation. The air force and navy have both submitted their
letters of affirmation to the ministry. The Interior Ministry and
the National Security Council have yet to reply.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which will become an international law in March
next year, imposes a comprehensive ban on using, stockpiling,
producing and transporting anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would need at least 800 million baht (21 million U.S.
dollars) to clear mines and rehabilitate the victims of land
mines.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Pivotals remained weak on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) during the week on selling pressure
coupled with lack of institutional support.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index declined from the previous week's level
of 2848.11 to 2741.22 before closing at 2784.46 with a net loss of
63.65 points. The national index also lost 23.53 points to 1246.00
from the previous week's level of 1269.53.
</P>
<P>
The closing rates showed widespread small to modest losses. The
volume of business remained below normal. The trading on BSE
lacked the traditional enthusiasm mainly because of the general
bearish sentiment induced by the recessionary trend in the
industry. Another reason for the lackluster market movement was
the Asian market crisis, traders said.

<HEADLINE> Czech Trade Deficit Down Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PLAGUE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic's trade
deficit shrank 53 percent to 47 billion koruna (1.6 billion
U.S. dollars) over the first three quarters this year from the
year-ago level, the National Statistics Office said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Compared with last year, imports increased 12 percent while
exports grew 24.7 percent during the period under review, said
Jaroslav Machane, spokesman for the statistics office.
</P>
<P>
In September 1998, the country registered a mere 18 million
koruna (620,000 dollars) in trade deficit, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that trade deficit for 1998 is expected to decline to
60 billion koruna (2.1 billion dollars) from the earlier-projected
80 billion koruna (2.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Describing the current foreign trade performance as the best
since 1994, Machane said the shrinking trade deficit will help
accelerate the country's economic revitalization.
</P>
<P>
The country had experienced huge yearly trade deficit since
1994, with its trade deficit hitting a staggering 160 billion
koruna (5.5 billion dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But its foreign trade performance began to improve after the
government readjusted its foreign trade policies in April 1997 to
encourage exports and curb imports.

The hosts brought home two titles from four events in the
three-day competition. Guo Zhengxin captured the men's skating
trophy with an almost flawless performance while Zhang Xiaodan
and Zhang Hao surprised even themselves to pocket the pairs,
edging ahead of two Russian pairs.
</P>
<P>
Gao Song and Wang Yu completed China's medal sweep in the
men's event, with the bronze medal of ladies and the fourth place
of ice dancing also going to Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The victory of the competition, part of the International
Skating Union (ISU) Junior Grand Prix series, marks the best
results for Chinese skaters in international level.
</P>
<P>
"It's a big improvement for Chinese," Italy's coach Rizzo
Valter said.
</P>
<P>
"They have a bright future, " Russian pairs' caoch Sergei
Petukhov said of Wang Xiaodan and Wang Hao.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese skaters, well known for their difficulty, were the
class of their own in the technical show.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Liu Hongyun said, "Even in the adults grand
prix, our jumps are also the most difficult."
</P>
<P>
Guo Zhengxin, who finished eighth in the Winter Olympic Games
in Nagano, skated to a rare perfect quadri-lutz jump to highlight
Chinese impressiveness.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not so easy to make up their lack of musical
understanding as the Chinese are desperate for a breakthrough in
artistry.
</P>
<P>
Petukhov, upset about his students' loss to Chinese, said,
"Chinese only know jumps." His remark is emotional, but it's
true.
</P>
<P>
Ren Hongguo, director of the competition committee, said,
"We're setting eyes upon world championship and Olympic medals.
It is a long way to go to compete against Russian top skaters in
the merit of presentation expression."
</P>
<P>
"To learn waltz for Chinese is just like to learn Weiqi
(go-chess) for Europeans and Americans," said Wang Rui, who
placed fourth with her partner in ice dancing.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who was just 25th in last year's world junior
championships, said they have a coach training one or two pairs
on ice, but just a single dance teacher for all the skaters in
the team.
</P>
<P>
"There are philosophy and good theme in their beautiful music,
but the skaters don't know how to display. They don't understand
the dance," Valter said.
