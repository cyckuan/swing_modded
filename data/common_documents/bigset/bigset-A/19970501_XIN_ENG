<HEADLINE> Ireland's Booming Economy Expected to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Ireland's booming
economy is set to continue to grow at twice the pace of the
European Union (EU) as a whole over the next five years, with
gross domestic product overtaking that of Britain before the year
2005, according to a report of a leading Irish think-tank.
</P>
<P>
The Economic and Social Research Institute predicted in the
report published early today growth of about 5.5 percent a year
until 2000 and 5 percent for each of the following five years,
press reports from Dublin said.
</P>
<P>
The independent research group said that such growth would fuel
a sharp fall in unemployment from its current rate of around 11
percent to just 7 percent by 2005 and Ireland would achieve the EU
average standard of living within the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
"The long-standing cliche of Ireland as a small vulnerable
economy on the periphery of Europe is already looking a little
threadbare," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone of Ireland's economic success was laid in the
late 1960s when the Irish government introduced free secondary
level education, the report said. Wage moderation and fiscal
prudence, coupled with success in inward investment, are also seen
as the main factors.
</P>
<P>
However, the report warned that falling birth rates and lower
net emigration have resulted in a sharp rise in proportion of the
population in work.

<HEADLINE> US Economy Surges at 5.6 Percent Rate in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. economic growth exploded
at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the first quarter, the
strongest in a decade, according to initial estimates released by
the U.S. Commerce Department today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter of last year was a
robust 3.8 percent. The 5.6 percent surge in the first quarter was
the most since the fourth quarter of 1987.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the surge was led by an increase of 6.4
percent in consumer spending, which amounts to two-thirds of the
gross domestic products (GDP). The pace was nearly doubled the
rate of 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year and the
fastest since the first quarter of 1988.
</P>
<P>
Real nonresidential fixed investment increased 11.9 percent in
the first three months, compared with an increase of 5.5 percent
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Exports of goods and services increased by 8.1 percent in the
first quarter compared with a surge of 25 percent in the last
quarter of 1996. But imports were up by 21.9 percent compared with
an increase of 3.3 percent in the final three months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government expenditure decreased by 3.5 percent and the real
change in business inventories added 29 billion dollars to the
first-quarter change in real GDP after subtracting 17 billion
dollars from the fourth-quarter change.
</P>
<P>
The gain in overall GDP translated into an increase of 96.1
billion dollars, bringing the economy's inflation-adjusted output
to an annual rate of 7.09 trillion dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department report on the GDP, the sum of all goods
and services produced in the United States, not only showed
extremely strong economic growth in the country. It also provided
new evidence of inflation creeping higher.
</P>
<P>
A key inflation gauge tied to the GDP rose at a 2.7 percent
annual rate, the fastest in two years, following a 1.9 percent
rate in the fourth quarter, a four-year low.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to preempt inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve
(Fed) raised short-term interest rates a quarter percentage point
on March 25. It is now widely expected that the U.S. Fed will make
a similar increase when its policy-makers next meet on May 20.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Commerce Department said that revised estimate of economic
growth in the first quarter based on more comprehensive data will
be issued next month.

<HEADLINE> Visit to China "Highly Fruitful": Leghari </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari has described his two-day visit to China as "satisfactory
and highly fruitful".
</P>
<P>
The President made the comment today during an interview with
the Pakistani media on board the special presidential plane,
according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Talking about increasing the bilateral trade between Pakistan
and China, Leghari said that currently the balance of payments was
tilted in favor of China. Efforts were underway to identify newer
Pakistani items to be exported to China, for which experts are
busy working out suggestions.
</P>
<P>
China was the largest and solidly-emerging economy and had much
to offer, Leghari said, adding that "we should make efforts to see
that our salable surplus is worthier and of fair standard. We must
go beyond cotton and rice and offer other commodities, in the
non-traditional fields."
</P>
<P>
The President said that China has gone for hi-tech
manufacturing, with established markets--even those of Europe-- as
its buyers.
</P>
<P>
"We must benefit from the vast experience of our friendly
country, with whom, our relations transcend normal formalities,"
said Leghari.
</P>
<P>
China, he said, had been helping Pakistan in the form of
technical know-how and expertise, infrastructure and defense
related collaboration.
</P>
<P>
"We will be happy to see Chinese investments on equity
partnership basis, in manufacturing with easy marketability and
profits," he said.
</P>
<P>
Leghari held separate meetings with China's business executives
and scholars earlier today in Beijing. "The response (from the
meeting) was positive and encouraging", said Leghari.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural research, irrigation and electronics manufacturing
were new fields of cooperation proposed by the two countries
during the visit, Leghari said.

<HEADLINE> EC Adopts Plans to Reassure Consumers about Food Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
announced plans on Wednesday for reforming its approach to food
safety in an effort to reassure consumers in the wake of the mad
cow disease crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said it would set up a new food safety office,
reorganize its system for seeking scientific advice and strengthen
its inspection procedures.
</P>
<P>
"Recent experience has clearly demonstrated that food safety is
not only of concern to the consumer, but is also at the very root
of a proper functioning of the market," it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the plans, the Commission's food safety activities
would be grouped in a Food and Veterinary Office that will be set
up in Ireland, reporting to Consumer Affairs Commissioner Emma
Bonino.
</P>
<P>
The Commission pledged to seek advice on food safety from
eminent and fully independent scientists whose opinions and
working methods would be accessible to all interested parties.
</P>
<P>
The Commission's various scientific advisory committees will be
regrouped and coordinated by a Scientific Steering Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said it would strengthen food control and
inspection procedures. It also promised to introduce formal audit
procedures assessing national control system.
</P>
<P>
The shake-up fulfills a pledge made by Commission President
Jacques Santer in February to the European Parliament, which was
conducting an inquiry into the EU's handling of the mad cow
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Th Commission on Wednesday also adopted a paper that aims to
launch a debate on how the EU should approach food regulation in
the future.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright leaves here today for Moscow to push forward
the negotiations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) and Russia.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day stay in Moscow, Albright will meet Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov in attempt to remove differences
over an agreement that will set future relations between Russia
and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Both the alliance and Russia has indicated that they would like
sign the document in late May, over one month before NATO convenes
its special summit in Madrid on expansion into the Central and
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Moscow demands the alliance make "absolute commitment" to
guarantee that it will not station nuclear weapons nor substantial
combat troops on the territories of the new members of NATO. The
alliance, led by the U.S., rejects the demand.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow , Primakov today restated Russia's demands for
guarantees that NATO will not move its military infrastructure
into the new NATO members.
</P>
<P>
Last week, testified before the Senate, Albright said that
the U.S. will make no compromise on this issue.
</P>
<P>
"All we have done and all we will do is....in the current and
foreseeable security environment, we have no plan, no need and no
intention to station nuclear weapons in the new member countries,
nor do we contemplate permanently stationing substantial combat
forces," she said.

<HEADLINE> Reestablishment of State Organs Inspiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The work to reestablish state
organs throughout Angola began today in Mbanza Congo, capital
of the Zaire province in northern Angola.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said this is encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Mbanza Congo used to be the capital of ancient Kingdom of
Congo, where kings of various dynasties lived. It is known
typically for African cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Angolan vice-minister of territory administration Nzau Puna
said that to reestablish state organs in the areas occupied by
the National Union for Total Independence of Angola is an
important work set forth in the Lusaka Peace Agreement and the
beginning of this work is an important step for the solution of
other problems and also opens an extremely good perspective for
the smooth conclusion of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Culture Maria De Oliveira said that today's
ceremony is an important action and will also create conditions
for the restoration of the historical relics in Mbanza Congo
known throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The work to reestablish state organs was originally
scheduled to begin early in March. However, conditions were not
ripe. The formation of the Angolan government of national unity
and reconciliation on April 11 paved the way for the work.

<HEADLINE> China Wins Swaythling Cup For 12th Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China leveled the
world record held by Hungary as it beat France 3-1 to win its 12th
Swaythling Cup for the men's team top honor at the 44th World
Table Tennis Championships here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic champion Liu Guoliang beat former world champion
Jean-Philippe Gatien, anchoring the defending champion squad to a
3-1 victory over France, which made history on Tuesday to enter
its first-ever world team final.
</P>
<P>
"Our quarter-final win over Sweden really boosted our
confidence," said Chinese team leader Li Furong. "We beat the
French team by strength, not by luck."
</P>
<P>
China nipped former world champion Sweden 3-1 and booked a
final spot after beating South Korea in four games.
</P>
<P>
"We have become a target of the world since we swept all seven
titles at the home soil in 1993," Li said. "I feel relieved and
happy now."
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Liu used his wickedly deceptive serves and
merciless follow-up attacks to defeat Gatien 21-19, 21-14 in the
fourth game. Gatien also lost its first game to China's world
No. 1 Kong Linghui.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Kong, who had beaten Gatien twice in the world
championships and World Cup two years ago, triumphed 18-21, 21-16,
21-17.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Chila evened the scores for France as he beat Liu in
the second rubber.
</P>
<P>
The 17th-ranked Chila, who had lost to Liu in the World Cup
last year, controlled the game with clever returns to Liu's
deceptive serves and strong topspin forehands, winning the second
rubber 21-17, 15-21, 21-10.
</P>
<P>
Chinese veteran Wang Tao put China 2-1 up as he won the third
game against Frenchman Damien Eloi, 21-10, 31-29.
</P>
<P>
"I was really nervous in the second set," Wang said after the
match. "I have never played to a score of 31-29."
</P>
<P>
Eloi made a tenacious comeback in the second game, winning five
points in a row to level 20-all, and then extended Wang to 29-29.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman played an air shot on Wang's tricky serve and
then returned into the net to concede the match point.
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, South Korea beat Germany 3-0 to win the third
place.

<HEADLINE> Iran Terms EU Declaration Invalid, Unjustifiable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran today condemned European
Union's (EU) decision to suspend dialog with Tehran, describing it
as "invalid and unjustifiable."
</P>
<P>
At the ministerial meeting concluded in Luxembourg Tuesday, the
European Union (EU) also decided to stop the ministerial level
contact between the two sides and continue its arms embargo on
Iran.
</P>
<P>
In response to EU's decision, the ministry said in a statement
that Iran will not tolerate any deviation from the norms of
inter-state conduct and principles of mutual respect and
non-interference.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Republic of Iran shall respond in the appropriate
reciprocal manner to any (EU's) measure," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement declared that "Iran will refrain from engaging in
any discussion over other subjects of critical dialog, including
human rights, terrorism, and conventional, nuclear and chemical
weapons with the European Union or its member states."
</P>
<P>
The statement described the EU decision as invalidly and
unjustifiably "constituting a grave breach of international law
and the norms governing the conduct of inter-state affairs."
</P>
<P>
The statement lashed out at the Berlin court verdict on the
Mykonos case and the EU's decision as "pure fabrications" and
"totally baseless."
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court verdict on April 10 implicated Iranian
leadership behind the assassination of four Kurdish opposition
leaders in Mykonos restaurant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed that the EU member countries provide
"full and public support" to terrorism to operate freely in their
territories against Iran, which is a major victim of terrorism.

LUSAKA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Villagers living along the
Zambezi river between Mwandi and Sesheke in Western province of
Zambia have appealed to the government to crop crocodiles which
have killed six people in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
People especially women and children are caught and killed

</P>
<P>
The villagers are worried that if no action is taken to crop
the reptiles, many more people will be killed.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted a local official as saying "it
is better for crocodiles to be cropped than the crocodiles
cropping people. The government should immediately come to our
aid and crop these reptiles which have become a menace to human
life."

<HEADLINE> Guinea Worm Cases Drop Greatly in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) said here today the cases of guinea worm disease in
Nigeria were reduced from 653,620 in 1987 to 12,282 at the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of the implementation of the UNICEF-funded
National Guinea Worm Eradication Program (NIGEP) in the country,
according to Emmanuel Gemade, UNICEF program officer in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The number of endemic villages also reduced from 5,872 to
1,360 during the same period, he said.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF officer attributed the reduction to methodological
control process adopted by NIGEP.
</P>
<P>
According to Ben Nwobi, NIGEP Northeast facilitator, the
country now is at the stage of "case containment", having
approached complete eradication of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Case containment is the early detection of any case of the
guinea worm disease and adoption of timely intervention measures
to arrest it, thereby ensuring there is no further spread.

<P>
HARARE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 166 people died of
malaria throughout Zimbabwe during the past week, bringing the
total number of people who have died of the disease this year to
949.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe experienced some of its heaviest rains in many years
this season, creating hot and humid conditions suitable for
breeding of malaria-creating mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
So bad is the situation that more than 40,255 malaria cases
were dealt with at hospitals throughout the country this week
alone, bringing the cumulative national malaria cases for 1997 to
380,323.
</P>
<P>
The deaths so far this year compare with the just over 2,000
recorded throughout the country last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare's weekly
disease update released today said in effect, the cumulative
malaria cases this week showed a downward trend, with a 14
percent decrease nationally.

<HEADLINE> Strong Pound Makes Rate Rises Unnecessary, Says NIESR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Interest Rates do not need to rise
after the election on May 1st, the National Institute of Economic
and Social Research (NIESR) claims in a report on UK economy,
published today.
</P>
<P>
The institute believes an incoming government should resist
Bank of England pressure for a rate rise and should focus its
energies on delivering a Budget designed to put the public
finances on to a sound fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
That would involve a firm commitment to existing spending
targets as well as higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
The NIESR says that the strong pound has reduced the dangers of
overheating in the economy, making higher interest rates
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
The institute argues that the 15 percent rise in sterling since
the autumn will slow the economy down this year, reducing the risk
of overheating.
</P>
<P>
It has cut its growth forecast for this year from 3.5 percent
to 2.6 percent and is forecasting another quiet performance next
year.
</P>
<P>
The NIESR also believes that the benefit of cheaper imports
will help reduce the underlying inflation rate to 2 percent later
this year and is forecasting the rate of well below the 2.5
percent target set by the Government for next year as well.
</P>
<P>
However, Martin Weale, the NIESR's director, describes the
existing position as "unhealthy" and estimates that the annual
borrowing requirement is 24 billion US dollars higher than it
should be at this stage of the cycle.
</P>
<P>
The institute calls for prompt action, claiming that "from a
political perspective there is no better time to tighten fiscal
policy than in the early part of a new parliament".

<HEADLINE> Budget for Liberian Polls Pruned Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The 9-million-U.S. dollars budget
for Liberia's elections scheduled for May 30 has been
"drastically pruned down to realistic and realisable cost,"
according to Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister Tom Ikimi.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last week's assessment visit to Liberia, Ikimi
said the initial estimate of two million dollars for personnel
cost has been cut down to 700,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Likewise, the initial projection of just over seven million
dollars based primarily on the estimates of the donor agencies
for technical support and material assistance has also been
drastically reduced to a figure that conforms with ECOWAS
expectation," he said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria
today.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi did not say how much the election would now cost.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two weeks ago, Liberia's newly-installed Independent
Electoral Commission sent a detailed estimate of 12 million U.S.
dollars to General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's head of state who is
also chairman of ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African
States) and the Committee of Nine on Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The commission emphasized that the country would not be able
to source the funds necessary for the elections.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday Abacha sent an ECOWAS delegation, led by Ikimi, to
Liberia to assess the preparations already made for the
elections.
</P>
<P>
While announcing the budget cut, Ikimi noted that some members
of the donor community had not lived up to their pledges and
expressed the hope that now that the budget have been reduced to
realistic level, they would deliver on their pledges.
</P>
<P>
On the call for a rescheduling of the date for the election,
partly due to lack of fund, Ikimi said only the ECOWAS heads of
state could take a decision on such a "crucial and fundamental
matter".
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all those who had joined ECOWAS to carry "this
mission through to stay the course with us and engage in nothing
that may threaten the process at this crucial and delicate
stage."

other's views to broaden the relations between the two countries,"
said Ciller.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Pangalos expressed his hope that the existing
problems between Greece and Turkey will be solved soon and more
positive relations will be set up, saying that cooperation and
positive ties will be for the benefits of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We should do our best to overcome the problems of the past",
said Pangalos.
</P>

On April 15, Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Onur
Oymen and his Greek counterpart Yorgo Papandreu held "surprising"
talks for a solution to the problems between the two countries

</P>
<P>
Later, EU current President and Dutch Foreign Minister Hans
Van Mierlo said that the meeting between Oymen and Papandreu is
important for the solution of the Turkish-Greek problems, adding
that such efforts will be continued in the coming days.

</P>
<P>
This was contained in the recommendations made by the
participants at the end of the two-day seminar organized by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
The recommendations said the culture of peace should be carried
out through basic education, particularly at the level of youths.
</P>
<P>
The participants noted the international rules would be
ineffective if they were not accompanied by national
implementation measures.
</P>
<P>
The participants supported the international criminal tribunal
for Rwanda and took note of the difficulties faced by the members
of the tribunal in the fulfilment of their tasks.
</P>
<P>
They supported the idea of establishing a permanent
international tribunal which would supplement the work of the
national tribunals.
</P>
<P>
They also took note of the need for increasing material
and financial resources of the Arusha tribunal and for greater
cooperation among memebr states of the OAU.
</P>
<P>
The seminar requested these recommendations be appended to the
report of the OAU Commission of 20 on Refugees and be the subject of
a decision of the 66th Ordinary Session of the Council of Ministers
scheduled in Harare, Zimbabwe at the end of May 1997. enditem

<HEADLINE> Tajik Opposition Condemns Attack on President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Tajik opposition "National
Revival" today resolutely condemned the terrorist act against
president of Tajikistan Emomali Rakhmonov, but ruled out the
political motivation of the act, declaring it as "a purely
criminal act".
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, opposition alliance
leader Abdumalik Abdulladjanov said in an exclusive telephone
interview with the news agency that his alliance and party "have
always been and will continue to be against resolving problems by
forcible means."
</P>
<P>
He stated that the opposition as a political party and a
political alliance have never had anything to do with criminals,
emphasizing that the opposition alliance would always struggle for
justice and for securing the solution to their problems
exclusively by political means, without any violence.
</P>
<P>
Describing the situation in Tajikistan as "extremely complex",
Abdulladjanov said the terrorist action in Khudjand might have
been caused by a complicated social and economic situation in the
republic.
</P>
<P>
He also did not rule out that the attack on the president was
relating to the recent events in the city Khudjand when 20 inmates
died in a clampdown on a riot in the local prison.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a similar view was expressed by deputy
leader of the allied Tajik opposition delegation to talks with the
government Abdunabi Sattorzodah.
</P>
<P>
Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov was wounded this morning in
an attempt on his life, when a grenade hurled by a young man
exploded near him.
</P>
<P>
In the incident two people died and more than 60 were wounded,
including chairman of the Leninabad region Kasim Kasimov, his
deputy Akil Akilov, chairman of the Tajikistan's customs committee
Yakubdjon Saidov.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the attack was described as "an open political action"
by Rakhmonov's press secretary Zafar Saidov.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Calls for Moves to facilitate Egyptian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- President Benajmin Mkapa today
called for urgent moves to facialitate Egyptian investments in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
A press statement issued here by the State House said the
president's remark came in a discussion with visiting Egyptian
Foregin Minister Amr Moussa at the Arusha State Lodge this morning.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Mkapa said it was high time the
longstanding political relations between Tanzania and Egypt were
translated into economic co-operation on the basis of South-South
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the policical relations that date back to
the early 60s were sufficent ground upon which to build strong
economic co-operation.
</P>
<P>
"It makes no economic sense for Tanzania to continue conducting
business with far away countries in Europe and elsewhere without
exploring the great potentials that exist in nearby Egypt," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa invited Egyptian investors to invest in
Tanzania's financial, mining, tourism sector and the agro-based
industry.
</P>
<P>
He gave an example of the abundant fruit varieties in Tanzania
which lacked the supportive canning industry, a situation that forces
Tanzanians to import juice from South Africa and Israel.
</P>
<P>
In reply, the Egypian foreign minister said his country has taken
note of the positive economic structural changes in Tanzania and had
decided to move in with great determination.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister said he was pleased that this visit
coincided with the meeting of the Tanzania-Egyptian joint
commission and the signing of trade protocals as the bases for
further economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he handed to President Mkapa a special message from
President Hosny Mubarak of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by Tanzanian Minister for Foregin
Affairs and International Cooperation Jakaya Kikwete and Minister
of Finance Daniel Yona.  enditem

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Allows Hamas Leader to Come to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein has allowed
the would-be-deported Hamas leader Musa Abu Marzouk to come to
Jordan on grounds of humanitarian motives, it was disclosed here
today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Jordanian News Agency, Jordanian
Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir Mutawe said this
stance on the part of King Hussein emanated from Jordan's firm
support for the Palestinian people and its efforts to remove
obstacles facing the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The United States will release Abu Marzouk soon and he will
then proceed to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Abu Marzouk, 46, was apprehended by New York immigration
officials in 1995 after a trip to the Middle East on grounds he
violated immigration laws by not declaring affiliation with
Hamas. He obtained a U.S. residency permit in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been involved in efforts to help secure the release
of the Hamas leader who is facing extradition from the United
States to Israel.
</P>
<P>
There has been reports that the Hamas leader could be sent to
Jordan instead of Israel as a compromise to avert possible
Palestinian violence that could undermine the peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday met with China's Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen first conveyed President Jiang Zemin's cordial
regards to Clinton and told the president that he had good talks
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other cabinet
members. Both sides in their talks agreed to work together to
further improve the Sino-U.S relations on a healthier, better
course, he said.
</P>
<P>
He told the president that the main purpose of his visit to
Washington is to make preparations for President Jiang Zemin's
state visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton said he is looking forward to President Jiang
Zemin's state visit, which will be followed by his state visit to
China. He said the mutual state visits are of great importance and
both China and the United States should from now make full
preparations and solve some specific problems in the Sino-U.S.
relations before there can be any positive results through
President Jiang Zemin's visit.
</P>
<P>
He said We will show to the world through President Jiang
Zemin's visit that the United States and China are committed to
making the 21st century a peaceful and prosperous one with

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Defenses Missile Deal With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today dismissed
U.S. criticism over its decision to purchase the Russian-made
anti-aircraft missile system S-300.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing today, Government
Spokesman Manolis Christofides said "we believe it is the
country's obligation and right to see to its defense because the
Turkish occupation force is illegally armed up to its teeth, with
American arms."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. President Bill Clinton's bi-monthly
report on Cyprus, the spokesman noted the Turkish forces, which
occupied the northern third of the island since 1974, have
brought a large number of heavy duty U.S.-made tanks.
</P>
<P>
In his report for last December-January period, Clinton
describes Cyprus' decision to purchase the S-300 as "doubly
regrettable," taking into consideration "the already excessive
levels of armaments in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also expressed concern over "threats of a military
strike by Turkey," linking them with the missile deal.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said the Cypriot government appreciates the
U.S. position on the Turkish threats. "We respect this position,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Turkey strongly opposes the Cypriot government's decision last
January to buy the Russian-made missiles and has threatened to
destroy them if they are deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman agreed with the U.S. government that "the
Cyprus problem will be solved through a dialog and not war."
</P>
<P>
However, Christofides dismissed part of the Clinton report
which claimed U.S. has successfully urged the Cypriot government
to delay the purchase of the missiles for 16 months.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. diplomacy did not pressure us on the delivery date," the
spokesman said, noting that the purchase contract defines the
date when the S-300 will be delivered.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Foreign Minister Yiannakis Cassoulides also told
reporters today that he sees no reason for carrying on with this
discussion on missiles, as all efforts should now be concentrated
on reaching a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"We can take unilateral decisions, when we believe the timing
is right, to help the climate" for a solution, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has call upon President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to
have face-to-face negotiations to find a over-all solution to
the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops landed and seized 37
percent of the territory after an Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Party Wins Yemen's Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Yemen's ruling People's Congress
Party has won a majority in the parliamentary elections, the
Supreme Elections Committee announced here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, among 247 constituencies which
have already been declared, the People's Congress Party led by
President Ali Abdullah Saleh so far has won 157 out of the 301
seats of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party's coalition partner the Islah Party won 43
seats and independent candidates and other small parties won 47
seats.
</P>
<P>
Candidates competing for the house stood at 2,311, of whom 754
are party nominees, and 1,557 independent ones. About 4.6 million
of the country's 16 million population were registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
Four parties boycotted the elections -- namely, the Yemen
Socialist Party, the Unionist Grouping Party, the League of
Yemenites and the Union of Popular Forces.
</P>
<P>
The elections, the first since a two-month civil war in 1994,
attract extensive Arab and world attention.
</P>
<P>
A total of 141 international observers supervised the
elections, including Arab observers and others from the European
Union, the United Nations and some other countries.
</P>
<P>
But the Islah Party said the ruling People's Congress party
violated the law by interfering in the counting, threatening that
it will withdraw form the election process. There were also
reports of bloody clashes during the elections.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Russian Proposal on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Government Spokesman
Manolis Christofides today expressed welcome to a Russian
proposal which he said could favorably contribute toward
efforts for a solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The Russian proposal was put forward Tuesday during a meeting
of the U.N. Security Council permanent members in New York.
</P>
<P>
Describing the proposal as "positive," Christofides said at
his daily press briefing today that "since we are still at the
preparatory stage, it can be used along with other documents," at
any stage of the negotiations for a Cyprus solution.
</P>
<P>
He said the two High Level Agreements reached between the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides in 1977 and 1979, the
U.N. Security Council resolutions on Cyprus and a set of ideas
proposed by the U.N. in 1992, are among documents on the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the Russian proposal notes that
the solution to the Cyprus problem would ensure the
establishment of a bicommunal, bizonal federation, which will
safeguard the existence of one independent and territorially
integral state, with a single sovereignty, international status and
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also rules out union of any part of Cyprus with
another country, as well as any form of division or secession.
It provides for the establishment of a demilitarized and
secular state.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the security of the future federal state,
which is one of the thorny issues in the Cyprus question, Russia
proposes it is safeguarded through international guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Christofides clarified that no decision was taken on the
Russian proposal by the five U.N. Security Council permanent
members, noting that a statement was issued after the meeting,
in which they outline how they see efforts to reach a solution
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has proposed a face-to-face
direct negotiation between President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to find a comprehensive solution to
the Cyprus problem by the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a coup
by some Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Arab Ministers Alert on Water Scarcity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Arab ministers of agriculture and
water resources today sounded warning of the scarcity of water in
the Arab region.
</P>
<P>
In the Cairo Declaration issued at the close of their two-day
conference, the ministers regard water as the region's "most
precious of natural resources" and the key for agricultural
programs and Arab food security.
</P>
<P>
The declaration spelled out the principles governing inter-Arab
cooperation in the use, development and protection of available
water resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We followed with deep concern external threats and policies
aimed at monopolizing and depleting water resources to which Arab
countries have legal share-rights," said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The ministers asserted the importance of resolutions adopted by
the Arab League Council on protecting Arab rights to joint water
resources with neighboring countries outside the Arab region.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo Declaration praised national efforts to maximize
exploitation of available water resources through technical and
investment programs.
</P>
<P>
The declaration called for mobilizing Arab water rights at all
regional and world forums.
</P>
<P>
The conference was jointly organized by the Arab Organization
for Agricultural Development and the Egyptian Ministry of
Agriculture and Land Reclamation.
</P>
<P>
The conference is attended by Arab League Assistant Secretary
General Abdel Rahman al-Sihbani, Chairman of the Arab Organization
for Agricultural Development Yehia Bakour, Arab ministers of
agriculture and representatives from Arab and international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
A recent study has showed that the scarity of water and the
indifference to the issue has blocked the agricultural development
in the Arab world that lies in the desert belt over the equatorial
zone.
</P>
<P>
The study, the work of the General Secretariat of the Union of
Arab Chamber, cautioned against the negative impact of the limited
water resources on future plans for self-sufficiency in cereals.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of water in the Arab world is used in
agriculture and the rate goes even higher in countries like Egypt,
Iraq, Morocco, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has predicted that the per capita quota of fresh
water in the Mideast and North Africa per year will nosedive from
3,300 to 650 cubic meters over the period from 1960 to 2025.
</P>
<P>
By then, the Arab states will have to settle with two thirds of
the amount used by Asian countries or seven times less than the
international average, according to the bank.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Appoint Resident Special Representative </HEADLINE>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said today that he plans to appoint, as a successor to
his current special envoy for Georgia, a resident special
representative who will be based in Tbilisi and Sukhumi.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Annan said this is part of
the efforts in response to the increased demands arising from a
strengthened United Nations involvement in the peacekeeping
process.
</P>
<P>
He said he also intends to convene a meeting with both sides at
an appropriate location to map out the areas where concrete
political progress can be made. To strengthen the political
element of the 125-member U.N. peacekeeping force in Georgia, he
also intends to appoint a few additional officers specialized in
political, civil and legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Georgia, Annan said both parties to the
conflict seem determined to continue their direct contacts and to
broaden their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to both sides to pursue, in this spirit, the
current discussions over the implementation of the decisions of 28
March 1997 adopted by the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States)
Council of Heads of State.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, it was decided that states members should
endeavor to reach, as soon as possible, a comprehensive political
settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, and an agreement
on the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes.

<HEADLINE> Major Remain Optimistic on Eve of Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Despite the media prediction that
the Conservatives would lose the election with a crushing defeat,
Prime Minister John Major today remained optimistic and confident
that his party's economic achievements could guarantee victory.
</P>
<P>
"No one can honestly question that the transformation in
Britain has been anything less than an economic miracle. It's too
good to give up," he told the last news conference in the six-week
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a tragedy if these opportunities were lost by the
false attraction of a well-packaged marketing scam," he added.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC, Major said he still thought this
election was there to be won. "There are huge numbers of people
who are undecided," he said.
</P>
<P>
An NOP/Reuters opinion poll released 17 hours before voting
begins showed the Conservatives lagging 22 points behind Labor,
riding high on the support of 50 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
But according to an opinion poll published by the Daily
Telegraph later today, the Labor Party's lead over the ruling
Conservatives has fallen seven points over the past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Gallup poll released in the newspaper put Labor's lead at
46 points, down five points from a day earlier, while the
Conservatives' supports were up two points to 33.
</P>
<P>
Major said he did not believe the opinion polls, which wrongly
forecast he would lose the last election in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"I don't share their opinion... that we're going to lose
tomorrow. I think this election is there to be won. There are huge
numbers of people who are undecided," Major told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
Most opinion polls conducted during the campaign period have
showed Labor leader Tony Blair enjoyed a comfortable lead of
around 20 percent over the Conservative party which has ruled
Britain for the past 18 years.
</P>
<P>
The 20-point lead showed by current polls would give Labor a
majority of around 200 seats, but the actual election outcome
would not be that size of victory and the majority could be around
100 seats.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Blair was also cautious about Thursday's result and
urged Britain's 44 million voters to come out and vote Labor to
avoid a fifth successive Conservative term.
</P>
<P>
"Let us together tomorrow come out, support the Labor Party,
build that better Britain and give our children the future they
need," he told voters in his last-day campaign tour.

<HEADLINE> Strong Pound Makes Rate Rises Unnecessary: NIESR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Interest rates do not need to rise
after the election on May 1, the National Institute of Economic
and Social Research (NIESR) said in a report on the UK economy
published today.
</P>
<P>
The institute believed an incoming government should resist
Bank of England pressure for a rate rise and should focus its
energies on delivering a budget designed to put the public
finances on to a sound fundamental.
</P>
<P>
That would involve a firm commitment to the existing spending
targets as well as higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
The NIESR said that the strong pound has reduced the dangers of
overheating in the economy, making higher interest rates
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
The institute argued that the 15 percent rise in sterling since
the autumn will slow the economy down this year, reducing the risk
of overheating.
</P>
<P>
It has cut its growth forecast for this year from 3.5 percent
to 2.6 percent and is forecasting another quiet performance next
year.
</P>
<P>
The NIESR also believed that the benefit of cheaper imports
will help reduce the underlying inflation rate to 2 percent later
this year and is forecasting the rate of well below the 2.5
percent target set by the government for next year as well.
</P>
<P>
However, Martin Weale, the NIESR's director, described the
existing position as "unhealthy" and estimated that the annual
borrowing requirement is 24 billion US dollars higher than it
should be at this stage of the cycle.
</P>
<P>
The institute called for prompt action, saying, "From a
political perspective there is no better time to tighten fiscal
policy than in the early part of a new parliament."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Panel Moves on Tighter TV Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A United States Senate panel is
moving forward on legislation that would either force more
detailed television ratings, or forbid the airing of violent shows
when children are likely to be watching.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Commerce Committee today is expected to agree to
send the bill to the full Senate, which reportedly would consider
it as early as next month.
</P>
<P>
The bill came four months after the TV industry began rating
programs. It would require broadcasters and most cable channels
to either provide more detailed information about shows' violent
content, or air those shows only when children are not likely to
be viewing.
</P>
<P>
An identical bill has been offered in the House, but hasn't
been acted upon. A House panel will hold a TV ratings hearing in
Peoria, Illinois, on May 19.
</P>
<P>
The action turns up the pressure on the TV industry to
voluntarily strengthen its six-tier, age-based ratings system,
which went into effect on January 1.
</P>
<P>
Existing ratings use designations ranging from "TV-G", programs
suitable for all ages, to "TV-MA", for mature audiences only.
Most shows have been rated "TV-PG", parental supervision suggested.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Communications Commission would determine during
what hours violent programs would be banned. It is unclear which
programs would qualify as violent.
</P>
<P>
Members of the TV industry, meanwhile, have been meeting to
consider possible changes, but no decisions have been made.
</P>
<P>
Motion Picture Association of America President Jack Valenti,
who oversaw the creation of the industry ratings, said no major
changes would be made unless parents wanted them. The industry
would begin polling parents in June.

<HEADLINE> Germany Assures Romania of Entry into NATO, EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 1 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel today assured Romanian authorities of Romania's admission
to NATO and the European Union (EU), but he stopped short of
pledging support for its bid to join among the first new members.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Romanian President Emil Constantinescu, Kinkel said
Germany is keen to build a partnership with Romania in political,
economic, and cultural fields. Germany fully supported Romania's
integration into Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, Kinkel, who was on a two-day visit here, refrained
from promising that Romania would be one of the first invited to
join NATO. The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland are so far
considered as most likely to be first.
</P>
<P>
He told Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea that it was
risky to make a promise to any applicant country.
</P>
<P>
The decision would be made at the alliance's summit in Madrid,
Spain, in July, he said, and any new recruitment would go ahead
only with endorsement from all its 16 members.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to give a promise, as any promise would be in
vain," Kinkel, who is also German Vice Federal Chancellor, told a
news conference later.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kinkel met his Romanian counterpart, Adrian Severin.
They discussed developing bilateral links and dialogue on
international issues. A new German consulate will be set up in
the western Romanian city of Timisoara in May.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel was accompanied by more than 200 entrepreneurs, who met
economic officials.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the biggest trade partner of Romania, a partner in a
fifth of Romania's trade volume since 1990. It is also the second
largest investor of the Eastern European country.

<HEADLINE> HK Returnee Rate Remains High in 1996: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's returnee rate, the
number of returnees recruited against that of staff who emigrated,
 remained high at 54 percent in 1996, a survey showed today.
</P>
<P>
The rate had peaked in 1995 at 60 percent, more than doubled
that recorded in 1994, according to a report published by the Hong
Kong Institute of Human Resource Management (IHRM).
</P>
<P>
The returning staff were mostly at managerial, supervisory and
professional levels and aged between 30 and 39, which was
consistent with the findings of IHRM's previous surveys.
</P>
<P>
They usually backed home from Canada, Australia and the United
States, the most popular destinations for Hong Kong emigrants.
</P>
<P>
The results also revealed that in 1996 about 0.82 percent of
the workforce left Hong Kong, slightly higher than the 0.76
percent recorded in 1995. Both figures were sharply lower than
those registered in early 1990's when there was a big outflow of
talents.
</P>
<P>
The institute surveyed over 180 companies covering all the
sectors of Hong Kong on a random basis before working out their
report.
</P>
<P>
Founded 20 years ago and ranking as a major human resources
management professional bodies in Hong Kong, the IHRM has
conducted annual surveys on emigrants, returnees and expatriates
since 1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
 Corporation (HSBC) is trying to expand its insurance capabilities
 in the Asia-Pacific region by entering into alliance with one of
the world's insurance giant.
</P>
<P>
The leading bank in Hong Kong and Royal &AMP; SunAlliance have
signed an agreement which enables the bank to provide non-life
insurance products to its customers.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, HSBC Insurance, a subsidiary of HSBC, is
able to sell insurance products in areas where it is not licensed
to operate at present. HSBC Insurance will co-operate in marketing
and sale of some insurance products of Royal &AMP; SunAlliance.
</P>
<P>
The agreement excludes Hong Kong and Singapore, where HSBC is
able to offer its own insurance products.
</P>
<P>
David Elton, chief executive officer of the Hong Kong bank
regarded the latest development as an evidence of HSBC's
commitment to providing a full range of financial services in the
region. "Royal &AMP; SunAlliance offers the best overall regional
presence to complement the existing service provided by HSBC
Insurance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Royal &AMP; SunAlliance is one of the largest general and life
insurance companies in the world. It has total assets of 55
billion sterling pounds in more than 120 countries.

MOSCOW, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and visiting United States Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright started talks today, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks will focus on an agreement governing Russian-North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) relations, European security
and Russian-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
During her last visit to Moscow, Albright and Primakov reached
an understanding in principle that a possible agreement between
Russia and NATO should be of legally-binding nature.
</P>
<P>
Before today's talks, Albright said she was not confident of
the agreement on Russian-NATO relations because the West had
already made every possible concession to Russia, said Itar-Tass.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers are expected to hold a joint news
conference after the talks.

<P>
XIAMEN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Xiamen Special Economic Zone
(SEZ) in southeast China's Fujian Province rose nine-fold in size
by absorbing Tong'an County today.
</P>
<P>
The county is now a district of Xiamen City. It covers a total
area of 1,079 sq km and has a population of 540,000. It used to be
the largest county in Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
This has enabled the 131-sq-km city of Xiamen to increase its
size by some nine times.
</P>
<P>
The county is the ancestral home to overseas Chinese living in
25 foreign countries and regions. It has attracted about 1.3
billion US dollars in overseas investment over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Last year the county, one of China's key production areas of
longan and vegetables, recorded a total industrial output value of
about 5.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The county is also noted for its production of peanuts, prawns
and lean-meat pigs for export.
</P>
<P>
Local observers say that the integration of Tong'an County with
Xiamen will greatly fuel the development of the overpopulated SEZ
and provide more rooms for its industries.

<HEADLINE> Australian Ministers Launch Attack On Hanson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of the Australian
Government today launched their most direct attack yet on
Independent MP Pauline Hanson, describing her as a threat to the
nation's future.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer strongly criticized Hanson's
anti-immigration and anti-Aboriginal policies, saying "the simple
truth is that Hanson's policies are job-destroying policies".
</P>
<P>
Downer's remarks were made today while addressing a gathering
of Australian ambassadors from throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett accused Hanson of abusing
Australia's democratic traditions by seeking to divide society,
"she would have us pit ourselves against Aboriginal communities,
she has done so much damage in terms of relationships with those
Australians who are of Asian origin", Kennett said over radio.
</P>
<P>
The officials' attack on Hanson came after opinion polls showed
her support rising to between 10 and 25 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
A Morgan Poll released in Tuesday suggested one in 10 people
would give their first preference to Hanson's One Nation Party,
while an AGB-McNair Poll found 25 percent of the respondents
supported Hanson.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trio Stands Fair Chance of St. Bride Vase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Wang Tao, Liu Guoliang
and Kong Linghui, the trio who won China's 12th Swaythling Cup for
the men's team event on Wednesday, stands a fair chance in the
men's singles contention at the World Table Tennis Championships.
</P>
<P>
"All three have a chance to win the St. Bride Vase for the
singles top honor," said Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua, who has
outmaneuvered his Swedish and South Korean counterparts with
smarter lineups in the quarter- and semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Wang, the oldest member of the Chinese team,
has showed that he is more than a doubles expert with impressive
singles play for a decade.
</P>
<P>
The stocky lefthander, who won the deciding game against Jorgen
Persson in China's 3-2 victory over Sweden in the 1991
championship final and downed the Swede again in China's 3-1
quarter-final win on Monday, has never won world or Olympic
singles event.
</P>
<P>
"I really want to end my career with a singles championship,"
said Wang, who has won respect from top world players.
</P>
<P>
"Wang Tao is one of the greatest players and he has ability and
mentality to be a singles champion here," said South Korean ace
Kim Taek Soo.
</P>
<P>
Olympic double gold medalist Liu, who has kept a clean book
against Sweden's table tennis great Jan-Ove Waldner, is also a
title hopeful.
</P>
<P>
"Liu plays a lightning-fast game in penhold grip, the style
that Europeans don't get used to," said the Chinese coach.
</P>
<P>
"Liu is the most favored for the singles championship," said
Waldner, the only male who has won a Grand Slam of the Olympic,
world championship and World Cup titles.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guoliang, whose name means "pillar of the country" in
Chinese, is hailed as a reviver of the penhold style, which was
predicted to end up in a Darwinian-style extinction as more
players were turning to handshake grip.
</P>
<P>
Playing a modified penhold style, Liu sticks rubbers on both
sides of the racket and plays topspins with backhand. Tricky
serves and excellent footwork are his major assets.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Kong Linghui is the other Chinese favorite
in the singles event if history and form don't turn against him.
</P>
<P>
The men's singles game has been so closely contested that no
one has succeeded in defending his title since Chinese Jiang
Jialiang won the championship in 1985 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Jan-Ove Waldner lifted the singles title in 1989 and
conceded it to teammate Jorgen Persson in 1991. Gatien took the
1993 event but fell under a giant-killing spree by Kong in the
1995 Worlds.
</P>
<P>
"I will try my best to regain the title," said the 21-year-old
Kong, who outlasted former world champion Jean-Philippe Gatien in
China's 3-1 final victory over France on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Those able to break the Chinese stronghold are Waldner,
Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus, Gatien and Jean-Michael Saive of
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, the greatest table tennis improviser the world has
ever seen, reached his top form as he grabbed the only point in
the quarter-final, beating world No. 1 Kong for the fifth straight
time.
</P>
<P>
Fourth-ranked Samsonov, the most improved player in the world
since the 1995 championships, plays a consistent game without
obvious loopholes. The 21-year-old Belarussian made himself as
title-hopeful as he just conceded 13 points in a straight-set
routing of Waldner in a men's team group match.
</P>
<P>
Gatien and Saive, the most aggressive players in the world who
played in the 1993 championship and 1994 World Cup finals, remain
the threats to the best.

<P>
"Despite the fact that the ASEAN leaders have agreed to accept
the three countries, they have yet to determine the appropriate

said.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the ASEAN foreign ministers need to meet to reach an

<P>
Results of the meeting could be in the form of a recommendation

said.
</P>
<P>
Alatas reiterated the ASEAN stance to accept the three
countries as new members without any pressure from advanced
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the results of the Kuala Lumpur meeting, they will
not be influenced by any pressure from advanced nations," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said there are other topics that will be taken up during the
Kuala Lumpur meeting but the entry of the three nations will be
given priority.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the membership of the three nations will not be
based on domestic developments in those countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> Memo Signed to Regulate Internet Domain Name Registration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 150 delegates from all over the
world signed a memorandum of understanding here today to regulate
registration of generic Internet Top Level Domain names (gTLDs)
after a three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The self-regulatory framework under the memorandum consists of
the Depository of the gTLD memorandum, a gTLD Policy Advisory
Body, a gTLD Policy Oversight Committee, a Council of Registrars
and Administrative Domain Name Challenge Panels.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the memorandum will cover only seven
newly-created gTLDs: .firm, .store, .web, .arts, .rec, .info
and .nom, and their registrars.
</P>
<P>
Before the expiration of an agreement giving the United
States-based Network Solutions Inc monopoly on registration
of .com, .org, and .net, the three existing domains and its
registrars will not be subject to the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure, the National Science Foundation, a U.S.
government entity, has announced that it will not renew the
agreement when it expires in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The memo will not cover the two-character TLD name space within
the Domain Name System, which is reserved for ISO 3166 country
codes from .af for Afghanistan to .zw for Zimbabwe, and some other
special TLDs.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the Geneva meeting have arrived at no agreement on
the issue of selecting 28 registrars among seven regions in the
world by lottery as recommended by the Internation Ad Hoc
Committee to the session.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,000 relic gulls, a
species of rare bird, have been found living on the Ordos Plateau
in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The relic gull, with a dark head, red legs and white plumage,
is a type of bird on the verge of extinction, and is now under
first-class state protection in China.
</P>
<P>
Merely about 3,000 mature pairs survive in the world, mainly in
China, Russia and Mongolia, and some 40 percent of them live on
lakes in the Ordos desert region.
</P>
<P>
There was no record of the bird in China before 1987. But since
then Chinese experts have made seven investigation tours of the
Ordos Plateau and found at least three major breeding places of
the birds, with some 1,500 mature pairs on the plateau in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"To find such a large group of rare birds is really encouraging
when so many species are in an alarmingly dangerous situation,"
said an expert from an international bird organization.

<HEADLINE> Moi: Kenya to Protect Local Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
today assured Kenyans that his government would protect local
industries from unfair competition from imports.
</P>
<P>
The president told a mass rally in commemoration of the
International Labour Day that a liberalized market should not
lead to unchecked import of goods.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that the unchecked import of goods was to kill local
industries as some imported goods were subsidized and dumped in
Kenya's market.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Kenya's sugar and textile industries were
most seriously affected, leading to thousands of tons of sugar
unsold and dozens of textile factories closed following its
economy liberalized.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has undertaken economic reform programs for several
years in order to stimulate its economy into faster growth.
</P>
<P>
However, some of the measures taken during the reforms brought
difficulties to the low income category, rural population and
vulnerable groups such as women and the youth.
</P>
<P>
Moi pointed out that "we have gone past the worst part of this
process", adding that Kenya would continue its reform process as
the economic reform programs are "far from complete."
</P>
<P>
He said that his government was negotiating with donor
agencies to find a workable formula for further reform of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
In his address, the Kenya leader urged Kenyan people to
exploit the East African Co-operation and Common Market for East
and Southern Africa which, he said, the Kenyan government "has
spent much time and energy to build".
</P>
<P>
He noted that "time has come for Kenya to export its skilled
manpower" through the two regional bodies which can be used for
job creation and business opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Irish Beef not Banned in UAE But Difficult to Sell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The ban on the import of Irish
beef has been lifted in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but
Ireland is still facing difficulties to share the local market, an
Irish official has said.
</P>
<P>
"The ban has been lifted only on paper but not from the minds
of the people", B.C George, general manager of Ireland's Farm
Fresh LLC in Dubai, one of the seven emirates of the UAE, was
quoted as saying by the local daily Khaleej Times today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks a week before the arrival of the first
consignment of Irish beef to Dubai after the UAE officially
revoked the ban on April 12.
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed by the UAE government since the scare of
the Bovine Spongform Encephalities (BSE), or mad cow disease,
surfaced in Europe, particularly in Britain and Ireland in April
1996. The disease reportedly could be transmitted to human beings.
</P>
<P>
Though the ban has been lifted, it is not easy for Irish beef
to re-establish itself in the UAE market, George said.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that currently there is a decline in the UAE
market for Irish beef because of fears on mad cow disease among
people and competition from Australian meat, which has become
very popular with UAE customers in the absence of Irish beef.
</P>
<P>
Many supermarkets in Dubai have shown no inclination to stock
Irish beef for the moment, since they stock Australian meat, as
well as meat from several other countries except European
countries, he proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
The Irish official said, however, he believed the decline is
just temporary and Irish beef could compete in the UAE market
with its "superior quality."
</P>
<P>
"The demand for Irish beef will spring back in the UAE once
people are convinced that Irish beef is free of mad cow
disease," he added.

<HEADLINE> Air France To Resume Paris-Shanghai Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Air France recently opened a
Shanghai office and announced that its direct flight from Paris to
Shanghai will resume next year.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Bullard, the airlines' regional general manager for the
Asia-Pacific, says that this reflects the increasing of number of
exchanges between the two countries and the city's importance as
China's commercial center.
</P>
<P>
Air France became the first European airline to enter the
Chinese market when it opened the Shanghai-Paris on March 30,
1947. Flights were halted in 1949, but service was restored in
1966, two years after the two countries resumed diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Flights stopped once more in 1973, when the French carrier was
allowed to fly directly to Beijing. There are four Paris-Beijing
flights weekly. Passengers from Shanghai have had to go to Paris
via Beijing or Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Paris flight takes ten hours. The new flight from
Paris to Shanghai will take 11.

SHANGHAI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- China's first railway, the
Songjiang-Shanghai line, which was laid by a British company in
1876, is being dismantled and all of the track and various
equipment will be put in a local museum.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after it began operation in 1876, the railway met with
a great deal of opposition because of fears of accidents, and the
Chinese government paid a large amount to purchase it from the
British owners and dismantled it.
</P>
<P>
The railway was rebuilt in 1896 and it extended from the
original 14.5 km to 16.1 km, entirely by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The railway has played an important role in the development of
the local economy, but in recent years it has been criticized for
disturbing traffic because of its location in the downtown area
and the threat it poses to vehicles and pedestrians.

<HEADLINE> Kim Young-sam Under Fire Over 1992 Campaign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The allegation that South Korean
President Kim Young-sam's ruling New Korea Party (NKP) spent much
more than the legal limit in the 1992 campaign is highlighted
after the first confirmation coming from an official of Kim's
party.
</P>
<P>
Kim Young-sam spent more than 150 million U.S. dollars for the
campaign, far exceeding the legal limit of 42 million dollars, Kim
Jae-dok, who worked as an accounting clerk in the NKP, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Though the NKP has claimed that it spent 32.6 million dollars
in the campaign, the opposition insisted that it told a lie and
demanded explanation on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung, an opposition party leader, alleged that
President Kim, then an opposition leader, received 2.3 million
dollars from then president Roh Tae-woo, who was sentenced
recently to 17 years in jail for mutiny, treason and taking bribe.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Hanbo group, which is under investigation for
a bribe-for-loan scandal, also provided huge amounts of money
during the 1992 campaign to President Kim.
</P>
<P>
The National Congress for New Politics (NCNP), another
opposition party, required Kim Young-sam, who took office in 1993,
to say whether Kim Dae-jung's allegation was true, while another
opposition leader Kim Jong-pil claimed that his United Liberal
Democrats (ULD) has evidence showing NKP's campaign spending
standing at 460 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far, NKP has dismissed as groundless the allegation. "Kim
Jae-dok was not in a position to know about the party's
expenditure during the campaign. We urge the opposition to stop
political maneuvering against us," its Secretary-General Park
Kwan-yong said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today protested to the
U.N. against the U.S. violations of its territorial waters, the
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Iraqi
permanent U.N. representative Nizar Hamdoon said that on March
19, two U.S. frigates were engaged in maneuvers three miles to
the south of Iraqi al-Badr port in the Gulf waters, with a
U.S. helicopter hoved ring over Iraqi boats.
</P>
<P>
Another helicopter flew over Iraqi trawler "Diala" in the area
on the same day, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
It asked the U.N. chief to intervene in the issue and stop the
U.S. repeated provocations that "stand counter to U.N. charter and
rules of international laws and constitute a flagrant violation of
the sovereignty of a U.N. member state," according to INA.
</P>
<P>
It stressed Iraq's "inalienable right" to compensation for the
damage caused by such breaches in conformity with the principle of
international liability.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.S. have been in a hostile state since August
1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. In early 1991 the U.S.-led allied
forces defeated Iraq and drove the Iraqi army out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 U.S. forces are stationed in the Gulf area to
contain any aggression attempts of Iraq. Following the Gulf war,
the allied forces also set up two no-fly zones in the Kurdish
north and Shiite south of Iraq depriving the central regime of
access to the areas.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Witnesses Increases of Technological Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's technology exports of
have been surged since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The change in the structure of technological exports is one
reason why many overseas businessmen have placed their confidence
in Shanghai technology, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Shanghai's technological exports had been confined
mainly to traditional technologies and practical skills. Over the
past years, the export of high and new technologies have made up a
larger proportion of the total exports.
</P>
<P>
The number of agencies engaged in exports of high and new
technologies in the city has increased from 300 to 350, which are
exporting 300 items of high and new technologies.
</P>
<P>
In addition to sponsoring and holding technological fairs
overseas, Shanghai has also cooperated closely with foreign firms
by jointly operating high and new technological businesses in
Shanghai, so as to increase availability of locally-produced
technological products on the overseas market with the aid of the
overseas partners. This method of exporting accounted for 70
percent of technological exports to Europe and America, said local
officials.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the city earned over 500 million
U.S. dollars from technological exports last year.

<P>
TOKYO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit a record same-day
jump, reaching as high as 127.47 yen today in Tokyo, its highest
level since August 1992. It was triggered by stop-loss buying.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was changing hands at 127.37-39 yen at 5 p.m., up
from 127.13-15 yen at 9 a.m. and from 127.05-15 late Wednesday in
New York.
</P>
<P>
On the stock market, the key Nikkei index advanced moderately
as large-capital stocks such as Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
(NNT) lifted sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index briefly topped a closing high for the year of
19,446.00 registered January 6, although late profit-taking erased
early substantial gains.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended at 19,275.33, up 124.21
points or 0.65 percent, from Wednesday's close.

<HEADLINE> Wages Data Send Australian Dollar Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed firmer
as a sharp rise in wage growth reported today headed off chances
of a cut in interest rates next week.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed at 78.45 U.S. cents from 78.20 at the
close Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With unemployment at 8.7 percent and the inflation outlook
previously unblemished, many in the market were tipping a 50-50
chance of a rate cut, but March quarter wages data released today
wiped out the chance of a rate cut.
</P>
<P>
The growth of 1.3 percent surprised the financial markets where
the highest forecast had been a quarterly rise of 1.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also hit a five-year high against the
Japanese yen, ending at 99.95 from 99.21, and against the German
mark it closed at 1.3591 from 1.3493.

<HEADLINE> China Proposes Greater U.N. Role Against Transnational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China today called on the United
Nations to play a greater role in the fight against organized
transnational crime.
</P>
<P>
At the Sixth Session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and
Criminal Justice here, Zhang Geng, Deputy Minister of Justice and
head of the Chinese Delegation, said the U.N., as the largest
international organization, should become an information exchange
center and provide member states with prompt information services
and establish mechanisms to coordinate extradition and other legal
matters among member states.
</P>
<P>
He said an international instrument such as a convention
against organized crime should be elaborated in light of the
expansion and increasing damage of organized transnational crime.
</P>
<P>
Zhang called on the international community to provide
technical assistance to developing countries, which have the
majority of the world's population, relatively backward economy
and technology and are faced with more serious actual and
potential threats by organized transnational crime.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also said all states should strengthen cooperation in
accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit and
principles of international law, instead of the consideration of
ideology and values, so that criminals will not be able to find
any safe haven.

<HEADLINE> HK Polytech University Emphasizes Language Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Polytechnic
University is introducing a series of changes in all its full-time
programs including compulsory subjects in English, Putonghua
(Mandarin), written Chinese and general education.
</P>
<P>
According to the university, the next intake of full-time
students must pass the mandatory language subjects before they
will be awarded their qualifications. In certain programs, the
language grades may contribute to the classification of the final
award.
</P>
<P>
The schedule of the university shows that the mandatory
provision of English will be introduced in 1997-98 while that for
Putonghua and written Chinese will start in the following year.
However, some departments have elected to make the Chinese
subjects mandatory in their curricula in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Poon Chung-kwong, president of the university, said that these
changes will be introduced because it is important for the
university to produce the preferred graduates who are competent
not only in professional skills, but also in their languages and
communications skills.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that English would remain the normal medium of
formal instruction as the institution will continue to promote a
bilingual culture and ethos.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the university has set aside 8 million HK dollars
(1.03 million U.S. dollars) for the establishment of an
independent General Education Center. The core staff of this
center will offer a variety of subjects grouped under five major
headings: scientific, historical, philosophical, aesthetic and
value judgments.

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Strengthen Cooperation in Combating Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to strengthen
cooperation with other countries and international organizations
in combating and preventing organized transnational crime, a
senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
China's deputy minister of justice, Zhang Geng, made the
remarks in a speech at the Sixth Session of the Commission on
Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the Chinese government appreciates the efforts
by the United Nations in crime prevention and criminal justice and
has taken an active part in U.N. activities in the area.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to strengthen cooperation with other governments
and international organizations and make our contributions to the
joint efforts in combating and preventing organized transnational
crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that in the past few years, China's law enforcement
authorities cracked numerous cases in southeast China involving
killing, kidnapping and racketeering by members of criminal gangs
which entered China from overseas.
</P>
<P>
They also assisted police authorities of other countries in
tracking down and arresting members of criminal gangs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China amended its Criminal Law recently to
enhance the fight against organized crime, money-laundering,
terrorist crime, trafficking of illegal immigrants and
environment-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
The amended penal code will play a greater role in combating
transnational crime after it comes into force on October 1, 1997,
he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, China has signed 32 judicial assistance
agreements with 25 countries and extradition agreements with six
countries, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"We have also cooperated with other countries with which no
agreements have been signed on a case by case basis in the
principle of mutual benefit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the Chinese government is ready to expand its
cooperation with other countries, including signing more
agreements, on the basis of mutual respect for each other's
sovereignty, judicial independence and dignity.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Stock Index Tops 13,000 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Share Prices on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange rose sharply today with the Hang Seng Index (HSI)
climbing 117 points to close at 13,020.
</P>
<P>
The HSI, a key indicator for blue chips at the local bourse,
has increased 420 points in the past two trading days and
re-exceeded the 13,000 points after 35 trading days in nearly two
months.
</P>
<P>
On December 20 last year, the HSI for the first time exceeded
the 13,000 level but fell from that level on March 13.
</P>
<P>
Stock market analysts noted that one of the favorable factors
for the surging of the share prices is the upward trend in the
property HSI sub-index. In the last two trading days, it rose
1,243 points with 666 points on Wednesday and 577 points today.
</P>
<P>
The turnover was also on the high level, at 13.819 billion HK
dollars (1.78 billion U.S. dollars) on Wednesday and 12.496
billion HK dollars (1.67 billion U.S. dollars) today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts stressed that this week the stock market in Tokyo and
New York are also on the rise, which has promoted the rebounding
on the Hong Kong stock market.
</P>
<P>
A financial specialist in New York has predicted that in May
there is little opportunity for the interest rate of the U.S.
dollar to be raised, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They said that the share prices on the Hong Kong stock market
will stay on the level of 13,000 points for a time.

<HEADLINE> Al-Assad, Mubarak Meet in Sharm el Sheikh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held talks on ways to revive the
stalemated Mideast peace process in Sharm el Sheikh at the southern
tip of the Sinai peninsula today.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are expected to continue their frequent
consultations on the need to achieve a just, comprehensive and
durable peace in the region, the Egyptian MENA news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian president, accompanied by Egyptian Ambassador to
Syria Mahmoud Shokri, this morning arrived on a lightning visit to
the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, about 500
kilometers southeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The meeting topped Mubarak's renewed diplomatic offensive to
revive the stalled peace effort by visiting Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from the two countries, Mubarak said he was
ready to organize a mini Arab summit grouping Jordan's King
Hussein, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Al-Assad but he made
this conditional on Israel's readiness to take steps to end the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak last week also offered to host a four-way summit
grouping Israel's prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Arafat and
Hussein, on the condition that Israel halts settlement buildings
on Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
Syria has been advocating a comprehensive Arab summit to and
stronger reaction to confront the Israeli settlement practice, but
Egypt said such a move is still premature.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria began negotiations in 1991. But Israel broke
off the off-again, on-again talks last February after a spate of
suicide bomb attacks in Israel blamed on Palestinian extremists.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists it will not return to the negotiating table with
the Israeli government unless it first agrees to pull out of the
Golan Heights, captured by the Jewish state in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu rejects the demand, saying that the strategic plateau
is vital to Israel. But his predecessors, labor Party leaders
Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, reportedly verbally accepted an
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in return for normalized ties
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday Mubarak warned that Israel's hard-line policies
have catapulted the peace process to a "dark and dangerous
impasse."
</P>
<P>
Equally dangerous, he said, is the current stalemate on the
Syrian-Lebanese track "that is tempting the enemies of peace on
both sides to finish it off and drag the region to a dangerous
crossroads."
</P>
<P>
He insisted that a comprehensive settlement should be based on
the principle of land for peace.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian talks also broke down when Netanyahu shrugged
off international criticism on February 26 and approved
construction of the first 2,500 homes for Jews in the Har Homa
neighborhood of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be their future capital
but Israel insists that Jerusalem remain undivided.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with the
Jewish state, has been a mediator in the peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has restated its foreign
policy of peaceful co-existence with neighboring countries,
calling for the establishment of a regional commission on the
settlement of boundary disputes.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Gulf of Guinea Commission shall comprise
Cameroun, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Sao Tome and Principe and
Nigeria, and be empowered to settle boundary disputes between
member states.
</P>
<P>
The call was made on Wednesday by Oladipo Diya, chief of
general staff, when he opened a meeting of the Joint Committee on
the Delimitation of Nigeria-Equatorial Guinea Maritime Boundary
in Abuja, the Nigerian capital.
</P>
<P>
According to Diya, such a commission should also be charged
with responsibility to demarcate maritime boundaries between
member states in addition to ensuring economic and agricultural
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We have a duty to prove to the international community that
Africans are determined to solve their own seemingly intractable
problems and conflicts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot continue to depend on others for solutions to our
internal problems," Diya added.
</P>
<P>
Boundary disputes have hampered the development of relations
and economic cooperation between neighboring countries in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroun have witnessed clashes in recent years
over the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula in the Gulf of Guinea since
1992.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have pledged to reduce military tensions on the
border and improve relations. The dispute is till waiting for the
arbitration of the International Court of Justice at the Hague.

<HEADLINE> Zaire's Mobutu, Kabila to Hold Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko
and rebel leader Laurent Kabila finally agreed today to begin
their first ever face-to-face talks at sea in a bid to seek a
peaceful solution to the country's spreading civil war.
</P>
<P>
Zairean officials said the meeting, initially planned for
Friday and to be mediated by South African President Nelson
Mandela, had been postponed till Saturday. The venue remains a
South African navy ship in international waters off Africa.
</P>
<P>
The encouraging step was welcomed by the United Nations
Security Council and other related countries currently mediating
the Zairean peace.
</P>
<P>
Kabila left his headquarters in southeastern Zaire earlier
today to visit some neighboring countries to prepare for the
coming South African-brokered talks.
</P>
<P>
Although the rebel leader claimed that the talks are aimed at
discussing how President Mobutu hand over his power gracefully,
there is no sign that the ailing president would step down.
</P>
<P>
A presidential spokesman said in capital Kinshasa that Mobutu,
currently troubled by cancer, had dropped plans to leave for
Gabon today en route for the talks.
</P>
<P>
"We understand the talks have been postponed until Saturday,"
Zairean Information Minister Kin-Kiey Mulumba announced.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, United States envoy Bill Richardson told reporters
in Kinshasa on Wednesday that there were no preconditions for the
talks.
</P>
<P>
At rebel headquarters in Lubumbashi, Zaire's second largest
city, a rebel spokesman said Kabila was surprised Richardson had
said "several African leaders" would attend the talks on the
supply ship Sas Outeniqua. The rebels do not want the talks to
turn into a mini-summit.
</P>
<P>
Richardson, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., did not persuade
Kabila to accept a truce ahead of talks or a transitional
government before elections -- key components of a U.N. peace
plan devised by its special envoy, Mohamed Sahnoun, who will
attend the talks.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's rebels, who took up arms last October, have now been
in control of over half of the Zairean territory.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said the rebels, on their march toward capital
Kinshasa, have now departed from their new forward base at
Kikwit, 400 km to Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
They also grabbed Bumba, south of Gbadolite, with no
resistance on Tuesday and were set to take Mobutu's nearby birth
place at Lisala.

<HEADLINE> Al-Assad Arrives in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad
arrived in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh today
for talks with President Hosni Mubarak on the stalled Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Al-Assad would top Mubark's renewed diplomatic
offensive to revive the stalled peace effort by visiting Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from the two countries, Mubarak said he was
ready to organize a mini Arab summit grouping Jordan's King
Hussein, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Al-Assad but he made
this conditional on Israel's readiness to take steps to end the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak last week also offered to host a four-way summit
grouping Israel's prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Arafat and
Hussein, on the condition that Israel halts settlement buildings
on Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
Syria has been advocating a comprehensive Arab summit to make
stronger reaction to confront the Israeli settlement practice, but
Egypt said such a move is still premature.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria began negotiations in 1991. But Israel broke
off the off-again, on-again talks last February after a spate of
suicide bomb attacks in Israel blamed on Palestinian extremists.

<HEADLINE> British Begin Casting Ballots in General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain's 44 million voters today
began to cast their ballots in around 45,000 polling stations
nationwide in the long-awaited general election.
</P>
<P>
They will choose between John Major, the current Prime Minister
and leader of the ruling Conservative party, and Tony Blair,
leader of the major opposition Labor Party, to form a government
for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Security has been tightened in streets and around polling
stations for fear that the Ireland Republic Army (IRA), which
fights against British rule of Northern Ireland, might disrupt the
voting process.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, several explosions and bomb threats
have caused chaos and losses of millions of dollars in the country.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major is seeking an unprecedented fifth
consecutive term, but has lagged behind the Labor leader Tony
Blair around 20 points during the six-week election campaign, the
longest in this century.
</P>
<P>
The last opinion polls released early Thursday morning still
put the Labor a lead between 10 to 22 points.
</P>
<P>
The Labor, meanwhile, is highly expected to oust the 18-year
rule of the Conservatives since Blair became the leader three
years ago and moved away from its socialist roots toward the
center of British politics.
</P>
<P>
Around 3,700 candidates have registered to run for 659 seats in
the House of Commons. The election results will come out on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the previous election in 1992, 77.8 percent of the
electorate of 43.2 million voted. The Conservatives won 336 seats
in the lower house and Labor 272.

<HEADLINE> 761 PKK Rebels Killed in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security forces killed 761
rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in the
military operations in southeastern Turkey in the first four
months of this year, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that 73 security personnel including village
guards also died in the armed clashes with the PKK during this period.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 51 PKK members surrendered to the
Turkish security forces in the region over the past four months.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the government troops captured large
quantity of various kinds of weapons in the operations against
the PKK in the region.
</P>
<P>
The agency stressed that the government troops have been now
staging strong military operations in Tunceli of eastern Turkey
in a bid to wipe out the PKK guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
As there are better weather conditions in the mountainous
terrain in the region, the Turkish security forces are expected
to cross into northern Iraq to launch large-scale military
operations against the PKK rebels, who shelter themselves in the
area, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that about 150,000-strong Turkish troops are
stationed along the Turkish-Iraqi border lines to prevent the
PKK militants from infiltrating into Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a separatist war in southeastern
Turkey for autonomy since August 1984, in which more than 21,000
people, including PKK rebels, civilians and government troops
were killed.

<HEADLINE> Major Route for Drug Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Cai Guozhong)
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has in recent years become a
major international route for smuggling of narcotics including
heroin, cocaine, Mandrax and cannabis from Latin America and Asia
to Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
As it is difficult for drug traffickers to smuggle narcotics
directly from Latin America or Asia to Europe and U.S.A., Uganda
became an important transit point for the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Due to backwardness and lack of drug detection equipment, east
African countries, especially Uganda, have been a very
appropriate conduit for smugglers to ferry drugs outside.
</P>
<P>
The trend of drug smuggling through Uganda is very worrying.
In 1996, 12 foreign and 298 Ugandan smugglers were arrested and
prosecuted in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Ugandan authorities intercepted 3.7 kilograms
of heroin worth 82,000 U.S. Dollars, over 78 kilograms of Mandrax
tablets worth 679,000 Dollars, about four kilograms of cocaine
worth 800,000 Dollars, among others.
</P>
<P>
Because Uganda is backward in technology of detecting narcotic
drugs, only one out of ten smugglers have been arrested in the
country while nine have escaped legal punishment.
</P>
<P>
Traffickers usually export drugs disguised as tea, vanilla or
sesame to northern America or Europe through Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The amount of drugs seized by Ugandan Anti-Narcotic Unit are
on rise. For instance, the amount of heroine seized by the unit
increased from 2.8 kgs in 1994 to 3.2 kgs in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the increase of drug smuggling is that the
powerful Colombian "Cali Cartel", an international drug smuggling
group, is behind the movement of cocaine and heroine through
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In order to fight drug smuggling, the unit bought high-powered
speed motor boats in 1994 to help curb increasing drug smuggling
on Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
A lot of smuggled goods including narcotic drugs are coming
through Lake Victoria from Kenya to Uganda's landing site
Bukakata on shore of the lake, then move by road to other places
including Kampala and the Entebbe International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government has also sent some members of the unit
to Europe to learn how to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
After Zambia and South Africa, Uganda has already established
a national coordinating commission to combat drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's fighting against drug smuggling has got supports from
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP) has since
early 1990s given material support to Uganda in its effort to
combat drug smuggling, and the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) in July 1996 donated five motorcycles and one Hyunda
vehicle to the drug control project in the country's police
anti-narcotic unit.
</P>
<P>
However, anti-drug smuggling is a global issue. Nearly 150
billion U.S. Dollars worth of illicit drugs are sold worldwide
today, according to the UNDP.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, as a major conduit for narcotic drug trafficking in
the world, is facing an extremely hard and bitter struggle
against narcotic drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Signs Amended Social Security Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
signed here today an amended social security law, expanding the
coverage of the Social Security System (SSS) that will give more
benefits to millions of private workers in the Philippines,
including farmers and self-employed people.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, the presidential office said
that also included in the coverage are overseas workers,
fisherfolk, household helpers, household managers and more than
355,000 pensioners.
</P>
<P>
Pensioners will benefit from increased minimum levels of
retirement, disability, and death pensions, the presidential
office said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new law, the minimum monthly pension for those
who meet the requirement of contributions is 1,000 pesos (about 35
U.S. dollars). But pensioners with 20 or more credited years of
service can look forward to a minimum monthly pension of 2,000
pesos (70 dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, workers employed in private enterprises
join the SSS compulsorily, while others, such as artists,
freelance writers and those who work for foreign embassies and
international organizations participate in the system on a
voluntary basis.

BUCHAREST, April 30 (Xinhua) -- German Vice Chancellor and

<P>
He added that NATO will keep its door open to countries which

<HEADLINE> Iran to Pursue "Look East" Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to pursue "Look East"
policies to expand its relations with Asian countries due to the
on-going diplomatic battle between Iran and European countries, an
Iranian top diplomat was quoted by the official news agency IRNA
today.
</P>
<P>
"Look East" policies will be brighter in the future and
Iran's ties with Asian countries will be expanded with greater
momentum, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Alaeddin Boroujerdi made
the remarks here Wednesday evening during a meeting with the
ambassadors of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and
Brunei.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed relations between Iran and the members of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the
recent developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian deputy foreign minister for Asia-Oceania described
the future of relations with ASEAN countries as "even more
promising."
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi said that the recent developments proved this
principle more than ever before that the Asian countries are
important power base in the future world should the countries
strengthen ties and expand links with each other even more.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has to make a shift in its foreign
policy from "Look West" to "Look East" because there are too
much political pressure from the European countries.
</P>
<P>
The April 10 Berlin court verdict, accusing top Iranian leaders
behind the killing of four Kurdish opposition leaders at Mykonos
restaurant in Germany in 1992, sparked a crisis in relations
between Iran and Germany and other European countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Iran had recalled their ambassadors and expelled
four diplomats from each side. Ambassadors from the European
Union (EU) member nations, except Greece, had also been recalled
from Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that it would take a long time for Iran and the
EU member nations to amend their relations since the Iranian
government adopted a tough stance to the Declaration issued by the
EU in Luxembourg on April 29. Iran announced Wednesday that German
and Danish ambassadors were unwelcome back to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
At a ministerial meeting concluded in Luxembourg Tuesday, the
EU decided to suspend the "critical dialog" with Iran and to stop
the ministerial level contact between the two sides and continue
its arms embargo on Iran.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair's Labor Party is heading for a large Commons
majority in today's general election to end a record of 18 years
of Tory government.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Major Wednesday made an impassionate
plea to wavering voters to deliver a fifth Conservative term of
office to the Tories, as opinion polls showed Labor has an
apparently unassailable advantage in today's general election.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The scale of Labor's lead over the Conservatives in Gallup's
final survey for The Daily Telegraph has retreated from the
borders of incredible. Nevertheless, the Conservative Party has
never had the support of such a small proportion of voters on the
eve of polling day.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Political leaders Wednesday handed the election over to the
people, with appeals for their support in a ballot that will
either return Tony Blair, 43, as the youngest prime minister, or
give John Major the first fifth term for one party since 1828.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor goes into today's general election poised to win only
its third working majority of the 20th century, and its first for
31 years, if today's results vindicate overwhelming eve-of-poll
evidence that voters have embraced Tony Blair's "time for a
change" campaign after 18 years of Conservative rule.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reinforces Foothold In South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel has redoubled its efforts
to strengthen its presence in the occupied "security zone"
in south Lebanon pending a political settlement, according to a
report of the pro-government Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Brig.-Gen. Eli Amitai, commander of the Israeli Lebanon Corps,
said in an interview with the Air Force Magazine this week
that the air force had in the past three months used
advance weaponry in a number of missions against Hezbollah
guerillas in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate but said that the air force was
using new weapons that allow for much greater accuracy. "We
have hit the terrorists in places where they are still
gathering before setting out. The other side understands very
well the change and is being more careful now," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the London-based Jane's Defense Weekly as
saying that Israel has recently doubled the number of its
troops in south Lebanon to 2,000 men.
</P>
<P>
Amitai, who survived two direct Hezbollah attacks since taking
over command of the Israeli forces in Lebanon, said: "Today we
are attacking targets based on intelligence information and action
against infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
He admitted, however, that the Hezbollah group had also
acquired new weapons, saying that his forces found 17
shoulder-held Strella missiles hidden in a cave in the Litani
area. The missiles are capable of shooting down jets and
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
There have also been reports that Hezbollah fighters have
received new type of rockets capable of reaching the interior
area of Israel.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran today condemned an
assassination attempt on Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov, who
suffered a minor leg injury from a hand grenade Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported Mahmoud Mohammadi,
spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, denounced such violent
acts, expressing hope that the belligerent Tajik sides will do all
in their power to safeguard the achievements of the peace talks
until national reconciliation is full in place in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik president was wounded in the legs Wednesday by a
hand grenade thrown at his feet as he got out of a car during a
visit to the northern town of Khojand.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed and 60 others injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The assassination attempt against Rakhmonov came at a time
when his hard-line government has been negotiating a peace
settlement with opposition groups that have been waging civil
war since 1992 in the impoverished Central Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
As a mediator, Iran had provided offices and other
facilities for the peace talks between the Tajik government and
the opposition groups in the past few months.

<HEADLINE> Report: Israeli-Turkish-US Military Exercises in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Turkey are working
to increase strategic ties, including holding joint military
exercises and combating terror, but both insist the strategic
alliance is not directed at any third party.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post reported that it was Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai's initiative to hold joint maneuvers
among Israel, Turkey and the United States who has already
agreed in principle.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai reportedly discussed the matter with his Turkish
counterpart Turhan Tayan, who is currently visiting Israel,
during their meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tayan, arrived here Wednesday, will fly to the North today
for a first-hand look at the Lebanese and Syrian borders and
the Golan Heights, and to receive a briefing from Amiram
Levine, Northern Command of the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
Tayan's visit is to set the stage for next week's meeting
with Turkish Deputy Chief of Staff Chabek Beer, who will be
leading the periodic strategic dialogue between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel is upgrading 54 F-4 fighters for the Turkish
air force in a deal worth over 600 million US dollars, and
both sides are discussing the possibility of another deal to
upgrade Turkey's F-5s in a deal worth over 300 million US
dollars, Israel Aircraft Industries officials said.
</P>
<P>
Israel is also competing with three other countries for a
deal to upgrade Turkey's M-60 tanks.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Tayan was received by a full military honor
guard at the Israeli Defense Ministry, after which he was
briefed on the threats facing Israel, particularly the
proliferation of surface-to-surface missiles and non-conventional
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai told Tayan that both Israel and Turkey suffer
from the threat of terror and that Israel is willing to
extend aid to Turkey in combating terror.
</P>
<P>
"The security cooperation between Israel and Turkey is not
directed against any third party," Mordechai said. "Cooperation
is vital for both countries and for strengthening the
stability of the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Tayan said the strategic cooperation "is not pointing arrows
at any third party, and Turkey sees relations as very
important and I believe they will bring stability to the
region and advance the peace process."

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Disappointed with U.S. 301 Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government today
expressed its disappointment at the decision of the U.S. Trade
Representative to place Hong Kong on the "Watch List" in the
context of its Special 301 review on the protection of
intellectual property rights (IPR).
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Hong Kong government said, "Given the
considerable and persistent anti-piracy efforts and initiatives
the government has made, we consider it most unjustified to place
Hong Kong on the list."
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong has been taking vigorous enforcement
action at the retail, distribution and importation levels.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Customs conducted over 1,000 raids and seized nearly
one million copies of CDs, VCDs, and CD-Roms, which was 164
percent of those seized in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the estimated value of the seizure was
47 million HK dollars (6.06 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has established a very good liaison network with IPR
enforcement authorities on the Chinese mainland to stop copyright
products from entering Hong Kong, he said, adding that a number of
parallel operations have been mounted with Customs and relevant
Chinese authorities at the border.
</P>
<P>
He said that courts are also handing down much heavier
penalties for persons convicted of copyright piracy. In 1996, 144
persons received immediate custodial sentences for offenses
relating to copyright piracy, compared with 18 in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Settlement Expansion Activities Stepped Up In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Jewish settlers have constructed
new fences and roads as part of their on-going moves to expand
settlements in the occupied West Bank, the state-run Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Eli Suissa toured the northern West Bank
Wednesday expressing government support for the settlers'
activities and promising more help for them.
</P>
<P>
The settlers revealed that the Interior Ministry had pledged
to allocate additional funds for the expansion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinians charged that 4,000 donams (375.6
hectares) of Palestinian-owned land had been confiscated to
allow the expansion of the Efrat Settlement.
</P>
<P>
Even Harow, a spokeswoman for Efrat, said that in 1991, the
settlement received 5,000 donams (469.5 hectares) of state-owned
land from the government. She claimed that of the 5,000 donams,
only 1,000 donams (93.9 hectares) had been developed so far. In
addition, she said, approximately 500 donams (46.95 hectares) on
Har Hazayit are being developed.
</P>
<P>
Yehudit Tayar, an official of the Council of Jewish
Communities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza, called the Palestinian
accusations ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that there is a land battle going on, and it
is no secret that the Palestinians have called for illegal
building in order to stop settlement expansion," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli Civil
Administration in the occupied West Bank, said that the
administration advertised in the Palestinian press two weeks ago
outlining the current project in Efrat and stipulating that
objections should be registered within 45 days.
</P>
<P>
On a live satellite interview broadcast on CNN Wednesday
night, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu denied the
government had planned to construct new settlements.
</P>
<P>
"Any construction taking place is within the current municipal
boundaries," he said, arguing that Palestinians are also
building in their villages.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has all along maintained that the occupied
Palestinian territories are part of the State of Israel.

<HEADLINE> Major Route for Drug Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Cai Guozhong)
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has in recent years become a
major international route for smuggling of narcotics including
heroin, cocaine, Mandrax and cannabis from Latin America and Asia
to Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
As it is difficult for drug traffickers to smuggle narcotics
directly from Latin America or Asia to Europe and U.S.A., Uganda
became an important transit point for the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Due to backwardness and lack of drug detection equipment, east
African countries, especially Uganda, have been a very
appropriate conduit for smugglers to ferry drugs outside.
</P>
<P>
The trend of drug smuggling through Uganda is very worrying.
In 1996, 12 foreign and 298 Ugandan smugglers were arrested and
prosecuted in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Ugandan authorities intercepted 3.7 kilograms
of heroin worth 82,000 U.S. Dollars, over 78 kilograms of Mandrax
tablets worth 679,000 Dollars, about four kilograms of cocaine
worth 800,000 Dollars, among others.
</P>
<P>
Because Uganda is backward in technology of detecting narcotic
drugs, only one out of ten smugglers have been arrested in the
country while nine have escaped legal punishment.
</P>
<P>
Traffickers usually export drugs disguised as tea, vanilla or
sesame to northern America or Europe through Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The amount of drugs seized by Ugandan Anti-Narcotic Unit are
on rise. For instance, the amount of heroine seized by the unit
increased from 2.8 kgs in 1994 to 3.2 kgs.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the increase of drug smuggling is that the
powerful Colombian "Cali Cartel", an international drug smuggling
group, is behind the movement of cocaine and heroine through
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In order to fight drug smuggling, the unit bought high-powered
speed motor boats in 1994 to help curb increasing drug smuggling
on Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
A lot of smuggled goods including narcotic drugs are coming
through Lake Victoria from Kenya to Uganda's landing site
Bukakata on shore of the lake, then move by road to other places
including Kampala and the Entebbe International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government has also sent some members of the unit
to Europe to learn how to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
After Zambia and South Africa, Uganda has already established
a national coordinating commission to combat drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's fighting against drug smuggling has got supports from
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP) has since
early 1990s given material support to Uganda in its effort to
combat drug smuggling, and the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) in July 1996 donated five motorcycles and one Hyunda
vehicle to the drug control project in the country's police
anti-narcotic unit.
</P>
<P>
However, anti-drug smuggling is a global issue. Nearly 150
billion U.S. Dollars worth of illicit drugs are sold worldwide
today, according to the UNDP.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, as a major conduit for narcotic drug trafficking in
the world, is facing an extremely hard and bitter struggle
against narcotic drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Free Trade Among SAARC States to Start in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 1 (Xinhua) -- South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is making hectic efforts to start
free trade among its seven member states by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
It is need of the hour that the mutual trade among the SAARC
countries be promoted for the well-being and economic prosperity
of the people in the region, said President of the SAARC Chamber
of Commerce and Industry (CCI) Salman F. Rahman of Bangladesh,
according to local newspaper reports today.
</P>
<P>
SAARC groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of a meeting between the CCI and the
Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Salman
said Wednesday in Lahore, capital of Punjab province, that the
liberalization of trade and reforms are the order of the day in
the world. Therefore, SAARC countries should ignore the political
cooperation to promote regional trade.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the private sector is being given top-most
importance in the world and the South Asian countries should also
bury the hatchet and boost mutual trade ties to bring about
economic revolution in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We have very limited time to enhance trade activities among
the SAARC countries as we have to strengthen each other by the
year 2005 so that in the free global trade, we could survive and
complete with the established economies of the world," Salman
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that SAARC countries constitute 25 percent of the world
population but the quantum of trade among themselves is merely
three percent of total trade which they carry out with other
countries.

<HEADLINE> Tajik Opposition Condemns Terrorist Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Tajik opposition today
condemned the attempt on the life of President Emomali Rakhmonov,
in Khudjand, a northern city of Tajikistan, saying it is "a purely
criminal act."
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred at 10:30 a.m. local time (0530 GMT) when a
lone assailant hurled a grenade at President Rakhmonov, who was
getting out of his car at a theater to attend celebrations marking
the 65th anniversary of the Khudjand University.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed and more than 60 were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The attacker, identified as Firdavs Dustboboyev, 26, was
detained immediately after the incident.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the Itar-Tass, opposition
alliance leader Abdumalik Abdulladjanov ruled out a political
motivation of the assassination and said the opposition has
nothing to do with criminals.
</P>
<P>
Abdulladjanov said the opposition alliance and his party
National Revival "have always been and will continue to be against
resolving problems by forcible means."
</P>
<P>
Tajik presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov called the
assassination attempt "an open political action."
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov, who was wounded in the leg, vowed that the
terrorists will be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
Describing the situation in Tajikistan as "extremely complex,"
Abdulladjanov said the terrorist action might have been caused by
a complicated social and economic situation in the nation.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders said the attack was possibly related to
the recent events in Khudjand city where security forces killed
around 20 prisoners, who rioted in a local prison.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Russian President Boris Yeltsin also condemned
the terrorist action against Rakhmonov.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Hot Property Raises Fears of Thai-Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Despite precautionary measures taken
by the Philippine Central Bank, the country's stock market
continued to slide sharply Wednesday amid fears that a Thai-style
financial crisis could occur in the country.
</P>
<P>
Weak corporate earnings, coupled with wide-spread nervousness
over bank lending to the property sector, made Tuesday's stock
market in the Philippines fall 4.5 percent, or 128.87 points, to
2708.44, the lowest level in two years.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to allay fears of a property-related financial
crisis, the central bank Tuesday enforced the 20 percent cap on
bank lending to real estate firms and gave banks one year to do
so. However, the market fell further Wednesday by 60.27 points to
2648.17.
</P>
<P>
What has happened in the Philippines in the past few days shows
that foreign investors' confidence in the country has not been
restored since a property-related crisis took place in Thailand
recently, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
That is why foreign investors continued to shift their funds to
markets in other regions in spite of precautions taken recently by
the central bank, they said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, financial and securities companies in
Thailand borrowed a large amount of U.S. dollars at low interest
rates and loaned up to 30 percent of their portfolios to the
property sector.
</P>
<P>
The moves resulted in over-supply of housing units. In Bangkok
last year, 600,000 square meters of office space came on the
market, of which more than half remains unleased. But another
900,000 square meters is planned for this year and 1.3 million
square meters for next year.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Thailand, the Philippines' picture looks better.
Central bank limits keep banks from putting more than 30 percent
of total loans in any one sector. The Philippine Central Bank
indicated in a study that property lending accounted for an
average of 11 percent of banks' loan portfolios in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But some economists said that banks' real exposure to the
property sector is much higher than the official data, perhaps
ranging from 15 percent to 24 percent of the total portfolios.
</P>
<P>
If a Thai-style crisis happens anywhere, analysts said, the
dubious honor could go to the Philippines, partly because of its
spectacular loans growth over the past several years and its high
U.S. dollar borrowing.
</P>
<P>
While total bank assets in the country have increased 25
percent annually on average between 1992 and 1996, bank loans
surged 42 percent in 1996 after jumping 43 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the Thai-style crisis, the bank took steps to limit
bank exposures to the property sector. In the Philippines, where
property is used as collateral for a loans, banks now can not lend
more than 60 percent of the appraised value of that property. That
is the new banking rule in addition to the 20 percent limit
imposed on banks' real estate lending.
</P>
<P>
Economists hailed the precautions taken by the central bank,
saying that the news rules could cool down the over-heating of the
property sector in the future.
</P>
<P>
But they still doubt the measures could restore investors'
confidence in the country soon.

<P>
HARARE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- About 7,000 solar lighting systems
have been installed in rural areas of Zimbabwe under the United
Nations Global Environment Project, now in its final year of the
pilot phase.
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1993, the five-year pilot program funded by the
U.N. Development Program (UNDP) and the Zimbabwe government, taps
the abundant solar energy through the installation of low-cost
photovoltaic systems, according to a UNDP spokesman today.
</P>
<P>
The initial target of 9,000 installations by the end of this
year is expected to be surpassed given the rate at which the
systems are being installed.
</P>
<P>
So far, installations have been made in households and
institutions such as clinics and schools. About 50 companies are
involved in the installation process resulting in the creation of
more than 500 jobs since the project was commissioned.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's agricultural sector is
this year expected to grow by about 12.8 percent with sugar as
its biggest contributor, local newspaper the Business Herald
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sugar output is expected to rise by 87 percent to 630,000
tons. The increased output will see sugar contributing 8.5
percent to the growth of the agricultural sector this year.
</P>
<P>
Further significant contributions are expected from tobacco
and horticulture which are projected to grow by eight and 18
percent respectively in volume terms.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slight reduction in maize yields, supply is
expected to be greater than domestic demand mainly because maize
stocks from last year are still relatively high.

<HEADLINE> Women Trafficking Urged to Be on South Asian Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Participants at a regional seminar
in this capital city of Nepal have urged South Asian governments
to take a serious and collective measure to control the rampant
women trafficking in the region.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, titled "Roundtable on Women Trafficking in South
Asia," was held here Wednesday by an organization called the Asian
Women Human Rights Council.
</P>
<P>
Reports made public at the seminar said that women trafficking
for prostitution has become a common problem of South Asian
nations.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial estimates showed that about 100,000 to 160,000
Nepali women are working in brothels in Mumbai and Calcutta of
India and 35 percent of them are abducted to India under false
promises of marriages and jobs.
</P>
<P>
India serves as the basic transit and stopover point for
trafficked South Asian women, the participants said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Bangladeshi girls are mostly trafficked to
Pakistan where there are over 200,000 Bangladeshi women, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Although Sri Lanka has no cross-border women trafficking
problem like that in other South Asian countries, the island
country is facing the increasing cases of trafficking women from
rural to urban areas, according to a Sri Lankan participant.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the seminar said that though trafficked women
are not necessarily forced into prostitution, they are mostly
commercially exploited and sold into slavery for domestic work,
illegal bonded labor and even the thriving human organ trade.
</P>
<P>
The governments in South Asia should look at the problem
seriously and discuss it at the regional level, they argued.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the participants will lobby the heads of states
or governments at the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) Summit, to be held in Maldives from May 12 to
14, for putting the women trafficking issue on the agenda,
organizers said.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Hikes Overnight Borrowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
Wednesday hiked its overnight borrowing rates from 10.25 percent
to 11 percent to prevent the peso from depreciating.
</P>
<P>
The bank's overnight lending rate, on the other hand, was
retained at 12.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market scrambled for dollars at the
Philippine Dealing System amid heavy selling of the local
currency, as foreign fund managers liquidated peso-denominated
assets in considerable volumes after the local stock market
continues to hit historic lows.
</P>
<P>
The peso thus dropped to a year low level of 26.375 pesos
against the dollar from the previous day's 26.369 against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's increase in interest rates was intended to
make peso-denominated assets more attractive, since higher rates
similarly translate to higher yields. The hike was thus sanctioned
to quell speculative attacks against the local currency.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's trading, traders estimated that the central bank
had sold more than 100 million U.S. dollars to temper the local
currency's depreciation.
</P>
<P>
Total market volumes increased to 306 million dollars from the
previous day's 184.4 million dollars, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank took the action after the local stock market
plunged further Wednesday to new two-year lows. The Philippine
Stock Exchange composite Index fell 60.27 points, or 2.23 percent
to 2648.17 at Wednesday's close amid fears that a property-related
crisis could take place in the country.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since January last year that the index
sank to the 2600 level. It has lost 224.20 points, or 7.81 percent
in the past three trading days.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes Spain Lead in NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that he expected Spain to lead in the 16-member North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking before meeting visiting Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar, Clinton said that "We want Spain integrated fully
into the NATO command structure," saying he expected Spain to
play "an important leadership role."
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton said, "Details of all that have to be worked
out by the command structure."
</P>
<P>
"We look to the Spanish to lead in NATO, to be willing to do
what has to be done to save situations which may not be
immediately popular, but which are profoundly important," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Though Javier Solana, NATO's secretary-general, is a Spanish,
the country has not fully joined the military structure of the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
"We're very fortunate in having a secretary-general of NATO
from Spain," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival Tuesday, citing Spain's decision last year
to fully join the alliance's command structure, Aznar said that he
wanted "clear recognition" of his country's growing role in the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
NATO is to convene its special summit in Madrid in July to
decide on expanding into the Central and Eastern European
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Having Madrid be the site of this historical summit when we
will vote for the first time to take in new members ... symbolizes
the importance of the role that Spain will play in the years ahead
in NATO," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Prevent Speculative Land-Grabbing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Thai Interior Minister Sanoh
Thienthong pledged tough measures to prevent speculative
land-buying or land-grabbing by foreigners after the government
relaxed rules on foreign ownership of land and housing.
</P>
<P>
He said on Wednesday that the relaxation of rules on foreign
ownership of land and housing would not be tantamount to "putting
the whole country up for sale."
</P>
<P>
He added that the country's new rules on ownership of land by
foreigners will meet international standards.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the cabinet, acting under pressure from the
property slump, agreed to seek parliamentary approval to amend
land and condominium laws to increase the right of foreigners to
own property.
</P>
<P>
The property market of Thailand is facing an oversupply, which
has lasted for about four years.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors will be allowed to own up to one rai of land
(0.16 hectares) for commercial use and 10 rai (1.6 hectares) for
industrial purposes.
</P>
<P>
A foreigner who has married a Thai spouse or has brought in
more than 1 million US dollars in capital will be allowed to own
one rai of residential land.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ownership in a condominium complex will be raised from
the current 40 percent limit to 100 percent.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Import Natural Gas from Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will start importing
piped natural gas from Indonesia under an agreement concluded
Wednesday between a consortium of Singapore companies and
Indonesia state oil company Pertamina, the Straits Times reported
here today.
</P>
<P>
It said the consortium plans to import 325 million standard
cubic feet per day of natural gas for an initial 22 years, and
this is equivalent to about 300 million US dollars worth of
natural gas a year.
</P>
<P>
A giant 480-kilometer underwater pipeline will be built to
transport the gas with first delivery expected in the year 2000,
it said, adding that a final "gas sales agreement" is expected to
be signed later this year.
</P>
<P>
Led by Sembawang Engineering and Construction (Sembec), a
subsidiary of listed Sembawang Corporation, consortium members
include Tuas Power Pte Ltd (TP) and the EDB Investments, a
subsidiary of the government Economic Development Board (EDB).
</P>
<P>
It was understood that the Sembec and EDB Investments will
together hold a majority stake, while the respective stakes to be
taken by the members are still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times said the agreement is important as it opens
up Indonesia, with its substantial gas reserves, as an alternative
energy source for Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Singapore currently imports 150 million standard cubic feet of
natural gas per day from Malaysia to fuel its power stations under
a 15-year contract which expires in 2007.

KATHMANDU, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is to adopt
a new transport policy soon after revamping the overall transport
system of the country, Transport Minister Bharat Mohan Adhikari

BANGKOK, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh has called for an "export summit" to be held on May
25 in Pattaya, a seaside resort city, to find ways to keep export
growth on target this year, according to a report today.
</P>
<P>
Thirty Thai leading exporters have been invited and the only

percent year-on-year.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Lift Ban on Its Royal Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian government today approved a
proposal put forward by Prime Minister Romano Prodi, which allows
the male heirs of Italy's former royal family to return to their
homeland, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
A measure to repeal Article 13 of the Italian constitution's
transitional norms laying down the ban on their return will be
approved at a government meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Italians voted down the monarchy, tainted by its links to
Fascism, and opted for a republic in a referendum in 1946. The new
republican constitution banning the House of Savoy's male heirs
from the Italian territory went into force on January 1, 1948.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Premier Walter Veltroni said the decision to speed up
the royal family's return was not a shift to the right in the
government's line: "Absolutely not, the government is above
suspicion on that."
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Communist Refoundation party, Marco Ferrando,
said the decision was made in the overall context of "historical
revisionism", a term usually taken to cover the rehabilitation of
Nazism and Fascism.
</P>
<P>
Others saw a more Machiavellian aim in the measure. "I've no
doubt at all, they want to win the election in Turin," said
Clemente Mastella of the Christian Democrat Center, part of the
opposition Freedom Front.
</P>
<P>
Turin, which is voting in the runoff mayoral race on May 11, is
the capital of the Italian part of Savoy and still feels strong
links with the royal house that once ruled it.

<P>
The bridge, expected to be completed in 2000, will have two
lanes and space for two more, and a lane for a railway tracks. The
Asian Development Bank provided 3 million dollars for the design
work.

Along with the second bridge agreement, Thailand has promised
to build a 3.5 km road worth 103 million baht in Vientiane at no
charge. Construction is expected to be completed by December 2,

<HEADLINE> Asian Rubber Producers to Discuss Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Asian natural rubber producers will
hold a periodic meeting soon to discuss the prices of the
commodity which have recently declined sharply on the world
market, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which will be attended by rubber businessmen from
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, is expected to be
held in Hadjay, Thailand on May 2, General Secretary of the
Indonesian Rubber Dealers Association (Gapkindo) Local Chapter
Syarbaini Zeing said Wednesday in Medan, North Sumatra, according
to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The main topic of the meeting will concern the decline of the
prices of natural rubber on the world market as a result of
increased rubber supply from other producers in the American
region.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Gapkindo will propose a restriction on natural
rubber supply to raise the prices of the commodity on the world
market.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's natural rubber output in 1996 reached 1.5 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
The world's biggest natural rubber producer was still Thailand
which in 1996 produced 1.7 million tons.

Although Uruguay dominated the game initially with swift
action, the limelight was stolen by the home squad.

defensive game but failed to block shots from the local squad.

<HEADLINE> Witnesses Recall Birth of China's Regional Autonomy System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 1 (Xinhua) -- "It is precisely because of this
system that China has successfully handled its ethnic issue," said
Bater. "I'm very proud that I was a witness to the system's birth."
</P>
<P>
Bater, 70, is a resident of Ulanhot, a city in the eastern part
of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China.
</P>
<P>
On this day 50 years ago the regional government of Inner
Mongolia was founded there, and Bater, then a young Mongolian
herdsman, attended the founding ceremony.
</P>
<P>
That day signified the start of China's system of regional
autonomy for ethnic minorities. The system was later introduced to
Xinjiang, Ningxia, Guangxi and Tibet, where ethnic minorities
dominate the local population.
</P>
<P>
"When the establishment of the autonomous region was announced,
I shouted my approval," Bater recalled. "But my voice was drowned
by the deafening applause of the other people there."
</P>
<P>
Bater, who retired in the 1980s as the deputy director of the
standing committee of the municipal people's congress, the local
legislature, is now writing his memoirs, titled "An Unforgettable
Fifty Years."
</P>
<P>
"I must record everything I saw and heard of the system of
regional ethnic autonomy, to pass it on from generation to
generation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Before 1947, he said, Ulanhot only had 10,000-plus residents,
and had no industry or commerce. Life was extremely difficult for
the Mongolian people.
</P>
<P>
The city has now developed into a modernized industrial
community, with a prosperous economy, convenient communications
and a thriving population.
</P>
<P>
"Personally speaking, I turned from a penniless herdsman into a
government official in charge of ethnic affairs, thanks to the
ethnic policy of the Communist Party of China (CPC)," he added.

<P>
Han Tangshu, 86, was also one of the 393 people's delegates
attending the autonomous region's founding ceremony half a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
"At that time the Japanese invaders had just surrendered, and
there was a power vacuum in Ulanhot," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the serious ethnic discrimination during the
reign of the Kuomintang and the Japanese, he said, people of all
ethnic groups were afraid that their rights could not be
guaranteed under the new government.
</P>
<P>
"Their worries were dispelled by the introduction of the
regional autonomy system, which affirmed the dominant role of the
Mongolian ethnic group in regional management, and also protected
the rights of the other ethnic groups," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1954 Han was elected deputy mayor of Ulanhot by the
municipal people's congress, and became the city's first deputy
mayor from the Han nationality, the country's largest ethnic group
but a local ethnic minority.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of mutual respect and understanding, I cooperated
quite well with my colleagues from the Mongolian and other ethnic
groups," he said, adding that the city's rapid development during
the past few decades should be attributed to the realization of
ethnic equality.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shifan, who is of the Mongolian ethnic group, was only 16
when he attended the founding ceremony of the autonomous region,
but he still clearly remembers the remarks made by a living Buddha
named Aji at the ceremony:
</P>
<P>
"Aji said that the regional autonomy system would protect the
rights of all lamas and greatly benefit the development of
Buddhism all over the region," Liu recalled. "Now his words have
become true."
</P>
<P>
He said that both the central and regional governments have
fully guaranteed the people's freedom of worship, funded the
renovation and rebuilding of monasteries, and set up special
schools for training lamas.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are more than 100 monasteries in the
autonomous region, which accommodate some 3,700 lamas.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 27 in Albanian Explosions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 27 people were killed, 12
of them children, in explosions at an underground Albanian
military weapons store outside Tirana Wednesday, police said.
</P>
<P>
The figure has earlier been put at 22, but authorities said the
number of casualties is expected to rise further as many families
lived near the depot.
</P>
<P>
"All the people that were inside the store at the time were
killed," a government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how the incident was triggered, but police said
that it was triggered as villagers were looting the weapons depot
for the brass casings of artillery shells for sales to make a
living.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Shakir Vukaj and some interior ministry
officials have rushed to the site for further investigation and
demanded measures be taken to avoid more blasts in the seven
depots nearby.
</P>
<P>
Eight people were killed last week when looters firebombed a
weapons store near Lezha, 55 kilometers north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak of violence in Albania in January after the
collapse of bogus investment schemes, many army depots have been
reportedly looted. Many Albanians have lost their life savings
after the collapse of the investment funds.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 400 people have been killed in the violence.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 troops from an eight-nation Italian-led force have
arrived in Albania in the past two weeks to secure the delivery
of humanitarian aid.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- This port city in northeast China's
Liaoning Province has worked out a way to guarantee the benefits
of workers retired from poorly managed state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
About 17,000 retired workers from three local state-owned
enterprise groups bade farewell to their employers yesterday, and
were handed over to a local service center, which will take care
of their social benefits, such as pensions and medical care.
</P>
<P>
The office is called the "Service Center for Retirees" and was
set up to take the heavy financial burden from state-owned
enterprises that have a large number of retired workers to take
care of.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhenggao, deputy mayor of the city, said that this
suggests that a new social welfare system has been created in
Dalian, which will help the state-owned enterprises face
challenges from a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Official sources indicate that the total number of retired
workers under the care of the center has reached 22,000. However,
the city has a total of 300,000 retirees who need help from the
government.

<P>
Under the agreement, Nicaragua will release on Thursday 16

<P>
"The Honduran fishermen are being held in Chinandega (northern
Nicaragua) but will soon be turned over to the Department of
Migration," Gasteazoro said.
</P>
<P>
He said these problems will terminate when border limits in the
disputed Gulf of Fonseca and the Pacific coastal waters, which is
also shared with El Salvador, will be finally marked with buoys.

solution to China's control of air pollution caused by the tail
gas.
</P>
<P>
International organizations concerned and some foreign
governments and related associations including the World Bank,
European Union, World Motor Emission Control Association, and the
US, Sweden and France have sent senior officials or experts to
attend the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
China has an annual automotive manufacturing output of 1.4
million and keeps 10 million motor vehicles so far. The tail gas
has become one of the major pollutants in the city as a result of
the rapidly increasing number of cars in the urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been paying great attention to the
vehicle emission control. Aided by the World Bank, the SSTC and
SBEP have arranged research on emission control.

<HEADLINE> Beijing To Replace More Transients by Laid-Offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- About 50,000 unemployed Beijingers
are expected to obtain jobs vacated by transient workers coming
from other places by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Wang Guofang, an official with the
Beijing Labor Bureau as saying that it will be the outcome of
limiting the hiring of workers from other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Beijing municipal government has earlier adopted a regulation
to curb employment of rural job seekers for some kinds of work
that the displaced Beijingers would like to do, in an effort to
help Beijing's laid-offs to find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Job posts required to be reserved for Beijingers include such
occupations as accountants, secretaries, sales clerks, bus
conductors, waiters and elevator operators.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government also adopted other preferential
policies for the Beijing laid-offs, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
These include tuition-free education in 29 vocational schools
for the displaced workers and a work unit can receive 3,000 yuan
(361 US dollars) from the municipal government for hiring a female
displaced worker above the age of 35 and for a male over 40 if the
worker is employed for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of factories which employ the laid-offs will be
exempted from paying taxes during the first three years of their
operation.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has registered a total of 110,000 laid-off workers by
the end of 1996 because of the reform of the state-own
enterprises. The number is expected to raise to 200,000 this year
and the municipal government expects to help at least 60 percent
of them to find new jobs.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Most Italians strongly favor the
creation of a single European currency, the euro, but have serious
doubts over Italy's chance of being the first nations to adopt the
currency.
</P>
<P>
A poll commissioned recently by the Italian weekly Panorama
showed that 67 percent of the 800 people interviewed were in favor
of creating the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Only 16 percent of those surveyed were "not very" favorable for
and 8 percent were opposed to the EMU due to the fears of greater
unemployment, the sacrifices necessary to be part of the EMU and
the possibility of Italy playing a secondary role.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five percent of Italians surveyed doubted Italy's chance
of being qualified for the single European currency on schedule,
while 41 percent were optimistic over its qualification.

BONN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario suffered a big upset when she was uprooted by Petra
Langrova at the Rexona Cup WTA tennis tournament in Munich on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As Sanchez Vicario continued her the slump, Czech Langrova who
ranked 74th in the world, exploited the former world no. 1's
numerous errors, handing the Spaniard a 7-5, 6-3 loss and her
earliest departure at a tournament.

Sanchez-Vicario, currently ranked fifth after topping the
rankings in mid-1995, has yet to reach a tournament final in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands, the fifth seed,
became the day's second upset victim when she was blown away by
France's Anne-Gaelle Sidot 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Conchita Martinez of Spain, the second seed,
became the first seed to reach the quarterfinals as she posted an

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 1 (xinhua) -- Fourteen percent of foreign-funded
firms in east China's Shangdong province were shut down in a
recent check.
</P>
<P>
Operation permits of 2,515 firms, with a combined contract
investment of 2.2 billion US dollars, were revoked because of
their illegal actions, such as tax evasion and chaotic financial
managment.
</P>
<P>
A lower rate of income and product exports than contracted were
also found in some firms.
</P>
<P>
According to China's law, some foreign-funded firms are asked
to export a certain percentage of their products.
</P>
<P>
The provincial foreign trade and economic cooperation
commission carried out a thorough check on the operation of 17,527
foreign-invested firms in the province recently and 86 percent
were proved to be qualified.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown of the unqualified firms will help promote the
overall level of utilization of foreign funds and ensure a stable
and healthy development of jobs, said the commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission also said that it would cooperate with other
departments to further check these firms in the future.

<HEADLINE> Study: Malnourished Children Decrease in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The number of children with some
degree of malnutrition in Costa Rica dropped by nearly 30 percent
between 1982-1996, a study from the Health Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The number of children under six years old with moderate or
severe malnutrition dropped from 6.3 percent in 1982 to 5.0 in
1996, and those with slight malnutrition fell from 24.6 percent to
17.3, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Other figures show an advance in better nutrition among
Costa Rican children since the number of children shorter than
they should be at their age decreased from 29.3 to 21.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Overweight children increased from 2.5 to 4.2 percent, the
study indicated.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Herman Weinstock attributed the positive
conditions to the health measures taken by the government,
including vaccination and primary health care campaigns.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that malnutrition still affects both urban and
rural children.

<HEADLINE> Slovenia to Join Multinational Mission in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Slovenia will become the ninth
nation to join the Multinational Protection Force (MPF) in Albania
under a decision made here today by the mission's directive
committee.
</P>
<P>
In a communique, the committee welcomed Slovenia's
participation in the MPF and stressed the importance of creating
an Albanian police force to ensure law and order in the Balkan
state.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been gripped by chaos and violence since the
failure of shady savings schemes last month, and thousands of
refugees have since fled the country to Italy and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The committee said the MPF's mission has been a political and
military success.
</P>
<P>
The quick deployment of the MPF, formed by Italy, Romania,
Greece, Turkey, Spain, France, Austria and Denmark, has improved
the distribution of humanitarian aid, reduced the number of armed
incidents and ensured a "general stabilization" of the situation
in Albania, the committee said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai To Host French Hi-tech Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- In a move to strengthen Sino-French
trade, more than 300 French companies will gather in Shanghai for
a hi-tech exposition scheduled to open on May 17 and continue
through May 21, announced French Trade Commissioner Jacques Dumasy
yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The show, known as Exposition Francaise de Hautes Technologies,
will be officially inaugurated by French President Jacques Chirac
who will be on a China visit at that time, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Covering 14,000 sq. m. of floor space, the exposition will
showcase state-of-the-art French technology in the areas of
energy, space, transportation, construction and infrastructure,
telecommunications, computers, electronics, environmental
protection and health care, said Dumasy who is based in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 professionals are expected to visit the show.
</P>
<P>
The French Government is subsidizing four percent of the show's
total expenses in an effort to bring French companies closer to
their Chinese counterparts, Dumasy said.
</P>
<P>
Hi-tech French companies that already have a strong presence in
China will participate in the show.
</P>
<P>
Up to 75 percent of the exhibitors are small and medium-sized
companies, organized under the various regional Chambers of
Commerce and Industries, reflecting a trend for such companies to
increasingly invest and export abroad, Dumasy said.
</P>
<P>
Of the total companies, 50 percent will be making their first
appearance in China. Seminars and lectures on energy,
telecommunications and technology transfer will be held during the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade reached 42.7 billion francs (seven billion US
dollars) in 1996. However, this amount does not parallel Frances's
worldwide economic status.

WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Riddick Bowe has started his
new career in the television media after his retirement from
boxing, local TV reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Home Box Office, a cable television channel, said the
two-time heavyweight champion will work for the media outlet after
he was battered in the last two fights.
</P>
<P>
In the two fights, Bowe suffered wrongful beatings from Andrew
Golota and was plunged into sadness although he won both on
disqualifications.
</P>
<P>
He finished with a record of 40-1, with 32 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
Following the two Golota fights, Bowe was recruited in the
U.S. Marine Corps Reserves last January but left the camp only
after 10 days.
</P>
<P>
"Although my time inside the ring has come to an end, it's just
the start of an exciting and important career for me," Bowe said
in a statement released by HBO. "I am delighted to begin my new
role in the HBO family."

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Launch New Care System for Elderly People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Cuba will start this year to
implement a nationwide integral system of care for the old people
in order to guarantee the elderly a high standard of living,
Osvaldo Prieto, Director of the Ibero-American Senior
Center (CITED) announced today.
</P>
<P>
With its accumulation of experience, the CITED believes it is
more advantageous to care for the elderly in their place of residence
with mutual support from the family and the community so it can
create the conditions that will prevent their disability and
facilitate a fuller old age, said Prieto.
</P>
<P>
Multidisciplinary groups, currently under training, will take
part in this project that will evaluate the needs of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
With a tendency towards an aging society, a low birthrate
and a life expectation of more than 75 years, Cuba now has one
million people over the age of 65, a figure that represents 12
percent of its population.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Spain, the
United States, Venezuela and other countries will take part
in an International seminar on care for the elderly. The seminar
will be in Havana from May 6-9, Prieto said.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, Cuba and Uruguay are the only countries in the
region with more than 10 percent of its population over the age of
65. With implementation of birth control programs in the
region, this will also be a problem for other Latin American
countries in the future, he added.

MANCHESTER, England, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The French men's
squad, which played their first-ever team final in the World Table
Tennis Championships on Tuesday, said they were happy with a
runner-up finish behind 12-time champions China.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased with the silver medal since we have already
made histroy," said French top player and 1993 world singles
champion Jean-Philippe Gatien, who lost two games in China's 3-1
victory.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Chila got the only point for France as he nippped
China's Olympic champion Liu Guoliang in the second game.
</P>
<P>
"Since we regarded ourselves as outsiders, we had been very
relaxed throughout the tournament," said world 12th-ranked
Gatien. "Making the final was a bonus for us."
</P>
<P>
Damien Eloi, who had extended Chinese Wang Tao to 29-all in the
third game, said he played his best table tennis in the final.
</P>
<P>
"I felt so free in the second set against Wang that I got an
incredible run of five points to lead 21-20," said Eloi.
</P>
<P>
At 29-29, the 29th-ranked Frenchman played an air shot on
Wang's tricky serve and then returned into the net to concede the
match point.
</P>
<P>
"I was really nervous in the second set," Wang said after the
match. "I have never played to a score of 31-29."
</P>
<P>
"If I had won this game to make it 2-2, the final result should
have been hard to predict," said Eloi.

<P>
NEW YORK, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar resumed climbing
today after a one-day dip and flirted with a 4-year high against
the yen on data that showed an unexpectedly strong surge in the
country's first-quarter economy.
</P>
<P>
The 5.6 percent increase in the gross domestic product reported
by the Commerce Department was the strongest in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the statistics increased the possibility that the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month to thwart
inflationary pressure, which tends to enhance the dollar's value.
</P>
<P>
The dollar touched an intraday high of 127.13 yen, before
settling in New York at 127.06 yen, up from 126.87 yen Tuesday.
The dollar settled at 1.7303 marks, up from 1.7243 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also strengthened against the pound, which retreated
to 1.6237 U.S. dollars from 1.6316 U.S. dollars partly on the
political uncertainties created by Britain's Thursday elections.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday:
5.8300 French francs, up from 5.8120; 1.4728 Swiss francs, up from

WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Alexis Herman today won
Senate confirmation to be secretary of labor following months of
waiting.
</P>
<P>
Senate Republicans lifted their holds on the nomination only
after the White House agreed to pull back an executive order that
would have favored organized labor in winning federal contracts
and will issue instead a presidential memorandum.
</P>
<P>
Republican critics described the order as a "payback" to labor
groups for backing U.S. President Bill Clinton in November. The
memorandum is seen as a concession because it is a temporary
measure.
</P>
<P>
Republicans made it clear that they were not opposing Herman so
much as using her nomination, stalled for nearly three months, as
a bargaining chip to force President Clinton to back down on his
executive order.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
welcomed the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention
(CWC) and reiterated its commitment.
</P>
<P>
The convention was negotiated and opened for signature in 1993.
It entered into force Tuesday, six months after the 65th state,
Hungary, ratified.
</P>
<P>
It prohibits states parties from producing and using chemical
weapons and restricts their trade in any chemicals that could be
used as chemical weapons or to make them.
</P>
<P>
Further, it obliges states parties to make declarations
concerning their use of scheduled chemicals and to allow
international teams to investigate facilities that could be used
to covertly produce chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The CWC is "a landmark in the history of global disarmament
efforts," said Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
"However, entry into force is a beginning, not an end. There is
much work to do to ensure that the CWC fulfills the expectations
that we and others have placed in it," he noted.
</P>
<P>
There are now 165 signatories to the convention, 87 of whom
have ratified and are now states parties.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged Russia, the only other state to open declare
it has chemical weapons, to ratify as well.
</P>
<P>
Convention signatories will meet for a conference in the Hague
beginning on May 6, where a body that overseas the CWC
implementation will be established.
