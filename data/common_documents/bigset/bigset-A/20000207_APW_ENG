<HEADLINE> Clinton Unveils Spending Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is sending Congress a $1.84 trillion
farewell budget with burgeoning surpluses that the president proposes using to
wipe out the government's public debt, provide modest tax cuts and greatly
expand government health care.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's final budget, for the 2001 fiscal year that begins in October,
projects that the surpluses will total a gigantic $2.9 trillion over the next
decade with $746 billion of that coming from non-Social Security sources,
according to budget documents obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's baseline budget projections include a $179 billion surplus for the
current fiscal year, then dipping slightly to $171 billion in the 2001 budget,
before beginning to rise and hitting $457 billion in fiscal 2010, the documents
showed.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton's policy changes would actually increase the surplus for the
year 2001 to $184 billion, mainly by pushing some spending into the current year
to undo some budget gimmicks employed last year to appear to meet strict
spending limits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our budget is trying to clean out the gimmicks from last year,'' said Jack
Lew, head of the president's Office of Management and Budget. ``We're on a
course that's a very positive direction for the budget and the economy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Delivery of the budget to Capitol Hill on Monday will kick off a bruising
battle that promises to be a replay of last year's fight as Democrats and
Republicans put forward vastly different plans on how to use the surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides would use two-thirds of the surplus, the portion generated by
Social Security, to begin wiping out the $3.7 trillion of publicly owned debt
within the $5.7 trillion national debt. Clinton's new budget says this goal can
be reached by 2013.
</P>
<P>
	   But it is the other third of the surplus where big disagreements will occur
with Republicans pushing for much larger tax cuts and less government spending
that Clinton seeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither side can even agree on the size of the non-Social Security surplus.
The $746 billion surplus being projected by Clinton is less than half the $1.9
trillion best-case figure the Congressional Budget Office projected last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The difference is that the CBO assumes less government spending than
Clinton, who in his budget will formally propose loosening the tight spending
limits that were enacted as part of the 1997 balanced budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton would devote all of the $2.17 trillion surplus from Social Security
to paying down debt plus almost half -- $350 billion -- of the $746 billion in
non-Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   Other parts of the non-Social Security surplus would be used to expand
health care coverage by $91 billion, provide prescription drug benefits through
Medicare and supply a modest range of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   By expanding the spending limits, Clinton would provide for increased
spending for a host of government programs ranging from education to protecting
the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans in Congress have pledged to fight for more generous tax cuts and
have attacked Clinton's budget for proposing billions of dollars in new
government spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's budget will offer $351 billion in tax relief to low- and
middle-income taxpayers while proposing $96 billion in tax increases, including
a renewed attack on closing corporate loopholes that Congress has rejected
before.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the $96 billion in the main group of tax increases, the
administration will propose that the cigarette tax be boosted by 25 cents per
pack and that tobacco companies be fined $3,000 for each teen smoker, measures
that would raise an additional $66 billion for what the administration
classified as ``health policy'' rather than tax increases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the president forces us to choose between his raising taxes or raiding
Social Security to fund his expansion of government, his budget is dead on
arrival,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio. ``A lame
duck president should not be able to derail us on the way toward retiring the
national debt, tax relief and saving Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans are putting together a rival tax-cutting strategy that seeks to
pass a variety of smaller targeted tax cut bills instead of the huge $792
billion tax cut package that Clinton vetoed last year.
</P>
<P>
	   John Podesta, the president's chief of staff, said on ``Fox News Sunday''
that the GOP strategy apparently was ``just take the tax bill that the president
vetoed last year, take the staples out of it and try to pass it one page at a
time. ... It was a bad bill last year, and doing it that way is a bad thing this
year.''
</P>
<P>
	   While Clinton declared after the Republicans took control of Congress in
1994 that the ``era of big government is over,'' his final budget, perhaps with
a view to his legacy, pushes an activist agenda. It also provides a number of
issues that Democrats are likely to campaign on in the fall, especially if
Republican votes keep them from being enacted. Some, such as gun control and
health care, mirror programs Vice President Al Gore is pushing in his
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration already has released much of its budget in piecemeal
fashion over the past month, hoping to gain maximum exposure for the
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget includes tax breaks to help families afford college and pay the
cost of long-term care for sick relatives. The president also wants to help
alleviate the inequity in the current tax code that penalizes married couples,
but his remedy offers less relief than the Republican plan's would.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also is proposing to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit for the
working poor to include an additional 6.4 million low-income families.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget also proposes the biggest expansion in government health care
since the creation of Medicare by providing health insurance to at least five
million of the 44 million Americans not now covered.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also wants to expand Medicare to help the elderly pay
prescription drug bills and allow persons 55 to 65 to buy into the program.

	   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Clinton announced her Senate run Sunday in a
university gymnasium, becoming the only First Lady to run for public office. The
race for the seat being vacated by fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan is
likely to pit Clinton against Republican New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in what
could be one of the most combative political campaigns in memory. Over and over
again during her announcement, Clinton pledged, "I'll be on your side" as she
described her commitment to better schools, better health care, environmentalism

	   GEKHI, Russia (AP) -- Federal troops have seized the last rebel stronghold
in Grozny, acting President Vladimir Putin said Sunday, pronouncing an end to
Russia's months-long drive to take the Chechen capital. Putin said federal
troops had taken control of the western Zavodskoi district of the capital and
raised the Russian flag over an administration building there. "A short while
ago, the terrorists' last bastion of resistance was seized," Putin said in an
interview with state-controlled ORT television. "So, we can say the operation to
liberate Grozny is over."

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. efforts to keep Russia's nuclear weapons materiel
away from rogue nations or terrorists may fail without increased government
money and attention, a bipartisan group of foreign policy experts warns. The
report examined the worldwide threat posed by the potential theft of nuclear
materiel from Russia's haphazardly protected stockpiles. It urges immediate
action by the White House and Congress to expand the U.S. assistance program --
or face a possible catastrophe. The study was based on findings by leading
foreign policy and nuclear weapons proliferation experts, including former
senior officials from past Democratic and Republican administrations.

Texas Cleric Denies Terror Links

	   DALLAS (AP) -- Lawyers for a Muslim leader in Texas denied accusations by
federal prosecutors that he served as an intermediary for Osama bin Laden's
suspected terrorist network. Moataz Al-Hallak, imam of the Islamic Society of
Arlington mosque, provided only religious advice to a pilot on how to handle the
purchase of a small jet in accord with Islamic law, said his lawyer, Stan Cohen.
The plane crashed in the early 1990s while being used by one of bin Laden's
businesses, Cohen said. Bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire exile, is accused of
masterminding the 1998 bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa. The attacks in
Kenya and Tanzania killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.

<HEADLINE> Pataki renews campaign against inmate legal services  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The stack of weekly decisions by a state appeals
court in Albany last week contained 46 written rulings.
<P>
	   Just over half - 24 - concerned cases brought by state prison inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   One prisoner complained about being disciplined for trying to get a handcuff
key smuggled behind bars, another because he was caught with marijuana. A third
inmate contended he was unfairly punished in a disciplinary hearing called
because he had struck a hearing officer in the face at an earlier disciplinary
hearing and broken his glasses.
</P>
<P>
	   In none of the 24 cases did the appeals court - the Appellate Division of
state Supreme Court - side with the inmates and against the prison
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of prisoner lawsuits say examples like the Feb. 3 caseload of the
appellate division in Albany show the burden that suits brought by prison
inmates continue to create for the state's court system.
</P>
<P>
	   In his 2000-01 state budget plan, Gov. George Pataki has once again proposed
eliminating all state funding for Prisoners' Legal Services. He has proposed
that in past years as well, but the state Assembly has restored the money by the
time the Legislature has adopted the budgets.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Conway, a spokesman for the state Budget Division, said federal court
rulings have directed that inmates must have access to taxpayer-funded lawyers
or to an adequately supplied law library. Pataki believes the law libraries in
state prisons meet that requirement, Conway said.
</P>
<P>
	   Former state Attorney General Dennis Vacco attacked inmate suits,
periodically releasing "top 10" lists of the most frivolous actions, but current
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer favors a fully-funded Prisoners' Legal Services
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you have an excellent attorney on the other side, even though they are
your adversaries, they sort of weed out cases that shouldn't be there," Spitzer
spokesman Darren Dopp said. "One of our greatest frustrations is defending the
state against cases that are literally drawn on the back of a napkin."
</P>
<P>
	   For example, the attorney general's office in Plattsburgh spends 90 percent
of its time defending the state against suits from inmates in the region's
prisons, Dopp said.
</P>
<P>
	   Inmates now are under some modest new restrictions designed to deter them
from filing frivolous suits.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time, inmates must pay a fee of between $15 and $50 to file
suits. The amount depends on how much money the inmates have in their prison
accounts and is determined by the judge who accepts the filing. Non-prisoners
bringing suits in state courts generally must pay a $170 filing fee.
</P>
<P>
	   Also under the new law, inmates seeking monetary damages must exhaust all
administrative remedies in prisons before filing suits.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Rifkin, deputy state attorney general, said it is too early to tell
whether the new restrictions, which took effect Dec. 1, have cut down on inmate
filings.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual budget battles in Albany over funding Prisoners' Legal Services
did have implications for the group last year. In September, its longtime
director David Leven resigned, saying the annual uncertainty over funding had
taken its toll on him personally.
</P>
<P>
	   Prisoners' Legal Services was formed in the aftermath of the bloody 1971
Attica riot to help represent inmates in cases involving brutality by
correctional officers, religious observances and treatment of inmates who have
HIV.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton starts building grassroots network with house parties  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) - Nancy Denofio thinks the world of Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
<P>
	   On her fireplace mantle sits a picture of Bill and Hillary. She has "Hillary
for Senate" buttons and hats all around her living room and even had a "Hillary
2000" cake made.
</P>
<P>
	   So when Clinton announced her campaign for New York Senate on Sunday,
Denofio called about 20 of her friends and invited them over to watch the event
on television in this New York resort city.
</P>
<P>
	   But it wasn't just a party. Denofio also passed out volunteer cards,
collected donations and gave a quick speech on the virtue of Clinton's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   In 600 other houses in New York state, people were doing the same. As
Hillary Rodham Clinton was announcing her U.S. Senate candidacy in Purchase,
activists around the state gathered their friends, family and future Clinton
campaign workers in their homes to watch the first lady's announcement on
television and begin setting up a grassroots network for her.
</P>
<P>
	   Denofio, who worked on President Clinton's New Hampshire campaign steering
committee in 1995, placed a speakerphone on the couch and a few seconds later,
Clinton's voice came from the telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to thank all of you," said the first lady, on a cell phone only
minutes after she announced that she would run for New York's U.S. Senate seat.
"I want to start by thanking the nearly 600 families and individuals who have
hosted these house parties, opening your homes to your friends and your
neighbors to hear my announcement."
</P>
<P>
	   But the first lady wasn't just talking to people in Denofio's home across
from the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. She was conferenced in to all of the
homes at the same time. "I thought it was a misprint when I heard that there
were 25,000 people at all of these house parties but it seems that there is,"
Clinton said. "It is because of your interest and your commitment to this
campaign that I think we have such a great beginning today."
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady soon hung up - cell phone problems, she said - and the
50-year-old Denofio went back to work pitching volunteer work for the Clinton
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're trying to reach the common person," she said. "While we're also
trying to raise money, it's not about the money. It's about the people instead."
</P>
<P>
	   Denofio had about 25 people in her home during the speech - a cheer broke
out around the dinner table as Mrs. Clinton acknowledged the house parties - and
no one left without signing a mailing list.
</P>
<P>
	   And this isn't the only Hillary party going on here. Across town, Saratoga
Springs' Democratic Mayor Ken Klotz, who upset a two-term incumbent Republican
last year, held one as well.
</P>
<P>
	   This is a unique way of doing this," said Denofio, daughter of former
longtime Republican Schenectady Mayor Frank Duci. "We need the workers and the
volunteers and what better place to find them than from your family and friends?
We hope to have a strong network here for Hillary."
</P>
<P>
	   Denofio shares a similar problem with Clinton - Clinton is a new New Yorker,
Denofio's a new Saratogian, having just moved there in November. When quizzing
her guests about where Mrs. Clinton should visit while in Saratoga Springs,
Denofio suggested Starbucks. An immediate cry went up among the group for her to
be taken to a local coffee shop called Uncommon Grounds instead.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sorry," Denofio laughed. "I just moved here."

   TOKYO (AP) -- A man drove a van to a police station in central Japan on
Monday with the bodies of four people he said he had killed.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Mavericks 103, Grizzlies 99, OT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Michael Finley scored eight of his 34
points in overtime, sparking the Dallas Mavericks to a 103-99 win over the
Vancouver Grizzlies on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Nash, from nearby Victoria, B.C., enjoyed a sweet homecoming, scoring
24 points off the bench as the Mavericks won their third straight and improved
to 7-1 in their last eight games.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory marked the fastest the Mavericks have reached the 20-win plateau
since they went 20-20 in the 1989-90 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored a season-high 36 points and set a franchise
record with 22 rebounds for the Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
	   After Vancouver's Michael Dickerson hit a 16-footer with 7.4 seconds left to
tie it at 91 and force overtime, the Mavericks took control at the start of the
extra session.
</P>
<P>
	   Finley started overtime by sinking two free throws, putting the Mavericks
ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
	   Ahead 97-93, Finley sealed the victory by hitting two more free throws with
23.6 seconds left. Finley got to the line after Shawn Bradley intercepted Grant
Long's inbounds pass which was intended for Abdur-Rahim, who turned the wrong
way.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdur-Rahim and Dickerson hit 3-point shots in the final 11 seconds, but
couldn't get any closer as Finley and Nash each made two free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   Overtime came as a result of both teams' inability to hit free throws over
the final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver's backup point guard, Milt Palacio, missed four free throws in the
final 68 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mavericks were little better as both Nash and Erick Strikland both went
1-for-2 from the line in the final 24 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   After going 5-for-22 from the field through the first 13 minutes, the
Mavericks' offense finally ignited. Behind Nash's 13-point second quarter, the
Mavericks outscored the Grizzlies 36-20 to take a 52-44 lead into the break.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas was especially sharp from 3-point range, hitting all five attempts --
including three by Nash -- in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton starts building grassroots network with house parties  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) - Nancy Denofio thinks the world of Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
<P>
	   On her fireplace mantle sits a picture of Bill and Hillary. She has "Hillary
for Senate" buttons and hats all around her living room and even had a "Hillary
2000" cake made.
</P>
<P>
	   So when Clinton announced her campaign for New York Senate on Sunday,
Denofio called about 20 of her friends and invited them over to watch the event
on television in this New York resort city.
</P>
<P>
	   But it wasn't just a party. Denofio also passed out volunteer cards,
collected donations and gave a quick speech on the virtue of Clinton's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   In 600 other houses in New York state, people were doing the same. As
Hillary Rodham Clinton was announcing her U.S. Senate candidacy in Purchase,
activists around the state gathered their friends, family and future Clinton
campaign workers in their homes to watch the first lady's announcement on
television and begin setting up a grassroots network for her.
</P>
<P>
	   Denofio, who worked on President Clinton's New Hampshire campaign steering
committee in 1995, placed a speakerphone on the couch and a few seconds later,
Clinton's voice came from the telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to thank all of you," said the first lady, on a cell phone only
minutes after she announced that she would run for New York's U.S. Senate seat.
"I want to start by thanking the nearly 600 families and individuals who have
hosted these house parties, opening your homes to your friends and your
neighbors to hear my announcement."
</P>
<P>
	   But the first lady wasn't just talking to people in Denofio's home across
from the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. She was conferenced in to all of the
homes at the same time. "I thought it was a misprint when I heard that there
were 25,000 people at all of these house parties but it seems that there is,"
Clinton said. "It is because of your interest and your commitment to this
campaign that I think we have such a great beginning today."
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady soon hung up - cell phone problems, she said - and the
50-year-old Denofio went back to work pitching volunteer work for the Clinton
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're trying to reach the common person," she said. "While we're also
trying to raise money, it's not about the money. It's about the people instead."
</P>
<P>
	   Denofio had about 25 people in her home during the speech - a cheer broke
out around the dinner table as Mrs. Clinton acknowledged the house parties - and
no one left without signing a mailing list.
</P>
<P>
	   And this isn't the only Hillary party going on here. Across town, Saratoga
Springs' Democratic Mayor Ken Klotz, who upset a two-term incumbent Republican
last year, held one as well.
</P>
<P>
	   This is a unique way of doing this," said Denofio, daughter of former
longtime Republican Schenectady Mayor Frank Duci. "We need the workers and the
volunteers and what better place to find them than from your family and friends?
We hope to have a strong network here for Hillary."
</P>
<P>
	   Denofio shares a similar problem with Clinton - Clinton is a new New Yorker,
Denofio's a new Saratogian, having just moved there in November. When quizzing
her guests about where Mrs. Clinton should visit while in Saratoga Springs,
Denofio suggested Starbucks. An immediate cry went up among the group for her to
be taken to a local coffee shop called Uncommon Grounds instead.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sorry," Denofio laughed. "I just moved here."

<HEADLINE> Pataki renews campaign against inmate legal services  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The stack of weekly decisions by a state appeals
court in Albany last week contained 46 written rulings.
<P>
	   Just over half - 24 - concerned cases brought by state prison inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   One prisoner complained about being disciplined for trying to get a handcuff
key smuggled behind bars, another because he was caught with marijuana. A third
inmate contended he was unfairly punished in a disciplinary hearing called
because he had struck a hearing officer in the face at an earlier disciplinary
hearing and broken his glasses.
</P>
<P>
	   In none of the 24 cases did the appeals court - the Appellate Division of
state Supreme Court - side with the inmates and against the prison
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of prisoner lawsuits say examples like the Feb. 3 caseload of the
appellate division in Albany show the burden that suits brought by prison
inmates continue to create for the state's court system.
</P>
<P>
	   In his 2000-01 state budget plan, Gov. George Pataki has once again proposed
eliminating all state funding for Prisoners' Legal Services. He has proposed
that in past years as well, but the state Assembly has restored the money by the
time the Legislature has adopted the budgets.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Conway, a spokesman for the state Budget Division, said federal court
rulings have directed that inmates must have access to taxpayer-funded lawyers
or to an adequately supplied law library. Pataki believes the law libraries in
state prisons meet that requirement, Conway said.
</P>
<P>
	   Former state Attorney General Dennis Vacco attacked inmate suits,
periodically releasing "top 10" lists of the most frivolous actions, but current
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer favors a fully-funded Prisoners' Legal Services
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you have an excellent attorney on the other side, even though they are
your adversaries, they sort of weed out cases that shouldn't be there," Spitzer
spokesman Darren Dopp said. "One of our greatest frustrations is defending the
state against cases that are literally drawn on the back of a napkin."
</P>
<P>
	   For example, the attorney general's office in Plattsburgh spends 90 percent
of its time defending the state against suits from inmates in the region's
prisons, Dopp said.
</P>
<P>
	   Inmates now are under some modest new restrictions designed to deter them
from filing frivolous suits.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time, inmates must pay a fee of between $15 and $50 to file
suits. The amount depends on how much money the inmates have in their prison
accounts and is determined by the judge who accepts the filing. Non-prisoners
bringing suits in state courts generally must pay a $170 filing fee.
</P>
<P>
	   Also under the new law, inmates seeking monetary damages must exhaust all
administrative remedies in prisons before filing suits.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Rifkin, deputy state attorney general, said it is too early to tell
whether the new restrictions, which took effect Dec. 1, have cut down on inmate
filings.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual budget battles in Albany over funding Prisoners' Legal Services
did have implications for the group last year. In September, its longtime
director David Leven resigned, saying the annual uncertainty over funding had
taken its toll on him personally.
</P>
<P>
	   Prisoners' Legal Services was formed in the aftermath of the bloody 1971
Attica riot to help represent inmates in cases involving brutality by
correctional officers, religious observances and treatment of inmates who have
HIV.

<HEADLINE> Police commanders feel pressure to keep crime numbers low  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Crime is down in cities nationwide and the unwritten
mantra of the police brass is: It better stay that way. But some criminologists
feel that motto can lead to trouble.
<P>
	   Police commanders are under pressure from their superiors' expectations, and
some have doctored statistics to show the number of offenses still going down.
Other commanders allege they were transferred when their precincts showed an
increase in crime.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, two New York captains were transferred, and the captains' union
says the moves were prompted by a jump in the number of crimes. In 1998, the
head of the police transportation bureau was forced to resign after he was
accused of underreporting subway offenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Such problems are not unique to New York City. The Philadelphia police
department has come under fire for allegedly reporting major crimes as minor
ones. Police in Boca Raton, Fla., and Atlanta also have been accused of
doctoring statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   Commanders have always been held accountable for what goes on in their
precincts, but in the 1990s a program known in some departments as COMPSTAT -
which uses computerized statistics to more accurately outline crime patterns -
began to put commanders on the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
	   Criminologists say, however, that COMPSTAT is not to blame. They maintain
the problem arises because police brass put too much weight on the statistics,
without looking at the broader picture.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've often used the term criminal justice limbo stick - how low can you
go?" said James Alan Fox, a criminal justice professor at Northeastern
University. "Can we hold someone accountable because you can't go lower, and the
only way left to go is up? Holding a commander accountable purely because the
crime number increased, especially after falling for many years in a row is
shortsighted and unfair."
</P>
<P>
	   Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, agrees.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't fire everybody," he said. "You have to understand what some of
the external factors are - which are under the control of the precinct commander
and ... which are not."
</P>
<P>
	   Former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton, who introduced
COMPSTAT in the city, said if commanders were being transferred solely on the
basis of an increase in crime statistics, that was wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   "Despite our best efforts and best people, sometimes crime is going to go
up," said Bratton, commissioner from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City police Capt. John F. Driscoll, who heads the Captains
Endowment Association - the union for police captains - said a person cannot
judge the effectiveness of a commanding officer by crime statistics alone.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to take into account a commander's supervisory skills,
administrative skills, relationships with his cops and command, and more
importantly, his relationship with the community," Driscoll said.
</P>
<P>
	   Driscoll has criticized what he claims is the New York police practice of
transferring commanders when crime rises in their precincts. In the past few
weeks, Capt. James Guida of the 88th Precinct in Brooklyn and Capt. Joseph W.
Byrne of the 104th Precinct in Queens were transferred after statistics showed
an increase in crimes in their commands.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Commission Howard Safir denies Driscoll's allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I look at whether or not to transfer a precinct commander, I look at
the totality of his performance," Safir said. "Crime reduction is, of course, a
very important factor, but community relations is a very important factor,
civilian complaints are a very important factor. Precinct morale is a factor.
Nobody gets transferred based strictly on one thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Guida replaced Capt. Charles F. Dowd when auditors found in 1988 that Dowd
had underreported crimes by classifying felonies as misdemeanors. Dowd was
transferred instead of being fired because officials said he had not willfully
deceived the department.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in 1998, the head of the Police Transportation Bureau, Chief Kenneth
Donohue, resigned after he was accused of underreporting subway crime. Earlier
that year, Safir said subway crime had been underreported for decades by as much
as 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Many crimes committed on trains or in stations were recorded as having
occurred above ground, he said, adding that the error was discovered during an
audit.
</P>
<P>
	   Other departments have seen similar problems. In 1998, the Philadelphia
police department came under fire when it was revealed that reports were being
rewritten to exclude key facts and that major offenses were being recast as
minor ones. The allegations prompted an inquiry by the FBI, and the city had to
withdraw its crime figures from the FBI for 1996, 1997 and part of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Louis Arcangeli alleged that the
department's 1996 crime statistics were softened by writing off some unsolved
crimes and misclassifying some violent crimes as nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard claimed a state audit
exonerated his department of any wrongdoing, but the audit included an FBI
finding that a significant number of robberies, rapes and car thefts were
incorrectly listed as unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Arcangeli has since been demoted to captain, but Harvard denied this was
because of his allegations. Arcangeli continues to work for the department and
said in a recent telephone interview that police commanders are now vigilant
about reporting crimes because the state is monitoring the department.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Attorney General Janet Reno ordered an informal inquiry into the
Boca Raton, Fla., police department to see if officers downgraded hundreds of
crimes to enhance the city's image as a safe place to live. The scandal cost
Police Chief Peter Petracco and the department's No. 3 ranking officer their
jobs. The department allegedly downgraded burglaries and petty thefts to the
point where they did not need to be included in the city's annual report to the
state and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Victoria Pyne, unit chief with the Uniformed Crime Reporting Program
managed by the FBI, said the federal government scrutinizes crime data from
17,000 law enforcement agencies, making it difficult for police officers
doctoring statistics to get away with it.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not seeing a lot of inaccurate statistics," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bratton also said that COMPSTAT makes it nearly impossible to fudge
statistics without it eventually being uncovered.
</P>
<P>
	   "COMPSTAT is about transparency. You have to come out and show your peers
what you've done," he said. "If crime is way down in your precinct, your
colleagues will ask you how you did that, and you'll have to answer. There's
nowhere to hide."

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton campaign trying to start fresh  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton's official entry into the
U.S. Senate race took the form of a reintroduction to the voters - this time on
a first-name basis.
<P>
	   Before a huge red, white and blue banner that shouted "Hillary for U.S.
Senate," the first lady urged New Yorkers on Sunday to look past her lack of
local roots, get to know her better and see if her positions and attitudes don't
square with theirs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll be on your side," she said repeatedly as she made history announcing
the nation's first candidacy by a first lady. "I'll fight my heart out for you."
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Clinton was to fly to Buffalo to begin a cross-state tour
capitalizing on the new beginning. A group of Republican officials will be
trying to blunt her momentum with their own news conferences, criticizing her,
in five cities.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has been campaigning for seven months. If she wins the anticipated
race against New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, she would be the first woman
independently elected to statewide office in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton took the stage in the Purchase College gymnasium with President
Clinton, their daughter, Chelsea Clinton, and her mother, Dorothy Rodham. Mrs.
Clinton's spokesman Howard Wolfson said the president "has given advice and
counsel as any husband would."
</P>
<P>
	   But the president didn't speak to the crowd Sunday, choosing instead to
yield the spotlight wholly to his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the first lady spoke, she was effusively praised by Democratic
politicians who have just the New York experience she lacks: Reps. Nita Lowey
and Charles Rangel and Sens. Charles Schumer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is
retiring.
</P>
<P>
	   Rangel, the longtime representative from Harlem, said that when a candidate
like Clinton comes along, "You don't ask where they come from. You ask are they
available to serve."
</P>
<P>
	   They praised her dedication and accomplishments in such areas as gun
control, children's health care and the environment, all issues Clinton the
candidate promised would continue to be high on her agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   A video tribute was screened, too, starting with Clinton's baby pictures and
including tributes from old friends emphasizing her dedication to women's and
children's issues and her love for her daughter and mother.
</P>
<P>
	   Opinions were offered as to whether she could make an omelet (yes) and carry
a tune (no).
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the start of an effort to tell all New Yorkers what Hillary is
really like," Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
	   When Clinton took the podium, hundreds of foot-stomping, placard-waving
college students chanted, "Hil-la-ry! Hil-la-ry!" There were more than 2,000
people in the gym, and about 20,000 more watched at house parties around the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am honored today to announce my candidacy for the U.S. Senate from New
York," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the carpetbagging issue - she has lived in New York only a
month - was "a fair question."
</P>
<P>
	   "I may be new to your neighborhood, but I'm not new to your concerns," she
countered.
</P>
<P>
	   She did not mention Giuliani by name but was clearly referring to the
combative mayor when she criticized "the divisive politics of revenge and
retribution."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Sunday, Giuliani played up his New York roots while making the
rounds of the political talk shows.
</P>
<P>
	   "My record of success comes out of my knowledge, experience, background and
life experience as a lifetime resident of the state," he said on CBS's "Face the
Nation." "How is it that the Democratic Party can't come up with a candidate for
the Senate from the state of New York?"
</P>
<P>
	   The race in New York is expected to be the most expensive Senate race in the
nation's history and has already polarized many voters.
</P>
<P>
	   A new poll released Sunday found Clinton and Giuliani in a statistical dead
heat, but with a majority expecting Giuliani to eventually win.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey by the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute shows Giuliani with a
45 percent to 42 percent lead over Clinton, but the difference disappears once
the 3-point margin of error is figured in. Ten percent of the 1,072 registered
voters surveyed by phone Feb. 2-5 were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   Fully half of those polled - including some Clinton supporters - expect the
mayor to win. Only 31 percent expect Clinton to win.
</P>
<P>
	   The numbers didn't daunt her, though.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know it's not always going to be an easy campaign," Clinton told cheering
supporters as she closed her announcement speech with a touch of affected city
accent in her voice. "But hey! This is New York!"

<HEADLINE> Decent Housing Elusive for Navajos  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE RUSHLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) -- Wanda Segina and her four young children moved to
the capital of the nation's largest American Indian nation and promptly made one
home improvement.
</P>
<P>
	   They dug an outhouse.
</P>
<P>
	   The family has no electricity, no running water and no sewer. They cook over
an open fire and bathe in water hauled in by relatives. And though the trailer
the family shares has three bedrooms, they sleep in one, huddling together in
the cold winter nights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a living hell. It's a disaster for me as a mom,'' said Segina, whose
children attend the local elementary school.
</P>
<P>
	   Segina's living conditions are shared by thousands on the 4.8 million-acre
Navajo Reservation, which sprawls across portions of Arizona, New Mexico and
Utah, and throughout America's Indian reservations, where housing is in
desperately short supply and often substandard.
</P>
<P>
	   The National American Indian Housing Council estimates U.S. reservations
need 200,000 houses to alleviate overcrowding and replace inadequate dwellings.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of the Navajo Reservation's 56,372 homes lack complete
plumbing and a large percentage still use wood as the primary heating source,
according to 1990 census figures.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The country is moving so rapidly, we're losing the chance to catch up,''
said Navajo community development director Benjamin Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   What keeps many American Indians from being able to buy or live in adequate
homes is a head-spinning host of problems: high unemployment, few willing
lenders, almost no private land and bureaucratic red tape.
</P>
<P>
	   Even basic knowledge about establishing good credit and applying for
mortgages can trip up many would-be buyers, said Ernest Goatson, director of the
Navajo Housing Service Department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The (federal) housing program is more of a subsidy program than a home
ownership program,'' he said. ``They see a house more as a giveaway.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tradition can also prove a major obstacle to modern housing, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
	   Navajos have historically lived far apart, with the rugged northern Arizona
hills separating their corn crops and sheep from their neighbors. Their hogans,
round dwellings built from native trees, were constructed by individual
families.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The way they saw their homes was spiritual, more of a cathedral, not
property,'' Jones said. Building a home, he said, was a measure of manhood.
</P>
<P>
	   For Navajos like Segina, for whom traditional dwellings are less important,
money is an insurmountable obstacle.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Segina, roughly half of the Navajo Reservation's 151,105 residents are
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
	   The single mother's only sources of income are child support and the odd
auto-repair job, making it almost impossible for her to raise the $6,000 it
would cost to connect her to the closest power line and the $8,000 it would cost
for a water connection.
</P>
<P>
	   So instead, her children Maxine, Keevin, Marita and Thurman do their
homework by the daylight that seeps through the living room window or by a
Coleman lantern at night. They drink canned milk and eat canned meat.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Navajos with steady jobs face obstacles to home ownership.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones holds a position in Navajo government roughly equivalent to a Cabinet
post, yet he lives in government housing he calls a ``stall.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd be happy to buy a place if there was a place to buy, but there's
not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian reservations are generally made up of trust land controlled by the
federal government or family allotments, which can have dozens or even hundreds
of owners. Such allotments create so much red tape and uncertainty for lending
institutions that conventional mortgages are rarely granted.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 1992 and 1996, just 90 conventional loans were made in Indian
country, and half of those came from a tribally owned bank, said Christopher
Boesen, executive director of the National American Indian Housing Council in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Reservations sorely lack private financing because many lenders don't see
reservations as viable home loan markets, he said, forcing many Indians to live
in substandard housing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the land America has forgotten,'' said Scott Bray, who works with
the Navajo community development division but is not a tribal member. ``America
has forgotten about these people.''

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Plane Lands in London  </HEADLINE>
   By AUDREY WOODS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- The Afghan passenger airliner forced by
unidentified hijackers on a tense journey across Central Asia and Europe landed
at London's Stansted airport early Monday. So far there have been no reported
injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 727 taxied to a secluded spot on a runway about half-mile from
the main terminal. Police and emergency vehicles assembled nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ariana Airlines plane was seized shortly after take off Sunday, about
12:30 a.m. EST Sunday, while on a domestic flight from the Afghan capital,
Kabul, to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif. The plane made stops in
Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia before arriving in London just after 2 a.m. (9
p.m. EST Sunday).
</P>
<P>
	   Essex Police Deputy Chief Constable Charles Clark said that negotiators had
made contact with the plane. He said he could not confirm the number or identity
of the hostage-takers, nor anything about the demands.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks were conducted in English, he said. Clark said the team includes
interpreters, but did not reveal what language the interpreters spoke. ``Things
seem to be calm at this moment'' on the plane, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark said that as far as police can tell, there are 140 people on the
plane, including the hijackers and crew.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our policing priority is clearly and will remain clearly the safe release
of everybody on that aircraft,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kim White, a spokeswoman for the local Essex Police department, said
authorities are well prepared for hijackings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a contingency plan which we regularly practice for these types of
events and have dealt with hijacks at Stansted in the past,'' White told the
British Broadcasting Corp. ``So we are very well prepared for this type of event
and hope to open up peaceful negotiations very shortly.''
</P>
<P>
	   When planes have been hijacked and crews have been ordered to land in
Britain, it has become routine to route them to Stansted, 38 miles north of
London. Planes can be kept well away from the terminal building and other
aircraft while negotiations can be carried on with the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers released nine passengers in Moscow, but made no political
demands, Russian security service spokesman Alexander Zdanovich told reporters
at Sheremetyevo-1 airport. He said the hijackers had asked only for food, for
the plane's toilets to be cleaned and for refueling while in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the people aboard the jet had been harmed, Zdanovich said, although
it remained unclear how many people were aboard. Russian news reports said there
were 131 passengers and nine crew before the release in Moscow, but other
sources said there were as many as 160 aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The passengers included 20 women and 23 or 24 children, said Zdanovich. All
the passengers released in Moscow were male.
</P>
<P>
	   An emergency official in Kazakstan said there were 20 hijackers, but three
passengers who were released in Kazakstan said eight to 10 hijackers were
aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The identity of the hijackers remained unclear. A diplomat familiar with the
negotiations in Moscow said the hijackers were seeking the release of a prisoner
from the Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghan media speculated that the hijackers wanted the release of opposition
figure Ismail Khan, a former regional governor who has been held since 1997 by
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
	   But a spokesman for the alliance fighting Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia denied that the Afghan opposition was responsible for the latest
hijacking. ``We condemn any act of terrorism,'' the spokesman, identified only
as Abdullah, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten passengers were also released in Uzbekistan, the hijacked plane's first
stop, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijacking comes six weeks after an eight-day hijacking of an Indian
Airlines plane ended peacefully in southern Afghanistan. The hijackers in that
case freed their hostages after India released three pro-Kashmiri militants from
jail.
</P>
<P>
	   After being seized over Afghanistan Sunday morning, the Afghan plane was
flown to Tashkent, Uzbekistan and then landed in the northern Kazak city of
Aktyubinsk because of a leak in its right fuel tank, the Kazak spokesman said.
It was not immediately known whether the leak was fixed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Afghan state-run airline is under international sanctions and is not
permitted to fly international routes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ariana has four aging Boeing 727 aircraft and five Russian-made Antonov
aircraft. Maintenance conditions are considered extremely poor in the country,
which is bankrupt and has been battered by more than 20 years of war. The
Taliban, who rule 90 percent of Afghanistan, are fighting their northern-based
enemies on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions against Afghanistan's state-owned
airline in November to punish the ruling Taliban movement for its refusal to
extradite suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden, who has been living in
Afghanistan for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban say they won't turn over bin Laden because Afghan culture and
tradition make it impossible to hand over a guest to his enemies.

<HEADLINE> Dominica Leader To Form Coalition  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE FAUL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPRINGFIELD PLANTATION, Dominica (AP) -- Dominica's new leader is a scion of
the plantation-owning elite who spurned his family's bourgeois ways to fight for
independence and help lead the Caribbean's black power movement.
</P>
<P>
	   At 58, Rosie Douglas has mellowed. He now touts his lush island's glorious
prospects in eco-tourism. But when he condemns the outgoing government's
excesses -- like selling passports to dubious foreigners -- one hears echoes of
the fiery determination galvanized during a stint in a Canadian prison.
</P>
<P>
	   In the early 1970s, Caribbean students at Toronto's Sir George William
University held a sit-in at the school's computer center, alleging they were
being given failing grades because they were black.
</P>
<P>
	   Police moved in, the mainframe computer was destroyed and students were
arrested. Douglas was jailed for 18 months, then deported, although he later
earned a political science degree from Montreal's prestigious McGill University.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was his incarceration in Canada that led to the setting up of the black
power movement throughout the Caribbean and established Douglas as a radical
figure in Dominica and throughout the region,'' said Crispin Gregoire, an
organizer of the campaign that swept the Dominica Labor Party to power in last
Monday's vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many of us, the younger people you see around him now, were in high school
when he began the movement and inspired us to political activism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Back home, Douglas founded the Popular Independence Committee to fight for
freedom from British rule. After independence, he was briefly appointed a
senator. But when Hurricane David devastated the island in 1979 and he invited
Cuban troops to help, Douglas was fired, apparently as a condition for U.S.
relief.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, his Labor Party boasts of the 400-plus Dominicans educated at Cuban
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor victory was its first in 20 years, and last Thursday, Douglas -- a
balding man with an infectious smile who looks much younger than his years --
was sworn in as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
	   Ironically, victory came in part because Douglas, a former Marxist who took
control of the fractured Labor Party in 1992, steadily moved the party from far
left to center. In the new government, Labor shares power with a one-time enemy,
the conservative Dominica Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas has indicated he will likely scrap the outgoing government's
controversial policy of selling passports to foreigners. The U.S. State
Department complained last year that Dominica had sold passports to some 300
Russians. Noting this happened at a time when organized crime linked to Russians
had sharply increased, the Americans raised concerns the Russians were
laundering money through Dominica's offshore banks.
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas also said he hoped to transform Dominica into the eco-tourism center
of the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor's campaign literature features pictures of Douglas with British Labor
Prime Minister Tony Blair and with members of the French Socialist Party in
Paris. Outgoing Premier Edison James criticized the numerous trips Douglas makes
off the island each year -- he was away 114 days last year -- but the Labor
Party countered that Douglas travels the world ``to make the contacts and meet
the people who can work with Dominica to bring investment, prosperity and create
the jobs we need.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Police Raid University  </HEADLINE>
   By NIKO PRICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- For 9 1/2 months, Mexico's top authorities seemed
powerless to wrest the country's most important university from a tiny band of
radicals with names like Mosh and The Devil.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sunday, the ordeal ended swiftly and without bloodshed as federal police
officers marched into a marathon meeting of the strike's governing council,
rounding up 430 students -- including the eight top strike leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   After 291 days, the strike at the National Autonomous University of Mexico
was over.
</P>
<P>
	   In just four hours, 2,260 federal police officers, armed only with batons
and shields, raided the sprawling campus, arresting a total of 632 strikers.
There were no injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A democratic society cannot allow the kidnapping of the national
university,'' said Interior Secretary Diodoro Carrasco.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike at the 260,000-student university -- Latin America's largest --
began in April to protest plans to raise annual tuition, which had been just a
few cents, to the equivalent of $140.
</P>
<P>
	   The university backed down, but a small core of radical students continued
to occupy the campus. They pushed a six-point agenda to reverse recent academic
reforms and give students more power within the university administration. They
also used the strike as a stage to denounce the free-market economy and Mexico's
political system.
</P>
<P>
	   What little public sympathy that may have existed for the strikers faded as
a result of their traffic-clogging and sometimes violent protests, vandalism of
university buildings, intolerance of dissenting opinions and intransigence in
negotiations. A referendum last month showed students and teachers
overwhelmingly sided with the university in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   But officials were reluctant to forcibly retake the campus. The strikers
were believed to have guns and explosives. No one wanted to risk repeating one
of the darkest moments in modern Mexican history: a 1968 massacre of university
students.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's raid came five days after a clash that injured 37 security guards
and two days after a failed negotiating session.
</P>
<P>
	   The clash seemed to mark a turning point. ``It became evident to me, very
sadly, that efforts to reach a resolution within the university community had
reached their limit and that they had to be complemented with the application of
the law,'' Zedillo said in a speech Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Zedillo said the strikers ``through force, converted into their own private
property a public asset, a university that is supported by all Mexicans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's raid seemed calculated to minimize the potential for violence.
Police did not carry guns, and human rights officials went along as observers.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal police said they sealed off the campus, then moved in. The handful
of strikers guarding the barricades didn't resist.
</P>
<P>
	   Alberto Gonzalez Camacho, a 27-year-old law student, said he was sleeping
when police arrived. He said he escaped by running into the hills behind the
university.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They came in swinging,'' he said. ``They took everyone they could. There
was no resistance. We were sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
	   Buses carried the strikers from the university as parents and supporters
outside the police line flashed victory signs at them and cursed at the police.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of people held protest marches on behalf of the strikers later
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not known when classes would resume. The university will have to
repair damaged equipment and replace stolen materials.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the arrests, the strike committee says the struggle isn't over. A
message on its Web site called on students to resist the occupation of the
campus by police.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Comrades, we are in an emergency situation,'' it said. ``The movement is
barely beginning.''

<HEADLINE> Giuliani hits talk show circuit ahead of Clinton's announcement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Don't expect Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to announce he's
running for U.S. Senate anytime soon.
<P>
	   Not that he's not running, mind you, he just doesn't feel the need to
formally say so.
</P>
<P>
	   "In 1989, when I ran for mayor, I announced, I lost," Giuliani said on Fox
News Sunday, just hours before first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton officially
launched her campaign for Daniel Patrick Moynihan's U.S. Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani continued: "In 1997, I decided not to announce. And I won with the
largest margin a Republican has ever won in Democratic New York City. So I said
to myself, 'You got to find a better way to do this then, the big kind of
announcement thing."'
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement that there's not likely to be an announcement came during
the mayor's whirlwind tour of five Sunday morning news shows, likely designed to
blunt the impact of Clinton's big party in Purchase during which she told 2,000
cheering supporters she wants to be their senator.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor did at least strongly imply that he IS in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   "May we assume that you wouldn't be running this Sunday morning gauntlet (of
talk shows) if you were not running?" asked Brit Hume on Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ahhh, yes," the mayor said, hesitating.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked on ABC's "This Week" if he planned to run, Giuliani responded,
"Looks that way."
</P>
<P>
	   And on CNN's "Late Edition," he said: "Well, there's always doubt.
Otherwise, I might as well make some kind of Hollywood-style announcement of
some kind or other. But right now, it's very much a direction we're moving in.
We've raised over $12 million, we have over 90,000 donors."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani said his campaign would focus on his success in reducing crime and
welfare and cutting taxes and was unlikely to bring up the Whitewater scandal as
a political issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "I doubt it, unless some relevant facts come out," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani also acknowledged that he and Clinton hold strikingly similar
positions on a number of issues - abortion rights, the death penalty, gun
control, gay rights and welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are a lot of issues on which we agree," he said. "There are a lot of
issues in which we disagree. I think there's a fundamental difference ... I
believe in solutions that don't necessarily involve building larger government."
</P>
<P>
	   Another difference between New York's Senate candidates: Clinton has
promised to serve her full six-year term if she is elected; Giuliani refused to
do the same.
</P>
<P>
	   And when asked whether he has the proper temperament for the U.S. Senate,
Giuliani said on "Meet the Press" that he had successfully worked with the
overwhelmingly Democratic City Council to pass budgets and other legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I tend to be a leader," he said. "I have strong ideas; I push very, very
hard for those ideas. ... We could use a senator from New York who is a strong
advocate."

<HEADLINE> Russian-NATO Relationship Mending  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFFREY ULBRICH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO's 78-day air war against Yugoslavia and
Russia's offensive in Chechnya all but killed off their budding cooperation, but
new signs indicate Moscow is rethinking last spring's decision to storm out of
the relationship.
</P>
<P>
	   As recently as last month, things were bleak. NATO was condemning Russia's
assault on Grozny, and Moscow was telling the allies to tend to their own onion
patch.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO officials, however, say they have detected a warming over the last two
weeks. The Russians have invited Secretary-General Lord Robertson to Moscow.
Acting President Vladimir Putin is pursuing the war in Chechnya vigorously but
talking more softly. And the Russians have begun returning to arms control
meetings and are resuming bilateral military cooperation with some of the
allies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The auspices are very good for a real collaboration,'' said Chris
Donnelly, special adviser to the secretary-general for Eastern European affairs.
But, he added, ``It won't be too quick. It won't be too dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
	   Progress in this warming trend, everyone agrees, depends on the Russian
presidential election March 26. That is why, in the view of officials here,
Putin can't move quickly to resume relations with NATO. He is generally viewed
as somebody the West can work with. Should he lose, however, it could be back to
square one.
</P>
<P>
	   It was on a brilliantly sunny May afternoon in Paris that a beaming Boris
Yeltsin embraced President Clinton and leaders from other NATO nations and
signed the NATO-Russia cooperation and security agreement. The deal called for a
Permanent Joint Council, where the two sides could consult on matters of mutual
interest, and the posting of a Russian general to NATO's supreme military
headquarters in southern Belgium.
</P>
<P>
	   That was 1997. Two wars and two years later, the agreement was in tatters.
The Russians virtually shut down the Permanent Joint Council, refusing to
discuss anything with NATO beyond Bosnia and Kosovo, where Russia has troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The paradox in the Russia-NATO relationship is that military cooperation
remained excellent. The Russian forces under allied command in Bosnia and Kosovo
have performed well, and Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme allied commander, never
misses an opportunity to praise Moscow's forces in NATO-led operations in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's basically the difference between the political side of Russia and its
commanders,'' Clark said. ``The Russian troops are reporting up the military
chain. They want their mission to be a success.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the Paris agreement, Moscow named a three-star general to work at
Clark's military headquarters. That relationship was good until Moscow
downgraded the post to a two-star position this year, named Gen. Lt. Vladimir
Laginov and transformed the job into a political position.
</P>
<P>
	   Rather than an experienced field commander, Laginov is essentially an
intelligence officer subordinated to the Russian ambassador, the Foreign
Ministry and the political section of the Defense Ministry, NATO officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Russia made a mistake, in my view, in suspending consultations in the
Permanent Joint Council when the NATO air campaign began,'' said Alexander
Vershbow, the U.S. ambassador to the alliance. ``Instead of continuing to engage
with NATO to try to reach solutions to complex problems, Russia shut off an
important channel through which we might have been able to find a solution to
the crisis much sooner.''
</P>
<P>
	   Experts say NATO relations are suffering from the internal struggle in
Russia between the faction led by former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, which
wants to restore Russia to the glories of superpower days, and a second, now
embodied by Putin, that believes prosperity will follow improvements to the
Russian economy, enforcement of law and order and cooperation with the West.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, NATO officials say, the Russian military elite and
intelligence services have assumed greater influence in the decision-making
process. That has led to a more belligerent attitude and a revision of Moscow's
military doctrine, broadening the authority to use nuclear weapons and taking a
tougher attitude toward the West.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, as Jakub Godzimirski, a Russia expert at the Norwegian
Institute of International Affairs, put it, ``Russia is doomed to cooperate with
NATO.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The question is whether Putin will be able to free himself from the
influence of the military, which now holds sway in Russia,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Farmers Facing Quota Cut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LANCASTER, Ky. (AP) -- Kentucky's tobacco farmers are trying to figure out
how to cope with the increasing pressures facing their business, including a
45.3 percent cut in the quota.
</P>
<P>
	   The reduction in the amount each farmer is allowed to sell under the federal
price support program was announced last week by the Agriculture Department. It
will cost Kentucky growers at least $264 million in tobacco sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think about it every night when I go to bed, what am I going to do?" said
Keith Middleton, 36. He and his twin bother, Kevin, and their father, Maurice,
have raised burley tobacco in Garrard County for many years.
</P>
<P>
	   "You take people our age and younger you see very few continuing to raise
tobacco," Kevin Middleton said. "After our generation is over, it'll be over
with."
</P>
<P>
	   The twins said that in the last three years, their quota has dropped from
90,000 to 30,000 pounds. That means their gross income from tobacco now is
roughly $108,000 less than it was three years ago, Keith Middleton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although farmers across the state share their concern, such worries are not
limited to people who grow tobacco. Bankers and retailers see potential problems
ahead as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Particularly hurt will be burley-dependent counties like Garrard, where
tobacco amounts to half of the $33 million in annual farm income. The quota cut
is troubling to A.T. Arnold, who owns a shop that sells antiques, glassware and
knickknacks on Lancaster's square.
</P>
<P>
	   The store opened last fall and had a good Christmas, thanks in large part to
the money that tobacco pumps into the economy. Next Christmas might not be as
good.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any time you eliminate money, you eliminate everybody," Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pressures on Kentucky tobacco do not end with the quota cut.
</P>
<P>
	   As farmers scramble to find more pounds to grow, the price for leasing
quotas from other land owners has risen dramatically.
</P>
<P>
	   Also entering the mix is cigarette-maker Philip Morris, which announced last
week that it will start a program in which the farmer would agree in advance to
sell his crop to the manufacturer. Such contract growing, coupled with the quota
cut, would reduce the amount of tobacco going to auction warehouses, putting new
economic pressure on them.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackie Brown of Woodford County said his concerns about the future of
tobacco are serious enough that he is considering taking a job in town. He grows
more than 140,000 pounds of tobacco on 55 acres. Before getting into farming he
sold copying machines, and he has thought about getting back into sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Working in town isn't new to the Middletons, either. For three years, the
twins worked at a Danville factory but left because they didn't like swing
shifts. Returning to factory work would mean commuting because opportunities in
Garrard are limited, Keith Middleton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, they plan to raise an acre of strawberries, and have even talked
about growing flowers. But they said neither of those enterprises would replace
the income lost by tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   As somber as the situation is, there are some saving graces. The national
tobacco settlement will put cash into farmers' pockets and some money will be
used to restructure agriculture in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
	   And some farmers have a cushioning "carry over" of pounds they can grow this
year because the drought reduced the amount they could have grown last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Maurice Middleton is saddened that the crop he has grown all his
lifetime may not continue to provide for his sons.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've tried to tell these boys to take pride in the tobacco they raise," he
said. "I don't know what's coming of it."

<HEADLINE> Great Nation Without National Debt!  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A sure-fire applause line early in President Clinton's
recent State of the Union address might well have drawn a ghostly chuckle from
one of the president's most celebrated and crusty predecessors.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton forecast huge budget surpluses for years to come. ``If we stay on
this path, we can pay down the debt entirely in just 13 years ... and make
America debt-free for the first time since Andrew Jackson was president in
1835.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even in Jackson's time, a debt-free government was a mind-dazzling prospect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the first, last and only time in American history, the nation did not
owe a cent to anyone,'' Jackson biographer Robert V. Remini wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Never mind that Clinton's vision deals only with the $3.7 trillion of
government debt in public hands, not the additional $2 trillion held by
government trust funds such as Social Security. The total national debt stands
at $5.7 trillion.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson -- nicknamed ``Old Hickory'' for the tree so hard it resists nails
-- might reel at those numbers, unable to comprehend why the chief executives
who followed him were so willing to put up with an endless ocean of red ink.
</P>
<P>
	   For Jackson, national debt was ``a national curse,'' even though the
unwelcome and unexpected aftermath of paying it off in 1835 included an
overheated economy, a financial collapse -- and more red ink than ever.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My vow shall be to pay the national debt, to prevent a monied aristocracy
from growing up around our administration that must bend to its views, and
ultimately destroy the liberty of our country,'' Jackson said during his
unsuccessful first presidential campaign in 1824.
</P>
<P>
	   As Jackson saw it, the chief malefactor was the nation's central bank, the
Second Bank of the United States. He denounced it as a corrupt and corrupting
financial octopus.
</P>
<P>
	   The destruction of the central bank and the dispersal of federal deposits
into smaller state banks became the central objective of Jackson's presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Eliminating the national debt was no small part of that objective,'' John
Steele Gordon wrote in his 1997 book, ``Hamilton's Blessing, The Extraordinary
Life and Times of the National Debt.''
</P>
<P>
	   By the end of 1834, in the middle of his second term, Jackson jubilantly
announced the debt would be paid in full. He said the Treasury's books would
show a surplus of $440,000 in 1835, rising to a projected $19 million by the end
of 1835 and $29 million more in 1836.
</P>
<P>
	   Official Washington celebrated at an extravagant banquet, held with
deliberate symbolism on Jan. 8, 1835, the 20th anniversary of Jackson's great
victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
	   The toasts flew as furiously as bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This month of January 1835, in the fifty-eighth year of the Republic,
ANDREW JACKSON being president, the NATIONAL DEBT IS PAID!'' roared Sen. Thomas
Hart Benton of Missouri. ``And the apparition, so long unseen on earth, a great
nation without a national debt! stands revealed to the astonished vision of a
wondering world.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president did not attend, but he sent a toast to be read in his absence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Payment of the Public Debt,'' it read. ``Let us commemorate it as an
event which gives us increased power as a nation, and reflects luster on our
federal union, of whose justice, fidelity and wisdom it is a glorious
illustration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Modern scholars have their own perspective on the events of 1835.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jackson's view of the national debt was terribly naive -- but it was the
naivete of the ordinary citizen,'' biographer Remini wrote in ``Andrew Jackson,
The Course of American Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   For them, paying the national debt was the equivalent of ``paying off the
mortgage on the old homestead,'' Remini said. ``It was a mark of achievement, a
badge of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the national mortgage did not stay paid for long.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Gordon's account, once the state banks had the federal
government's money on deposit they rapidly increased the money supply. That,
despite Jackson's best efforts to avert it, led to a surge in speculation. And
that led to rampant inflation and an economic contraction lasting 72 months.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Soon, the entire economy was deep in depression,'' Gordon wrote. ``But
Jackson, with the luck and timing characteristic of great politicians, had
retired from office on March 4th 1837, just before the full brunt of the
depression had struck.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal revenues quickly faded, shrinking from $51 million in 1836 to less
than $25 million the following year. With revenues cut in half, the national
debt climbed back to $32 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The debt has been growing ever since.

<HEADLINE> Stevie Wonder Sings at Funeral  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- Motown musician Thomas "Beans" Bowles got a fitting sendoff
at a funeral that drew saxophones, trumpets and trombones -- and a performance
by Stevie Wonder.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a celebration of an angel on Earth. It is also a celebration of a
true spirit," Wonder said during Saturday's funeral for Bowles. The baritone
saxophonist died Jan. 28 after a 10-year battle with prostate cancer. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowles was a baritone saxophonist who played on several Motown hits and
helped design the traveling Motown Revue.
</P>
<P>
	   During services at Central United Methodist Church, Wonder played the Duke
Ellington song "Satin Doll" for the standing-room-only crowd. He said he
considered Bowles "a teacher and also a father."
</P>
<P>
	   A group of about 25 musicians, dubbed "The Friends of Beans Orchestra,"
played in front of Bowles casket, leading the family processional in a New
Orleans-style ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Diallo jury to hear from medical examiner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Prosecutors say an autopsy shows that one of the 19
police bullets that stuck Amadou Diallo tunneled up his leg - a possible sign he
was shot while on the ground.
<P>
	   A medical examiner who did the autopsy on Diallo is expected to present that
finding and others at the close of the prosecution case against four police
officers accused of murdering the 22-year-old street vendor on his Bronx
doorstep.
</P>
<P>
	   The witness could testify as early as Tuesday. The trial resumes today.
</P>
<P>
	   An autopsy found that one of the 41 bullets the defendants fired at Diallo
on Feb. 4, 1999, went into his right leg, traveled upward and lodged behind his
right knee. The bullet's route could help prove prosecutor Eric Warner's claim
last week in opening statements that the officers kept shooting after the West
African immigrant "was falling down or actually on the ground."
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy,
27, have pleaded innocent to the second-degree murder charges. If convicted,
they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying of the unarmed black man by the four white officers produced a
flood of pretrial publicity and protests alleging widespread abuse of minorities
by police. An appeals court responded by moving the case to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the plainclothes officers made a "conscious decision" to
kill Diallo without warning. But defense attorneys argue the shooting was a
tragic mistake made after the victim ignored orders to stop and pulled out a
black wallet that, because of darkness, appeared to be a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first two days of testimony last week, the jury heard from police and
other witnesses who described the spot where Diallo died as well lighted. One of
Diallo's neighbors, Debbie Rivera, also testified that she heard a volley of
gunfire followed by a brief pause, then a longer, final volley.
</P>
<P>
	   The pause could be used to argue the officers had a chance to cease fire.
But defense attorneys plan to call a sergeant who questioned Rivera on the night
of the shooting. His reports says she heard one continuous burst.
</P>
<P>
	   Other defense witnesses include a paramedic who used a flashlight to view
Diallo's body in a vestibule because, attorneys say, the lighting was so poor.
The defense also said a civilian witness would testify that Diallo was acting
suspiciously before the officers showed up.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the defense case will be the officers themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   "You will hear from Ken Boss," attorney Steven Brounstein told jurors. "And
what I will ask you to do is step inside his shoes and try to view what he
viewed and hear what he heard that night."

<HEADLINE> U.S. National Missile Defense Near  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The closer the Clinton administration gets to deploying a
national missile defense, the farther it seems to get from persuading other
countries -- even some of its allies -- that it is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Munich Conference on Security Policy over the weekend, Defense
Secretary William Cohen heard words of doubt from some European members of NATO
and outright opposition from Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
	   Wang Guangya, China's deputy foreign minister, told the conference on Sunday
that ``a certain country'' -- leaving no doubt he meant the United States -- was
pursuing an antimissile capability ``in an attempt to seek absolute security for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
	   That notion is similar to a concern Cohen heard expressed less pointedly by
some European officials at the gathering in Germany. They said they feared that
if the United States alone gains the capability of defending its borders from
long-range missile attack, it will create a ``two-tier'' system of security with
the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen responded that the United States will do what it believes necessary to
protect itself from potential missile attacks. ``And we would certainly think
that it would be advisable for others to consider what measures they can take to
protect their people,'' he said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   That go-it-alone approach is not generally what alliance partners like to
hear from their U.S. ally, which throughout the Cold War was the guarantor of
European security against the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen was careful to point out that President Clinton has yet to commit the
United States to actually building a missile defense. Although the Pentagon has
spent tens of billions of dollars pursuing technologies in recent decades, it
remains unclear whether a reliable system is within reach.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is scheduled to decide this summer whether to go ahead with
deployment of a network of radars and interceptors designed to protect all 50
U.S. states against a limited attack by ballistic missiles. A key factor in his
decision will be the outcome of an interceptor test scheduled for this spring.
If the test fails -- as did the last one in January -- deployment almost
certainly would be delayed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon was expected to announce today that the administration's 2001
budget proposal includes an additional $2.2 billion for missile defense, pushing
the cost of deploying a limited system to $12.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who was among a dozen members of Congress who
attended the Munich conference, said the Europeans are wrong to think the
missile defense project spells trans-Atlantic trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I can see how they could reach that conclusion,'' he added in an
interview. The Europeans, as well as the Chinese and Russians, are aware that
even though the Pentagon says the antimissile system would be limited in scope,
some in Congress are eager to expand it.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how the Europeans he spoke with seem to feel about the U.S. project,
Biden said, ``Mystified. They wonder, `What's this really about? Is this just
the beginning? What's the deal?'''
</P>
<P>
	   In China's view, the U.S. pursuit of missile defense is part of a broader
American effort to impose its will on the rest of the world, not only through
military might but also economic dominance.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia holds similar suspicions about American motives. In remarks to the
Munich conference, Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov from the international relations
department of the Russian General Staff accused the administration of
exaggerating the immediacy of missile threats from Iran, Iraq and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   Ivashov asserted that Russia and China are the real targets of U.S. missile
defense, drawing a retort from Cohen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' the defense secretary said. The
reason for deploying antimissile defenses, he said, is to protect U.S. territory
against a small-scale attack by North Korea, Iran or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen went so far as to predict that in the next five to 10 years, those
three countries ``will be able to hold all of NATO at risk with their missile
forces.''

<HEADLINE> US Considers Ways To Cut Oil Prices  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. MANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is trying to decide whether to
dip into the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve for only the second time to
drive down soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Key to that decision could be whether Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is
able to persuade major oil producers to back off a 2-year-old production
hold-down.
</P>
<P>
	   Ideally, ``the market ought to set the price, but we're taking a look at
what options we have under the authorities and under the laws of the United
States,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta said on ``Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Podesta said Richardson's contacts with oil ministers of producing countries
-- several already, with visits scheduled to Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico
planned -- are a major part of the administration's effort to force prices down
from current levels close to $30 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet
next month to consider whether to extend the production cutbacks of 5 million
barrels per day, which began in 1998 and expires March 31. Some other producers
are holding down their production as well.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton released $45 million last week to help low-income people
in the frigid Northeast with their heating bills. Podesta said that besides such
stopgap measures, ``We're also trying to see what we can do to see if we can
take some of the pressure off of oil prices'' through raising market supplies,
possibly by tapping the strategic reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson has said repeatedly he does not intend to release any of the 580
million barrels of oil in the reserve to do that.
</P>
<P>
	   To the suggestion the U.S. reserve was created only to compensate for
disruptions in supply, not control prices, Podesta said it ``was put in place
with its name in mind, to have a strategic reserve to make sure that we had an
adequate supply of oil, and that's what it's used for.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he also said: ``There are certain authorities under the law that are
available, and we're taking a look at those.''
</P>
<P>
	   The reserve, first suggested during World War II, was established in 1975.
Its only use so far was a partial drawdown in 1991 at the beginning of the
Persian Gulf War. That move by President Bush and production increases
internationally maintained market stability and kept down oil price increases
during the six-week war.
</P>
<P>
	   On other issues, Podesta said:
</P>
<P>
	   --Although Clinton supports the death penalty, he has asked advisers for
research into whether it should be suspended for federal crimes, as Gov. George
Ryan did in Illinois. Ryan acted because of misgivings about the Illinois
justice system, which has seen more death row inmates exonerated and freed since
1987 than have been executed since 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Given the facts in Illinois, he's just asked us to get some more
information,'' Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
	   --The United States has ``made strong protests to the Russian government''
over the fate of Andrei Babitsky, a Russian reporter for the U.S. government's
Radio Liberty, who was arrested by Russian troops while covering the fighting in
Chechnya. The Russians contend they turned Babitsky over to Chechen rebels in
exchange for Russian prisoners-of-war, but the reporter has not been heard from
and is considered by many to have been slain by Russian soldiers.

officials say. But a panel of foreign policy experts warns that might not be
enough to keep the stockpiles away from rogue nations or terrorists.

	   Most of the additional money -- about $70 million -- will be earmarked for a
new program to help safeguard plutonium from Russia's 29 civilian nuclear power
reactors, said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Programs to help create jobs in Russia's ``nuclear cities'' and to improve
security at facilities where nuclear weapons materials is stockpiled also will
be increased under the proposal, the official said. The Energy Department is
spending $240 million on these programs this year and Clinton is asking Congress
to increase that by about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But a panel of senior foreign policy and nuclear proliferation experts said
in a new report that even more money and greater high-level priority is needed
to keep Russia's nuclear materials, including hundreds of tons of plutonium and
weapons-grade uranium, from being stolen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The possibility that the essential ingredients of nuclear weapons could
fall into the hands of terrorists and proliferating states is all too real,''
said the 117-page report produced by the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a leading Washington foreign policy think tank.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was based on findings by leading foreign policy and nuclear
weapons proliferation specialists, including senior officials of past Democratic
and Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
	   The report examined the worldwide threat posed by the potential theft of
nuclear materiel from Russia's haphazardly protected stockpiles. It urges
immediate action by the White House and Congress to expand the U.S. assistance
program -- or face a possible catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must take action to prevent a catastrophe,'' said former Sen. San Nunn,
D-Ga., the center's chairman and head of its global nuclear materials management
program.
</P>
<P>
	   The report urged that the United States spend $1 billion to blend down
highly enriched Russian uranium so it can't be used in weapons. It said
Washington also should step up efforts to help consolidate the more than 1,000
tons of plutonium and uranium now scattered in 300 buildings and 50 sites across
Russia, and name a new high-level official with direct access to the president
to coordinate the Russian assistance effort.
</P>
<P>
	   The theft of just a few pounds of highly enriched Russian uranium or
plutonium ``could allow a rogue state or terrorists group to acquire a nuclear
capability, posing a severe threat to the international community,'' the study
said. It said the ``lack of sufficient funding and senior leadership attention
on the U.S. side'' has prevented swift action to reduce the threat.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the report's authors, Matthew Bunn of Harvard's John F. Kennedy
School of Government, said the money set aside for these programs is ``woefully
insufficient,'' and more spending would be ``tiny in comparison to the cost and
risks of failure to act.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bunn, a specialist in nuclear nonproliferation issues, added in an interview
that ``the window for cooperation may be closing'' with Russia because of
increased hostility toward the West. ``It is clear already that the atmosphere
for sensitive nuclear cooperation is much worse today than it was in 1992 and
1993,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Plane Lands in London  </HEADLINE>
   By AUDREY WOODS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- The Afghan passenger airliner forced by
unidentified hijackers on a tense journey across Central Asia and Europe landed
at London's Stansted airport early Monday. There have been no reported injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 727, with 179 hostages aboard, taxied to a secluded spot on a
runway about half-mile from the main terminal. Police and emergency vehicles
assembled nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   The state-run Ariana Airlines plane was seized shortly after take off at
about 12:30 a.m. EST Sunday, for a domestic flight from the Afghan capital,
Kabul, to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif. The plane made stops in
Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia before arriving in London just after 2 a.m. (9
p.m. EST Sunday).
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers asked for a generator, tea bags and soft drinks and that they
would be provided, said Essex Police Deputy Chief Constable Charles Clark. He
said he believed the hostages included 122 men, 20 women, 23 children and 14
crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Things are going as well as can be expected at this time. It's very early
days and we hope to peacefully resolve this situation,'' Clark said. ``The
position that we adopt in this country is that we don't allow them to take off,
but, of course, that's very much a matter for negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clark said he could not confirm the number or identity of the
hostage-takers.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks were conducted in English, he said. Clark said the team includes
interpreters, but did not reveal what language the interpreters spoke. ``Things
seem to be calm at this moment'' on the plane, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our policing priority is clearly and will remain clearly the safe release
of everybody on that aircraft,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kim White, a spokeswoman for the local Essex Police department, said
authorities are well prepared for hijackings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a contingency plan which we regularly practice for these types of
events and have dealt with hijacks at Stansted in the past,'' White told the
British Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   When planes have been hijacked and crews have been ordered to land in
Britain, it has become routine to route them to Stansted, 38 miles north of
London. Planes can be kept well away from the terminal building and other
aircraft during negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers released nine passengers in Moscow, but made no political
demands, Russian security service spokesman Alexander Zdanovich told reporters
at Sheremetyevo-1 airport. He said the hijackers asked only for food, for the
plane's toilets to be cleaned and for refueling while in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   An emergency official in Kazakstan said there were 20 hijackers, but three
passengers who were released in Kazakstan said eight to 10 hijackers were
aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The identity of the hijackers remained unclear. A diplomat familiar with the
negotiations in Moscow said the hijackers sought to free a prisoner held in the
Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghan media speculated that the hijackers were dissidents who wanted the
release of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor who has been held since 1997
by Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement. Khan is a member of Afghanistan's
opposition alliance, which still rules roughly 10 percent of the war shattered
country.
</P>
<P>
	   But Afghanistan's former president Burhanuddin Rabbani, ousted by the
Taliban army in 1996, denounced the hijacking calling it ``an act of terrorism,
jeopardizing the life and security of innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whomever is behind this act shall realize that their initiative amounts to
an act of terrorism and blemishes the name of Afghanistan and dishonors the
Afghan people,'' Rabbani said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijacking comes six weeks after an eight-day hijacking of an Indian
Airlines plane ended peacefully in southern Afghanistan. The hijackers in that
case freed their hostages after India released three pro-Kashmiri militants from
jail.
</P>
<P>
	   After being seized over Afghanistan Sunday morning, the Afghan plane was
flown to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, where ten passengers were released in return for
food and fuel. The plane then landed in the northern Kazak city of Aktyubinsk
because of a leak in its right fuel tank, the Kazak spokesman said. It was not
immediately known whether the leak was fixed, but three hostages were released
there.
</P>
<P>
	   The Afghan airline is under international sanctions and is not permitted to
fly international routes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ariana has four aging Boeing 727 aircraft and five Russian-made Antonov
aircraft. Maintenance conditions are considered extremely poor in the country,
which is bankrupt and has been battered by more than 20 years of war. The
Taliban, who rule 90 percent of Afghanistan, are fighting their northern-based
enemies on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions against Afghanistan in November to
punish the ruling Taliban movement for its refusal to extradite suspected
terrorist Osama bin Laden, who has been living in Afghanistan for the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban say they won't turn over bin Laden because Afghan culture and
tradition make it impossible to hand over a guest to his enemies.

<HEADLINE> Simon Estes carves niche as one of the finest performers of Wagner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Simon Estes was flying around the world, singing to
rousing ovations. But back in his hotel room at night, he was "crying like a
baby," says the towering 61-year-old baritone.
<P>
	   "And I had lumps in my throat bigger than grapefruits - before, during and
after the singing," Estes says of the personal struggle after his recent
divorce. "But I thought, well, I have to take this incredible pain and make
myself stronger, and go on."
</P>
<P>
	   With his patrician presence and rich voice, Estes has carved a niche for
himself as one of the world's finest performers of Verdi and Wagner, singing
alongside stars like Placido Domingo and Leontyne Price. And his new
autobiography is filled with photos of Estes in the company of world leaders -
Nelson Mandela, Pope John Paul II, former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   But the glossy tome begins with a simple boy growing up in Iowa amid fierce
segregation.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I was a kid, we couldn't go into the swimming pool with white people,"
Estes remembers. "They'd disinfect the pool, and then they'd let the white kids
come in. You know, those 'black' germs were in the water."
</P>
<P>
	   This kid had a splendid voice. He ended up at New York's Juilliard School
and soon became the only black male opera singer of great celebrity.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, he says, "the world did not let me forget that I have a darker skin
color than you."
</P>
<P>
	   For his 1965 debut at the Deutsche Oper in Berlin, he was subjected to
makeup that made him look "white as a ghost," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   And in the 1970s, "I remember singing in one of those Southern cities, and
the director of the opera house came up to me and said, 'Simon, I want to work
with you, but I can't because some of the people who are giving us money said if
I engaged you, they're going to take away the funds. And we need the money."'
</P>
<P>
	   Things have changed. In his hometown of Centerville, Iowa, the local high
school auditorium was named after him several years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was a way of saying, 'Simon, we're sorry,"' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He has given concerts around Iowa, and the state has given him the Iowan
Award, it's highest honor. This was the first time it went to a black person.
</P>
<P>
	   But his racially charged journey has left its mark.
</P>
<P>
	   When he teaches classes at Iowa State University, he speaks not only about
music but about human values, telling students: "Don't ever compromise your
principles to try to get a job, or a position or relationship, or whatever."
</P>
<P>
	   And despite his success, he's still waging an age-old battle to bring more
talented black male singers into classical music. There are plenty of black
female stars, he says, but only a handful of men.
</P>
<P>
	   "Find me a group of people where one gender can sing, and the other gender
cannot sing!" he says. "It's one of the last big hurdles that we still have to
overcome."
</P>
<P>
	   Estes tempers such frustrations by thinking of Nelson Mandela, for whom he
has sung.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here was a man who was unjustly incarcerated for 27 years. He came out and
not one time did he speak of revenge or hatred or bitterness," Estes says. "In
order not to have hatred when you have been so unjustly treated requires an
inner strength that I personally think has to come from a higher source."
</P>
<P>
	   Before each performance, he prays.
</P>
<P>
	   "I pray that the gift God has given me touches somebody's heart out there,"
says Estes, his face illuminated by a winter sun as he sits on the glassed-in
porch of his New Jersey home.
</P>
<P>
	   He glances at his watch to make sure it's not too late to call Switzerland,
where his three daughters live with their mother.
</P>
<P>
	   He has just finished vacuuming the white carpet; again he's a bachelor who
does his own cooking, laundry and ironing. He doesn't need to do housework,
given his six-figure income from work at the Met, the Vienna State Opera and the
Washington Opera.
</P>
<P>
	   But this man has a different definition of success.
</P>
<P>
	   "The more I sing, the more, in quotes, 'success' I have - whatever that may
be - the more humble and grateful I'd like to become, instead of feeling that
everybody has to cater to me and I have to have the presidential suite and a
limousine that's 40 feet long," Estes said.
</P>
<P>
	   To him, success means "being at peace with yourself."
</P>
<P>
	   There's at least one sore spot: The divorce he granted his wife more than a
year ago. Leaving her and their three daughters, ages 12, 14 and 16, "was the
most difficult thing in my life."
</P>
<P>
	   And it made performing tough, especially the lead role in Wagner's "Flying
Dutchman," for which Estes is famed. He pointed out that his character says at
one point, "Oh, I'm without a wife and I'm without a child," and said that's
when the lump arose in his throat.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've always been a very strong person in my life. But this broke me, it
really broke me," he says. "I flew around the world, and I was in hotel rooms
crying like a baby."
</P>
<P>
	   He survived through friends and prayer, and the shows went on. And now, his
piano accompanist tells him, he's singing at his best again.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm almost cured," Estes says. "And I think about trying to improve my
life, to be a better person."
</P>
<P>
	   He sponsors an educational foundation that gives scholarships to talented
students. Two years ago, he founded the Simon Estes High School near Cape Town,
South Africa, with almost 200 students who are focused on music. Last year, 40
of them attended school in Iowa for the academic year.
</P>
<P>
	   The baritone has perhaps another dozen years of performing ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
	   In March, he'll appear at Carnegie Hall in Ponchielli's "La Gioconda,"
followed by Verdi's "Aida" in Los Angeles with Domingo, appearances in Tokyo and
opera dates all over Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   And he says he'll stop performing "while I can still sing. ... I want to try
to be like Michael Jordan."
</P>
<P>
	   His final, dream concert in Washington is already planned, except for the
date. The program will include "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen," as well as
a rendition of the 27th Psalm, "The Lord is my light."
</P>
<P>
	   And Estes will offer a beloved song by Gustav Mahler, "Ich bin der Welt
Abhanden Gekommen," meaning "I am lost to the world."
</P>
<P>
	   It ends with the words: "I live alone in my heaven, in my love and in my
song ... ."

U.S. Close To Deploying National Missile Defense
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The closer the Clinton administration gets to deploying a
national missile defense, the farther it seems to get from persuading other
countries -- even some of its allies -- that it is a good idea. At the Munich
Conference on Security Policy over the weekend, Defense Secretary William Cohen
heard words of doubt from some European members of NATO and outright opposition
from Russia and China. Wang Guangya, China's deputy foreign minister, told the
conference on Sunday that "a certain country" -- leaving no doubt he meant the
United States -- was pursuing an antimissile capability "in an attempt to seek
absolute security for itself."

enough to keep the stockpiles away from rogue nations or terrorists. The
president's fiscal 2001 budget, being unveiled Monday, includes an additional
$100 million to help Russia increase its protection of nuclear materials and
help create jobs for unemployed nuclear scientists, according to sources

<HEADLINE> Bradley Fighting Back Against Gore  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hoping to counter early campaign setbacks, Bill Bradley's
Democratic presidential campaign has largely abandoned its above-the-fray
attitude and is aggressively confronting rival Al Gore on a series of fronts.
</P>
<P>
	   He has also opened a competition for backing of key party constituencies
where the vice president has held sway and where Bradley must make inroads if he
hopes to make the race competitive.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley began that effort by toughening his assault on Gore's fund-raising
troubles, coupled with a high-profile pitch for black voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's campaign week opened Sunday with a pitch for racial harmony at New
York's largest black church, Allen AME Church, and that theme was continuing.
The former New Jersey senator was heading for Florida today to tout his
commitment to affirmative action, then visit South Carolina to wade into the
fight over flying the Confederate battle flag at the state capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   The appearances were aimed at the significant black vote in such states as
New York and California, where the next round of Democratic primaries is planned
March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley found a receptive audience in New York, where activist Al Sharpton
proposed that Gore and Bradley debate before New York's black community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have been courted by both sides,'' said Sharpton. ``I come out of the
traditional family where people who want to marry you, court you. The black vote
is not monolithic. We need to hear the candidates.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley agreed, and Gore aides said they would present the debate idea to
the vice president. Spokesman Chris Lehane said the Gore campaign was in
discussions with Bradley's camp about debates, and ``I assume this (proposal)
will be part of those discussions.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not taking the African-American vote for granted,'' said Bradley. ``I
have a lot of friends in New York.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Bradley sharpened his criticism of Gore, a gambit that is
not risk-free because one of his core appeals is as a nontraditional politician
who doesn't use campaign attacks. But aides have concluded there is little
choice.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley renewed his attack on Gore's fund-raising practices in the last
campaign, criticizing the vice president's 1996 appearance at a Buddhist temple
near Los Angeles. ``I think he has to explain more thoroughly what was happening
at the Buddhist temple, said Bradley. ``If he didn't know it was a fund-raiser
then he was spectacularly naive.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley again warned that Republicans will hammer Gore on the issue in the
fall. ``There is no doubt in my mind that is going to happen,'' Bradley said.
``This is a real risk in the fall. The Democratic Party is taking a risk.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also has challenged Gore on health care and his record on abortion
and says voters want a ``fresh start,'' a thinly veiled reference to President
Clinton's troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``America is about competition, political campaigns are about competition,''
Bradley said in explaining his new aggressiveness. ``If your positions are
misrepresented, you can only take it so long. That's the way I'll continue for
the next four or five weeks.''
</P>
<P>
	   By then, the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination could well be
decided, with the high-stakes showdown in California, New York and other states.
``I have to take off on March 7,'' Bradley acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
	   One place to begin is within his own party. Much of the Democratic
establishment is behind Gore and one of Bradley's most urgent tasks is winning
back key constituencies like blacks and women that surveys show overwhelmingly
support the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think I have to communicate better with the Democratic base,'' said
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley and Gore opened their weeks in New York, and both were setting aside
ample time for delegate-rich California.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have to win California,'' Bradley said. ``I know I have some ground to
make up.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has focused heavily on California and has the backing of key state
leaders like Gov. Gray Davis along with organized labor.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said Gore will continue the kind of grassroots, retail campaign that
led to success in the opening contests in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore is a national candidate,'' said spokesman Lehane. ``We'll be
campaigning in virtually every state where they have a primary. There's only one
candidate in this race who is undefeated, and that's Al Gore.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Defends Campaign Donations  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain says he doesn't find anything hypocritical
about his campaign finance reform message and the contributions he has accepted
from lobbyists, including those representing clients with interests before the
Senate committee he chairs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to get money from everybody in America and if someone who has a

that's fine,'' the Arizona senator and Republican presidential hopeful said
Sunday on ABC's ``This Week.'' ``The message is clear -- there's going to be a

<P>
	   McCain has been barnstorming the country on a promise to break the grip of
special interests. Rival George W. Bush has accused him of engaging in
``Washington double talk'' for attacking special interests while also courting
their support.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Bush planned to sharpen his message against McCain beginning
today with a speech in Delaware that aides say will draw distinctions between
the reforms Bush has achieved as governor of Texas and the lack of progress made
by politicians in Washington, specifically McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who came out swinging at McCain after losing to him in New Hampshire,
plans to touch on a range of issues -- including education -- to make the case
against Washington-style politics and McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also plans to unveil a new ad this week accusing McCain of breaking his
promise to run a campaign free of attacks. The senator, who made the pledge in a
Michigan debate last month, has since raised questions about the Texas
governor's Social Security plan and, in a more subtle fashion, his
qualifications for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, recently came under fire
for writing letters on behalf of powerful interests and accepting contributions
from donors who often have business before his panel.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, stopped short of calling McCain a
hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain sees himself and portrays himself as an advocate of
campaign finance reform, as somebody who is cleaner than anyone else around the
table, and yet he has accepted contributions and sought contributions from
people with legislation pending before his committee,'' Rove said on CBS' ``Face
the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain defended his acceptance of contributions from such donors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I welcome the support of anyone in the form of $1,000 contributions, but
they know clearly well where I stand, they know clearly I want to break the iron
triangle'' of big money, lobbyists and legislation, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who plans a major fund-raiser Thursday in Washington that will be
broadcast via satellite to about 30 sites nationwide, said many of his
contributors support his efforts to change the way political campaigns are
financed.
</P>
<P>
	   The new Bush ad will feature footage from the Michigan debate to ``remind
voters that John McCain made a promise not to run negative ads and then he has
run them,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky replied that Bush's campaign is behind
third-party ads critical of the senator, and he noted that a veterans' activist
blasted McCain in the presence of Bush at a recent South Carolina event.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're accusing us of going negative? That's the pot calling the kettle
black,'' Opinsky said. ``John McCain's ads are factual.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has been on a roll since defeating Bush in the New Hampshire primary
last Tuesday. He said he expected attacks from members of the GOP establishment
who feel threatened by his efforts, and they are now ``coming at me from all
sides.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Unveils Spending Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, blessed with a booming economy and
burgeoning surpluses, is sending Congress today a $1.84 trillion farewell budget
that would expand government health care, shower billions of dollars on
education and other favored programs and still aim to wipe out the publicly held
national debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's eighth and last budget is heavy with symbolism, from its black and
white covers, standing for the new era of a federal government in the black, to
its election-year proposals for a range of new programs favored by the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   In some cases, Clinton retooled proposals he has made in the past to better
fit the campaign promises Vice President Al Gore is making in his presidential
race in such areas as expanding health care coverage to 5 million of the 44
million Americans without insurance and making greater gun-control efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the budget reached Capitol Hill, Republicans were complaining
about the increased spending and stingy tax relief. The upcoming budget battle
promises to be a replay of bruising fights of past years as Republicans who
control Congress push for bigger tax cuts and less government spending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We won't let the agenda of a lame duck president in any way reduce our
commitment to smaller government, paying down debt and providing for tax
fairness,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jack Lew, head of the president's Office of Management and Budget,
insisted the administration was following a fiscally prudent course that would
protect the record-breaking economic expansion, the source of the gusher in new
revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're on a course that's a very positive direction for the budget and the
economy,'' Lew said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's overall budget calls for spending $1.84 trillion for the fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1, up 2.5 percent from this year. Revenues are projected
at $2.02 trillion, leaving a surplus of $184 billion, according to documents
obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Democrats and Republicans are promising to set aside surpluses
generated by the huge Social Security program -- about two-thirds of the total
-- to wipe out $3.7 trillion of the $5.7 trillion national debt, the part held
by the public.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton projects this can be accomplished in 2013, leaving the United States
debt-free in terms of public obligations for the first time since Andrew Jackson
was president in 1835.
</P>
<P>
	   But it is the other one-third of the surpluses where the battles will be
fought in coming months. GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush has called
for using much of this money to provide across-the-board tax cuts and many
Republicans in Congress support that approach.
</P>
<P>
	   The parties cannot even agree on the size on the non-Social Security
surplus. The administration is projecting $746 billion in non-Social Security
surpluses over the next decade, far below the $1.9 trillion best-case scenario
put forward by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of that difference is explained by the fact that Clinton's new budget
abandons the old spending limits put in place in 1997 in favor of higher budget
caps that allow him to provide more money for favorite programs.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to earmarking the projected $2.17 trillion in Social Security
surpluses to reducing the debt, Clinton proposes using $350 billion of the $746
billion in non-Social Security surpluses for debt relief.
</P>
<P>
	   He would provide $351 billion in targeted tax relief, including measures to
help the working poor, families with education expenses or long-term health care
costs and those saving for retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   In the health area, Clinton would spend $35 billion to help elderly
Americans who have particularly high prescription drug costs pay for their
medications, The Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget, however, also calls for $162 billion in new taxes, primarily
through closing corporate loopholes and boosting the federal cigarette tax by 25
cents per pack. Congress has rejected similar Clinton proposals in the past.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Campaigns in Delaware  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER THORNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DOVER, Del. (AP) -- For Steve Forbes, it comes down to Delaware. Again.
</P>
<P>
	   He's a Republican in need of a victory, campaigning for one against Gov.
George W. Bush, with Sen. John McCain an absentee name on the ballot in
Delaware's presidential primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won in Delaware four years ago, gaining 33 percent of the vote to
beat Bob Dole, then the front-runner and the eventual nominee. But Forbes was
the only GOP candidate to campaign in Delaware that year, with the others
staying away in deference to New Hampshire's insistence on being the first and
only contest in the opening week of primary competition.
</P>
<P>
	   To avoid a replay in 2000, Delaware Republicans opted out of the state
primary last Saturday to hold a party-run election Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was battling in Delaware to take some of the sting out of his landslide
loss to McCain in the New Hampshire primary. He campaigned here Friday, and was
due back today.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes is spending four days on a bus tour of the state. He held town
meetings in Smyrna and Newark on Sunday, and planned two others today.
</P>
<P>
	   He said in an interview that even if he doesn't win, he will not quit the
race. Forbes said he'd be happy to come in second in Delaware -- but not behind
Bush. That's based on the idea that McCain might win, even though he hasn't set
foot in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody's ever had the united establishment, political-elite support that
George Bush has had,'' Forbes said. ``If George Bush is third, then you have a
two-man race.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' problem is that it's already a two-man contest, and he isn't one of
them. He lost Iowa to Bush, and ran a distant third, with 13 percent of the
vote, in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   The self-financed candidate won two primaries in 1996, Delaware and Arizona.
This time, he has an active Bush to contend with in Delaware, and not only Bush
but home-state Sen. McCain in Arizona on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes still trumpets his familiar flat tax proposal, the single issue
centerpiece in his first campaign. But he has tried to broaden the fare this
time, asking -- and after New Hampshire, pleading -- for conservative support,
campaigning as an ardent foe of abortion rights, an issue he did not stress in
1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Before a conservative crowd in rural Bridgeville, he got two standing
ovations when he denounced abortion. Jesse Flynn, taking a rare day off from his
auto repair shop there, said he was impressed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Abortion was a question mark. I had reservations in '96,'' Flynn said.
``But he's come out much more conservative, clearly, on the issue this time.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said his positions have not changed but that he is better now at
delivering the message.
</P>
<P>
	   Polling by the Forbes campaign shows Delaware Republicans split almost
evenly between Bush and Forbes, said Wayne Smith, GOP majority leader of the
state House of Representatives and a Forbes supporter. He would not provide
details.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a key state,'' Forbes said. ``We've got a good basis for support
here, so I'm optimistic. If we win, we'll gain credibility here.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, winning twice wasn't enough. Forbes quit that contest in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Steve Forbes wins here, it'll be a serious setback for Bush, no
question. Bush has worked very hard in Delaware,'' said Chuck Welch, Republican
whip in the state House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I like Forbes,'' Welch said. ``But he's spreading an ideological divide at
a time when the GOP is really trying to pull things together.''

<HEADLINE> Pfizer To Acquire Warner-Lambert  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pfizer Inc. has apparently emerged as the victor of a
three-month takeover battle for control of Warner-Lambert Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer was to announce today it is acquiring Warner-Lambert Co. for $84.4
billion in stock, in a deal that will create the world's second-largest
pharmaceutical company, sources said.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company's medicine cabinet includes the impotence treatment
Viagra and Lipitor, the blockbuster cholesterol fighting drug.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal will mark the end of a takeover battle that started in November
when Warner-Lambert announced a $58.3 billion merger with its New Jersey
neighbor American Home Products Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products will be paid $1.8 billion -- the largest breakup fee
in history -- to sever its contract with Warner-Lambert. American Home Products,
which makes the hormone replacement drug Premarin, decided not to wage a lengthy
and expensive court battle to stop Pfizer, according to a person involved in the
deal.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products could use the windfall as a cushion against
larger-than-expected verdicts or settlements related to its fen-phen diet drug
combination. The company has already set aside $4.7 billion for such claims.
</P>
<P>
	   But while Pfizer won its hostile bid for Warner-Lambert, relations between
the top executives are anything but friendly. Warner-Lambert's chairman and
chief executive officer, Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, will leave the company after the
deal closes in four to six months, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   De Vink won't be the only one out of a job. Pfizer also is expected to cut
hundreds of jobs -- most of them from Warner-Lambert -- from their combined work
force of 87,400 as the two companies unite their sales and research teams as
well as consolidate administration jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Those job cuts will be part of the company's estimated $1.6 billion in cost
savings by 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company will keep Pfizer's name and headquarters in New York.
Warner-Lambert's headquarters in Morris Plains, N.J., will become the base for
the consumer products division, which will include household names like
Listerine, Rolaids, Bain de Soleil and Visine.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly merged company will have sales of $29 billion, profits of $4.9
billion and a research budget of $4.7 billion. Still, the new-and-improved
Pfizer will only control about 6.3 percent of the world's medicine market,
assuaging most antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the third pharmaceutical takeover as many months. Last month, Glaxo
Wellcome PLC struck a $76 billion deal to acquire SmithKline Beecham PLC to
become the world's largest pharmaceutical company. In December, Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn Co. announced a $27 billion merger with Monsanto Co.
</P>
<P>
	   And the trend likely will continue.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products is expected to find another partner soon. The company
is expected to sell its agricultural chemical business by June, according to a
person familiar with the company's plans. That should make American Home
Products a more attractive takeover target.

<HEADLINE> Author Says Average Folks Hit it Big  </HEADLINE>
   By CHAD ROEDEMEIER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Donald Sonner is in the junk business. The 64-year-old head
of Southern Bloomer Manufacturing in Bristol, Tenn., takes scrap cloth and makes
underwear for prisons and strips for cleaning guns.
</P>
<P>
	   He doesn't have a master's degree in business. In fact, he went to high
school for only a year. But by working hard and capitalizing on an idea no one
else had, Sonner was a millionaire by the time he was 24.
</P>
<P>
	   His story is not unique, says Thomas J. Stanley, who surveyed 1,300
millionaires for his new book, ``The Millionaire Mind,'' which comes out today.
</P>
<P>
	   The average millionaire made B's and C's in college, Stanley says. Their
average SAT score was 1190 -- not good enough to get into many top-notch
schools. In fact, most millionaires were told they were not smart enough to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I find no correlation between SAT scores, grade point averages and
economic achievement. None,'' said Stanley. ``Admittedly, there are some very
bright people in the data, but not many.''
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of relying on natural genius, millionaires choose careers that match
their abilities, Stanley said. They may not have great analytic intelligence,
but they are creative and practical. They focus on a goal, take calculated risks
and then work harder than most people.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a lesson Stanley has taken to heart. The author, who lives in Atlanta,
has gotten rich himself by writing about the rich.
</P>
<P>
	   For years he was a marketing professor at Georgia State University. He wrote
three textbooks about marketing to wealthy people and gave seminars around the
country. But he felt like he was on a treadmill going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
	   So he took time off to write ``The Millionaire Next Door,'' which was penned
with researcher William D. Danko of Albany, N.Y. Published in 1996, it has been
on The New York Times Best Sellers list for more than 150 weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The book went No. 1 -- not bad for somebody who got all C's in English,''
Stanley said. ``The reason the book succeeded is not because I'm a great writer.
It's not Shakespeare. The fact is I picked the right target.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stanley found the key to being rich is being frugal. He says most
millionaires live beneath their means, driving domestic cars and living in
upper-middle class neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
	   In ``The Millionaire Mind,'' Stanley studied even richer millionaires -- the
top 1 percent of households. These people had an average net worth of $9.2
million and earned $749,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The average multimillionaire in Stanley's study is a 54-year-old man,
married to the same woman for 28 years, with three children. Nearly half are
business owners or senior corporate executives.
</P>
<P>
	   And almost none of them credit their success to being smart. They say the
keys to success are being honest and disciplined, getting along with people,
having a supportive spouse and working hard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Somehow they figured out what they were good at,'' Stanley said. ``They
all said, 'I'll be the best at this. This is what I really, really love to
do.'''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Millionaire Mind'' is a hybrid -- part science and part inspirational
self-help book. Stanley crunched numbers using the help of his friend and
associate Jon Robbin, a Harvard-trained mathematician. But its message is
instructive: Anybody can be a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody should tell kids they can't succeed based on test scores,'' Stanley
said.

<HEADLINE> Bombing Compounds NIreland Tensions  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A bombing at a rural hotel by an IRA
splinter group has aggravated tensions as Northern Ireland faces the prospect of
losing its Protestant-Catholic government.
</P>
<P>
	   The Continuity IRA, which is opposed to the province's 1998 peace accord,
planted a bomb at the family-run Mahon's Hotel in Irvinestown, 90 miles west of
Belfast. The area was evacuated following telephoned warnings, and nobody was
injured when the bomb detonated beneath an oil tank at the back of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sunday night's blast -- the first carried out by Irish Republican Army
dissidents since 1998, when a car bomb killed 29 people in the nearby town of
Omagh -- sent out shockwaves amid a crisis over the IRA's refusal to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party, condemned the attack
and called for the dissidents to disband. But he said the blast should serve as
``an incentive'' to politicians to keep the province's four-party Cabinet
running.
</P>
<P>
	   Urging the British government to drop its plans to suspend the Cabinet's
powers this Friday if the IRA doesn't pledge to disarm, Adams said: ``The vacuum
which is opening up needs to be closed and closed quickly.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Good Friday peace accord proposed that a Catholic-Protestant Cabinet
should be strengthened by the gradual disarmament of the IRA and outlawed
pro-British groups. But it didn't explicitly tie the two goals together.
</P>
<P>
	   So for more than a year the major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists,
refused to form a Cabinet alongside Sinn Fein unless the IRA first promised to
disarm. The American mediator, former Sen. George Mitchell, appeared to bridge
this divide in November with a deal that got the Cabinet formed in expectation
that IRA disarmament would soon begin.
</P>
<P>
	   But the IRA has refused. The group never accepted the accord's expectation
that the outlawed group should completely disarm by this May -- if ever.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, the Ulster Unionists threatened to resign from the Cabinet,
forcing its collapse, unless the British resumed ``direct rule'' from London,
the quasi-colonial system of government imposed here in 1972.
</P>
<P>
	   By rendering the four-party coalition powerless, the British government says
it is decreasing the risk that the Cabinet would collapse, an outcome that could
make it make its resurrection unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   IRA dissidents oppose the accord completely because it doesn't come close to
achieving the IRA's traditional goal -- the abolition of Northern Ireland as a
Protestant-majority state linked with Britain. Voters in both parts of Ireland
backed the peace accord in referendums.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA, which started its violent campaign in 1970, called a cease-fire in
1997 after killing 1,800 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, said
Sunday's attack was ``not just wrong. It is against the democratically expressed
wishes of the people. What can it possibly achieve?''
</P>
<P>
	   Northern Ireland's major Catholic-supported party, the moderate Social
Democratic and Labor Party, said the bomb was timed to build Protestant
suspicions of Sinn Fein at a critical moment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is madness,'' said the SDLP's Sean Farren, minister of higher education
in the threatened Cabinet. ``It has no purpose but to drive people apart. Given
the looming crisis, the attack was clearly calculated to exploit the
situation.''

<HEADLINE> 'Scream 3' Carves Up Competition  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- "Scream 3" wracked up an impressive body count this
weekend -- bodies of movie-goers, that is.
</P>
<P>
	   Viewers packed theaters for the final chapter of the horror franchise, which
took in a whopping $35.2 million in its debut weekend, according to industry
estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Opening amid a movie market crowded with holdovers, "Scream 3" grossed more
than the rest of the top 10 films combined. It was the biggest February premiere
ever, the best debut for a horror film and the top opening for distributor
Miramax, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc, which tracks the box office.
</P>
<P>
	   The prison drama "The Hurricane" was second with $4.9 million, followed by
"Stuart Little" with $4.8 million and "Next Friday" with $4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Last weekend's top film, the thriller "Eye of the Beholder," fell to No. 5
with $4.04 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Billed as the last in a trilogy, "Scream 3" reunites the survivors of the
first two movies -- Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courtney Cox -- on a
Hollywood movie lot where they are again terrorized by a slasher.
</P>
<P>
	   In releasing "Scream 3" in February, Miramax took advantage of the
franchise's notoriety and the quiet movie season, said Paul Dergarabedian,
president of Exhibitor Relations.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think people were questioning whether this was the right time to release
a horror film. Obviously, in hindsight, it was the perfect time," Dergarabedian
said. "Looking at how slow the market place has been the last few weeks, all it
takes is a big movie like this to come along and it really busts things wide
open."
</P>
<P>
	   Opening in more theaters than its two predecessors, "Scream 3" averaged an
impressive $10,153 on 3,467 screens. "The Hurricane" averaged $2,281 in 2,148
cinemas.
</P>
<P>
	   "Scream" opened in 1,413 theaters and took in $6.4 million the weekend
before Christmas in 1997, while "Scream 2" debuted a year later on 3,112 screens
and grossed $32.9 million its first weekend. The movies went on to gross just
over $100 million each.
</P>
<P>
	   "Scream 3" helped jump-start a market where the top 12 films grossed a
meager $43.9 million last weekend. The total for Friday through Sunday was $72.4
million, compared with $62 million for the same weekend a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Two new movies opened in a few hundred theaters. "Gun Shy," starring Liam
Neeson and Sandra Bullock in a dark comedy about a shaky drug agent, earned
$700,000 from 296 theaters. The horse-racing caper "Simpatico," starring Nick
Nolte, Jeff Bridges and Sharon Stone, grossed $500,000 in 283 theaters.
</P>
<P>
	   "Simpatico" had a limited run late last year for Oscar consideration.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters,
according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures were to be released
today.
</P>
<P>
	   1. "Scream 3," $35.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   2. "The Hurricane," $4.9 million.
</P>
<P>
	   3. "Stuart Little," $4.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Russian Tanker Carried Iraqi Oil  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tests confirm a Russian tanker seized by the U.S. Navy in
the Persian Gulf was carrying Iraqi oil in violation of the U.N. economic
embargo, Defense Secretary William Cohen said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Volga-Neft-147 was taken Monday to Muscat, the capital of Oman. A
diplomat at the Russian embassy in Muscat, Alexander Nazarov, said it will dock
at Fahl port once some technical procedures are completed. Fahl is used mainly
by oil tankers for exporting Omani oil.
</P>
<P>
	   The Omani government will determine the fate of the merchant vessel and its
crew, Cohen told reporters while flying back from Germany, where he attended a
conference on European security.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen also disclosed that an Iraqi naval officer was on board the ship when
it was seized by U.S. Navy SEAL commandos. The Russian government had insisted
the oil was from Iran, not Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   The tests were completed Sunday on samples of oil from the tanker that was
seized Wednesday on suspicions it was carrying Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They do reveal that the oil was from Iraq,'' Cohen said. ``The government
of Oman will make a determination as to what they will do with the ship itself.
That's up to the Omanis at this point.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Russians were informed of results of the tests but was unaware
of any immediate response from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   Under normal procedure, the contraband would be sold and the profits used
partly to offset the costs of the nation that agrees to take the vessel and
partly to pay for the maritime force operation, U.S. officials have said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked what effect the development might have on U.S.-Russian ties, Cohen
said: ``I don't think it will have any impact on relations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen also said the fleet of ships used to enforce the oil embargo against
Iraq has ``intensified'' its patrols since the Russian tanker was seized. He
offered no details. His spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said that at least one ship
had been added to the multinational fleet used to patrol the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen pointed out that the Russian tanker was privately owned, and not the
property of the government. Moscow had protested the seizure and demanded the
vessel's release.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department referred all questions to the Pentagon. Calls to the
Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
	   When the tanker was confronted in the Strait of Hormuz on Wednesday, it
ignored U.S. Navy signals to halt, so armed Navy SEALs were dispatched by
helicopter to board and seize the vessel, the Pentagon said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials had said earlier that the Russian crew offered no resistance
to being boarded Wednesday and cooperated with U.S. Navy personnel involved.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the SEALs got on board, the Russian crew cooperated, and no shots were
fired, a Pentagon official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. ship was part of a multinational maritime interception force that
enforces the 9-year-old U.N. embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia, which maintained that the oil was from Iran, long has supported
steps that would lead to the eventual lifting of the U.N. economic embargo
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has insisted on full Iraqi compliance with the
U.N. Security Council resolutions, including a requirement Iraq not possess
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington said it merely was merely enforcing the embargo against Iraq in
ordering the seizure.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is banned from most international commerce but is allowed to export up
to $5.2 billion in oil every six months in order to buy food, medicine and other
essentials for its people, and spare parts for its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the effort to enforce the U.N. sanctions, the State Department said
last week that illicit oil exports from Iraq average 100,000 barrels a day,
compared with 50,000 barrels in 1998, when oil prices were much lower.

<HEADLINE> CIA Says Attorney Failed Polygraph  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawyer who claims he was fired by the CIA because of
anti-Semitism says he may sue the spy agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Adam Ciralsky said in a televised interview that if he sues, he will not
seek a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In fact it's a matter of principle,'' he said. ``They have to clean my
record and allow me the opportunity to serve my country.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, a CIA memo says Ciralsky failed a pair of lie-detector tests about
whether he gave or sold U.S. secrets ``to an Israeli national.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ciralsky, 28, of Milwaukee, joined the spy agency in December 1996 as a
contract employee in the Office of General Counsel. By the following October,
he'd been placed on unpaid leave. His top-secret security clearance was revoked
in July 1998, and he was fired in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Ciralsky aired his complaints against the agency Sunday night on CBS' ''60
Minutes.'' ``The idea that I'm guilty of a lack of candor is ludicrous,'' he
said. But a network interviewer said Ciralsky acknowledged off camera that in a
series of polygraphs and interrogations he often challenged the questions and
quibbled about legalities.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency said it acted against Ciralsky because he did not fully reveal a
relationship with two people holding dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship, both
employees of Israeli defense firms with possible ties to Israeli intelligence.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Harlow, CIA public affairs director, disputed Ciralsky's allegations of
anti-Semitism. He said the allegations had been reviewed by the agency's
inspector general, by several congressional panels and by a citizens' review
group.
</P>
<P>
	   The memorandum about Ciralsky's case, first reported Sunday by The
Washington Post, was written by Alan Wade, the CIA's associate deputy director
for security.
</P>
<P>
	   The memo said Ciralsky failed two polygraph examinations. The questions he
was asked, Wade wrote, were about ``deliberately compromising U.S. government
classified information to an Israeli national, accepting compensation from an
Israeli national in exchange for U.S. government classified information, and
deliberately concealing from the U.S. government a relationship with an Israeli
national.''
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA's Harlow refused to discuss the memo Sunday. He said the agency had
been willing to publicly discuss details of Ciralsky's case, but that his
lawyers had blocked them from doing so by invoking the Privacy Act.

<HEADLINE> Finns Vote in 1st Female President  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTI HUUHTANEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Social Democrat Tarja Halonen edged out her rival
in a run-off election, becoming Finland's first female president.
</P>
<P>
	   Halonen, who is foreign minister in the current Finnish government, won
Sunday by more than 100,000 votes, receiving 51.6 percent to former Prime
Minister Esko Aho's 48.4 percent. She had led by as much as 14 points in surveys
last month, but recent polls showed Aho catching up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have together, men and women, been successful in both winning this
election and in getting Finland's first female president,'' Halonen told a
gathering at her party's headquarters on Sunday. ``I promise to do everything so
that in six years time you'll be saying, 'We knew it was going to be worth
it.'''
</P>
<P>
	   More than three-quarters of the country's 4.2 million eligible voters turned
out.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's role is largely symbolic, and not much is expected to change
in foreign and defense policy -- the traditional domain of the Finnish head of
state.
</P>
<P>
	   But that didn't stop Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen, who heads the Social
Democrats, from proclaiming Halonen's election ``a historic moment for
Finland.''
</P>
<P>
	   Halonen, 56, takes office on March 1 for a six-year term. She replaces
Martti Ahtisaari, who did not seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign, marked by a lack of issues, was more about personalities than
politics. The only major disagreement between the two candidates was over the
European Union's denunciation of the new right-wing Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
	   Aho said the EU shouldn't meddle in the internal affairs of a member
country, while Halonen defended the EU's move to isolate Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   It didn't seem to influence voters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Austrian issue was far too distant. It wouldn't have swayed many Finns
at all,'' said Esko Anttola, professor of EU studies at Finland's University of
Tampere.
</P>
<P>
	   Many had thought Halonen's controversial stands would hurt her chances at
the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   In a country where 85 percent belong to the Evangelical Lutheran Church, she
quit the church in protest over its policy of not ordaining women.
</P>
<P>
	   Halonen has also headed Finland's Gay Association. She lives with a longtime
boyfriend and has said she has no plans to marry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Halonen is a person who with her own individuality, her openness and her
genuine character appealed across party lines,'' Lipponen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aho, dubbed the ``Kennedy of Finland'' by media for his dapper manner, had
tried to shake off the rural image of his Center Party -- traditionally
supported by farmers and landowners.
</P>
<P>
	   He managed to gain the support of high-power conservative politicians and
businessmen, but for many he remained aloof.
</P>
<P>
	   At one rally, Aho admitted that he found ``it difficult to put himself in
the shoes of ordinary people.''

<HEADLINE> Plane Crash Latest Hit to Seattle  </HEADLINE>
   By LUIS CABRERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- For a while at least, it seemed as if bad things didn't
happen here.
</P>
<P>
	   Not in this smug and sparkling city, as liberal as it is livable, a place
where high-tech millionaires are as plentiful as postcard views.
</P>
<P>
	   But bad things have been happening here, over and over again in the last few
months. And last week's crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, which claimed the
lives of 42 Seattle-area residents, was perhaps the most deeply felt blow.
</P>
<P>
	   The city was already shaken from a double-fatal workplace shooting, World
Trade Organization protests that did millions in property damage and an alleged
international terrorist bombing plot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People anywhere ... like to think they're insulated from the risks and
hardships of the world,'' said John Findlay, a University of Washington history
professor. ``We've had that illusion punctured.''
</P>
<P>
	   The string of incidents comes after what Findlay called ``somewhat of a
charmed decade'' for the city that saw the flourishing of Microsoft in nearby
Redmond, a market surge by home-grown Starbucks coffee and widening influence of
Seattle's grunge-rock scene.
</P>
<P>
	   While recent traumas can't compare to the street battles and economic hard
times of the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the Vietnam War raged and Boeing
Co. laid off two-thirds of its Seattle work force, ``the coincidence of these
things is unusual,'' Findlay said. ``Certainly, it's been a hard several
months.''
</P>
<P>
	   The turmoil began on Nov. 3, with the fatal shooting of two shipyard
employees and serious wounding of two others. SWAT teams swarmed a residential
neighborhood, but the killer escaped. A former employee was arrested and charged
with the slayings in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Then in early December, Seattle residents were stunned as more than 50,000
World Trade Organization protesters poured into downtown streets. Gangs of
anarchists and opportunists smashed storefront windows, trashed police cars and
did some $2.5 million in property damage.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Paul Schell was harshly criticized at first for not doing enough, then
later for overreacting when police took on the crowds with tear gas and rubber
bullets. Police Chief Norm Stamper announced his retirement soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   Next came the Dec. 14 arrest of an Algerian national who was allegedly
smuggling military-grade explosives and timing devices into Washington state
with intent to blow up U.S. targets. Ahmed Ressam had reserved a room for that
night near Seattle's Space Needle, and the mayor's office went on to cancel the
city's New Year's celebration around the landmark.
</P>
<P>
	   When the Alaska Airlines flight crashed into the Pacific Ocean near Los
Angeles on Jan. 31 as it headed to San Francisco and Seattle from Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico, a number of the 88 aboard were off-duty employees of the
Seattle-based airline and its affiliate, Horizon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We seem to have been reeling,'' said Bill Gallant, spokesman for the
Seattle-based Catholic Archdiocese of Western Washington. Sixteen aboard the
flight were also Catholic parishioners in the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very tough time,'' Gallant said. ``I think people are feeling a
little lost and a little out of control.''
</P>
<P>
	   Local shockwaves from the crash are immense in a city where ``almost
everybody knows somebody or knows of somebody who either lost their life or
works for Alaska Airlines,'' said Anthony Robinson, pastor of the Plymouth
Congregational Church.
</P>
<P>
	   On Seattle's waterfront on Sunday, elementary school teacher Cristy
Verellen, 52, of nearby Federal Way said the plane disaster ``touches
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the magnitude, when so many people go down at once,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The city will host an open memorial to crash victims this week, said Dick
Lilly, Schell's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent incidents -- especially the WTO protests -- ``aren't the essence of
Seattle,'' he said, ``and they don't characterize either our past or our
future.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The town is ... vibrant and has a strong heart and a great soul,'' Lilly
said. ``Those things will go past.''

<HEADLINE> Tyke Definitely Knows His Autos  </HEADLINE>
   By PAT LEISNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) -- Andrew Owen Koon picks a packed parking lot for an
outing and races from one car to the next identifying the vehicles and models:
Ford Taurus, Toyota Avalon, Jaguar, Volvo.
</P>
<P>
	   He is a 3-year-old car whiz.
</P>
<P>
	   Right behind him is Randy Koon ready to protect his son from a motorist who
might not see the child.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a bundle of energy,'' says Koon, 35. ``I think he learned mostly from
car ads on TV. He started showing an interest in cars at 18 months.''
</P>
<P>
	   Drew, as he is called, reads the names on cars and recognizes manufacturer
emblems. He stops long enough to do a little dance. He flaps his arms and jumps
up and down -- like a bird in a ritual dance. Then he's on to the next car.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When he gets excited he flaps his hands. He's always done that,'' his
father says. ``He's a ham ... real theatrical.''
</P>
<P>
	   Offer Drew a trip to a toy store or Disney World and he passes them up in
favor of a visit to a car dealership. He never tires of it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He can spend a couple hours,'' Koon says. ``And when it's time to leave he
has a meltdown.''
</P>
<P>
	   For his birthday in January he got an electric jeep which he drives around
his yard.
</P>
<P>
	   Where cars are concerned, the blond-hair, blue-eye tyke isn't shy. He tries
the door -- whether there is someone inside the vehicle or not. Strangers,
disarmed by his cherub-faced smile, let him get behind the wheel -- which often
is as big as he is.
</P>
<P>
	   Koon, a sales representative for a safety equipment manufacturer, has a keen
interest in cars himself. He races stock cars. And his late father had a
fascination for hot rods. When Drew was about a year old, Ed Koon would sit
outdoors with him and call out the names of cars driving by.
</P>
<P>
	   At home, before Koon gets a chance to read the sports section of the
newspaper, Drew climbs in his lap and has him open to the automobile classified
section.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He looks at the names or emblems of each car and tells me what it is. Each
morning I have to go through page after page of this. Twice he found mistakes in
the models,'' Koon says.
</P>
<P>
	   Drew will start preschool this month.
</P>
<P>
	   His parents don't know his IQ or reading level. Koon said his wife, Donna, a
therapist at a psychiatric rehabilitation center, was told by school officials
to keep Drew stimulated and, at this point, not to worry as long as he seemed
above average and not below.
</P>
<P>
	   Koon says at about 18 months, Drew started running up to the TV when car ads
came on. He would dance to the music and point to the emblems. Then came: ``yee
yaa ma'bu'' which his parents couldn't understand until Drew finally led them to
the garage and pointed to his mother's Chevy Malibu.
</P>
<P>
	   The child has a good memory, says his grandmother, Bonnie Koon. He sounds
out words. When she takes him to the hair salon with her, he picks car magazines
over coloring books.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He just blows our minds,'' she says.

	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- The Afghan passenger airliner forced by
unidentified hijackers on a tense journey across Central Asia and Europe landed
at London's Stansted airport early Monday. So far there have been no reported
injuries. The Boeing 727 taxied to a secluded spot on a runway about half-mile
from the main terminal. Police and emergency vehicles assembled nearby. The
Ariana Airlines plane was seized shortly after take off Sunday, about 12:30 a.m.

Cohen: Russian Tanker Carried Iraqi Oil
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tests confirm a Russian tanker seized by the U.S. Navy in
the Persian Gulf was carrying Iraqi oil in violation of the U.N. economic
embargo, Defense Secretary William Cohen said yesterday. The Volga-Neft-147 was
taken Monday to Muscat, the capital of Oman. A diplomat at the Russian embassy
in Muscat, Alexander Nazarov, said it will dock at Fahl port once some technical
procedures are completed. Fahl is used mainly by oil tankers for exporting Omani
oil. The Omani government will determine the fate of the merchant vessel and its
crew, Cohen told reporters while flying back from Germany, where he attended a
conference on European security.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pfizer Inc. was to announce Monday it is acquiring
Warner-Lambert Co. for $84.4 billion in stock, in a deal that will create the
world's second-largest pharmaceutical company, sources said. The combined

takeover battle that started in November when Warner-Lambert announced a $58.3
billion merger with its New Jersey neighbor American Home Products Corp.

U.S. Close To Deploying National Missile Defense
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The closer the Clinton administration gets to deploying a
national missile defense, the farther it seems to get from persuading other
countries -- even some of its allies -- that it is a good idea. At the Munich
Conference on Security Policy over the weekend, Defense Secretary William Cohen
heard words of doubt from some European members of NATO and outright opposition
from Russia and China. Wang Guangya, China's deputy foreign minister, told the
conference on Sunday that "a certain country" -- leaving no doubt he meant the
United States -- was pursuing an antimissile capability "in an attempt to seek
absolute security for itself."

U.S. Urged To Eye Russian Nukes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is proposing a sharp increase in
spending to help Russia safeguard its nuclear materials, administration
officials say. But a panel of foreign policy experts warns that might not be
enough to keep the stockpiles away from rogue nations or terrorists. The
president's fiscal 2001 budget, being unveiled Monday, includes an additional
$100 million to help Russia increase its protection of nuclear materials and
help create jobs for unemployed nuclear scientists, according to sources
familiar with the proposal.

	   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton launched her Senate campaign
Sunday from the state she has called home for only a month, declaring, "I may be
new to your neighborhood, but I'm not new to your concerns." Clinton becomes the
first president's wife to run for office. The race for the seat being vacated by
fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan is likely to pit Clinton against
Republican New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in what could be one of the most
combative political campaigns in memory.

<HEADLINE> Finland's President Seeks Equality  </HEADLINE>
   By KIM GAMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Tarja Halonen, elected Finland's first female
president, is known for her down-to-earth style and her sympathy for the
downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
	   The jovial, red-haired Halonen, who will begin her six-year term on March 1,
launched her victory speech Sunday cautioning her enthusiastic supporters to
take care not to trample several small children up front.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign minister since 1995, Halonen was on the Helsinki City Council for 20
years and has been a lawmaker since 1979. She has held several other ministerial
posts and has a reputation for getting things done.
</P>
<P>
	   Some pundits had predicted that the 56-year-old Social Democrat's left-wing
tendencies and untraditional lifestyle would work against her. But many Finns
said they admired her independence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm voting for Halonen because of her values, and she has a lot of
experience,'' said Pekka Mikkonen, 36, a computer maintenance worker.
</P>
<P>
	   The former trade union lawyer is divorced and lives with her longtime
boyfriend, Pentti Arajarvi, who will be moving with her to the presidential
residence. Halonen also has a daughter, Anna, who lives in England.
</P>
<P>
	   Arajarvi said he was proud of Halonen and ready for the change.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every time a woman wins something in our society, it's a great victory for
them. Even though our society is fairly egalitarian, there are still things to
improve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Halonen tried to place her win in a historical context.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In 2005, Finns will celebrate 100 years of women's voting rights, and I
think it's great and fitting that then we'll have a woman as president,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Halonen has also supported minority groups and headed Finland's Gay
Association. She left the Evangelical Lutheran Church -- to which 85 percent of
Finns belong -- to protest its policy of not ordaining women and taxing church
members.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She will be a caring president which is very important in our society,
where the rich are getting richer,'' said Suvi-Anne Siimes, head of the Left
Alliance, a member of the coalition government.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Would Hike Taxes on Smoking  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed $181 billion in tax
increases over the next decade similar to those rejected by the Republican-led
Congress last year, including a 25-cent-a-pack cigarette tax increase and
attempts to curb abusive corporate tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   The revenue increase helps the president offset $351 billion in tax relief
already outlined by the White House, including $45 billion in relief from the
``marriage penalty,'' $54 billion for new retirement savings accounts, $32.7
billion in relief for the middle class from the alternative minimum tax, and
credits or deductions for child care, long-term health care, charitable giving,
college costs, school construction and inner-city development.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax increases mean Clinton would use less of the projected budget
surplus for tax cuts than either Republicans in Congress or the leading GOP
candidates for president. Clinton's net tax relief would be about $170 billion,
far less than the $483 billion over five years advocated by Texas Gov. George W.
Bush or the $237 billion proposed by Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, are advancing pieces of the $792
billion tax cut vetoed last year by Clinton, starting this week with a House
plan to cut taxes for all married couples -- including those who now pay more
than if they were single -- that would cost $182 billion over 10 years. GOP
lawmakers are cool to any tax increases for an offset, arguing that taxpayers
deserve a return of a bigger chunk of the burgeoning surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I guarantee that Republicans in Congress will strongly oppose the
president's $181 billion tax hike,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee. ``It is amazing to me that after all these
years, President Clinton still cannot resist his urge to raise taxes on the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed cigarette tax increase, which would raise nearly $66 billion
over 10 years, is less than half the 55-cent tax advocated by Clinton last year
and ignored by Congress. The total also includes proposed fines on tobacco
manufacturers of $3,000 for each teen-age smoker beginning in 2004 if the
national youth smoking rate isn't cut in half.
</P>
<P>
	   The president would raise nearly $23 billion by limiting many corporate tax
shelters, a thriving industry that costs the federal government billions of
dollars a year. Promoters of abusive shelters could be penalized with a 25
percent tax and the current penalty for corporate underreporting of income would
rise from 20 percent to 40 percent under Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget also would impose new restrictions on corporations with dealings
in ``identified tax havens,'' usually foreign countries with a friendly or
nonexistent tax law, including new penalties on companies that fail to report
their business in those places.
</P>
<P>
	   Other revenue increases in the proposed budget include reinstatement of a
5-cent-a-barrel oil tax to help pay for spill cleanups, making trade
associations' investment income over $10,000 taxable and making now-exempt bingo
and keno winnings over $10,000 taxable at a 28 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Major elements of the president's tax cuts include establishment of
government-subsidized retirement savings accounts and his own plan to alleviate
the marriage penalty. Others include expansion of the earned income tax credit
for the working poor, tax deductions for up to $10,000 in college expenses and a
$3,000 tax credit to help cover the cost of long-term care.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly lower at the start of trading today,
although technology stocks once again held up better than the broad market.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 64.22 at 10.899.58.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were narrowly mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 4.76 at 1,419.61, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 0.63 at
4,244.77.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's weakness came from J.P. Morgan, down 1 7/16 at 117 11/16, and 3M,
down 1 13/16 at 87 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet there was little news to give the market direction today. Concerns that
interest rates will rise sharply this year continue to weigh on investors'
minds, but very little data on the economy's strength is due for release this
week.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug stocks were mostly higher after Pfizer and Warner-Lambert Co. resolved
their bruising three-month takeover battle. Pfizer will pay $90 billion in stock
to acquire Warner-Lambert, creating the world's second largest pharmaceutical
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer rose  3/4 to 36 1/2 and Warner-Lambert gained 2 7/16 to 97. American
Home Products, which had also conducted merger talks with Warner-Lambert, rose 2
11/16 to 48 3/16. The company will be paid $1.8 billion -- the largest breakup
fee in history -- to sever its contract with Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 135.93 million shares, well behind Friday's
early pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 0.84 at 526.36.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.0 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down
0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Gene Therapy Trials Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- A Boston medical center has suspended its gene therapy tests
because of safety concerns arising from a student's death last year in a similar
trial program in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are temporarily halting (the trial) because there is a national
discourse on this, and we would like to benefit from it," said Dr. Michael
Rosenblatt, interim president of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
	   The death in September of the 18-year-old patient in Pennsylvania triggered
a government investigation, the suspension of eight gene therapy trials in that
state and a Senate hearing last week
</P>
<P>
	   In halting their program last week, Beth Israel officials said they had
encountered no problems with it. The trial involved implanting genetically
altered cells into patients with hemophilia, an inherited bleeding disorder.
</P>
<P>
	   Last summer, Beth Israel halted a different gene therapy trial after three
of the first six terminally ill cancer patients died. Officials at the hospital
said an internal review concluded that at least two of the deaths were not
related to the treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Gene therapy attempts to repair or replace broken genes in seriously ill
patients by transferring normal genes into the body.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of human experiments have been conducted in the past decade, but
there has been no clear-cut success. Getting the foreign genes safely into the
body and maintaining their function for more than a short time are among the
hurdles.

<HEADLINE> $1.84 Trillion Budget Unveiled  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sent Congress today a $1.84 trillion
farewell budget that carves up the burgeoning surpluses by showering billions of
dollars on new government programs. It includes a major expansion of health care
while still promising to eliminate the publicly held debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's eighth and last budget is the opening salvo in what is certain to
be an intense battle with Republicans as both parties find the struggle to order
the nation's priorities in an era of vast surpluses is no easier than during the
past three decades of deficits. The GOP dismissed it as ``dead on arrival.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton proposed a host of targeted tax cuts to provide relief to low- and
moderate-income taxpayers. But Republicans contend the $351 billion in tax
reduction is far too small.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president is proposing the era of big government come back with a
vengeance,'' said the Senate Budget Committee chairman, Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M. ``This is a document designed to help Al Gore win election.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who chairs the House Budget Committee, called it
``the president's fantasy budget. ... This president has failed to make basic
choices, promising more spending on every government program.''
</P>
<P>
	   The budget proposal, heavy with election-year symbolism, was contained in
mammoth books with black-and-white covers to underscore the fact that the budget
is now in the black, promising a string of surpluses that America has not seen
since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's tax and spending blueprint proposes spending $1.84 trillion in the
budget year that begins Oct. 1, a 2.5 percent increase over this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton laid out his plans for spending what he projects will be $746
billion in budget surpluses not generated by the Social Security program. Both
Clinton and the Republicans have pledged to use the $2.2 trillion in Social
Security surpluses to pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   But the two sides differ drastically on the non-Social Security surpluses
with Clinton pushing to reserve nearly half the $746 billion projection for
additional debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton would earmark another $91 billion over 10 years to cover 5 million
of the estimated 44 million Americans not covered by health insurance. He
proposes spending $195 billion for a new program to help the elderly pay
prescription drug costs over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Included in this amount would be $35 billion for catastrophic drug coverage
to pay costs that exceed the maximum of $2,500 in drug payments that would be
covered in Clinton's main drug plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, appearing at a briefing with his economic team, used a paint brush
to draw a blue line on a wall chart showing his budget's projections that the
publicly held debt can be eliminated by 2013.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Federal deficits are last century's news,'' the president said. ``We're on
the way to an achievement that only a few years ago would have been
inconceivable -- making America debt-free for the first time since Andrew
Jackson was president in 1835.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said working toward this goal would help support America's current
record-breaking economic expansion by keeping interest rates low for consumers
and businesses. In addition, he said the interest savings the government
realized from lower debt would be directed in his budget to shoring up the
Social Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
	   With an eye to the November presidential and congressional campaigns, the
budget emphasizes a host of initiatives favored by traditional Democratic
constituencies, from boosting help for the working poor to hiring teachers and
modernizing schools, increasing protection for the environment and expanding
health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the proposals were released far in advance of the traditional
first-Monday-in-February budget unveiling. In a further bow to an election year,
some of Clinton's programs were retooled to mirror proposals that Vice President
Al Gore is advancing in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Clinton also singled out Gore for praise in his budget message.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Democrats and Republicans are promising to set aside surpluses
generated by the huge Social Security program to begin wiping out the $3.7
trillion of the $5.7 trillion national debt that is in public hands. The other
$2 billion in debt is held in the government's trust funds, mainly Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
	   But the parties cannot even agree on the size on the non-Social Security
surplus. The $746 billion projected by the administration over the next decade
is far below the $1.9 trillion best-case scenario put forward by the
Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of that difference is explained by the fact that Clinton's new budget
abandons the old spending limits put in place in 1997 in favor of higher budget
caps that allow him to provide more money for favorite programs. Clinton would
let those limits, which cover the one-third of the budget that covers everything
but automatically paid benefits like Social Security, grow over the decade at
slightly less than inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans want that spending to be significantly lower, leaving more money
for the tax cuts favored by many Republicans including GOP presidential
contender George W. Bush.

caps that allow him to provide more money for favorite programs. Clinton would
let those limits, which cover the one-third of the budget that covers everything
but automatically paid benefits like Social Security, grow over the decade at
slightly less than inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans want that spending to be significantly lower, leaving more money
for the tax cuts favored by many Republicans including GOP presidential
contender George W. Bush.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell today, while technology shares pushed
modestly higher, helping the Nasdaq composite index extend its record high.
</P>
<P>
	   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
98.66 at 10.865.14.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were narrowly mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 5.80 at 1,418.57, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 32.13 at
4,276.27, edging past the record of 4,244.14 set Friday.

gas and tech remains all the rage."
</P>

down 2 3/16 at 86 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet there was little news to give the market direction today. Concerns that
interest rates will rise sharply this year continue to weigh on investors'
minds, but very little data on the economy's strength is due for release this
week.
</P>
<P>
	   The lingering nervousness sent investors toward the technology stocks that

interest rates are especially damaging to high-growth stocks.

<HEADLINE> Dot-Com Boom Forces Raises for Some  </HEADLINE>
    By ERICA NOONAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Here's one more reason for the rest of the world to tell
lawyer jokes: Attorneys at one Boston firm got 40 percent raises last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Timothy McGuire, partner at Testa, Hurwitz &AMP; Thibeault, said the technology
law firm doled out the huge pay hikes so that their attorneys won't leave for
high-tech companies promising bigger paychecks and lucrative stock options.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Boone, president of The Americas of Korn/Ferry International, the
world's largest executive search firm, said companies today face tremendous
pressure to keep the best employees.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone's scrambling for good people," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers and high-tech workers aren't the only ones enjoying the booming
economy. Last month, the nation's unemployment rate hit a 30-year low of 4
percent. Approximately 387,000 new jobs were created in January, the largest
leap since September 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The boom means hospitals in Illinois need qualified nurses so badly that
they're willing to offer higher salaries, paid tuition, flex time and referral
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Massachusetts has been trying to lure new teachers with $20,000 signing
bonuses, while the U.S. Border Patrol in Texas started handing out $2,000 to new
recruits who make it through the academy. Even McDonald's offered $3,500 signing
bonuses to new assistant managers.
</P>
<P>
	   In the legal field, the competition to retain and attract talent is forcing
the kind of pay hikes that make partners wince.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's largest law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom, last
week gave associates 40 percent raises; New York-based Davis Polk and Wardwell
hiked salaries by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   At Testa, first-year associates will make $140,000 -- up from $100,000 --
while sixth-year associates will see their annual salaries rise to $205,000.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuire said his firm, which counts Lycos, Inc., among its clients, didn't
want to risk losing its associates to up-and-coming Internet companies. Judging
by the grateful e-mails that flooded management last week, the strategy created
some pretty content employees.
</P>
<P>
	   "Just wanted to let you know this has created a lot of goodwill in the
hallways," read one message. "If anyone still complains, I will personally pop
them!"
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the firm believes it must do more to hold onto its lawyers. It is
investing in companies and passing along stock profits to associates who stay
loyal to the firm, McGuire said.
</P>
<P>
	   "What do the dot-coms have that we don't? Stock options," McGuire said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stock options are being offered to a variety of professionals to sweeten the
employment deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Though many dot-com companies don't have mega-million initial public
offerings, executive-level workers in marketing, sales, computer programming,
law, human resources and accounting can become millionaires if a stock booms.
</P>
<P>
	   Even mid-level workers making annual salaries of $30,000 to $50,000 are
finding themselves beneficiaries of stock options and profit sharing incentives.
</P>
<P>
	   "The saying in the industry is, 'Now I know what it's like to be in
Sacramento in 1848 for the Gold Rush,"' Boone said. "The excitement runs across
many sections of business stratum. It's not just the CEOs and the CFOs."
</P>
<P>
	   Some employers look beyond the paycheck. Retailing giant Wal-Mart says it
retains employees by offering opportunities for advancement, bonuses based on
store performance and a supportive, caring culture.
</P>
<P>
	   "Work life issues are what drive us, and they're what our associates tell us
they have a need for," said Cole Peterson, vice president of the company's
People division.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the company's management team, 65 percent were promoted from within. "If
you are successful in keeping people you have, you need less people," Peterson
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But there seems to be no end in sight for compensation packages in other
industries.
</P>
<P>
	   "For now, it looks like the answer to the whole thing is more, more, more,"
said Ed Archer, vice president of Pearl Meyer and Partners, a New York-based
executive compensation consulting firm. "The risk associated with dot-coms are
that they are the biggest winners and the biggest losers."

<HEADLINE> U.S., N. Korea Consider New Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With at least two remains of American soldiers newly
discovered in North Korea, officials from both countries indicated progress
towards talks on a joint recovery operation to find more Americans killed during
the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea, after initially reporting it had discovered the remains of 415
Americans, now says it has found only ``four or five.'' U.S. officials -- who
rejected the original report of hundreds of remains as untrue -- say they
believe North Korea has so far accounted for just two soldiers in the latest
discoveries during bulldozing operations at a reclamation project near Unsan.
</P>
<P>
	   A Pentagon statement Monday said U.S. officials are proposing a resumption
of talks with North Korea, which were cut off in December after North Korea
sought economic assistance in exchange for a joint recovery operation. The talks
had been held in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   Li Gun, a North Korean envoy at the United Nations, said Monday he could
make no announcement, but added that resumed talks are being discussed in North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   Li said there were some ``technical mistakes'' in the original report of 415
bodies, saying, ``We have four or five remains.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials have said they hope to send a small team of forensics
experts from the Army's Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii. Li has said
U.S. officials would be welcome in North Korea to review the new discoveries.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials believe the earlier North Korean references to 415 remains
reflected a U.S. estimate of how many Americans were killed on the battlefields
near Unsan, 60 miles north of Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
	   About 8,200 American servicemen are listed as missing from the 1950-53
Korean War. Over the past three years, joint recovery operations with North
Korea have unearthed 42 sets of remains.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Reports Loss  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- British Airways reported Monday that its third-quarter pretax
loss narrowed to 60 million pounds ($97 million) from 75 million pounds ($121
million) a year earlier as the airline continued to be hurt by a glut of
low-cost fares in the market. The results were in line with expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The company lost 2 million pounds ($3.2 million) in the quarter ended Dec.
31, compared to an operating profit of 92 million pounds ($148.7 million) a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   BA reported a loss per share of 6.6 pence, the same loss per share reported
in the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Operating results continued to be hurt by excess seats in the industry,
which produced an abundance of low fares, the airline said. BA said it responded
by increasing the number of higher-paying premium passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Premium traffic grew 6.8 percent and non-premium traffic fell by 2.8 percent
in the quarter. Thanks to the higher proportion of premium traffic, yields --
the average fare received for carrying a passenger one kilometer -- rose 3.2
percent compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
	   BA said increased demand by summer travelers should help fill seats in its
principal markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline is implementing various cost-cutting measures and innovations,
including the launch of a fourth class, to stem losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Europe's largest airline fell 13 pence to 296 pence ($4.76) in
trading Monday on the London Stock Exchange.

Internet-related merger and acquisition news and speculation.

</P>
<P>
	   In domestic markets, London's FTSE-100 Share Index fell 1.1 percent to
6,118.6. Some investors blamed the losses on fears over the Bank of England's
expected quarter percentage point interest rate hike Thursday and caution about
the longer-term rate outlook.
</P>
<P>
	   Although a quarter-point hike is priced into the market, caution about the
longer-term rate outlook and concerns about the impact of a rising pound on
exporters is playing on investor confidence.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks $277.5B for Defense  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Modernized weaponry, better benefits for soldiers and a
big jump in spending on weapons and equipment add up to a $277.5 billion defense
budget the Pentagon says will ``preserve American military excellence.''
</P>
<P>
	   With increases offset by cuts in other programs, proposed Pentagon spending
for fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1, is exactly the same as this year's level.
But it likely will increased by Congress, where support for higher defense
spending is strong.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Department officials, briefing on the budget before its release
today, touted their plans to spend $60 billion for new weapons and equipment to
help modernize the force -- a procurement level Pentagon planners had been
hoping to reach for years. It represents a one-third increase over 1998
spending.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget proposes a 3.7 percent military pay raise, increased health
benefits and $5 billion in additional housing subsidies for military personnel
living off base. Those personnel now pay 19 percent of housing costs, to be
reduced to 15 percent next year and eliminated by 2005 under the administration
plan. Earlier proposals to increase health care benefits for military retirees
were not included in the budget, however.
</P>
<P>
	   Assuming presidential approval of a national missile defense system, the
budget proposes $1.9 billion for the plan to defend all 50 states against
limited ballistic missile attack. An additional $2.6 billion is sought for other
missile programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo are fully funded, with $2.2
billion in the 2001 budget and a request for $2 billion to cover expenses in the
current year.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget provides for several advanced aircraft, including the F-22
fighter, the V-22 tilt-rotor plane, a new amphibious assault vehicle and
upgrades to helicopters and AV-8B and F/A-18 warplanes. For the Navy, it
includes building three DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class destroyers, a new attack
submarine and the final Nimitz-class aircraft carrier -- the most expensive
single piece of equipment in the budget at more than $4 billion.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell today, while technology shares pushed
modestly higher, helping the Nasdaq composite index extend its record high.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 76.94 at 10,886.86.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were narrowly mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 5.72 at 1,418.65, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 37.02 at
4,281.16, edging past the record of 4,244.14 set Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very fragmented market, and you can understand why," said Larry
Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities. "The cyclicals have run out of
gas and tech remains all the rage."
</P>
<P>
	   General Electric, down 3 7/8 at 137 7/8, and 3M, down 1 5/8 at 87 7/16,
contributed most to the Dow's decline. An overall weakness in the Dow's
industrial and financial components held the blue-chip index lower despite a big
gain by Hewlett-Packard, which rose 6 11/16 to 124 11/16.
</P>
<P>
	   There was little news to give the market direction today. Concerns that
interest rates will rise sharply this year continue to weigh on investors'
minds, but very little data on the economy's strength is due for release this
week.
</P>
<P>
	   The lingering nervousness sent investors toward the technology stocks that
have performed well so far this year, proving immune to concerns that rising
interest rates are especially damaging to high-growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "When there's a dearth of news, investors are deciding to play what works,"
Wachtel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco Systems rose 2 5/8 to 123 3/4, Applied Materials rose 4 to 149 3/8 and
Apple Computer gained 2 7/8 to 110 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug stocks were mostly higher after Pfizer and Warner-Lambert Co. resolved
their bruising three-month takeover battle. Pfizer will pay $90 billion in stock
to acquire Warner-Lambert, creating the world's second largest pharmaceutical
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer rose  7/8 to 36 5/8 and Warner-Lambert gained 2 1/4 to 96 13/16.
American Home Products, which had also conducted merger talks with
Warner-Lambert, rose 1 7/8 to 47 3/8. The company will be paid $1.8 billion --
the largest breakup fee in history -- to sever its contract with Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 623.80 million shares, well behind Friday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   In Chicago, technical problems related to a software upgrade forced the
Chicago Board Options Exchange to halt trading for about two and a half hours.
The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were unaffected.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 5.45 at 530.97.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Reports Loss  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- British Airways reported Monday that its third-quarter pretax
loss narrowed to 60 million pounds, or $95.5 million at current exchange rates,
from 75 million pounds a year earlier as the airline continued to be hurt by a
glut of low-cost fares in the market. The results were in line with
expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   On the basis of operations, the company lost 2 million pounds ($3.2 million)
in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to an operating profit of 92 million
pounds a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   BA reported a loss per share of 6.6 pence, the same loss per share reported
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Operating results continued to be hurt by excess seats in the industry,
which produced an abundance of low fares, the airline said. BA said it responded
by increasing the number of higher-paying premium passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Premium traffic grew 6.8 percent and nonpremium traffic fell by 2.8 percent
in the quarter. Thanks to the higher proportion of premium traffic, yields --
the average fare received for carrying a passenger one kilometer -- rose 3.2
percent compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
	   BA said increased demand by summer travelers should help fill seats in its
principal markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline is implementing various cost-cutting measures and innovations,
including the launch of a fourth class, to stem losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Europe's largest airline fell 10 pence to 299 pence ($4.76) in
trading Monday on the London Stock Exchange.

<P>
    CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- One Valley Bancorp, West Virginia's biggest bank
holding company, is being acquired by BB&AMP;T Corp. of North Carolina for $1.2
billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the deal announced Monday, One Valley with assets of $6.6 billion will
become part of BB&AMP;T which has $45.5 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
	   West Virginia's largest bank chain was founded in 1867 as Kanawha Valley
Bank by Col. William Dickinson, Jr. It now has nine affiliate banks and 124
branches, 76 of which are in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   One Valley chairman J. Holmes Morrison will continue as chairman of BB&AMP;T's
West Virginia operations and join the BB&AMP;T board.
</P>
<P>
	   BB&AMP;T, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., has been expanding rapidly, acquiring 40
banks and thrifts, 32 insurance agencies and 12 small finance companies in the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   It has more than 650 branch banks in North and South Carolina, Virginia,
Kentucky, Georgia, the District of Columbia and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   BB&AMP;T said it will create a $10 million trust fund for charitable
contributions and economic development in the areas served by One Valley, more
than doubling a similar $4 million fund the West Virginia bank operates.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter, has been
approved by both banks' boards but still must be approved by One Valley
shareholders and regulators.

<HEADLINE> Statue of Liberty's Origins Probed  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM KIRCHOFER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- The Statue of Liberty has long stood as a beacon of hope to
immigrants. But National Park Service researchers are looking into the
possibility that Lady Liberty may have been intended, at least in part, as a
monument to freed black slaves.
</P>
<P>
	   And if that's true, it could lead to a change in how the park service
portrays the 114-year-old monument's history.
</P>
<P>
	   An unsourced text began appearing on the Internet several years ago and
quickly spread the theory that the widely accepted history of the Statue of
Liberty is not true, says Rebecca M. Joseph, a Boston-based park service
anthropologist.
</P>
<P>
	   The Internet report said that the statue ``was intended as a monument to the
abolition of slavery in the United States and that the original model was a
black woman,'' according to Joseph.
</P>
<P>
	   The park service's official history of the Statue of Liberty holds it was
proposed by French historian Edouard Laboulaye in 1865 to commemorate the
friendship between France and the United States born during the Revolutionary
War.
</P>
<P>
	   But Laboulaye was also a leader of the French abolitionist movement with a
commitment to fighting slavery, notes Diane H. Dayson, the statue's
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our history states that he was an abolitionist, but we still don't know
whether or not it was relative to the Statue of Liberty,'' she says. ``The
important thing for us is just to validate the history one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph is now combing archives and libraries here and in France to find out
whether Laboulaye also wanted the statue to honor the recently freed slaves.
Dayson says he may have conceived the statue with both the slaves and
Franco-American friendship in mind.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Newman, a research officer at Harvard University's W.E.B. DuBois
Institute for Afro-American Research, says it is widely believed in academic
circles that Laboulaye meant for the statue to honor the slaves, as well as mark
the recent Union victory in the Civil War and the life of Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
	   However, by the time sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi's 151-foot statue
was erected in New York Harbor in 1886, European immigration had begun to rise
dramatically and the statue took on a whole new symbolism, he says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was entirely related to slavery, and not about immigration at all,''
Newman says. ``The `liberty' was the freedom of the slaves.''
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph also is checking into the possibility a 21-inch model of Lady Liberty
completed by Bartholdi in 1870 may have been based on the likeness of a black
woman. That model, now in the Museum of the City of New York, has a broken chain
around its hand; the statue in the harbor has a more discreet broken shackle on
its foot.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph refused Monday to say what she has discovered so far. Her final
report is due for release this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those people who are looking for a report that's going to support the most
traditional interpretation of the Statue of Liberty are going to be
disappointed,'' she said, ``and those who are looking for a report that will
support the rumors in their entirety will also be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``History is much more complicated than that. It's not a sound bite.''

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Spokesman Leaving Post  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- James P. Rubin, the voice of the State Department and a
trusted adviser to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, will leave April 1 and
be replaced by Richard Boucher, a spokesman for three of Albright's
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Monday, Rubin gave no explanation why he was leaving his
State Department post or where he was going. Rubin, 39, is known worldwide
through television broadcast of daily department briefings and for being at
Albright's side during international trips.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin spoke with rare authority, having been close to Albright while she was
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and then in her more than three years at
the State Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said she asked Boucher to take over, citing ``a superb record of
government service.''
</P>
<P>
	   Boucher served as spokesman for former Secretaries James P. Baker III,
Lawrence Eagleburger and, briefly, Warren Christopher. He is a career foreign
service officer who was U.S. ambassador to Cyprus, consul general in Hong Kong
and, currently, coordinator for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department spokesman's job was relatively low key before the
popularity of cable television and instant communication. The spokesman would
hold daily briefings that were largely informal and provided reporters with such
basic information as the secretary's travel schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iran hostage crisis, which began in 1979, changed that. Television
cameras were brought into the department briefing room, give-and-take with
reporters became more formal, and spokesmen became celebrities.
</P>
<P>
	   Last June, for instance, when Albright and her entourage toured a camp in
Macedonia for ethnic Albanians who fled Kosovo, hundreds of refugees pushed
against ropes and chanted, ``Rubin, Rubin.''
</P>
<P>
	   The spokesman drew far more attention, and touched off more commotion, than
Albright herself.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin's dark good looks and Armani suits contributed to his fame. So did his
marriage to Christiane Amanpour, a London-based reporter for CNN. They are
expecting their first child in a few months.
</P>
<P>
	   He previously worked at the private Arms Control Association, and for Sen.
Joseph R. Biden, Jr., D-Del., before joining Albright in 1993.

	   Pfizer To Acquire Warner-Lambert
</P>

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pfizer Inc. is buying Warner-Lambert Co. for $90
billion in stock after a three-month takeover battle. American Home
Products, which also wanted Warner-Lambert, will be paid $1.8
billion -- the largest breakup fee in history -- to sever its
contract with Warner-Lambert. American Home Products decided not to
wage a lengthy and expensive court battle to stop Pfizer, according
to a person involved in the deal. William C. Steere Jr., chairman
and chief executive of Pfizer, will retain those titles at the
combined company. Warner-Lambert's chairman and CEO Lodewijk J.R.
de Vink will leave the company after the deal closes, it was
announced. He stands to receive millions of dollars in
compensation. Pfizer is expected to cut hundreds of jobs, most of
them at Warner-Lambert. Warner-Lambert stock was up 2 3/16 at 96 3/4

<HEADLINE> Historian: Smoke Risk Dangers Known  </HEADLINE>
    By CATHERINE WILSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Smokers were exposed to significant news coverage about the
dangers of cigarettes and very little on the tobacco industry's view that those
risks were small, a historian testified Monday in a landmark smokers' trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas DiBacco, a retired American University history professor from Palm
Beach, was the industry's opening witness.
</P>
<P>
	   He testified about his review of newspapers and magazines commonly read
since the 1950s by three smokers who filed the class-action lawsuit on behalf of
about 500,000 Florida smokers.
</P>
<P>
	   Focusing on throat cancer victim Frank Amodeo's preferred newspaper during
his early years, the Detroit Free Press, DiBacco said 94 percent of 556
smoking-related news stories focused on health risks.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 2 percent of the articles from 1950 to 1963 focused on the industry
playing down the risks of smoking, he said. DiBacco did not count cigarette
advertising during the period.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is proceeding before the same jury that in July found the nation's
five largest cigarette makers produced a product that causes emphysema, lung
cancer and other illnesses. In this phase, the jury is hearing evidence to
determine damages.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry has warned that the jury might award a crippling verdict of
$300 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   DiBacco's testimony was intended to show jurors that smokers shouldn't be
compensated because they kept smoking in the face of bad medical news.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanley Rosenblatt, an attorney for smokers, tried to keep DiBacco off the
stand entirely, calling him "a totally created witness" with no expertise in
smoking, health or addiction.
</P>
<P>
	   But Philip Morris attorney Dan Webb said DiBacco is a necessary witness
because smokers have made an issue of whether the industry drowned out

<HEADLINE> Chemical Companies Announce Venture  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BARTLESVILLE, Okla. (AP) -- Phillips Petroleum Co. and Chevron Corp. have
agreed to a 50/50 joint venture of their chemical businesses, creating a company
with assets of more than $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The as-yet-unamed petrochemicals company, which will be based in Houston,
will employ up to 6,000 people. As a result of the combination, 600 jobs cuts
will be made.
</P>
<P>
	   "Phillips and Chevron are strong companies with excellent chemicals assets
and a shared vision of growth for their chemicals businesses," said Jim Mulva,
chairman, president and chief executive officer of Phillips. "This joint venture
creates one of the world's leading chemicals producers, with a global market
presence, excellent growth prospects and a strong financial position."
</P>
<P>
	   San Francisco-based Chevron is the second-largest U.S. oil firm in terms of
revenue, while Phillips, based in Bartlesville, is the nation's eighth-largest
oil company.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Gallogly, Phillips' vice president of chemicals, has been named
president and chief executive officer of the new company. Kent Potter, vice
president of finance for Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc., will be chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The new company will be one of the world's top five producers of olefins and
polyolefins, which are used in the manufacture of basic chemicals and plastics.
It also includes the companies' aromatics and styrene businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement does not include Chevron's Oronite additives business, which
develops, manufactures and markets fuel and lubricant additives.
</P>
<P>
	   Under terms of the agreement, the joint-venture company will arrange $1.6
billion of debt financing and will make one-time cash distributions of $800
million to each parent company.
</P>
<P>
	   The transaction is expected to close by midyear and is subject to final
approval by the companies' boards of directors and regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   Chevron employs 31,000 people worldwide and has about $40 billion in assets.
Chevron Chemical Co. produces commodity petrochemicals, plastics and additives
in nine U.S. states and in Brazil, France, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips had 15,900 employees and $15 billion of assets at the end of 1999.
Last month, Phillips announced a gas processing and marketing joint venture with
Duke Energy.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Chevron were unchanged at $78.56 1/4 in afternoon trading on the
New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Phillips were up $1 to $40.

<HEADLINE> Analysis of Clinton's Budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis
By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- By contemporary historical standards, the first sentence
of President Clinton's final budget message is the most striking: The $1.84
trillion tax and spending plan ``is the fourth balanced budget of my
administration.''
</P>
<P>
	   That's more than all other presidents in the last half century combined
could claim, and it comes against a backdrop of divided government and
near-constant political bickering.
</P>
<P>
	   It also underscores how the budget debate has shifted in the last
half-decade.
</P>
<P>
	   In the days of government red ink -- five years ago -- any proposed tax cut
or spending increase would have meant a rise in the deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   But, as Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., pointed out Monday: ``We have come a long
way since 1992, when the deficit was $290 billion and headed up.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the key big issues this election year, the two parties are in rough
agreement on what is needed to sustain the current economic expansion. They
pledge jointly to keep the budget balanced and to set aside the entire Social
Security surplus to reduce the debt, with a goal of retiring it by the middle of
the next decade, and are likely to spend much of the year jockeying for the
political credit.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest of the debate revolves around allocation of the general government
surplus, the money that does not come from payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   On that, the argument is as strong as ever. Republicans favor bigger tax
cuts; the White House wants more spending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How can we address the issue of tax fairness, when his budget does not
substantially ease the marriage penalty?'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How can the `era of big government' be over, when his budget would create
close to $350 billion in new government programs?'' The quotation harks back to
Clinton's 1996 State of the Union promise to shrink the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,
``The president is proposing the era of big government come back with a
vengeance. This is a document designed to help Al Gore win election.''
</P>
<P>
	   As usual, Clinton's proposal is well-stocked with politically potent
spending increases: a prescription drug benefit for the elderly, health
insurance for 5 million who now lack coverage, more money for Head Start and
money to help local school districts hire additional teachers. He wants to set
aside a portion of the surplus to lengthen Medicare's solvency.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton provides for tax cuts totaling $351 billion over 10 years, but that
is substantially offset by tax increases of $181 billion. The biggest single
item is a tax on cigarettes of 25 cents a pack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me be very clear,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey said in rapid
rebuttal: ``This Congress will not raise taxes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nor will it agree to all the new spending the president wants.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House would like to be very clear, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   It won't accept a tax cut being readied for a vote by the House GOP
leadership that would ease the so-called marriage penalty by $182 billion over
10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   And at a weekend retreat in western Pennsylvania, there was general
agreement among the House GOP rank and file to hold spending on domestic
programs at current year's level, in the aggregate. It's not quite clear what
they mean by that, but it will certainly involve less spending than Clinton
favors.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time Congress adjourns for the elections this fall, a compromise will
be reached on spending and, given the swelling surplus, quite possibly on a tax
cut as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans intend to pass some sort of prescription drug benefit for the
elderly, although they prefer that it apply only to the less well-off.
</P>
<P>
	   The likelihood is the budget will be balanced, the Social Security surplus
left untouched and the nation's debt reduced by default as a result.
</P>
<P>
	   An entirely different situation than on the occasion of Clinton's first
budget eight years ago, when he said ``We can't keep on going the way we're
going.''

<HEADLINE> Budget Impact on Americans  </HEADLINE>
   By DEB RIECHMANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the sweetest economic time of his presidency, the
budget that President Clinton proposed Monday is like a 10 1/2 pound box of
candy filled with bite-sized goodies for young and old.
</P>
<P>
	   For children, there's more money to expand Head Start, renovate schools and
recruit more teachers. For parents, there's a tax deduction of up to $10,000 to
help pay college expenses. For grandparents, prescription drug benefits under
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   There are benefits for Americans without health insurance and tax breaks for
low-income and middle-class citizens. But there's also something bitter for
smokers to stomach -- a 25-cent increase in the federal tax charged on each
pack.
</P>
<P>
	   For fiscal 2001, Clinton proposed a $1.84 trillion budget -- 2.5 percent
higher than the budget currently running the nation. He wants to increase
spending on dozens of government programs, provide some tax relief and use
surpluses to pay off the publicly held national debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
	   It's the rest of the surplus that Republicans and Democrats will be fighting
over on Capitol Hill. With voters to woo in the upcoming presidential and
congressional election, the surplus is like a pile of bonbons. And Republicans
have their own idea of who should savor them.
</P>
<P>
	   House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, criticized the
president's budget, saying it promises something for interest groups, large and
small. ``It's flavor of the day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton said the nation is prosperous and can afford his budget
proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is time to make the most of this moment of promise to extend prosperity
to all corners of our nation,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   For farmers, he plans $11 billion to enhance farm income when crop prices
are low. For members of the armed services, a 3.7 percent pay raise and more in
housing subsidies to cut out-of-pocket costs for those who live off the base. A
$3,000 tax credit is extended to help families that care for a disabled or
elderly relative. For couples, there's relief from the ``marriage penalty'' that
forces them to pay higher taxes than they would have if they remained single.
</P>
<P>
	   Many proposals are aimed at children and families.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton proposes expanding Head Start funding by $1 billion to add 70,000
more toddlers to the program, bringing the total to about 950,000. His budget
requests $1.3 billion to give loans and grants to school districts the need to
make essential repairs like fixing leaking roofs and plumbing, $75 million in
grants to recruit skilled teachers to high-poverty school districts and $1
billion for summer and after-school programs. To make college more affordable,
Clinton wants to expand tax credits for higher education and increase Pell
grants and other college aid.
</P>
<P>
	   For households struggling to make ends meet, there's an expanded earned
income tax credit to provide tax relief for 6.8 million working families.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also wants to widen a health insurance program that serves 2 million
children. He wants to extend this coverage to more children and to pull their
parents and other low-income working adults into the program. And he wants to
let hundreds of thousands of Americans, aged 55 to 65, buy Medicare coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   In the budget's fine print, there's a $10 credit for people who file their
tax returns electronically. Holocaust reparations would be tax-exempt. Hollywood
movie shots of the Grand Canyon would cost more if Congress approves the
administration's plan to increase fees for making films, TV shows, sound tracks
and other productions on national lands.

<HEADLINE> Russia Satisfied With IMF Relations  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN IAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia should not beg for international aid but it won't cut
off relations with foreign lenders, acting President Vladimir Putin said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin was speaking after Russia's main lender, the International Monetary
Fund, announced that it won't resume a $4.5 billion loan package to Russia until
it sees more progress on structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would be wrong to sever our relations with international financial
organizations, but it would be wrong to beg. We are a big and self-sustaining
country," he said on Russia's ORT television.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin also said Russia needs to strengthen its economy to ensure that
prosperity isn't limited to a privileged few. But it was unclear how he would go
about doing so if elected president in March elections that he is widely
expected to win.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's spurts of growth since the 1991 Soviet collapse mainly benefited
tycoons with close ties to the Kremlin, while millions of Russians sank into
poverty. Russian media say some of those tycoons may help fund Putin's
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said his ministry must borrow
from the central bank to pay off foreign debts in March. Russia had hoped to use
the IMF loan to help pay off previous debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia is due to make about $3 billion in foreign debt payments in the first
quarter. Kasyanov said the Finance Ministry will borrow from the central bank
for its March debt payments, but wouldn't say how much.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia has been forced to borrow from the central bank for debt payments
before, though the practice reduces crucial hard currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount to be borrowed from the central bank was agreed upon with IMF
experts who left Friday after spending two weeks in Moscow, Kasyanov said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   "The exact amount will be determined closer to March," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kasyanov said Russia was satisfied with its relationship with the IMF
despite the frozen loan deal.
</P>
<P>
	   "The belief that our relations with the IMF are limited to squeezing money
from this organization wrongly reflects the goals of our cooperation," Kasyanov
said in a Russian television interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The IMF froze disbursements of its loan for Russia last year, saying that
Russia's reform moves were insufficient.
</P>
<P>
	   No quick resumption of lending has been expected, and the fund reiterated in
a statement from its Moscow office this weekend that it's waiting for Russia to
fulfill key reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Kasyanov met with Putin on Monday, and was instructed to work harder and
faster to put the country's banking system in order, Interfax said. Many banks
froze or collapsed after Russia's August 1998 financial meltdown.

<HEADLINE> Mergers Benefit German Execs Little  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Mannesmann AG chief executive Klaus Esser managed
to seal a spectacular purchase price for his company, forcing Vodafone Airtouch
PLC to double its original offer to a record $180 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   But despite all the work Esser did in conducting the grueling negotiations
over the past several weeks, he will be leaving with what likely will be a very
modest severance package, underscoring just how little German executives have to
gain when merger offers come knocking at the door.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to the American model, where executives bail from their
companies with a golden parachute of stock options and cash bonuses, German
executives are hemmed in by a corporate culture that typically scoffs at stock
options and values the prestige of a top position more than the paycheck.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the curse of being a German manager," said Rolf Gerner, an
acquisition analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
	   "A person in Mr. Esser's position is clearly driven by motivations of
wanting to be independent and being seen as a smart manager, but not as someone
taking home 200,000 Deutsch marks ($100,000) or more," he said. "It's less
money-oriented than the Anglo-Saxon world."
</P>
<P>
	   The breakthrough deal was history's largest corporate merger and created the
world's fourth-most valuable company in terms of market value. By holding out
for nearly three months, Esser not only squeezed twice as much money out of
Vodafone as it initially offered, he managed to guarantee Mannesmann
shareholders a 49.5 percent stake in the merged company -- a sweetened offer up
from the original 47.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope the Mannesmann board looks after him because he has done a wonderful
job for shareholders," Vodafone chief executive Chris Gent said Friday after
clinching the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   In the freewheeling world of American-style capitalism, looking after
management often means loading them with stock options -- an offer to buy shares
at a fixed price.
</P>
<P>
	   If the company's stock rises, they can buy the shares and then sell them,
netting a quick profit.
</P>
<P>
	   When Vodafone bought out U.S.-based AirTouch Communications last year,
AirTouch chief Sam Ginn stepped out of the picture with roughly $150 million in
stock options, according to Vodafone spokesman Mike Caldwell. And even Vodafone
head Chris Gent has roughly 2.5 million stock options in Vodafone he can cash in
for a soft landing worth up to $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the merger of American pharmaceutical companies Pfizer Inc. and
Warner-Lambert Co., announced Monday, Warner-Lambert chief executive, Lodewijk
J.R. de Vink, will leave the company with three years' salary and bonus, plus
stock options currently worth about $245 million.
</P>
<P>
	   But Esser won't be getting anything like that when he departs in five
months. Esser does not have any options, and Mannesmann would not comment on
whether he owned any shares. An earlier appeal by the CEO to link executive
bonuses to stock price was turned down, and whatever options might be worked
into his contract are thought by analysts to be meager.
</P>
<P>
	   In Germany, stock options are relatively unheard of -- and even discouraged
for fear they would tempt managers to sell out the company's long-term health
for short-term payoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a philosophical debate over whether it entices managers to hold on and
try to build the company, or cut a deal and sell out," Gerner said. "At least in
the American model, if they lose their job, they get something in return."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Smoking Tax Hike  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Smokers, corporate America and promoters of abusive tax
shelters would see $181 billion in tax increases over 10 years under the budget
outlined Monday by President Clinton. The plan also envisions $351 billion in
tax cuts targeted at the middle class.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has previously rejected many of the tax increases, but they would
allow Clinton to use less of the projected surplus for tax cuts than measures
proposed by Republicans on Capitol Hill or the leading GOP presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's economic advisers say using too much of the surplus for tax cuts
jeopardizes other priorities including Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to make tough choices,'' said Jack Lew, director of the White
House Office of Management and Budget. ``If the tax cut grows, it's going to
push something else out.''
</P>
<P>
	   GOP lawmakers contend taxpayers should get back a bigger chunk of the
surplus. The House this week plans to begin considering a 10-year, $182 billion
plan to cut taxes for married couples, including those who pay more than they
would if they were single.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I guarantee that Republicans in Congress will strongly oppose the
president's $181 billion tax hike,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee. ``It is amazing to me that after all these
years, President Clinton still cannot resist his urge to raise taxes on the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among Clinton's proposed tax increases, which total $181 billion over 10
years:
</P>
<P>
	   --A 25-cents-a-pack increase in the federal cigarette tax, raising $66
billion over 10 years. It is less than half the 55-cent tax Clinton advocated
last year, which Congress ignored. The $66 billion total also includes proposed
fines on tobacco manufacturers of $3,000 for each teen-age smoker if teen
smoking isn't cut in half by 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   --New limits and penalties on corporate tax shelters, raising $23 billion
over 10 years. Firms that market tax shelters could be penalized with a 25
percent tax and the current penalty for corporate underreporting of income would
rise from 20 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --New restrictions on corporations that deal in ``identified tax havens,''
usually foreign countries with a friendly or nonexistent tax law, including new
penalties on companies that fail to report their business in those places.
</P>
<P>
	   --Dozens of tax increases on businesses and various corporate transactions
that would raise more than $80 billion over 10 years, including a $14 billion
increase on insurance companies, a 5-cent-a-barrel oil tax to pay for spill
cleanups, taxes on trade associations' investment income over $100,000 and
reinstatement of a tax on oil and chemical companies to pay for Superfund
cleanups.
</P>
<P>
	   Major elements of the president's 10-year tax cut plan were released earlier
this year, including $45 billion in relief from the ``marriage penalty,'' $54
billion from new retirement savings accounts, and $32.7 billion in relief for
the middle class from the alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's plan also includes numerous middle-class tax credits or deductions
for child care, long-term health care, charitable giving, college costs, school
construction and inner-city development.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are targeted at the income ranges, the activities, that are engaged
in by the vast majority of American families,'' said Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers.
</P>
<P>
	   Counting all the tax increases, Clinton's net tax relief amounts to about
$170 billion over 10 years. That is far less than the $483 billion over five
years advocated by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, or the $237 billion over five
years proposed by Arizona Sen. John McCain, both seeking the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration put its net tax relief number at $254 billion over 10
years, arguing that revenue raisers are ``user fees'' for specific industries
and that the tobacco tax hike's intent is to curb smoking, not raise money. Seen
in that light, Clinton's revenue offsets would total $96 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress, meanwhile, is contemplating a variety of tax cuts that total more
than Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also asked Congress to increase the Internal Revenue Service budget
by 9 percent to $8.8 billion. About $400 million would be used to hire 1,600
employees to improve customer service and reverse a sharp decline in enforcement
actions and audits, and to replenish an account for the IRS computer system
overhaul.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 76.01; Nasdaq Up 31.16  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell today, while technology shares pushed
modestly higher, helping the Nasdaq composite index extend its record high.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 76.01 at 10,887.79.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were narrowly mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 7.51 at 1,416.86, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 31.16 at
4,275.30, edging past the record of 4,244.14 set Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq, dominated by technology stocks, has risen more than 5 percent so
far this year, while the blue-chip Dow industrial average has fallen more than 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very fragmented market, and you can understand why," said Larry
Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities. "The cyclicals have run out of
gas and tech remains all the rage."
</P>
<P>
	   General Electric, down 4 13/16 at 136 3/4, and 3M, down 1 7/8 at 87 3/16,
contributed most to the Dow's decline. An overall weakness in the Dow's
industrial and financial components held the blue-chip index lower despite a big
gain by Hewlett-Packard, which rose 8 1/2 to 126 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   There was little news to give the market direction today. Concerns that
interest rates will rise sharply this year continue to weigh on investors'
minds, but very little data on the economy's strength is due for release this
week.
</P>
<P>
	   The lingering nervousness sent investors toward the technology stocks that
have performed well so far this year, proving immune to concerns that rising
interest rates are especially damaging to high-growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "When there's a dearth of news, investors are deciding to play what works,"
Wachtel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco Systems rose 2 15/16 to 124 1/16, Applied Materials rose 5 1/8 to 150
1/2 and Apple Computer gained 4 3/16 to 112 3/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug stocks were mostly higher after Pfizer and Warner-Lambert Co. resolved
their bruising three-month takeover battle. Pfizer will pay $90 billion in stock
to acquire Warner-Lambert, creating the world's second largest pharmaceutical
company.

<HEADLINE> Budget Slates $227.5 for Defense  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's last defense budget would provide
$277.5 billion to run the world's most powerful military, replacing outdated
weapons, developing a national missile defense and boosting military pay and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   While the total budget outlays for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 would
match those expected for this year, the budget sports some big increases. Most
come in the purchase of military hardware including $4 billion for an aircraft
carrier. Some older systems get cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress is more likely to increase than cut the proposed budget. With
expected additions and military-related spending in other department's budgets,
total defense spending authority is projected at $305.4 billion for the year.
When inflation is discounted, real growth in defense budget authority is
expected to exceed 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon said its spending plan protects Clinton's commitment to
preserve ``America's military excellence.''
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen, in a prepared statement, said the budget
lays out key building blocks to transform U.S. defense policy to meet modern
needs, ``but more hard work and tough choices are needed.'' These include
possible future rounds of base closures to further streamline the military,
Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Assuming presidential approval of a national missile defense system, the
budget proposes $1.9 billion for the plan being designed to defend all 50 states
against limited ballistic missile attack. An additional $2.6 billion is sought
for other missile programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget includes $4.8 billion that was added from previous planning for
operations in Bosnia and Kosovo and for expected higher fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
	   It proposes $60 billion for procurement, fulfilling a major military
planning goal to update its planes, ships and other equipment. Included are the
most current new systems like the V-22 tilt-rotor plane and the F-22 fighter as
well as upgrades to other planes, helicopters, ships and land vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Navy, it would build three Arleigh Burke class destroyers and a new
attack submarine in addition to the last of 10 Nimitz-class aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
	   It plans for a 3.7 percent military pay raise, increased health benefits and
$5 billion in additional housing subsidies for military men and women living off
base. Those personnel now pay 19 percent of housing costs, to be reduced to 15
percent next year and eliminated by 2005 under the administration plan. Earlier
proposals to increase health care benefits for military retirees were not
included in the budget, however.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Borrowing Up 9.7 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' borrowing leaped ahead in December led by
strong demand for loans for everything from autos and boats to education and
vacations.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers' credit outstanding, excluding mortgage debt, advanced at a 9.7
percent annual rate in December to a seasonally adjusted $1.39 trillion, the
Federal Reserve said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   All told, consumers borrowed $11.2 billion more in December then during the
month before -- much more than the $7 billion gain many analysts were
forecasting.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, consumer debt rose at a 13.8 percent annual rate, slightly
stronger than the government previously estimated. Consumers borrowed $15.8
billion that month than in October, ringing up the largest monthly increase in
debt since 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Demand for non-revolving loans, including loans for autos, mobile homes,
boats, trailers, education and vacations, in December rose at a 10.6 percent
annual rate, following a whopping 17.3 percent rate the month before.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers also used their credits cards freely in December. Revolving credit
-- primarily credit cards revolving loans -- grew by a 8.4 percent annual rate,
down from a 9 percent rate in November.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates by a quarter of a percentage
point last week, the fourth increase since June. The action made borrowing more
expensive for consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the three prior rate increases, the U.S. economy -- supported by
hardy consumer and business spending -- continues to barrel ahead. The economy
grew by a breakneck 5.8 percent annual rate in the last three months of 1999 and
by 4 percent for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
	   All that spending helped give the nation's retailers their strongest holiday
shopping season since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Americans continued their spending spree after Christmas, boosting retail
sales to surprisingly strong levels in January, the nation's retailers reported
last week. That helped stores finish their fiscal year with the biggest gains
since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Mixed in T-Bill Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities were
mixed in Monday's auction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department sold $9 billion in three-month bills at a discount
rate of 5.545 percent, down from 5.560 percent last week. An additional $8
billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 5.770 percent, up from 5.705
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-month rate was the lowest since Jan. 24 when the bills sold for
5.385 percent. The six-month rate was the highest since May 1, 1995, when the
rate was 5.840.
</P>
<P>
	   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 5.719
percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,859.80 and
6.042 percent for a six-month bill selling for $9,708.30.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making changes in
adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 6.24 percent last week from 6.17 percent the
previous week.

<HEADLINE> Consumers See Some Telecom Changes  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The revolution envisioned by a landmark
telecommunications law that held the promise of more choices and lower prices
for consumers remains a work in progress, with some Americans not yet enjoying
the fruits of greater competition and falling costs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My cable bill is outrageous! The rate has steadily increased with no
changes in service or quality,'' wrote Debbie Williams of Aloha, Oregon this
summer to a consumer group in Washington. Bob Palinchak of Cordova, Tenn.,
griped that an array of monthly charges has caused his phone bill to increase
even when he makes few calls.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the passage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, cable rates have risen
three times faster than inflation and the regional Bell companies still claim 96
percent of local phone revenue.
</P>
<P>
	   But there are some signs of change: The number of Internet users has tripled
and wireless prices have plummeted in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The big picture is that the whole telecommunications and information
sectors of our economy are just booming,'' Federal Communications Commission
Chairman William Kennard said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``We've
really never seen anything like this in the history of communications in the
world where you have so much investment so quickly, a myriad of new services
being provided to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The law, signed by President Clinton four years ago Tuesday, freed cable and
local and long-distance phone companies to enter each others' businesses. House
Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley, R-Va., one of the bill's co-authors,
said consumers are beginning to see choices in markets once controlled by
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would have liked to have seen it go quicker,'' Bliley said. But ``it's
coming.''
</P>
<P>
	   Fledgling businesses have spent billions of dollars to offer local phone and
data services to compete with the Baby Bells. AT&AMP;T has invested heavily in its
ambitious plan to use cable lines to deliver local phone service, while MCI
WorldCom and Sprint say their combined merger could enable then to reach local
customers through fixed wireless systems.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Bell companies and GTE still have the lion's share of the local
market.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is hardly full-fledged realistic competition,'' said Adam Thierer a
fellow in economic policy at Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators point to the success of wireless service in giving consumers more
options. Almost all Americans now have a choice of three or more wireless
providers, according to the FCC, and prices have steadily declined.
</P>
<P>
	   A plethora of new long-distance plans -- boasting rates as low as 5-cents a
minute -- have helped drop the price of state-to-state calls more than 2 percent
between the time before the act was passed and December 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   But consumer groups, in a scathing letter to President Clinton, said most
Americans are not benefitting from falling rates because of an extra $4 billion
a year in assorted charges now tagged on to their monthly phone bills. They also
warned that an unprecedented wave of communications mega-mergers set off by the
law has reduced consumer options.
</P>
<P>
	   New competition could come as the Bell companies aggressively seek
permission to offer long-distance in their territory. In one of the biggest
milestones since the act's passage, Bell Atlantic received FCC approval in
December to provide its local customers in New York with long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States Telecom Association, which represents local phone
companies, says the time is ripe for the FCC to remove regulatory hurdles
keeping its members out of voice and data long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All customers suffer as a result,'' said Roy Neel, president of the group
</P>
<P>
	   And consumers are still waiting to see lower cable TV rates. Lawmakers and
others hope that legislation passed last year allowing direct broadcast
satellite companies to beam local channels to their customers will help bolster
competition.
</P>
<P>
	   That could help drive down cable TV prices -- which have increased nearly 27
percent between the time right before the law was enacted until December 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Cable TV is one of the biggest black eyes for the 1996 act,'' said Gene
Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union.

<HEADLINE> Budget Said Tilted Toward Gore  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The budget that went to Congress on Monday is President
Clinton's, but Vice President Al Gore hopes to administer the plan that contains
at least a dozen of his own proposals. One Republican chairman grumbled that it
was designed ``to get Al Gore elected.''
</P>
<P>
	   In some instances, Clinton not only incorporated Gore's ideas, he left it to
the vice president to announce them over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House says Gore's extensive involvement in crafting the budget is
not unusual; he's done it for seven years. But this year Gore's role is far more
evident.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the title presents the budget as a ``Clinton-Gore administration''
document.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a document designed to help Al Gore win election,'' said Senate
Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M. His House counterpart, Rep. John
Kasich, R-Ohio, said the White House framed the budget to offer ``all things for
everyone they feel they will need to get Al Gore elected.''
</P>
<P>
	   The White House denied that Clinton tried to load the budget to Gore's
advantage, even while picturing him as a prominent player in putting it
together.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the major proposals Clinton put forth are mirror images of Gore's
positions. For example, like Gore, the president is calling for health insurance
coverage for all children under 18 and offering some coverage to poor, working
parents. Clinton's plan to tighten gun laws includes large sections of Gore's
anticrime proposal, although he shied away from Gore's suggestion that photo
licenses be mandatory for handgun buyers. Clinton would make it optional.
</P>
<P>
	   James Thurber, political science professor at American University, said such
close mirroring in policies reflects not only Clinton's desire to see Gore
elected, but also the close relationship they enjoy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a result of that relationship, the president is going out of his way to
help the vice president,'' said Thurber, who is writing a book on Congress and
the presidency. ``It's a relationship that is of equal importance on both sides.
The president probably has suggestions for (Gore's) campaign, the vice president
is probably asking the president for help in certain areas.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has advocated funding for social programs that run the gamut from AIDS
research to nursing homes to wetlands. He called for funds to preserve the house
where Martin Luther King Jr. was born, and proposed $1.3 billion to help farmers
with water conservation.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside of those proposals, Gore also manifested himself in a number of
small proposals, such as $30 million for training preschool teachers, $247
million for school safety, $211 million for transit systems in 12 urban areas;
and $4.8 million for preserving the camps where Japanese-Americans were interned
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a different reality from when Ronald Reagan was the popular two-termer
in the White House and Vice President George Bush was the candidate, Thurber
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He wanted his vice president to be president, but he wasn't doing what
Clinton is doing in terms of all these budgetary items,'' Thurber said of
Reagan. ``It was very much a lame duck period for him.''

<HEADLINE> SEC Seeks $150M To Fight Fraud  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission, in an uphill
fight against burgeoning fraud over the Internet, is seeking $150 million for
enforcement work and investor education and another $15 million to pay its
attorneys and other professionals above government rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The market watchdog agency has lost 25 percent of its attorneys, accountants
and examiners in the past two years to lucrative jobs in private practice. For
lawyers, many of those jobs now have become even more seductive as big law firms
have offered huge pay raises to compete with high-tech companies providing
bigger salaries and juicy stock options.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposals sent to Congress on Monday are part of the SEC's $422.8
million budget request for fiscal 2001, up 12 percent from the current spending
level of $377 million for the 3,200-person agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC "has made great progress in fighting fraud on the Internet," said
Richard Walker, the agency's enforcement director. "Additional funds from
Congress will enable us to detect violations better and bring even more cases."
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC and state regulators are battling a new form of investment fraud
that has been proliferating in Internet junk mail, online newsletters,
electronic "chat rooms" and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the Internet is everywhere, unscrupulous stock promoters anywhere in
the world can cloak themselves in anonymity and lure investors across the
country, who have lost millions in such schemes in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the SEC sued a man who calls himself Tokyo Joe -- a flamboyant,
self-proclaimed stock expert with a Web site and an investment club -- for
allegedly defrauding investors by failing to tell them he was selling the same
stocks he was advising them to buy.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo Joe's attorney has said he will contest the allegations in court.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the SEC's first enforcement action against a well-known Internet
guru, but it followed several nationwide "sweeps" by the agency against online
investment fraud involving relatively minor companies and individuals.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC is seeking new funds to add 15 people to its "Cyberforce" team, now
some 240 strong, which prowls the Internet on the lookout for investment scams
and other securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   While SEC fraud-fighters do conduct Internet surveillance, they don't have
the legal authority to go undercover online. Unlike the Justice Department, the
SEC cannot put anyone in jail; it can only file civil lawsuits against suspected
violators.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC said Monday it also will continue to go after financial accounting
fraud by publicly traded companies. It has recently accused some corporations of
manipulating their earnings to meet Wall Street analysts' projections.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, the SEC accused 68 people and companies -- including Hall of
Fame quarterback and Atlanta businessman Fran Tarkenton -- of accounting fraud
in the first nationwide "sweep" against inflating earnings and other alleged
reporting misconduct.
</P>
<P>
	   The $15 million in "special pay" the SEC is seeking for attorneys,
accountants and examiners, a premium of about 10 percent over government rates,
would put the SEC employees closer to their counterparts at the federal bank
regulatory agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress shot down in 1998 a proposal by SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt to pay
$7 million in bonuses, representing as much as 20 percent of salaries, to get
people to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   The steady drain of talent in recent years has included several high-level
SEC officials, including Richard Lindsey, the former director of market
regulation; former enforcement director William McLucas and his deputy, Colleen
Mahoney; ex-chief accountant Michael Sutton; Barry Barbash, formerly the top
official overseeing the mutual fund industry; and Brian Lane, former director of
the corporation finance division.

<HEADLINE> Democrat Fund-Raising Trial Starts  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At the start of a long-delayed trial for a former
Clinton-Gore fund-raiser, the Justice Department said Monday that businesswoman
Maria Hsia concealed the source of more than $100,000 in illegal donations.
</P>
<P>
	   Hsia's lawyer retorted that the Los Angeles immigration consultant is the
victim of ``a smear job'' by federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The system breaks down'' because of people like Hsia, who ``time and time
again engaged in these schemes'' in the 1996 election campaign, prosecutor Eric
Yaffe told the U.S. District Court jury in opening statements.
</P>
<P>
	   In becoming ``a major player in the Democratic Party,'' Yaffe said, Hsia
tapped well-to-do business acquaintances secretly to reimburse straw donors and
conduits for cash who were falsely listed in federal election records as
contributors.
</P>
<P>
	   Hsia faces five felony counts of causing various Democratic campaign
treasurers unwittingly to file false reports with the Federal Election
Commission. Two charges deal with a 1995 Clinton-Gore fund-raiser in California,
two revolve around Democratic fund-raisers in Washington and at a Buddhist
temple in California, and the fifth deals with a fund-raiser at the same temple
for Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyer Nancy Luque said Hsia is a community activist who wanted
Asian-Americans to become part of the political process. ``Maria didn't ask any
person who made a contribution ... where they got money,'' said Luque. ``So
don't ask, don't tell.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The prosecutors want you to believe that her asking for contributions
caused someone six steps removed to lie,'' but ``Maria Hsia is not responsible
for what other people do,'' said Luque. ``Maria Hsia never lied.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yaffe said that for a fund-raiser at a Buddhist Temple in California
attended by Vice President Gore, Hsia handed an envelope with $100,000 in checks
to Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang, who will testify against Hsia.
</P>
<P>
	   The temple treasury was the source of many of the contributions, although
election records falsely listed individual people as the donors, said Yaffe.
</P>
<P>
	   Yaffe said the temple reimbursed Hsia for some of her own political
contributions. Luque denied that, saying that Hsia was simply being paid for
immigration-related work she did for the temple.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman dismissed the heart of the prosecution's
case in 1998, saying they used ``Alice-in-Wonderland'' logic to claim she was to
blame for false campaign filings.
</P>
<P>
	   An appeals court reinstated the charges. That court said, ``It is not
entirely clear what defects the district court found in the government's
theory.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court cleared the way for the trial last month by refusing to
hear Hsia's appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   As the Justice Department battled in court last year to bring the February
1998 indictment to trial, two Buddhist nuns who prosecutors regarded as crucial
to their case left the country to spend time with their religious order in
Taiwan. Bench warrants have been issued for their arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent court papers, prosecutors said that one of the missing nuns
``would typically receive a telephone call from defendant Hsia to obtain
political contributions, and ... on occasion, ... would provide the conduit
checks to defendant Hsia.''

<HEADLINE> $1.84 Trillion Budget Unveiled  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To a chorus of Republican ridicule, President Clinton
sent Congress his budget finale on Monday, a $1.84 trillion plan to expand
health care access, shrink the national debt and shower Democratic
constituencies with election-year largesse.
</P>
<P>
	   Blessed with a budgetary bonanza that past presidents could only dream about
-- a projected $2.92 trillion in federal surpluses over the next decade --
Clinton used his spending outline to propose something for almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
	   He would cut taxes for the sick, elderly, poor and college-bound; spend more
for the environment, schools and gun-law enforcement; and erase the $3.7
trillion publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal is sure to be heavily reworked by Congress, where defiant
Republicans dismissed it as a gambit to bolster Vice President Al Gore's
presidential bid and the Democratic drive to capture Congress. They promised to
fatten the plan's tax cuts, trim its spending boosts and ignore its tax
increases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has all things for everyone they feel they'll need to get Al Gore
elected president,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio,
who called it ``the president's fantasy budget.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I look forward to working with the president in putting together a serious
spending proposal,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
``But this is a document designed to help Al Gore win election.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was little denying presidential politics at the White House, where
officials said at least a dozen Gore proposals were latticed into the outline.
But beyond that, Clinton's farewell spending blueprint -- for fiscal 2001,
beginning Oct. 1 -- was an effort to choose the terrain of this year's budget
battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton proposed $351 billion in tax cuts through 2010 that he argues can
only be enlarged by eroding Social Security's trust funds, diluting efforts to
expand and strengthen Medicare, or slashing other popular initiatives such as
hiring teachers or reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This budget, in short, makes really strong and significant steps toward
achieving the great goals that I believe America should pursue in this new
century,'' Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans said that at a time of surplus, taxpayers should get a bigger
break than Clinton wants to give them.
</P>
<P>
	   They criticized his proposal to raise other revenues by $181 billion over 10
years, including higher taxes on cigarettes and some corporate transactions. And
they noted that using Clinton's own figures, there would be a net $9 billion tax
increase in 2001 and a $1 billion increase in 2002 before annual tax cuts begin
to outweigh increases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're obviously going to reject the higher taxes,'' said John Feehery,
spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Strikingly, the president's budget boasted few initiatives that he has not
proposed before.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the new ones was a $91 billion, 10-year effort to expand health
coverage for working poor families. It is aimed at covering 5 million of the 44
million Americans who lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   He also called for setting aside $35 billion, beginning in 2006, for extra
prescription drug coverage for the sickest Medicare patients. This is on top of
a $160 billion, 10-year plan for prescription drug benefits for Medicare
patients, similar to his proposal of last year that Congress ignored.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also proposed extra spending to help farmers deal with low
commodities prices; about the same $278 billion Pentagon budget as this year;
and extra money to buy park lands, modernize schools and hire new federal agents
and prosecutors who focus on gun laws.
</P>
<P>
	   In one area of bipartisan agreement, the president would set aside the $2.17
trillion of Social Security's surpluses over the next decade for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   By 2013, he said, the $3.7 billion portion of the national debt should be
gone for the first time since 1835, which economists say should lower interest
rates and add muscle to the economy. The rest of the $5.7 trillion national debt
is money in federal trust funds such as Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton estimates that over the next 10 years, there will be a $746 billion
surplus in the rest of the budget -- a figure that will be pivotal in this
year's fiscal fight.
</P>
<P>
	   He would use this money to help pay for his tax cut, the prescription drug
proposal, the health insurance initiative for poor families and additional debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Republicans have made no final decisions, they will estimate this
part of the surplus to be hundreds of billions larger than $746 billion. That
would leave more room for the bigger tax cuts favored by most Republicans,
including the $1.3 trillion, 10-year plan advanced by GOP presidential contender
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's surplus estimate is smaller because he assumes that spending for
the one-third of the budget Congress determines every year will grow annually at
nearly the rate of inflation. Republicans say spending for this portion of the
budget -- which includes everything but automatically paid benefits like Social
Security -- will not grow that fast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is government on autopilot,'' Domenici said.
</P>
<P>
	   By crediting some debt reduction to Medicare and Social Security, Clinton
said his plan would extend Social Security solvency to 2050 and Medicare's to
2025.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton proposed no overhaul of either program's benefits or revenues,
which many analysts say must occur to prepare for the looming retirement of the
baby boomers. That omission seemed a concession that bipartisan consensus this
election year is impossible on those politically charged programs.

<HEADLINE> Phillips, Chevron Announce Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BARTLESVILLE, Okla. (AP) -- Phillips Petroleum Co. and Chevron Corp. have
agreed to a 50/50 joint venture of their chemical businesses, creating a company
with assets of more than $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The yet-to-be-named petrochemicals company, which will be based in Houston,
will employ up to 6,000 people. As a result of the combination, 600 jobs will be
cut.
</P>
<P>
	   "Phillips and Chevron are strong companies with excellent chemicals assets
and a shared vision of growth for their chemicals businesses," said Jim Mulva,
chairman, president and chief executive officer of Phillips. "This joint venture
creates one of the world's leading chemicals producers, with a global market
presence, excellent growth prospects and a strong financial position."
</P>
<P>
	   San Francisco-based Chevron is the second-largest U.S. oil firm in terms of
revenue, while Phillips, based in Bartlesville, is the nation's eighth-largest
oil company.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Gallogly, Phillips' vice president of chemicals, has been named
president and chief executive officer of the new company. Kent Potter, vice
president of finance for Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc., will be chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The new company will be one of the world's top five producers of olefins and
polyolefins, which are used in the manufacture of basic chemicals and plastics.
It also includes the companies' aromatics and styrene businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement does not include Chevron's Oronite additives business, which
develops, manufactures and markets fuel and lubricant additives.
</P>
<P>
	   Under terms of the agreement, the joint-venture company will arrange $1.6
billion of debt financing and will make one-time cash distributions of $800
million to each parent company.
</P>
<P>
	   The transaction is expected to close by midyear and is subject to final
approval by the companies' boards of directors and regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   Chevron employs 31,000 people worldwide and has about $40 billion in assets.
Chevron Chemical Co. produces commodity petrochemicals, plastics and additives
in nine U.S. states and in Brazil, France, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips had 15,900 employees and $15 billion of assets at the end of 1999.
Last month, Phillips announced a gas processing and marketing joint venture with
Duke Energy.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Chevron were up 50 cents at $79.06 1/4 in late afternoon trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Phillips were up $1 at $40.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 58.01; New Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks diverged in familiar fashion today, with technology
shares leading the Nasdaq composite index higher for a sixth straight session
while blue-chip industrials slumped.
</P>
<P>
	   According to preliminary calculations, the Nasdaq rose 76.40 to 4,320.54,
coasting past its previous record of 4,244.14, set Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 58.01 to 10,905.79. Broader stock
indicators were narrowly mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq, dominated by technology stocks, has risen more than 5 percent so
far this year, while the blue-chip Dow industrial average has fallen more than 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very fragmented market, and you can understand why," said Larry
Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities. "The cyclicals have run out of
gas and tech remains all the rage."
</P>
<P>
	   General Electric and 3M contributed most to the Dow's decline. An overall
weakness in the Dow's industrial and financial components held the blue-chip
index lower despite a big gain by Hewlett-Packard, which rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Campbell, chief investment officer at The Commerce Funds in St. Louis,
said fears that interest rates will rise sharply this year are weighing heavily
on investors' minds, pressuring the vast majority of stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to be a much tougher year for the equity markets," he said.
"Many stocks have reached very, very high valuations, and rising interest rates
are going to make many investors wonder if they're worth their high prices."
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates are generally bad for stocks because they cut into
corporate profits by making it more expensive to borrow money. Traditionally,
companies that place a high premium on growth are most vulnerable to higher
rates.
</P>
<P>
	   But so far this year, investors have determined that a handful of leading
technology companies are growing quickly enough to outrun interest rates. Cisco
Systems, Applied Materials and Apple Computer, strong performers in recent
weeks, all rose on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "When there's a dearth of news, investors are deciding to play what works,"
Wachtel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug stocks were mostly higher after Pfizer and Warner-Lambert Co. resolved
their bruising, three-month takeover battle. Pfizer will pay $90 billion in
stock to acquire Warner-Lambert, creating the world's second largest
pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer and Warner-Lambert both rose. American Home Products, which had also
conducted merger talks with Warner-Lambert, also advanced. The company will be
paid $1.8 billion -- the largest breakup fee in history -- to sever its contract
with Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   While shares of high-tech companies dominated buying on Wall Street,
investors received several reminders of the fragility of technology. Brokerage
Charles Schwab Corp. said clients experienced intermittent problems using the
company's Web site today.
</P>
<P>
	   Search engine provider Yahoo! said its Web site also experienced service
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, technical problems related to a software upgrade forced the
Chicago Board Options Exchange to halt trading for about two and a half hours.
The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were unaffected.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Spokesman Leaving Post  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- James P. Rubin, the voice of the State Department and a
trusted adviser to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, will leave in April
and be replaced by Richard Boucher, a spokesman for three of Albright's
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Monday, Rubin gave no explanation why he was giving up the
spot that made him world famous, or what he would do next. But Albright
suggested that wife Christiane Amanpour's pregnancy may have something to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
	   Amanpour, a London-based reporter for CNN, is due to give birth in March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've just become a grandmother, and I can just tell you it's a lot easier
to be a grandmother than to become a father,'' Albright said. ``He has to get
ready for those duties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously, Mr. Rubin has been very important in everything that we've
done,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said that after a ``great run in government'' for seven years, and
four years on the staff of Sen. Joseph Biden, Jr., D-Del., he needed time to
decompress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know what I am going to do next except that I am going to help
Christiane take care of our baby in London,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At this stage in life, I am doing three stressful things -- going to a new
country where I only partly speak the language, leave my career and have a
baby,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin, 39, is known worldwide through television broadcasts of daily
department briefings and for being at Albright's side during international
trips.
</P>
<P>
	   He spoke with rare authority, having been close to Albright while she was
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, where he was her spokesman, and then in
her more than three years at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said she asked Boucher to take over, citing ``a superb record of
government service.''
</P>
<P>
	   Boucher served as spokesman for former Secretaries James P. Baker III,
Lawrence Eagleburger and, briefly, Warren Christopher. He is a career foreign
service officer who was U.S. ambassador to Cyprus, consul general in Hong Kong
and, currently, coordinator for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department spokesman's job was relatively low key before the
popularity of cable television and instant communication. The spokesman would
hold daily briefings that were largely informal and provided reporters with such
basic information as the secretary's travel schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iran hostage crisis, which began in 1979, changed that. Television
cameras were brought into the department briefing room, give-and-take with
reporters became more formal, and spokesmen became celebrities.
</P>
<P>
	   Last June, for instance, when Albright and her entourage toured a camp in
Macedonia for ethnic Albanians who fled Kosovo, hundreds of refugees pushed
against ropes and chanted, ``Rubin, Rubin.''
</P>
<P>
	   The spokesman drew far more attention, and touched off more commotion, than
Albright herself.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin's dark good looks and Armani suits contributed to his fame. So did his
marriage to Amanpour.
</P>
<P>
	   He worked at the private Arms Control Association, and for Biden before
joining Albright in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Penn St. Keeps Investments a Secret  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Student activists who want to peek at Penn
State's investment portfolio have gotten a message: It's none of your business.
</P>
<P>
	   School administrators say outside advisers manage the school's $800 million
portfolio. Releasing any more information would mislead or confuse students,
they say.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the morning, we could have money in a stock or company that somebody
doesn't like, and then the investment manager could sell that stock by
afternoon," said Daniel Sieminski, assistant vice president for finance and
business.
</P>
<P>
	   Some students are not satisfied with this, however.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to know where the money's going," said Garrett Fitzgerald,
undergraduate student government president. "We want a full disclosure."
</P>
<P>
	   The student Senate voted 12-4 last week to ask university administrators to
open the books. The campus chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union,
Amnesty International and Eco-Action, an environmental defense group, back the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   "Penn State has an obligation to teach its students -- teach them in a lot
more ways than just inside the classroom," said Fitzgerald. "And if you invest
your money in ways that aren't positive and life-affirming, you're teaching that
it's OK, it doesn't matter if there is environmental pollution or human rights
abuses."
</P>
<P>
	   The student drive at Penn State is part of a nationwide effort to get
schools to invest their money in socially responsible ways. In the 1980s,
students opposed to apartheid in South Africa protested to stop their schools
from investing in companies that did business there.
</P>
<P>

of tuition money and state funds.

<HEADLINE> Is Propulsid Safe for Babies?  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Frightened parents began calling pediatricians when they
saw newspaper reports warning: Get an EKG before using the heartburn drug
Propulsid because it might stop your heart.
</P>
<P>
	   That warning was aimed at adults, because Propulsid is approved only for
adult use.
</P>
<P>
	   But many children, mostly infants and premature babies, take this drug
anyway -- and some have died or suffered irregular heartbeats. So do babies need
their hearts tested before taking Propulsid, too? And when is this illness bad
enough that infants need medication at all?
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration is mum on those questions. Pediatric
experts say Propulsid's side effect appears very rare, but that it should be a
last resort used carefully in babies.
</P>
<P>
	   And specialists say the Propulsid controversy illustrates a major problem:
Sick children repeatedly take adult drugs when no one knows if they really work
or are safe for youngsters because there is no choice. Too few drug companies
study how their products affect children.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's expensive to do drug trials. If they can use it for adult indications,
they can make their money on that," explained Dr. Robert D. Baker, who is
writing guidelines on how to treat babies with heartburn-causing
"gastroesophageal reflux."
</P>
<P>
	   Propulsid is widely used in infants -- in one survey of 58,000 premature
babies' medical records, 20 percent took it, said Dr. James Lemons, Indiana
University Medical Center's neonatology chief, who is advising FDA on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, "there's going to be a dramatic reduction" in use until studies settle
the questions, he said. "People will obtain EKGs prior to putting babies on
(Propulsid) and will need to follow them closely."
</P>
<P>
	   When and how to treat these babies is complicated.
</P>
<P>
	   Reflux occurs when stomach acid backs up in the esophagus. Adults call that
burning feeling heartburn. Babies react by spitting up.
</P>
<P>
	   All babies do that. It's normal considering the esophagus and stomach are
immature at birth, particularly in preemies.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 95 percent of babies will outgrow the problem by their first birthday,
Baker said. "So you try not to treat it."
</P>
<P>
	   But when reflux is bad enough that babies become malnourished and don't gain
weight, have trouble breathing while vomiting, or the esophageal irritation
causes obvious pain, Baker says it's time to treat.
</P>
<P>
	   Step 1: Giving frequent small meals instead of fewer large ones, burping
babies well, keeping them upright for half an hour after meals, and elevating
the head of the crib can help, Baker advises. Sometimes thickening formula with
rice cereal helps, too.
</P>
<P>
	   If that doesn't help, he tries special doses of prescription antacids like
Zantac or Prilosec.
</P>
<P>
	   When those fail, Baker prescribes Propulsid, which is not an antacid but
instead helps push food through the stomach.
</P>
<P>
	   In babies, "the evidence it works is not very strong," Baker cautions. "You
wouldn't say it was a miracle drug. It's a little bit of an aid."
</P>
<P>
	   How safe is it? Of the 70 deaths known by the FDA among Propulsid users
since 1993, 11 were among children. The FDA knows of another 20 children who
suffered nonfatal heart rhythm disturbances.

	   Experts say some were babies clearly given too high a dose. They say it's
critical that babies pass an EKG before taking Propulsid, take a cautious dose
and don't take other medicines that combine dangerously with Propulsid.

	   The FDA, however, says it lacks data to offer parents or pediatricians

<P>
	   Manufacturer Janssen Pharmaceutica notes that some European countries sell
Propulsid as a second-choice treatment for some babies -- although Canada
forbids its use in premature babies. At FDA's urging, Janssen began a small
study of infant doses, saying it only recently realized many infants took the
drug.

parents must know there's a danger.

Chase was put straight on Propulsid without trying antacids or getting an EKG
first. "I didn't know it 'til I lost a child."

<HEADLINE> Pfizer To Buy Warner-Lambert  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ and NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writers
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- After three bruising months of courtship, the world's two
fastest-growing large drug companies, Pfizer and Warner-Lambert, agreed to marry
Monday in a $92.3 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The daunting challenge for executives of both companies is to put aside
their nasty accusations and lawsuits and unite their research, sales and
manufacturing efforts to make the Pfizer takeover work.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company, to be called Pfizer, will be the world's
second-largest drugmaker. But if the merger succeeds as analysts expect, it is
expected to vault to No. 1 within two years.
</P>
<P>
	   For consumers, the gargantuan merger will have little short-term impact. The
new Pfizer will control less than 7 percent of the world market for prescription
drugs. But the companies contend that by combining they will be able to more
effectively develop new medicines and help hold down business expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   "We predict the integration will go very smoothly," said William C. Steere
Jr., Pfizer's chairman and chief executive, who will lead the business with
annual sales of $28 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   One reason for that rosy outlook is that Warner-Lambert Chairman and CEO
Lodewijk J.R. de Vink is stepping aside once the merger is completed this
summer.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fact that de Vink will not be staying will be sufficient to clear the
air,"said Dr. Joseph Zammit-Lucia, president of London-based Cambridge Pharma
Consultancy.
</P>
<P>
	   De Vink last November agreed to a takeover by American Home Products, saying
AHP's pipeline of new products was more impressive than Pfizer's. De Vink was to
be the top executive of the combined American Home-Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   No sooner had the deal with AHP been announced than Pfizer launched its own
hostile offer and Steere accused Warner-Lambert of failing to give Pfizer a
chance to bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert responded by seeking to terminate Pfizer's rights to
co-market and share profits from the blockbuster cholesterol-lowering drug
Lipitor.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's all behind us," Steere said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Added de Vink, "In any negotiation of this magnitude, you are going to have
tensions, and the most important thing is you look forward."
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer won by upping the ante, offering 2.75 shares of its stock for each
Warner-Lambert share, a deal valuing Warner-Lambert at $100.89 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Warner-Lambert rose $2.56
1/4 to $97.12 1/2, Pfizer rose 93 3/4 cents to $36.68 3/4 and American Home
gained $2.50 to $48.
</P>
<P>
	   Before moving forward, Warner-Lambert will pay American Home $1.8 billion --
the largest breakup fee in history. American Home will use the money and cash
from selling its struggling agriculture business to pay the legal bills from
health claims from consumers who used its former diet drugs, and make itself
more attractive for another suitor.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer's first step with Warner-Lambert will be to identify $1.6 billion in
cost cuts to be taken by 2002. A big chunk of that is expected to come from
layoffs as the companies move to combine administrative and manufacturing
forces.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously, there is going to be a certain amount of discomfort when there
is change like this," de Vink said. Referring to the 4 percent unemployment rate
that is the lowest in 30 years, he added, that "it's a good market for finding
other jobs."
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street analysts say the new company will be the fastest-growing large
drug company for at least the next several years.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer, fueled by strong sales of its blood pressure medicine Norvasc and
impotence-treatment pill Viagra, had been among the best-performing drug
companies in the last few years. But analysts said Pfizer had too few
blockbuster drugs in its pipeline to keep its growth rate going.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert's fast growth has been spurred by Lipitor, which had $5
billion in sales last year. But even though Lipitor will soon be the world's
top-selling drug, analysts worried that Warner-Lambert was growing too dependent
on it.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer's earnings were expected to grow at about 20 percent this year, but
with the acquisition of Warner-Lambert it expects to accelerate to average 25
percent growth over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
	   In comparison, analysts expect annual earnings to growth around 15 percent
for top U.S. drugmakers Merck &AMP; Co and Bristol-Myers-Squibb.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer, which had been the world's fourth-largest drugmaker, will now be
second behind Glaxo SmithKline, which is being formed by the proposed merger of
British firms Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Pfizer is growing considerably faster than Glaxo, analysts expect
Pfizer to take over the No. 1 spot by 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   "The combined firms can grow much faster together than on their own," said
Bob Kirby, an analyst with Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   In co-marketing Lipitor, the two companies showed Wall Street they can get
along, and that should help smooth over wrinkles left from the fierce takeover
battle.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given that it's a hostile takeover, it should go as smoothly as one can
expect, given the relationship the companies have had for three years in terms
of Lipitor." Leonard Yaffe, Banc of America Securities.

<HEADLINE> Israel: We May Leave Lebanon Soon  </HEADLINE>
   By RON KAMPEAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- After a week of bloody attacks on their troops and graphic
footage on the evening news, Israeli officials said Monday they may pull out of
Lebanon soon -- with or without an agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign of an impending escalation of the violence at the Israeli-Lebanon
border, the army ordered residents of border towns into shelters. Ministers in
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's Cabinet said it was becoming clear that a withdrawal
without Syria's agreement was likely.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1985, Israel established a buffer zone in south Lebanon to protect nearby
northern Israeli towns from guerrilla attacks. But Islamic Hezbollah guerrillas
have been fighting to drive the Israelis out ever since, and Barak said last
July 7 that Israel would withdraw within a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak had hoped a pullout would be through an agreement with Syria, the main
power broker in Lebanon. But Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down last month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no point in waiting until July, unless someone thinks that by
then we can achieve an agreement (with Syria),'' said Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
Barak's tourism minister and one of his lead Syria negotiators.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak's Police Minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, said Israelis should not rule out
an earlier withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Some warned that a unilateral withdrawal would be counterproductive,
bringing the Hezbollah within firing range of the Israeli towns arrayed along
the border.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's easy to call for a unilateral withdrawal when you don't consider what
will happen the next day among the northern border communities,'' said
opposition Likud lawmaker Silvan Shalom.
</P>
<P>
	   But the dramatic details of the latest deaths and grisly footage of the
fighting raised public pressure on Barak to make good on his promise to get out.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Barak significantly dropped the clause ``with an agreement'' when
he repeated his pledge to meet the deadline. He also blames Syria for not
restraining -- possibly even encouraging -- the Iranian-backed Hezbollah's
intensified attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   This week and last, four Israeli soldiers and a senior officer in the
Israel-allied South Lebanese Army died in Hezbollah attacks. On Sunday, a medic
was killed while he was tending to three soldiers wounded in earlier firing.
Throughout Monday, television stations repeated footage that included close-ups
of the wounded soldiers being evacuated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who have harmed us, will be harmed,'' Barak said before leaving for
a meeting with officials from northern border towns.
</P>
<P>
	   Within minutes of the end of a meeting of Barak's Security Cabinet, both TV
newscasts -- citing government sources -- said there would be ``upgraded
military action'' within hours. In the past, that has signaled intensive
artillery pounding of guerrilla targets in the strip Israel occupies in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   That in turn usually invites guerrilla retaliation in the form of katyusha
rockets aimed at northern border towns. As soon as the army ordered people into
shelters Monday night, residents fled the oft-hit town of Kiryat Shmona in
convoys.
</P>
<P>
	   A unilateral Israeli pullback from Lebanon would likely be bloody. During a
1984-85 Israeli pullback, Hezbollah led attacks against Israeli troops, securing
the new militia's reputation for toughness.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah would be as motivated to hit withdrawing troops now as it was
then. Heavy Israeli casualties would consolidate its image as the movement that
drove out the occupier.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech timed for prime-time newscasts, Barak told Israelis that they
would have to ``bite their lips in determination'' to meet the July deadline --
a warning that further violence was ahead.

<HEADLINE> Analysts Expect Dip in Oil Prices  </HEADLINE>
    By MARK BABINECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- Even as oil prices flirt with levels last seen at the onset
of the Gulf War, a new study is questioning how long international oil producers
will continue to hold down production.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 14th edition of their joint industry outlook, researchers from Arthur
Andersen and Cambridge Energy Research Associates said Monday that oil prices
currently hovering near $29 a barrel are likely to drop in the coming months as
OPEC gauges what the world can afford.
</P>
<P>
	   "OPEC and key non-OPEC producers are keenly aware of the risks of prices
rising too much as well as the risks of prices tumbling down toward single
digits once again," said the report, titled "World Oil Trends 2000."
</P>
<P>
	   In short, said Cambridge Energy president Joseph Stanislaw, producing
nations want to strike a balance between robust prices and affordable oil that
won't break energy-dependent countries, particularly Far East nations emerging
from economic crises.
</P>
<P>
	   "These prices for one quarter are fine. For two quarters, it's unsure. They
don't want to destroy their markets," Stanislaw said. "The question is, when
does (the high-price environment) impact world economic growth?"
</P>
<P>
	   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries likely will increase
production in the late spring to bring prices back down to a more manageable
level and blunt inflation, which could slow economic growth and stifle demand
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising oil prices have had a limited effect on inflation in the United
States, though certain industries are beginning to feel the pinch. Several
airlines have tacked on $20 fuel surcharges to round-trip air fares, while a
number of cargo companies have also raised rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Few in the industry seem confident that the market will sustain $29 per
barrel, nearly triple the price in December 1998. That outlook explains why
exploration companies have been slow to act, said Victor Burk, Arthur Andersen's
top energy expert.
</P>
<P>
	   "If oil producers believe the high oil prices that have prevailed since the
second half of 1999 are sustainable, that belief could create investment
incentives to increase worldwide oil production capacity even more," Burk said.
</P>
<P>
	   OPEC is scheduled to meet March 27 to make a decision on production levels.
Currently, OPEC is holding back 6 million barrels of potential daily production,
the study said. About 65 million barrels are produced worldwide each day.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, the World Bank said last week it expected oil to fall from near
$30 to below $20 later this year, a price level that would both be profitable
for producers and a relief for consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, West Texas crude for delivery in March fell 42 cents to $28.50 in
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   OPEC's likely target would be for prices in the low-$20 range, Stanislaw
said, but he cautioned that the market should expect continued volatility.
</P>
<P>
	   World Oil magazine, an industry trade publication, predicted in its annual
forecast last month that prices could stabilize between $25 and $28, which
should entice production investment in late 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   World Oil researchers forecast a worldwide drilling increase of 21.9
percent, to 60,343 wells drilled from about 49,500 in the bust year of 1999.
U.S. activity is expected to see a more robust recovery, rising 30.6 percent to
24,416 wells drilled from 18,700 last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, in addition to restraint over price uncertainty, the merger frenzy by
the major oil companies and the slow recovery of independent companies have
taken the focus off of production, despite high prices, said Bill Gilmer, chief
economist of the Houston Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think anybody is going to bet their company on an oil price
forecast," Gilmer said.

<HEADLINE> Aid Worker Claims Yugoslav Abuse  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE CORDER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- In a bare room in Yugoslavia, Australian aid
worker Steve Pratt said he was given a choice: sign a trumped-up espionage
confession -- or die.
</P>
<P>
	   In interviews broadcast Monday, Pratt and fellow aid worker Peter Wallace
spoke publicly for the first time about their detention and said they were
abused by Yugoslav security forces during the NATO bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt said his confession was prompted by beatings and death threats. Even
though he has since proclaimed his innocence, Pratt said some people are sure to
harbor suspicions that he was spying.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will never shake entirely the tag,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt and Wallace, both workers for CARE Australia, were arrested near the
Croatian border on March 31, a week after NATO began bombing Serb targets to
force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to pull his forces out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men spent 154 days in custody before being pardoned by Milosevic and
freed last September.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after his arrest, Pratt, once CARE Australia's head of operations in
Yugoslavia, was accused by Yugoslav intelligence forces of passing lists of
potential targets to NATO.
</P>
<P>
	   After a series of beatings, Pratt said he was told by his interrogator, who
identified himself as a major in Yugoslav intelligence service, ``This man will
take you downstairs to the garage and will get rid of you down there quietly. We
won't disturb the neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
	   It took three days to write the confession, Pratt said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Basically the chief said, `Look, I will read you the sentence, you write
the sentence down. If you think that the way I explain the sentence to you is
not in the Australian way of expressing it, change the expression, but don't
change the context,''' Pratt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt's confession -- that he was head of a spy ring and was using his CARE
work as a cover -- was ruled inadmissible at his trial, but he was convicted of
espionage anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallace and Branko Jelen, a Yugoslav who worked for CARE Australia, also
were convicted of espionage. All three denied the charges. Pratt and Wallace
only agreed to speak to Australian Broadcasting Corp. after Jelen was released.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallace said he also was beaten by his Yugoslav captors, and Pratt said
Jelen endured many beatings by guards in a Belgrade jail.

<HEADLINE> Parents Lobby for Air Bag Safety  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE STRONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents of children killed by air bags lobbied the
government Monday to keep strongly worded warning labels that say the safety
devices can kill young children riding in the front seat.
</P>
<P>
	   Parents for Safer Air Bags also encouraged the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration to adopt more rigorous crash tests to certify air bags.
The group believes that would force automakers to put safer air bags in new
cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Air bags have been blamed for at least 146 deaths, mainly young, unbelted
children and some shorter women whose necks were broken by the force of the bags
in low-speed crashes they should have survived, according to NHTSA data.
</P>
<P>
	   Safety regulators are working on new rules for air bags that specify which
crash tests must be used for federal certification. The regulations, expected to
be announced March 1, are intended to prevent air bag deaths in new cars.
</P>
<P>
	   About 25 relatives of children and some adults killed or seriously injured
by air bags met with acting NHTSA administrator Rosalyn Millman and other
transportation officials to express their views about the proposed safety rules.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The agency is proposing to water down the air bag warning label. We think
that is premature,'' said Robert Sanders, a Washington-area lawyer who founded
the group after his 7-year-old daughter was killed when the passenger-side air
bag deployed in a low-speed crash in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Labels now required warn parents that ``death or serious injury can occur''
from the air bag and that children are safer in the back seat. They are red,
yellow and black and are on the car visor and dash.
</P>
<P>
	   NHTSA officials are considering language that does not include the word
``warning'' or say ``death can occur'' to children riding in front.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanders and some of the other parents said the labels should not change
until there is proof that new air bags have eliminated the threat to children
and small adults.
</P>
<P>
	   New technology being developed by automakers includes sensors that determine
when to suppress an air bag rather than inflate it and so-called dual-stage air
bags that inflate with less force in lower-speed crashes.

<HEADLINE> Preemies' Learning Ability Studied  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Children born extremely prematurely, weighing 2 pounds or
less at birth, experience significant learning difficulties that persist into
their teen-age years, a study found.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers and experts not involved in the study said the findings
should make parents, doctors and educators aware of the risks such children face
and the need for them to get help early.
</P>
<P>
	   Prematurity is on the rise, partly because of an increase in multiple births
and in older women having babies. Also, medical advances enable an increasing
number of even the tiniest babies to survive.
</P>
<P>
	   Premature babies are known to run a higher risk of problems such as cerebral
palsy, mental retardation and vision and hearing trouble. The latest findings
bolster previous research linking prematurity to more subtle cognitive problems
that may be permanent.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no question that these children are at high risk," said Dr. Saroj
Saigal, a professor of pediatrics at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario,
who led the study. "We are raising the awareness that these children are likely
to have problems."
</P>
<P>
	   She followed 150 premature babies, who were born in Ontario between 1977 and
1982, into their teens. Her study, published in the February issue of the
journal Pediatrics, found that academic difficulties that existed at age 8
continued into the teen-age years.
</P>
<P>
	   The study is one of the first to follow premature babies into their teens.
Saigal said it is not clear whether these youngsters go on to have difficulties
in adulthood; more research on that is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   Those studied weighed between about 1 pound, 2 ounces and 2 pounds, 4 ounces
at birth and were born about two to three months early, "the sickest of the
sickest babies that we see," Saigal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Their average age was 14 during the most recent follow-up.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly half were receiving special educational assistance, compared with
just 10 percent of a control group of children who were not born prematurely but
were similar in gender, age and social class. Twenty-five percent had repeated a
grade, compared with just 6 percent of the control group.
</P>
<P>
	   Fewer than half of the smallest premature children -- those born weighing 1
pound, 9 ounces and under -- scored in the normal range most intelligence and
achievement tests.
</P>
<P>
	   And while 42 of the teens had nervous-system or sensory disorders such as
cerebral palsy, blindness and deafness, even those who didn't scored
significantly lower on achievement tests than the control group.
</P>
<P>
	   About 11 percent of the nation's 4 million births are premature, which means
they occur before the 37th week of pregnancy. That is up from 9 percent a decade
ago. The increase is largely attributed to a rise in the use of fertility drugs,
which often result in multiple, premature births.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 1.4 percent of all births, about 56,000 annually, are
considered very low birth weight, or less than about 3 pounds, up from 1.2
percent in 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Maureen Hack, a Cleveland neonatologist who has studied developmental
problems in premature babies, said the learning difficulties may be caused by
bleeding in the brain, lack of oxygen to the brain and other problems linked to
prematurity.
</P>
<P>
	   "These things don't go away," Hack said.

<HEADLINE> Eight Hijacked Passengers Released  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BARR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Authorities waged hours of ``fairly calm and
businesslike'' negotiations Monday with apparent Afghan dissidents holding a
planeload of at least 150 people hostage at an airport outside London.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials did not disclose what political demands, if any, the hijackers put
forth. But a diplomat familiar with earlier negotiations when the plane landed
in Moscow said those holding the plane sought to free a prisoner held in the
Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghan media speculated the hijackers were Afghan dissidents who sought the
release of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor who has been held since 1997
by Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement. Khan is a member of Afghanistan's
opposition alliance, which rules about 10 percent of the war-shattered country.
</P>
<P>
	   Once in Britain, the hijackers requested only food, water, unspecified
medical supplies and that the lavatories on the Afghan state-run Ariana Airlines
plane be emptied, said John Broughton, assistant chief constable of the Essex
Police.
</P>
<P>
	   He characterized the negotiations, conducted in English, as ``fairly calm
and businesslike'' and said authorities were patiently working toward a peaceful
solution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Negotiations remain our favorite option,'' said Joe Edwards, another
assistant chief constable. ``I will say it could be a very protracted technique.
It could go on for days.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mohammad Bashir Mahal, a passenger freed in Moscow, told reporters on Monday
that the hijackers treated the passengers well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were all young -- around 25-30 years old, dressed in traditional
Afghan costume -- and to begin with they were threatening,'' he said in Pashtu.
``But slowly, their aggression subsided and they treated us quite well. No one
was beaten or insulted. Relations were good.''
</P>
<P>
	   Broughton said that eight captives released Monday at Stansted, Britain's
designated airport for handling hijackings, ``tell us they were very
well-treated while they were onboard.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 727 was seized by an unknown number of hijackers shortly after
takeoff early Sunday on an Ariana flight from the Afghan capital, Kabul, headed
to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
	   Before landing early Monday at Stansted, about 25 miles north of London, the
hijackers had freed 22 hostages in return for supplies during earlier stops in
Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said they could not confirm the nationalities of what were
believed to be 157 hostages remaining on the airliner. They disclosed that one
passenger has a serious kidney illness, but said they did not know if that
person was among those released.
</P>
<P>
	   As night fell, the plane remained parked about a half-mile from Stansted's
main terminal, which still managed to operate at more than 80 percent capacity
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broughton said Britain's Foreign Office was working in ``close
collaboration'' with several other governments, but would not be more specific.
He added that it wasn't Britain's policy ``to allow aircraft to take off again
once landed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban said it would neither negotiate nor agree to
the demands of the hijackers. A statement issued by the religious militia's
supreme leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, accused the head of an anti-Taliban
alliance, Ahmed Shah Massood, of masterminding the hijacking. The Taliban
provided no evidence, however.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are watching this closely, waiting to hear what the demands are,''
Taliban Foreign Ministry spokesman Faiz Ahmed Faiz said in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Afghanistan and Britain do not have diplomatic relations, Faiz said a
Taliban representative in London was in contact with British authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The Afghan opposition has denied any involvement in the seizure of the
plane. It faxed a formal statement to The Associated Press saying it ``adamantly
condemns the hijacking.''
</P>
<P>
	   An emergency official in Kazakstan said 20 hijackers were aboard, but the
passengers released there said eight to 10 hijackers were aboard.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Take Guards in Peru Riot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- About 50 convicted Maoist-Shining Path rebels in a frigid
Andean prison were holding guards hostage Monday, after a riot that left at
least two people dead.
</P>
<P>
	   One guard and one rebel were killed in riots at Yanamayo prison that were
started Sunday by rebels loyal to Oscar Ramirez Durand, who was captured last
year, said cable news station Canal N.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels, armed with homemade knives, took an undetermined number of
guards hostage and demanded to be treated as prisoners of war instead of
terrorists, news stations reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials declined to confirm or deny the reports. Television broadcast
images of heavily armed police surrounding the prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Elias Aycacha, director of the Puno State Hospital told Peruvian radio
that three police guards had been injured, one critically.
</P>
<P>
	   A Justice Ministry spokesman in Lima said the rebels had been demanding
better prison conditions and more frequent family visits. President Alberto
Fujimori and Justice Minister Alberto Bustamante had visited the prison last
week to review conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yanamayo prison is 12,700 feet above sea level in Puno, 525 miles
southeast of the capital Lima and near the Bolivian border.
</P>
<P>
	   New York native Lori Berenson was held there until being transferred in 1998
for health reasons. A military judge convicted Berenson, 30, of treason in 1996
for helping lead a thwarted assault on Congress by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement -- another, less powerful, insurgent group.
</P>
<P>
	   Peru's war against leftist rebels has left 30,000 dead since 1980. Ramirez
Durand was considered the last top rebel leader still at large before he was
captured in July.
</P>
<P>
	   He is serving a life sentence at a naval base in Lima -- where the group's
founder, Abimael Guzman, also is imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
	   The Shining Path had as many as 10,000 armed fighters in the early 1990s,
but is now believed to have fewer than 1,000 combatants.

<HEADLINE> $1.84 Trillion Budget Unveiled  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To a chorus of Republican ridicule, President Clinton
sent Congress his budget finale on Monday, a $1.84 trillion plan to expand
health care access, shrink the national debt and shower Democratic
constituencies with election-year largesse.
</P>
<P>
	   Blessed with a budgetary bonanza that past presidents could only dream about
-- a projected $2.92 trillion in federal surpluses over the next decade --
Clinton used his spending outline to propose something for almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
	   He would cut taxes for the sick, elderly, poor and college-bound; spend more
for the environment, schools and gun-law enforcement; and erase the $3.7
trillion publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal is sure to be heavily reworked by Congress, where defiant
Republicans dismissed it as a gambit to bolster Vice President Al Gore's
presidential bid and the Democratic drive to capture Congress. They promised to
fatten the plan's tax cuts, trim its spending boosts and ignore its tax
increases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has all things for everyone they feel they'll need to get Al Gore
elected president,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio,
who called it ``the president's fantasy budget.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I look forward to working with the president in putting together a serious
spending proposal,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
``But this is a document designed to help Al Gore win election.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was little denying presidential politics at the White House, where
officials said at least a dozen Gore proposals were latticed into the outline.
But beyond that, Clinton's farewell spending blueprint -- for fiscal 2001,
beginning Oct. 1 -- was an effort to choose the terrain of this year's budget
battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton proposed $351 billion in tax cuts through 2010 that he argues can
only be enlarged by eroding Social Security's trust funds, diluting efforts to
expand and strengthen Medicare, or slashing other popular initiatives such as
hiring teachers or reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This budget, in short, makes really strong and significant steps toward
achieving the great goals that I believe America should pursue in this new
century,'' Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans said that at a time of surplus, taxpayers should get a bigger
break than Clinton wants to give them.
</P>
<P>
	   They criticized his proposal to raise other revenues by $181 billion over 10
years, including higher taxes on cigarettes and some corporate transactions. And
they noted that using Clinton's own figures, there would be a net $9 billion tax
increase in 2001 and a $1 billion increase in 2002 before annual tax cuts begin
to outweigh increases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me be very clear: This Congress will not raise taxes,'' said House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Strikingly, the president's budget boasted few initiatives that he has not
proposed before.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the new ones was a $91 billion, 10-year effort to expand health
coverage for working poor families. It is aimed at covering 5 million of the 44
million Americans who lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   He also called for setting aside $35 billion, beginning in 2006, for extra
prescription drug coverage for the sickest Medicare patients. This is on top of
a $160 billion, 10-year plan for prescription drug benefits for Medicare
patients, similar to his proposal of last year that Congress ignored.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also proposed extra spending to help farmers deal with low
commodities prices; about the same $278 billion Pentagon budget as this year;
and extra money to buy park lands, modernize schools and hire new federal agents
and prosecutors who focus on gun laws.
</P>
<P>
	   In one area of bipartisan agreement, the president would set aside the $2.17
trillion Social Security surplus over the next decade for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   By 2013, he said, the $3.7 trillion portion of the national debt should be
gone for the first time since 1835, which economists say should lower interest
rates and add muscle to the economy. The rest of the $5.7 trillion national debt
is money in federal trust funds such as Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton estimates that over the next 10 years, there will be a $746 billion
surplus in the rest of the budget -- a figure that will be pivotal in this
year's fiscal fight.
</P>
<P>
	   He would use this money to help pay for his tax cut, the prescription drug
proposal, the health insurance initiative for poor families and additional debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Republicans have made no final decisions, they will estimate this
part of the surplus to be hundreds of billions larger than $746 billion. That
would leave more room for the bigger tax cuts favored by most Republicans,
including the $1.3 trillion, 10-year plan advanced by GOP presidential contender
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's surplus estimate is smaller because he assumes that spending for
the one-third of the budget Congress determines every year will grow annually at
nearly the rate of inflation. Republicans say spending for this portion of the
budget -- which includes everything but automatically paid benefits like Social
Security -- will not grow that fast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is government on autopilot,'' Domenici said.
</P>
<P>
	   By crediting some debt reduction to Medicare and Social Security, Clinton
said his plan would extend Social Security solvency to 2050 and Medicare's to
2025.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton proposed no overhaul of either program's benefits or revenues,
which many analysts say must occur to prepare for the looming retirement of the
baby boomers. That omission seemed a concession that bipartisan consensus this
election year is impossible on those politically charged programs.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Elects Mesic As President  </HEADLINE>
   By EUGENE BRCIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- A candidate who pledged to lead Croatia away from
its authoritarian past won the country's presidential election Monday, his
opponent said, conceding the race hours before the first results were to be
announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Stipe Mesic is the victor in the runoff election to succeed the late Franjo
Tudjman, former Communist dissident Drazen Budisa acknowledged shortly after
polls closed. Mesic is a former member of Yugoslavia's collective presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the moment has come for me to congratulate Mr. Mesic on his
victory and to wish him a lot of success in carrying out the presidential
duties,'' Budisa said after early, unofficial results available to both parties
showed Mesic with a 10 percent lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates differed only slightly in the policies they supported
during the campaign, leaving voters with a choice based largely on personality
and presentation.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting took place in more than 7,000 polling stations in the country and 48
in embassies abroad. The first preliminary results were expected early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The vote was the third nationwide election in just over a month. In
watershed parliamentary elections on Jan. 3, Croats ousted Tudjman's
nationalists in favor of a left-leaning coalition supporting democratic reform
and integration into the European mainstream.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters returned to the polls Jan. 24 for presidential elections that widened
the break with Tudjman's corruption-ridden legacy. Mesic, 65, and Budisa, 51,
emerged victorious out of a nine-contender field, but neither mustered an
absolute majority, forcing a runoff.
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic, a lawyer, won the first round of voting with 41 percent. Budisa
lagged 13 percentage points behind.
</P>
<P>
	   The new president will have key influence in national security matters and
in shaping foreign policy. But he will face a reduction of executive powers,
with a new parliament committed to restoring its role as the central
decision-making body. Legal analysts say Tudjman, who led the country to
independence in 1991 and ruled until his death on Dec. 10, abused his powers.
</P>
<P>
	   Croats exhausted by Tudjman's authoritarian rule and imperial styles
apparently looked for a personality completely opposite to his. Mesic fit that
role -- projecting an easy-going attitude, offering quick solutions to problems
and speaking in terms ordinary Croats could understand. To people burdened with
increased economic hardships, he said: ``The future is smiling.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic is no stranger to politics or to Western officials. He served during
the 1960s as a deputy in the Croatian parliament and was Croatia's
representative in the collective Yugoslav presidency in the early 1990s, when
the federation began disintegrating.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Serb opposition, he became the last president of Yugoslavia at the
intervention of the European and U.S. officials on July 30, 1991, a month after
Croatia proclaimed independence from the Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   Warren Zimmerman, then U.S. ambassador to Yugoslavia, said that ``as a
politician, Mesic was a moderate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic joined Croatia's fight for independence as Tudjman's closest aide. In
1994, however, he left Tudjman's party, protesting its aggressive policy in
Bosnia, Tudjman's disregard for democracy and widely rumored corruption within
Tudjman's party.
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic has won kudos from Bosnian Muslims because he pledged to cut off
support to Croat hardliners there, and he has said he wants to testify before
the international war crimes tribunal about Tudjman and Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's alleged plans to carve up Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
	   Western officials have welcomed the democratic changes in Croatia. They have
expressed support for both Mesic and Budisa and their pledges to develop civil
society, free the media and improve Croatia's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union and the United States have promised financial aid if the
new president and government ease the return of Serb refugees, cooperate with
the war crimes tribunal and improve relations with Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Head Eyes Wiranto Pardon  </HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANT BRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid said Monday
that he would pardon Gen. Wiranto if the former army chief is found guilty of
war crimes in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will pardon him,'' Wahid said while in Brussels as part of a European
tour. ``For the past several years we have been good friends, despite whatever
he has done in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid also rejected rumors that Wiranto and other generals in Jakarta are
plotting a coup.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He protected me when I was persecuted by the last government,'' Wahid
said. ``I know him. I know he would not do such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Wahid called for Wiranto to step down from his current Cabinet
post and threatened to fire him in response to a government investigation that
held Wiranto responsible for the tragedy in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   The territory was torched and looted and some residents were killed after it
voted for independence from Indonesia last year. Wiranto, who is now the
nation's security minister, was the army chief at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations last week said in a report that the Indonesian army was
responsible for the crackdown and called for an international tribunal to look
into war crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid reiterated Monday that it would be better for Wiranto to step down
from his Cabinet post until he is cleared of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, he appeared to be softening his stance toward the general. Even
before Monday's comments, he had offered qualified praise for Wiranto's
character and had said Wiranto saved him from an army assassination plot in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is better for him to resign now,'' he said Monday. ``I respect him and
will continue to communicate with him whether he resigns or not.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Wahid's comments, it appeared tension between him and the Indonesian
military would continue in the wake of his allegations about an assassination
plot.
</P>
<P>
	   In a stopover in Rome this weekend, Wahid said Wiranto tipped him off about
the mid-1990s plot aimed at him and Megawati Sukarnoputri, who is now his vice
president. Wahid recounted how Wiranto told him that the army had been ordered
``eliminate'' him and Megawati. At the time, both were high-profile critics of
Suharto, Indonesia's former authoritarian leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto told him the order to kill had been conveyed by then-armed forces
commander Feisal Tanjung, Wahid stated.
</P>
<P>
	   Tanjung denied the story, describing Wahid's accusations as ``abnormal and
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Monday was the last day of Wahid's 16-day European tour. While in Brussels,
he met with European Union Commission President Romano Prodi to discuss future
cooperation and a possible EU aid package for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid stressed to officials that a new political system was being set up in
Indonesia. He said he would open a ``new dialogue'' between the Muslim and
Christian communities in his country to try and create a secular society.
</P>
<P>
	   Several parts of Indonesia have been marred in recent years by sectarian
violence that has claimed thousands of lives.

<HEADLINE> Police: Gifted artist, musician and wrestler also a murderer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Thomas G. Nelford left southern California for faraway
Columbia University a wrestling star, a gifted musician and artist. But the
23-year-old's life began a downward spiral at the Ivy League school that may
have led to the murder of his girlfriend and his suicide beneath a subway train.
<P>
	   Nelford dropped out of Columbia in 1998 and freeloaded at a fraternity house
before his drug use got him kicked out. No one on Monday seemed to know why
Nelford turned to drugs and left school. Or why he may have slain his
19-year-old girlfriend, lacrosse star Kathleen Roskot from Bayshore, Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Police are investigating whether Nelford's motive may have been anger
because Roskot wanted to break up with him.
</P>
<P>
	   Roskot's throat was slashed, and she was found naked Saturday afternoon on
the floor of her bedroom, a literary journal with a picture of the beatnik
author Jack Kerouac covering her face.
</P>
<P>
	   The placement of the journal may not have been a coincidence. Stark
similarities existed in Nelford's life and that of Kerouac, author of the 1950s
classic "On the Road."
</P>
<P>
	   Kerouac, who coined the term "Beat Generation" for himself and his starving
fellow writers Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs, was a high school football
star and won a scholarship to Columbia. But things at the Ivy League school
began to go wrong after Kerouac got into a fight with his coach, who refused to
let him play, according to biographies of the writer.
</P>
<P>
	   At about the same time, Kerouac's father lost his business and began
drinking heavily. A disillusioned Kerouac dropped out of Columbia. He began
hanging around New York with a crowd his parents disapproved of: Ginsberg and
company.
</P>
<P>
	   There are other similarities, as well. Kerouac, who died in 1969, also spent
time in California, where he turned to Buddhism and drank himself into oblivion.
According to one biography, "he was cracking up," an experience he recounted in
his last successful novel, "Big Sur."
</P>
<P>
	   And there's more: Kerouac's parents lived on Long Island as did Roskot's,
and through his first 40 years, he had failed to sustain a long-term romantic
relationship, although he often fell in love.
</P>
<P>
	   Friends in Oxnard, Calif., and at Columbia said they were stunned by the
news of Nelford's actions.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Columbia student Betty Lai said Nelford would often walk her and
other women home at night, so they would be safe.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was the sweetest boy," Lai said. "But I guess he was also a murderer."
</P>
<P>
	   "I trusted him around my family, my children," Todd Stoke, Nelford's
wrestling coach at Rio Mesa High School, said in several newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Stoke did not return telephone calls for comment Monday. A woman who
answered the Nelfords' telephone Monday said the family did not wish to comment.
The New York Times quoted Nelford's mother, Carolyn, as saying reports her son
was a drug user were "very cruel."
</P>
<P>
	   But several students at the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house, where Nelford
once lived, said his drug use was frequent. Fraternity president Rich Luthmann
said Nelford often did drugs out in the open, prompting the other members to
throw him out.
</P>
<P>
	   Other students said Nelford acted strangely and knew local homeless people
by name.
</P>
<P>
	   "We called him 'Weird Tom,"' said Corey Barnes, who lives next door to the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity house. "He seemed like a weird, crazy guy."
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after he allegedly killed Roskot, Nelford committed suicide by jumping
in front of a No. 1 train on West 181st Street. Investigators said he was
carrying Roskot's wallet when found.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical examiner confirmed Monday that Roskot's death was a homicide and
Nelford's a suicide. Nelford's violent end was very much in contrast to the
young man people knew in Oxnard.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was the kind of guy you thought would do something good for himself,"
Andrew Ferrari, 23, told the Daily News of Los Angeles. Ferrari was on the
wrestling team with Nelford for three years.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a good friend, a great wrestler and had a real promising outlook,"
Ferrari said. "Ever since I've known him, he's been a real nice guy. I never
expected anything like this."
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of last summer, Nelford was back in Oxnard, living in a van as he
wrote songs and dreamed of a music career, Luciano Basua Jr., 26, told the Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
	   "He told me he was writing a lot of songs and that a record producer had
taken an interest in his music," Basua said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nelford was also a gifted artist and had drawn a mural for the high school.
But he was best known for his wrestling prowess. In a 1994 article, the Los
Angeles Times described him as "arguably the best wrestler in Ventura County."
And Nelford was named "athlete of the year" in 1995 by his school. That same
year, he came in fourth in the 152-pound category in the state wrestling
tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   It's those memories that Stoke, Nelford's wrestling coach, still holds dear.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not trying to say Tommy's an angel who dropped directly from heaven,
but this was a good, very popular, well-liked young man who, around here, people
thought the world of," Stoke said. "I love Tommy."

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Turns out congressional staffers want to be millionaires,
too.
</P>
<P>
	   Press secretary Matt Phillips was a contestant Sunday on the quiz show ``Who
Wants to be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
	   One question that almost tripped him up was naming the national park where
Old Faithful is located. His boss, Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., serves on the
Government Reform Committee rather than Resources. But the audience helped
Phillips correctly pick Yellowstone over Yosemite.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't get to go to too many national parks,'' Phillips, 26, of
Washington, said in an interview from his office Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Another question rewarded his reading, by listing four governors in order
from east to west based on their states. The answer was George Pataki of New
York, George Ryan of Illinois, Jesse Ventura of Minnesota and Gary Locke of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I couldn't believe my luck, working in Congress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips is again on the show Tuesday, when he'll try to build on the $2,000
he won on his first episode. But he isn't telling what happens on the show,
which was taped Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps a clue was that he was still at work Monday.

<HEADLINE> Former CNN Exec Takes PBS Helm  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Turner Broadcasting executive and former talk show host Pat
Mitchell took the helm of the nation's Public Broadcasting Service on Monday and
said PBS's importance is growing in a time of media consolidation.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell, 57, PBS's fifth president, takes over for Ervin Duggan, who left
last fall, saying he had fulfilled his objectives.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell said PBS's educational mandate and non-commercial policy give it a
unique advantage at a time when viewers are concerned about whether huge media
companies will mean fewer independent voices on television.
</P>
<P>
	   "PBS is a brand that we know the public trusts," she said, adding that she
didn't mean that as a dig against Turner, which is owned by Time Warner,
recently bought by America Online.
</P>
<P>
	   PBS's board unanimously chose Mitchell at a meeting in Key West, Fla., over
the weekend. She was selected for her ability to help the system plan for its
future and to find consensus among the 346 public TV stations that make up the
service, board chairman Colin Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell also said he hoped to use Mitchell's expertise to help PBS stations
increase their international and local news coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell worked in local TV news before becoming a correspondent for NBC's
"Today" show in 1979. She left to develop and be host of the Emmy-winning
syndicated talk show "Woman to Woman," and later worked for ABC and CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   She joined Turner in 1992, heading a division that produced nonfiction
programming for CNN, TBS and TNT, including CNN's epic "Cold War" documentary
series.
</P>
<P>
	   In that position, she heard from some nonfiction producers that a cumbersome
PBS bureaucracy sometimes made it difficult to get the go-ahead for programs.
She hopes to streamline the process.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the programming genres PBS once had to itself -- nature
documentaries, historical documentaries, educational children's shows -- are now
widely available on cable. Mitchell said PBS needs to emphasize the mission that
sets it apart.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not making programming to appease the greatest number of eyeballs for
advertisers," she said. "We're making programming to serve the public."
</P>
<P>
	   One of her first tasks will be finding a new chief programming executive for
PBS. Kathy Quattrone, who last held that job, left in May for Discovery
Communications.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, President Clinton's proposed budget released Monday included a
recommendation that PBS get $393 million over a three-year period to help the
system convert to digital technology.

<HEADLINE> GOP: Clinton Budget 'DOA'  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- So much for an acrimony-free final year. Congressional
Republicans on Monday greeted President Clinton's $1.84 trillion farewell budget
proposal with open scorn, declaring it a ``lame duck spending spree'' that was
headed for a quick burial.
</P>
<P>
	   Top Republicans ripped into Clinton's budget, saying it was an election-year
return to the era of ``big government'' the president had supposedly disavowed.
Even though Republicans too no longer abide by spending caps put in place in
1997, many complained about Clinton's ignoring spending limits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The President didn't just blow the caps -- he blew all commitment to
fiscal restraint and sanity,'' said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill
Young, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans were of one voice in concluding that the budget proposal went
way too far in devising new ways to spend federal money, didn't go nearly far
enough in providing tax relief and was headed for a dead end in suggesting ways
to increase tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas called the plan ``a spending
smorgasbord full of special interest handouts.''
</P>
<P>
	   And Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., called Clinton's proposal a ``lame
duck spending spree by Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
	   House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, was even blunter. ``His
budget will be dead on arrival. Instead of looking for ways to create new
government programs we should focus on ways to make them work better by rooting
out growing waste, fraud and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's budget proposal for fiscal 2001 is 2.5 percent more than this
year's $1.79 trillion budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The president has proposed $351 billion in targeted tax cuts to help low-
and moderate-income taxpayers pay for college, care for sick relatives and save
for retirement -- far less than what Republicans envision. Clinton aims to
defray those tax cuts with $181 billion in tax increases, including a proposed
25-cent-per- pack boost in cigarette taxes and $96 billion in corporate loophole
closers that Congress has rejected in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me be very clear -- this Congress will not raise taxes,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert said the budget was a ``paradox.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``How can we pay down the debt with a budget that substantially expands the
size and scope of the federal government?'' he asked. ``How can the era of big
government be over when his budget would create close to $350 billion in new
government programs?''
</P>
<P>
	   At least one Republican saw the possibility for compromise. ``There's no
question that common ground exists between us,'' said Senate Finance Committee
Chairman William V. Roth, R-Del. ``I hope this year we can build on this common
ground and not miss the opportunities before us.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Health Investments  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proposing the biggest increase in government spending on
health care since the 1960s, President Clinton asked Congress on Monday for $195
billion over the next decade for new Medicare prescription benefits. For younger
Americans without health insurance, he wants another $110 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton cited rising government surplus projections in boosting by $77
billion the administration's previous request for cash to improve prescription
coverage for the elderly, even though congressional Republicans rejected last
year's more modest version as too expensive.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the new money, $35 billion would go to create a reserve account for sick
retirees whose very high drug bills would barely be dented by the limited
Medicare coverage the administration previously proposed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some seniors have absolutely enormous bills that they have no way of
paying,'' Clinton said. He offered no details about how the catastrophic
coverage would work, saying he would try to work it out with Congress'
collaboration.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP leaders continued Monday to question the wisdom of adding a new benefit
to Medicare, which is financially unprepared for the baby boomers' retirement.
But they held out the possibility of compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In this case, the president deserves credit for including Medicare and
prescription drugs on his canvas, but his picture needs revision,'' said Sen.
Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Committee on Aging.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Republicans would prefer to target help to low-income senior citizens
through tax credits or state block grants or to increase opportunities for
Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in HMOs that cover drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's plan would create an optional Medicare drug benefit in 2002,
covering half of retirees' prescription costs up to a $1,000 cap. Those
participating would pay a $26-a-month premium.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, for younger Americans, Clinton wants to make health insurance
more accessible through new spending on existing state and federal programs, as
well as tax credits to defray the cost of private coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Together, his initiatives for the young and old would require the biggest
government commitment to health-care spending since Medicare -- now a
$220-billion-a-year program -- was created in 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Republican lawmakers said Clinton seemed to be laying out a Democratic
campaign platform for the fall elections rather than a realistic budget with a
chance of passing Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican Conference,
said progress is possible only ``if President Clinton and House Democrats put
aside election-year politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was in part responsible for the death of some health care proposals
similar to his when he vetoed a broader Republican tax-cut package last year.
</P>
<P>
	   To help the nation's 44 million uninsured, Republicans and some moderate
Democrats support a $70 billion plan for a standard health insurance tax credit
for individuals and families not covered by employers or public assistance
programs -- about 27 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Clinton's competing proposals is $76 billion over 10 years to extend
coverage to 4 million parents of children eligible for state-run Medicaid and
Child Health Insurance Programs, known as CHIPs. He is also asking for an
additional $13.6 billion to get more children enrolled in CHIPs.
</P>
<P>
	   The president wants to give states authority and money to expand Medicaid
coverage for pregnant women and children who are legal immigrants as well as
people who leave welfare rolls for jobs without benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   He would give tax credits to Americans who want to buy insurance from a
previous employer under existing COBRA laws and those caring for an elderly or
disabled relative at home.
</P>
<P>
	   And for the third year running, Clinton will ask Congress to let people aged
55 to 64 who lack health insurance buy into Medicare, now limited to those 65
and older.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks diverged in familiar fashion today, with
technology shares leading the Nasdaq composite index higher for a
sixth straight session while blue-chip industrials slumped. The
Nasdaq rose 76.40 to 4,320.54, coasting past its previous record of
4,244.14, set Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 58.01
to 10,905.79. Broader stock indicators were narrowly mixed. The
Nasdaq, dominated by technology stocks, has risen more than 5
percent so far this year, while the blue-chip Dow industrial
average has fallen more than 5 percent. Gary Campbell, chief
investment officer at The Commerce Funds in St. Louis, said fears
that interest rates will rise sharply this year are weighing

	   Pfizer To Acquire Warner-Lambert
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pfizer, Warner-Lmbert and American Home Products
stocks all were higher today after Pfizer won a battle to get
Warner-Lambert. American Home Products will benefit to the tune of
$1.8 billion -- the largest breakup fee in history -- for severing
its contract with Warner-Lambert. Pfizer stock was up 15/16 at 36
11/16; Warner-Lambert was up 2 9/17 at 97 1/8, and American Home
Products gained 2 1/2 to 48. The combined company, to be called
Pfizer, will be the world's second-largest drugmaker. But if the
merger succeeds as analysts expect, the firm is expected to vault
to No. 1 within two years. For consumers, the gargantuan merger
will have little short-term impact. The new Pfizer will control
less than 7 percent of the world market for prescription drugs. But
the companies contend that by combining they will be able to more
effectively develop new medicines and help hold down business
expenses.

<HEADLINE> Chavez, Fellow Coup Leaders Feud  </HEADLINE>
   By BART JONES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Three former officers who helped President Hugo
Chavez stage his famous 1992 coup attempt are lashing out at the president and
his inner circle, threatening to carve a division in Venezuela's leftist
governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   The ex-coup leaders last week used the eighth anniversary of their revolt to
publicly warn Chavez that his year-old government may be betraying the
revolutionary goals that prompted them to take up arms.
</P>
<P>
	   They offered details. But on Monday, retired Lt. Col. Francisco Arias
Cardenas, considered the intellectual author of the 1992 coup, said Chavez's
Fifth Republic Movement political party is in crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An organization that doesn't allow contrary opinions, that doesn't debate,
that doesn't discuss, in my opinion doesn't exist,'' Arias, who is now governor
of oil-rich Zulia state, told the Globovision TV network.
</P>
<P>
	   Another former coup leader, retired Lt. Col. Jesus Urdaneta, called on
Chavez to fire two cabinet ministers and the head of the legislature. He claimed
they are leftovers from the corrupt oligarchy the former soldiers want to
destroy.
</P>
<P>
	   Government officials have shot back, fiercely criticizing the former coup
leaders and stirring the first major feud among Chavez forces. The spat has led
some to speculate that true opposition to Chavez may finally be emerging in the
South American nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Political analyst Anibal Romero said the conflict is partly about power,
since the three former coup leaders may feel sidelined in the Chavez
administration. Arias was passed over recently for vice president, and Urdaneta
was fired as head of the political police after he clashed with the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
	   The feud could cause deep rifts in Chavez's governing coalition, especially
if the discontent spreads to the military. Yet Chavez also enjoys near-fanatical
support among millions of poor people and is the most famous of the former coup
leaders. Some say it's Chavez's personality, not his governing coalition, that
really matters in Venezuelan politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez hasn't commented directly on the feud, though on Friday he announced
he was retaking control of the Fifth Republic Movement after ``letting them do
what they want'' for the last year.
</P>
<P>
	   In an apparent attempt to ease tensions, Fifth Republic leaders announced
Monday that the third former coup leader, retired Lt. Col. Joel Acosta Chirinos,
was resigning as head of the organization but will be the party's candidate for
governor in Falcon state in western Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez spent two years in prison after the coup attempt and was swept to the
presidency in December 1998 on a wave of public anger over mass poverty and some
of the world's worst corruption. Since then, he has overhauled Venezuela's
government -- winning approval for a new constitution, increasing the power of
the presidency and ousting the old Congress and Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say Chavez has concentrated power in his own hands and moved
Venezuela dangerously close to dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez's hodgepodge coalition is made up of former coup participants, the
military and leftist political parties with backing from Venezuela's poor
majority. The two traditional political parties that ruled the country during
four decades of democracy have all but disappeared, and some analysts had
predicted a viable political opposition would emerge from disenchanted Chavez
supporters.

<HEADLINE> Analysis of Clinton's Budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis
By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- By contemporary historical standards, the first sentence
of President Clinton's final budget message is the most striking: The $1.84
trillion tax and spending plan ``is the fourth balanced budget of my
administration.''
</P>
<P>
	   That's more than all other presidents in the last half century combined
could claim, and it comes against a backdrop of divided government and
near-constant political bickering.
</P>
<P>
	   It also underscores how the budget debate has shifted in the last
half-decade.
</P>
<P>
	   In the days of government red ink -- five years ago -- any proposed tax cut
or spending increase would have meant a rise in the deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   But, as Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., pointed out Monday: ``We have come a long
way since 1992, when the deficit was $290 billion and headed up.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the key big issues this election year, the two parties are in rough
agreement on what is needed to sustain the current economic expansion. They
pledge jointly to keep the budget balanced and to set aside the entire Social
Security surplus to reduce the debt, with a goal of retiring it by the middle of
the next decade, and are likely to spend much of the year jockeying for the
political credit.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest of the debate revolves around allocation of the general government
surplus, the money that does not come from payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   On that, the argument is as strong as ever. Republicans favor bigger tax
cuts; the White House wants more spending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How can we address the issue of tax fairness, when his budget does not
substantially ease the marriage penalty?'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How can the `era of big government' be over, when his budget would create
close to $350 billion in new government programs?'' The quotation harks back to
Clinton's 1996 State of the Union promise to shrink the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,
``The president is proposing the era of big government come back with a
vengeance. This is a document designed to help Al Gore win election.''
</P>
<P>
	   As usual, Clinton's proposal is well-stocked with politically potent
spending increases: a prescription drug benefit for the elderly, health
insurance for 5 million who now lack coverage, more money for Head Start and
money to help local school districts hire additional teachers. He wants to set
aside a portion of the surplus to lengthen Medicare's solvency.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton provides for tax cuts totaling $351 billion over 10 years, but that
is substantially offset by tax increases of $181 billion. The biggest single
item is a tax on cigarettes of 25 cents a pack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me be very clear,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas said in
rapid rebuttal: ``This Congress will not raise taxes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nor will it agree to all the new spending the president wants.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House would like to be very clear, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   It won't accept a tax cut being readied for a vote by the House GOP
leadership that would ease the so-called marriage penalty by $182 billion over
10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Nor will House Democrats, mounting a strong effort to gain a majority in the
fall elections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republicans' mantra is massive tax cuts and not a penny for Social
Security and Medicare,'' charged House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of
Missouri. ``As a result, they threaten the surplus before we can use it
responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
	   And at a weekend retreat in western Pennsylvania, there was general
agreement among the House GOP rank and file to hold spending on domestic
programs at current year's level, in the aggregate. It's not quite clear what
they mean by that, but it will certainly involve less spending than Clinton
favors.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time Congress adjourns for the elections this fall, a compromise will
be reached on spending and, given the swelling surplus, quite possibly on a tax
cut as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans intend to pass some sort of prescription drug benefit for the
elderly, although they prefer that it apply only to the less well-off.
</P>
<P>
	   The likelihood is the budget will be balanced, the Social Security surplus
left untouched and the nation's debt reduced by default as a result.
</P>
<P>
	   An entirely different situation than on the occasion of Clinton's first
budget eight years ago, when he said ``We can't keep on going the way we're
going.''

<HEADLINE> Catholic Leader Hume Appeals To IRA  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's most respected Catholic
politician appealed Monday for the Irish Republican Army to give up a cache of
its most powerful explosives, saying such a gesture was needed to prevent the
province's government from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
	   John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, sought to
resolve the crisis that is threatening Northern Ireland's Catholic-Protestant
administration after just two months in power.
</P>
<P>
	   Hume said the U.S.-brokered peace deal that got the administration formed
also created expectations the IRA would start to disarm. The outlawed group has
so far refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I now appeal to the IRA to show their deep respect for the will of the
Irish people,'' Hume said in remarks published by the Irish News, Northern
Ireland's main Catholic newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ask them to demonstrate for all to see their patriotism and desire to
move the situation forward by strengthening the peace process through beginning,
voluntarily, the process of decommissioning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He called on the IRA to hand over some Semtex, the Czech-made plastic
explosive the group has particularly prized since receiving several tons of it
from Libya in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   But the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party rebuffed the message. Sinn Fein chairman
Mitchel McLaughlin said Hume normally demonstrated ``great sensitivity and
judgment'' -- but that it would be ``hard to imagine a more inappropriate moment
to make that particular suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hume's IRA appeal came hours after dissident IRA members bombed a rural
hotel in Irvinestown, 90 miles west of Belfast. No one was injured in Sunday's
blast, but the attack was bitter reminder of the days the province is struggling
to leave behind.
</P>
<P>
	   The Continuity IRA, a dissident splinter group that claimed responsibility
for the bombing, answered Hume by threatening further violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We intend to continue to progress our war effort regardless of how British
rule in the six occupied counties is remodeled,'' the group said in a statement
Monday, referring to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   The province's major British Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, has
threatened to withdraw from Northern Ireland's Cabinet if the IRA does not begin
to surrender its weapons. It has scheduled a meeting for Saturday to debate the
issue.
</P>
<P>
	   That has left the British government with a choice -- to watch the Cabinet
collapse outright, or try to keep it intact by rendering it powerless.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair's government announced it intends to
push legislation through the House of Commons on Tuesday. That would enable
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson to revoke the Cabinet's
authority and resume so-called ``direct rule'' from London on Friday, as he has
already said he intends to do.
</P>
<P>
	   Hume, who shared the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize with Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble, is considered a prime architect of the peace process that
produced the Good Friday peace accord in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   That pact proposed that the power-sharing Cabinet be buoyed by gradual
paramilitary disarmament. But since it did not link the two goals explicitly,
the Ulster Unionists spent more than a year demanding a start to IRA disarmament
before they would share power with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
	   The breakthrough brokered in November by American diplomat George Mitchell
required the Ulster Unionists to accept Sinn Fein before the IRA would open
negotiations with the disarmament commission. The commission issued its first
detailed report about that secret dialogue Jan. 31 -- and confirmed no concrete
progress had been made.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Defense Minister Killed  </HEADLINE>
   By JOVANA GEC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An unidentified attacker shot Yugoslavia's
defense minister as he dined in a Belgrade restaurant Monday, killing the
official and wounding two dinner companions, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic, a loyal aide to President Slobodan
Milosevic, died at the Belgrade military hospital where he was taken after being
shot in the dining area of the soccer club Rad, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Montenegrin police said the gunman fired through a window of the restaurant,
hitting Bulatovic; the restaurant's owner, Mirko Knezevic; and banker Vuk
Obradovic from behind with automatic weapon fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yugoslav government, which met for an urgent session, said in a
statement that Bulatovic ``was the victim of a classic terrorist act'' and
pledged to fight against ``terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agency said an urgent government session
was called for later Monday to discuss the assassination.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack came less than a month after Serbia's most infamous warlord,
Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan, was gunned down in a Belgrade hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a dozen prominent people, some close to Milosevic, have been
killed in Belgrade in the past decade. Most of the killings have never been
solved, and the killers remain at large.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the shooting, the area where Bulatovic sat at a corner table
was covered with blood and the floor was littered with debris. Pieces of plates
and broken glass were scattered around. Bullet holes were seen on the walls.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic, 52, had been defense minister of Yugoslavia since 1994. Bulatovic
was largely a figurehead minister, with all the major decisions being made by
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   From 1992 to 1994, Bulatovic served as Yugoslav interior minister in the
government of Milan Panic, a Serb-born businessman who was sacked by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic was a member of a pro-Serb faction in Montenegro loyal to
Milosevic and his Socialist Peoples Party is at odds with the Montenegrin
pro-Western government of President Milo Djukanovic. Yugoslavia is made up of
two republics, Serbia and the smaller Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic is survived by his wife and two children.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 58.01; New Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   oNEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks diverged in familiar fashion Monday, with
technology shares leading the Nasdaq composite index higher for a sixth straight
session while blue-chip industrials slumped.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rose 77.63 to 4,321.77, coasting past its previous record of
4,244.14, set Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 58.01 to 10,905.79, and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 slipped 0.19 to 1,424.18.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq, dominated by technology stocks, has risen nearly 6 percent so
far this year, while the blue-chip Dow industrial average has fallen more than 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very fragmented market, and you can understand why," said Larry
Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities. "The cyclicals have run out of
gas and tech remains all the rage."
</P>
<P>
	   General Electric, down 5 1/16 to 136 1/2, and Boeing, down 2 3/16 to 41
13/16, contributed most to the Dow's decline.
</P>
<P>
	   An overall weakness in the Dow's industrial and financial components held
the blue-chip index lower despite a big gain by Hewlett-Packard. The computer
maker soared 10 3/8 to 128 3/8 after a Lehman Brothers analyst said the company
is poised to benefit from Ford Motor Co.'s plan to distribute Internet-ready
computers to its employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Campbell, chief investment officer at The Commerce Funds in St. Louis,
said fears that interest rates will rise sharply this year are weighing heavily
on investors' minds, pressuring the vast majority of stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to be a much tougher year for the equity markets," he said.
"Many stocks have reached very, very high valuations, and rising interest rates
are going to make many investors wonder if they're worth their high prices."
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates are generally bad for stocks because they cut into
corporate profits by making it more expensive to borrow money. Traditionally,
companies that place a high premium on growth are most vulnerable to higher
rates.
</P>
<P>
	   But so far this year, investors have determined that a handful of leading
technology companies are growing quickly enough to outrun interest rates. Cisco
Systems, Applied Materials and Apple Computer, strong performers in recent
weeks, all rose on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco, scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday, rose 4 1/16 to 125 3/16;
Applied Materials rose 8 1/4 to 153 5/8; and Apple gained 6 1/16 to 114 1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   "When there's a dearth of news, investors are deciding to play what works,"
Wachtel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug stocks were mostly higher after Pfizer and Warner-Lambert Co. resolved
their bruising, three-month takeover battle. Pfizer will pay $92.3 billion in
stock to acquire Warner-Lambert, creating the world's second largest
pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer rose 15/16 to 36 11/16 and Warner-Lambert gained 2 9/16 to 97 1/8.
American Home Products, which had also conducted merger talks with
Warner-Lambert, advanced 2 15/16 to 48 7/16. The company will be paid $1.8
billion -- the largest breakup fee in history -- to sever its contract with
Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   While shares of high-tech companies dominated buying on Wall Street,
investors received several reminders of the fragility of technology. Brokerage
Charles Schwab Corp. said clients experienced intermittent problems using the
company's Web site Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Search engine provider Yahoo! said its Web site also experienced service
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, technical problems related to a software upgrade forced the
Chicago Board Options Exchange to halt trading for about two and a half hours.
The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were unaffected.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, advancing issues led by a 5-to-4 margin.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 915.13 million shares, compared with 1.03 billion in the
previous session.

<HEADLINE> Is Propulsid Safe for Babies?  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Frightened parents began calling pediatricians when they
saw newspaper reports warning: Get an EKG before using the heartburn drug
Propulsid because it might stop your heart.
</P>
<P>
	   That warning was aimed at adults, because Propulsid is approved only for
adult use.
</P>
<P>
	   But many children, mostly infants and premature babies, are given this drug
anyway -- and some have died or suffered irregular heartbeats. So do babies need
their hearts tested before taking Propulsid, too? And when is this illness bad
enough that infants need medication at all?
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration is mum on those questions. Pediatric
experts say Propulsid's side effect appears very rare, but that it should be a
last resort used carefully in babies.
</P>
<P>
	   And specialists say the Propulsid controversy illustrates a major problem:
Sick children repeatedly get adult drugs when no one knows if they really work
or are safe for youngsters because there is no choice. Too few drug companies
study how their products affect children.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's expensive to do drug trials. If they can use it for adult indications,
they can make their money on that," explained Dr. Robert D. Baker, who is
writing guidelines on how to treat babies with heartburn-causing
"gastroesophageal reflux."
</P>
<P>
	   Propulsid is widely used in infants -- in one survey of 58,000 premature
babies' medical records, 20 percent took it, said Dr. James Lemons, Indiana
University Medical Center's neonatology chief, who is advising FDA on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, "there's going to be a dramatic reduction" in use until studies settle
the questions, he said. Doctors "will obtain EKGs prior to putting babies on
(Propulsid) and will need to follow them closely."
</P>
<P>
	   When and how to treat these babies is complicated.
</P>
<P>
	   Reflux occurs when stomach acid backs up in the esophagus. Adults call that
burning feeling heartburn. Babies react by spitting up.
</P>
<P>
	   All babies do that. It's normal considering the esophagus and stomach are
immature at birth, particularly in preemies.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 95 percent of babies will outgrow the problem by their first birthday,
says Baker, a Medical University of South Carolina pediatric gastroenterologist.
"So you try not to treat it."
</P>
<P>
	   But when reflux is bad enough that babies become malnourished and don't gain
weight, have trouble breathing while vomiting, or the esophageal irritation
causes obvious pain, Baker says it's time to treat.
</P>
<P>
	   Step 1: Giving frequent small meals instead of fewer large ones, burping
babies well, keeping them upright for half an hour after meals, and elevating
the head of the crib can help, Baker advises. Sometimes thickening formula with
rice cereal helps, too.
</P>
<P>
	   If that doesn't help, he tries special doses of prescription antacids like
Zantac or Prilosec.
</P>
<P>
	   When those fail, Baker prescribes Propulsid, which is not an antacid but
instead helps push food through the stomach.
</P>
<P>
	   In babies, "the evidence it works is not very strong," Baker cautions. "You
wouldn't say it was a miracle drug. It's a little bit of an aid."
</P>
<P>
	   How safe is it? Of the 70 deaths known by the FDA among Propulsid users
since 1993, 11 were among children. The FDA knows of another 20 children who
suffered nonfatal heart rhythm disturbances.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts say some were babies clearly given too high a dose. They say it's
critical that babies pass an EKG before taking Propulsid, take a cautious dose
and don't take other medicines that combine dangerously with Propulsid.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker's belief: "When used in the right way, it's a safe drug."
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA, however, says it lacks data to offer parents or pediatricians
advice. "The adult warning describes what's happening in adults. In kids ... we
don't really know what to warn about," said FDA's Dr. Florence Houn.
</P>
<P>
	   Manufacturer Janssen Pharmaceutica notes that some European countries sell
Propulsid as a second-choice treatment for some babies -- although Canada
forbids its use in premature babies. At FDA's urging, Janssen began a small
study of infant doses, saying it only recently realized many infants took the
drug.
</P>
<P>
	   But one mother whose 6-month-old died in 1998 while taking Propulsid says
parents must know there's a danger.
</P>
<P>
	   "People don't realize," say Karen Brown of East Moline, Ill., whose son
Chase was put straight on Propulsid without trying antacids or getting an EKG
first. "I didn't know it 'til I lost a child."

<HEADLINE> One dead, one wounded in Westchester Community College shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   VALHALLA, N.Y. (AP) - A man in the midst of a breakup with his
18-year-old girlfriend accosted her in a college hallway Monday, shot her in the
head as she tried to get away, then shot and killed himself as he ran off across
the snow-covered campus.
<P>
	   "His hand went up, then his head went back. He was still running, then he
fell," said Rayvon Miller of Greenburgh, a student who witnessed the suicide at
Westchester Community College.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting was the first in the 54-year history of the college, said
Julius Ford, vice president of student services.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not really what you expect when you go to school," said Louis Ramirez,
a student from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman, who lives in Mount Vernon but whose name was not made public, was
listed in critical condition at the Westchester Medical Center. Detective
William Rehm of the Westchester County police said, however, that her gunshot
wound - from a bullet that glanced off her temple - did not appear to be
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
	   Rehm said the woman was in a first-floor hallway of the Academic Arts
building at about 12:15 p.m. when the man, identified only as a Yonkers man in
his 20s who was not a student, confronted her.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was on ongoing prior relationship," Rehm said. "We have reason to
believe that that relationship may have been terminated by one party or the
other."
</P>
<P>
	   They argued and she tried to leave, Rehm said, but he followed and "she
obviously felt threatened. ... She went for the first open door she came to."
</P>
<P>
	   Just as she was going through the door, the man grabbed her from behind and
fired one shot from a handgun. She fell into the room, where a staff member and
a student had been meeting, and they shut the door behind her. The bullet that
glanced off her head was found embedded in the door, Rehm said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Closing the door was good thinking on their part," the detective said. "It
ended the assault and forced the perpetrator to leave."
</P>
<P>
	   The attacker ran off along campus pathways and was near the school's
Classroom Building when he shot himself. Blood marked the snow where he fell,
the gun still in his hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Don Gregory, a journalism teacher who walked by the body soon after the
suicide, called the experience "surrealistic."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a numbing sensation to see someone lying there. ... You feel despair
at not knowing what to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said classes were not interrupted for the 20,500 students, but campus
exits were sealed for half an hour until police concluded that the dead man was
the only attacker.
</P>
<P>
	   The school offered a telephone hotline for worried parents and counseling
for any students troubled by the shootings.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said the building where the first shooting occurred is patrolled by one
unarmed guard. The school will eventually review security, he said.

<HEADLINE> Gold Rally Fizzles; Cocoa Rises  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A brief but explosive rally in gold fizzled out Monday when a major Canadian
mining company signaled caution about prices after they had reached a second
consecutive four-month high.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, heating oil and other energy futures sank as temperatures
in the Northeast rose, and cocoa bounced higher after hitting 27-year lows last
week.
</P>
<P>
	   Gold prices rocketed 8 percent higher Friday on a combination of factors,
including evidence of an overheating U.S. economy and the optimism shown by a
top producer in suspending its program for hedging, or betting on lower prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The furious rally continued early Monday on the Comex division of the New
York Mercantile Exchange, barreling upward another 4 percent to $326.90 an
ounce, the highest price since Oct. 7. The two-year high for gold, $339 last
Oct. 5, was in sight.
</P>
<P>
	   But investors' enthusiasm for the metal began waning at that lofty level,
and they went on a selling spree when the world's No. 4 gold producer announced
it was revising but not halting its gold sales and hedging program.
Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp. had been widely expected to follow the lead set
last week by fellow Canadian producer Placer Dome Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Gold for April delivery settled down $8.50 at $304.50 an ounce -- a 3
percent decline.
</P>
<P>
	   That's still 5 percent higher than it was before the flurry began last
Friday, and analysts are uncertain whether the higher level will hold.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think you'll see pullbacks to the mid-$290s," said Dave Meger, senior
metals analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago. "But you can now see prices
averaging $300 an ounce without any problem. I think we'll settle between $300
and $310."
</P>
<P>
	   George Gero, first vice president for Prudential Securities, said the sharp
fallback Monday was disappointing but "at least it's off those doldrum lows" of
recent months.
</P>
<P>
	   "The jury's out on whether this was a turnaround in the market or once again
a short-term event," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver, following gold's lead, also came down sharply after an earlier
rally, with the March contract settling 30 cents lower at $5.28 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil's hot winter run may be nearing an end after prices slid 4
percent on the New York Merc. Temperatures were above freezing Monday in much of
the U.S. Northeast, the world's top heating oil market, and are forecast to rise
higher in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   March heating oil fell 2.97 cents to 75.81 cents a gallon. March crude oil
dipped 1.3 percent, settling 37 cents lower at $28.45 a barrel, while March
unleaded gasoline fell 1.21 cent to 78.62 cents a gallon and March natural gas
plummeted 18 cents to $2.562 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, March Brent crude from the North Sea fell 19 cents to $26.88 on
the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa traders said prices for that commodity may finally have hit bottom.
West African crops are still coming in huge, but a U.S. forecast lowered the
estimate for production in Indonesia, the world's No. 3 producer.
</P>
<P>
	   May cocoa settled up $16 at $814 a ton on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Whitman disavows Michael Francis despite his acquittal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The former chairman of the New Jersey Sports and
Exposition Authority may be exonerated of any crimes, but his former boss, Gov.
Christie Whitman, said Monday she is nonetheless glad to be rid of him.
<P>
	   Michael Francis was acquitted of charges last month that he had concealed
ties to a reputed mobster and tried to use those ties to win a contract for his
cleaning company from a mall in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said Francis' nefarious ties may not have been enough to plant him
in jail "but those associations, that kind of business association, is just not
acceptable in government, as far as I'm concerned."
</P>
<P>
	   "The reasons, the ethical concerns that I had that led me to request his
stepping down as chairman of the Sports Authority were never in contention (in
his trial). Those exist," the governor said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis was a former Essex County GOP chairman, fund-raiser for the
governor's 1993 campaign, head of her inaugural party and her first Sports
Authority chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Then in 1996 Whitman demanded his resignation, and in 1997 Francis was
indicted on charges that he concealed ties to Anthony Rizzo, a reputed leader in
the Genovese crime family who was convicted of criminal conspiracies in the
trash industry over the course of 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Evidently the trail got hot when investigators wiretapping Rizzo heard him
bragging about his friendship with Francis.
</P>
<P>
	   Various counts in Francis' indictment had to be redone because of defects,
other counts were thrown out along the way and finally on Jan. 20 a Superior
Court judge ended Francis' trial and dismissed the remaining charges because
prosecutors had failed to provide "a scintilla of evidence for the jury to
consider."
</P>
<P>
	   Francis said it "ends what has been a devastating and painful period in my
life."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman has repeatedly declined to comment on the Francis case because two
minor charges were still pending against him. Attorney General John Farmer
dropped those two weeks ago, so on Monday Whitman broke her silence.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let me just say that it was a very difficult time for me when I was first
made aware of his business associates, and I would say that I felt betrayed at
that time. If I had known about that prior to the appointment (to the Sports
Authority), I never would have offered him that position.
</P>
<P>
	   "And for me, that was difficult, because he did lay himself out for me (in
the 1993 campaign), he did a lot of fund raising, and I felt a great deal of
loyalty to him because of that," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said his ties to organized crime created an insurmountable ethical
smear, and she would never have accepted his help as a candidate had she any
inkling about them.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor said it was inappropriate for her to discuss prosecution
matters.
</P>
<P>
	   "The criminal procedure is the criminal procedure. Those charges were
brought, and the judge dismissed them. That's the way that goes," Whitman said.
"There are those who would argue there were things the jury was not allowed to
hear about some of the other issues, but I can't go into that."
</P>
<P>
	   But she also said the dismissals had no bearing on the ethical concerns,
which she said "were never in dispute" for an official "in a position where you
carry the trust in the name of the state of New Jersey with you as you do
business."

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs Yen on Japan Outlook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar jumped against the yen Monday after a Japanese
official issued a gloomy assessment of that country's economic situation.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was quoted at 108.78 yen in late New York trading, well above its
level of 107.35 yen late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the latest gain for the dollar against the yen as currency markets
reacted to continued signs of strength in the U.S. economy, higher short-term
interest rates and the absence of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the yen took a blow from statements by a senior Japanese
official in a television interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Taichi Sakaiya, the country's chief economic planner, said he expects to see
a "considerably large negative figure" when gross domestic product for the
October-December quarter is announced next month.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Japanese economy did shrink during the latest quarter, it would mark
the second consecutive quarter of contraction, meeting the textbook definition
of an economy in recession.
</P>
<P>
	   A separate survey showing a decline in Japanese business sentiment added to
the concerns about Japan's economy, which has been struggling to emerge from a
prolonged slowdown.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey by Japan's Economic Planning Agency found that business sentiment
worsened slightly in the October-December quarter on concern over Y2K computer
glitches.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading, the euro was quoted at 98.00 cents, down from 98.29 cents
late Friday. The dollar also was quoted at 1.6387 Swiss francs, up from 1.6345,
and 1.4458 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4416. The British pound rose to $1.5964
from $1.5908.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Monday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9952 German marks, up from 1.9899; 6.6917
French francs, up from 6.6737; and 1,975.28 Italian lire, up from 1,969.96.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton: I must get known on my own  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Having lived in the shadow of her husband's
presidency for seven years, Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday that like Vice
President Al Gore she must create an independent image to succeed as a
candidate.
<P>
	   "I think the vice president had to say to himself, 'Hey, I need to go out
and tell my story. People don't know anything about me,"' the newly official
Senate candidate said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press. 'I
learned the same thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also said that when people think about who to vote for in the Senate
race, they should consider that she is strongly in favor of abortion rights and
wouldn't vote to confirm known anti-abortion candidates for federal judgeships.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't imagine I would vote to confirm such a nominee," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, Clinton's expected Republican opponent, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who is also an abortion rights supporter, said he would not
rule out voting to confirm a judge who held anti-abortion views.
</P>
<P>
	   The interview came the day after Clinton announced her Senate candidacy and
during the start of a four-day campaign swing that was to take her to Buffalo,
Rochester, Syracuse and Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady told the AP that she did not know whether the president might
want to run again for elective office. There has been speculation that he might
someday want to run for the Senate himself, perhaps from his home state of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't say never to anything, but I think he's got lots of ideas about
things he wants to do. He wants to remain very active in the public debate here
in our country and around the world. ... But I don't know all that he would do
in the future," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   And, once again, Clinton sought to raise concerns about just how well the
blunt-spoken Giuliani would do in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't show up in the Senate and demand that your 99 colleagues do what
you tell them to do," she said. "You've got to be able to work with people one
day who you may disagree with the next day."
</P>
<P>
	   But asked directly if she felt Giuliani had the wrong temperament for the
Senate, she said: "That is a question that the people of New York will have to
ask themselves. I think I would be a very good senator for New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also implied that Giuliani couldn't necessarily be counted on to
maintain what has been his largely moderate record in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've seen it time and time again - people who claim to be independent, all
of a sudden vote with the Republican leadership because if they don't, they
don't get support raising funds for their campaigns, they don't get the
committee assignments that they want," she said. "That's just the way that party
operates."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's desire to step out of the shadow of her husband has been
increasingly obvious in recent weeks. For instance, her campaign literature and
her banners routinely refer to her simply as "Hillary" now.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just seems like the easiest way for me to quickly be identified," she
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "This may be a campaign between two, first-name candidates," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was an impression that I got that people were just unaware of how I
had spent my life before the White House and that there was also a similar gap
on awareness on what I had done in the White House," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you come out of the White House, where there really is one voice ...
no matter how much you do to help create positive results for the people as part
of that overall agenda, it's only appropriate that the American public wouldn't
know much about it," Clinton explained.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the first lady said she would only go so far to establish her
own identity beyond the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not moving to Nashville," she joked. "I moved to Chappaqua."
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady also expressed a desire to have the independent counsel's
office that has been looking into Whitewater and other allegations of
impropriety against the Clintons wind up its work.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that everyone would have expected that after 6 1/2 years, thousands
upon thousands of documents and investigations and committee hearings, that they
would have reached their conclusion and I would hope that they do in an
efficacious manner," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Clinton said the ongoing probe still hanging over her and the
president was not having an impact on the way she is running her campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "That has nothing to do with any of my campaign decisions or how I'm trying
to present myself," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also said that win or lose, she plans to maintain the roots she
planted last month when she moved into the $1.7 million house she and the
president purchased in Chappaqua in suburban Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
	   "I look forward to spending years in that house," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   And what of the change from political supporter to candidate?
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to just get out there and have the experience. You have to be
ready to learn and work on yourself so you can be more effective. And I've been
doing all of that," she said. "It's exciting."

<HEADLINE> Pfizer Acquires Warner-Lambert  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ and NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writers
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- After three bruising months of courtship, the world's two
fastest-growing large drug companies, Pfizer and Warner-Lambert, agreed to marry
Monday in a $92.5 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The daunting challenge for executives of both companies is to put aside
their nasty accusations and lawsuits and unite their research, sales and
manufacturing efforts to make the Pfizer takeover work.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company, to keep the Pfizer name, will be the world's
second-largest drugmaker. But if the merger succeeds as analysts expect, it is
expected to vault to No. 1 within two years.
</P>
<P>
	   For consumers, the gargantuan merger will have little short-term impact. The
new Pfizer will control less than 7 percent of the world market for prescription
drugs. But the companies contend that by combining they will be able to more
effectively develop new medicines and help hold down business expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   "We predict the integration will go very smoothly," said William C. Steere
Jr., Pfizer's chairman and chief executive, who will lead the business with
annual sales of $28 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   One reason for that rosy outlook is that Warner-Lambert Chairman and CEO
Lodewijk J.R. de Vink is stepping aside once the merger is completed this
summer.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fact that de Vink will not be staying will be sufficient to clear the
air,"said Dr. Joseph Zammit-Lucia, president of London-based Cambridge Pharma
Consultancy.
</P>
<P>
	   De Vink last November agreed to a takeover by American Home Products, saying
AHP's pipeline of new products was more impressive than Pfizer's. De Vink was to
be the top executive of the combined American Home-Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   No sooner had the deal with AHP been announced than Pfizer launched its own
hostile offer and Steere accused Warner-Lambert of failing to give Pfizer a
chance to bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert responded by seeking to terminate Pfizer's rights to
co-market and share profits from the blockbuster cholesterol-lowering drug
Lipitor.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's all behind us," Steere said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Added de Vink, "In any negotiation of this magnitude, you are going to have
tensions, and the most important thing is you look forward."
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer won by upping the ante, offering 2.75 shares of its stock for each
Warner-Lambert share, a deal valuing Warner-Lambert at $101.06 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Warner-Lambert rose $2.75
to $97.41 1/4, Pfizer rose $1 to $36.75 and American Home gained $2.93 3/4 to
$48.43 3/4 as of 5:30 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
	   Before moving forward, Warner-Lambert will pay American Home $1.8 billion --
the largest breakup fee in history. American Home will use the money and cash
from selling its struggling agriculture business to pay the legal bills from
health claims from consumers who used its former diet drugs, and make itself
more attractive for another suitor.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer's first step with Warner-Lambert will be to identify $1.6 billion in
cost cuts to be taken by 2002. A big chunk of that is expected to come from
layoffs as the companies move to combine administrative and manufacturing
forces.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously, there is going to be a certain amount of discomfort when there
is change like this," de Vink said. Referring to the 4 percent unemployment rate
that is the lowest in 30 years, he added, that "it's a good market for finding
other jobs."
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street analysts say the new company will be the fastest-growing large
drug company for at least the next several years.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer, fueled by strong sales of its blood pressure medicine Norvasc and
impotence-treatment pill Viagra, had been among the best-performing drug
companies in the last few years. But analysts said Pfizer had too few
blockbuster drugs in its pipeline to keep its growth rate going.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert's fast growth has been spurred by Lipitor, which had $5
billion in sales last year. But even though Lipitor will soon be the world's
top-selling drug, analysts worried that Warner-Lambert was growing too dependent
on it.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer's earnings were expected to grow at about 20 percent this year, but
with the acquisition of Warner-Lambert it expects to accelerate to average 25
percent growth over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
	   In comparison, analysts expect annual earnings to growth around 15 percent
for top U.S. drugmakers Merck &AMP; Co and Bristol-Myers-Squibb.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer, which had been the world's fourth-largest drugmaker, will now be
second behind Glaxo SmithKline, which is being formed by the proposed merger of
British firms Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Pfizer is growing considerably faster than Glaxo, analysts expect
Pfizer to take over the No. 1 spot by 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   "The combined firms can grow much faster together than on their own," said
Bob Kirby, an analyst with Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   In co-marketing Lipitor, the two companies showed Wall Street they can get
along, and that should help smooth over wrinkles left from the fierce takeover
battle.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given that it's a hostile takeover, it should go as smoothly as one can
expect, given the relationship the companies have had for three years in terms
of Lipitor." Leonard Yaffe, Banc of America Securities.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has stepped up efforts to interdict
illegal oil exports from Iraq following seizure of a Russian tanker carrying
Iraqi crude, Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said the Volga-Neft-147 -- seized last week for carrying oil in
violation of the U.N. embargo against Iraq -- was taken Monday to Oman and was
being unloaded. He said the oil would be sold and the profits used to pay for
the cost of surveillance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are intensifying the interception operations,'' Cohen told a Pentagon
briefing on the proposed U.S. budget. ``We and the United Nations want to
maintain a containment policy to make sure that we intercept as many illegal
operations as we can.''
</P>
<P>
	   Such illegal operations ``seem to have intensified in recent months,
particularly with the increase in the price of oil, and Saddam Hussein is going
to try to exploit that to get as much revenue as he can,'' he said. ``And so, we
will continue to bolster the international community's obligations and
opportunities to intercept as many as we can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Russian denials, Cohen said tests on the oil showed it was from
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen pointed out that the Russian tanker was privately owned, and not the
property of the government. Moscow had protested the seizure and demanded the
vessel's release.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia, which maintained that the oil was from Iran, long has supported
steps that would lead to the eventual lifting of the U.N. economic embargo
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is banned from most international commerce but is allowed to export up
to $5.2 billion in oil every six months in order to buy food, medicine and other
essentials for its people, and spare parts for its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the effort to enforce the U.N. sanctions, the State Department said
last week that illicit oil exports from Iraq average 100,000 barrels a day,
compared with 50,000 barrels in 1998, when oil prices were much lower.

<HEADLINE> Czech, U.S. Brewers Share Bud Name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- The legal wrangling between Czech and U.S. brewers to use the
Budweiser brand name fizzled out Monday when the Court of Appeal announced its
ruling: This Bud's for both of you.
</P>
<P>
	   The court battle originated back in 1911 when the Czech brewery sought to
expand sales into the United States using the Bud name.
</P>
<P>
	   The fight resumed in the 1970s when both companies began marketing their
products in Britain. Another round of litigation was triggered later in the
decade when the Czech firm successfully applied to register Bud as a trademark.
</P>
<P>
	   But despite the "danger of confusion" facing the beer-drinking public, three
Court of Appeal judges ruled that the names Budweiser and Bud belonged to both
breweries.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bud name originally came from a town in Bohemia, which was part of the
Austro-Hungarian empire, called Budwis. Budejovicky Budvar is the successor of a
brewing firm established there in 1895.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch Inc. set up its business in the United States
in the 19th century and began calling its beer Budweiser in 1875.

<HEADLINE> Top Assembly Democrats in spat over gubernatorial endorsement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - By backing a candidate for governor in the 2002
election, the majority leader of the state Assembly is forgetting that his
political "focus" should be on the 2000 elections, the Assembly speaker said
Monday.
<P>
	   Speaker Sheldon Silver said it is too early to worry about the governor's
race in 2002 with a president, congressional delegation and new state
Legislature to elect this November.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there has to be an appropriate focus on the year 2000," Silver said
in reference to the activities of Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver's comments served to confirm a report in Monday's New York Post of
tensions between Silver and Bragman over Bragman agreeing to be one of four
members of an advisory committee formed to promote state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall's candidacy for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post, citing unidentified sources, reported that Silver was miffed
Bragman didn't clear his participation on the committee with Silver, and also
annoyed that Bragman wasn't worrying more about the 2000 elections at this point
than on the next gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
	   Bragman said Monday evening that he had not discussed the issue with Silver.
</P>
<P>
	   "However, no one should question my focus or my support for Assembly
campaigns, for the campaign of Hillary Clinton or any other statewide race,"
Bragman said. "If anyone should do that, then it's correct to say that there
should be a rift between that person and me."
</P>
<P>
	   McCall and Andrew Cuomo, the federal housing secretary and son of former
Gov. Mario Cuomo, are considered the top possible Democratic candidates for
governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   As majority leader, Bragman is the No. 2 figure in the Assembly behind
Silver. Bragman serves as traffic cop for legislation as it moves onto the floor
of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Bragman, of upstate Onondaga County, and Silver, of Manhattan, have
worked together in their current posts for seven years in the Assembly, they
have never been particularly close and relations between the two have at other
times been strained.
</P>
<P>
	   Bragman was not present at a news conference Silver called Monday to unveil
a series of managed care-related bills. Silver said he assumed Bragman was
attending to other Assembly business.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked whether a "rift" had developed between himself and Bragman,
Silver said the only rift he knew about was the much-publicized falling out that
Republican Gov. George Pataki and Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, also a
Republican, have been experiencing.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver appeared uncomfortable when pressed about his relations with Bragman
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that is not a productive use of our time here," he told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Judge Throws Out Navajo Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT KELLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge scolded Reagan administration Interior
Secretary Donald Hodel for aiding a coal company in a dispute with the Navajo
Nation over coal royalties, but threw out the tribe's $600 million claim against
the government.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Court of Claims Judge Lawrence Baskir said that while Hodel's actions
betrayed the public trust, federal law did not explicitly require Hodel to act
in the Navajos' best interest.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navajo Nation, the largest U.S. Indian tribe, gets much of its money
from royalties for coal taken from its land. The tribe sued the federal
government in 1993 over the royalties paid by the Peabody Western Coal Co. for
coal from two reservation strip mines.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navajos and Peabody agreed in 1987 to a 12.5 percent royalty on the
coal, which fuels power plants in Arizona and Nevada that generate electricity
for Phoenix, Los Angeles and other cities. Previously, Peabody paid the tribe
37.5 cents per ton, or less than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the lawsuit, the tribe argued the Interior Department violated its
financial obligations to the Navajo by rejecting a proposed 20 percent royalty
on that coal. The tribe claims it would have gained $600 million had the 20
percent figure been used.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the tribe, Hodel met privately in 1985 with Stan Hulett, a
friend working for Peabody. Hodel then ordered subordinates to block a decision
on the 20 percent royalty proposal, sending the tribe and Peabody into talks
that led to the 12.5 percent figure.
</P>
<P>
	   Such private meetings, ``especially those that result in decisions worth
millions of dollars to the party with special access to high officials, betray
the public trust and transgress the high ideals of public service,'' Baskir
wrote in the decision issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said Hodel ``violated the most basic common law fiduciary duties
owed the Navajo Nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   But because the federal Indian Minerals Leasing Act did not require the
Interior Department to act in the tribe's best interests, the Navajos' lawsuit
must be thrown out, Baskir ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling does not affect a separate, $600 million lawsuit filed in U.S.
District Court filed by the Navajo Nation against Peabody over the same issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Hodel, who headed the Christian Coalition after leaving the Reagan
administration, did not return a telephone message seeking comment Monday. Lisa
DeMatteo, a spokeswoman for the Navajo Nation, declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton: I must get known on my own  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Having lived in the shadow of her husband's
presidency for seven years, Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday that like Vice
President Al Gore she must create an independent image to succeed as a
candidate.
<P>
	   "I think the vice president had to say to himself, 'Hey, I need to go out
and tell my story. People don't know anything about me,"' the newly official
Senate candidate said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press. 'I
learned the same thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also said that when people think about who to vote for in the Senate
race, they should consider that she is strongly in favor of abortion rights and
wouldn't vote to confirm known anti-abortion candidates for federal judgeships.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't imagine I would vote to confirm such a nominee," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, Clinton's expected Republican opponent, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who is also an abortion rights supporter, said he would not
rule out voting to confirm a judge who held anti-abortion views.
</P>
<P>
	   The interview came the day after Clinton announced her Senate candidacy and
during the start of a four-day campaign swing that was to take her to Buffalo,
Rochester, Syracuse and Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady told the AP that she did not know whether the president might
want to run again for elective office. There has been speculation that he might
someday want to run for the Senate himself, perhaps from his home state of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't say never to anything, but I think he's got lots of ideas about
things he wants to do. He wants to remain very active in the public debate here
in our country and around the world. ... But I don't know all that he would do
in the future," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   And, once again, Clinton sought to raise concerns about just how well the
blunt-spoken Giuliani would do in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't show up in the Senate and demand that your 99 colleagues do what
you tell them to do," she said. "You've got to be able to work with people one
day who you may disagree with the next day."
</P>
<P>
	   But asked directly if she felt Giuliani had the wrong temperament for the
Senate, she said: "That is a question that the people of New York will have to
ask themselves. I think I would be a very good senator for New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also implied that Giuliani couldn't necessarily be counted on to
maintain what has been his largely moderate record in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've seen it time and time again - people who claim to be independent, all
of a sudden vote with the Republican leadership because if they don't, they
don't get support raising funds for their campaigns, they don't get the
committee assignments that they want," she said. "That's just the way that party
operates."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's desire to step out of the shadow of her husband has been
increasingly obvious in recent weeks. For instance, her campaign literature and
her banners routinely refer to her simply as "Hillary" now.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just seems like the easiest way for me to quickly be identified," she
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "This may be a campaign between two, first-name candidates," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was an impression that I got that people were just unaware of how I
had spent my life before the White House and that there was also a similar gap
on awareness on what I had done in the White House," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you come out of the White House, where there really is one voice ...
no matter how much you do to help create positive results for the people as part
of that overall agenda, it's only appropriate that the American public wouldn't
know much about it," Clinton explained.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the first lady said she would only go so far to establish her
own identity beyond the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not moving to Nashville," she joked. "I moved to Chappaqua."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who did move his campaign headquarters to Nashville, put in a plug for
the first lady while campaigning Monday in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let's join together now to elect Hillary Rodham Clinton the next senator
from New York," Gore told cheering union members. "Your voice will be heard and
her vote will be cast for you."
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady also expressed a desire to have the independent counsel's
office that has been looking into Whitewater and other allegations of
impropriety against the Clintons wind up its work.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that everyone would have expected that after 6 1/2 years, thousands
upon thousands of documents and investigations and committee hearings, that they
would have reached their conclusion and I would hope that they do in an
efficacious manner," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Clinton said the ongoing probe still hanging over her and the
president was not having an impact on the way she is running her campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "That has nothing to do with any of my campaign decisions or how I'm trying
to present myself," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also said that win or lose, she plans to maintain the roots she
planted last month when she moved into the $1.7 million house she and the
president purchased in Chappaqua in suburban Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
	   "I look forward to spending years in that house," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   And what of the change from political supporter to candidate?
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to just get out there and have the experience. You have to be
ready to learn and work on yourself so you can be more effective. And I've been
doing all of that," she said. "It's exciting."

<HEADLINE> US, Russia OK Nuke Protection Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has agreed to give Russia an
additional $100 million to safeguard nuclear materials and conduct research in
return for Russia's promise to stop making plutonium from civilian reactor fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   Arms control advocates praised the agreement as a significant step toward
reducing the threat of nuclear proliferation and the first attempt to deal with
the huge volume of used fuel, and tons of weapons-grade plutonium, from Russia's
civilian reactors.
</P>
<P>
	   Some details of the agreement in principle remain to be worked out, and some
of the money for nuclear research is linked to Russia's ending its transfers of
nuclear technology to Iran, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson called the tentative agreement ``a very
exciting new initiative'' that will reduce the amount of Russian plutonium
exposed to potential theft or diversion.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress must approve the additional money, which was included in President
Clinton's fiscal year 2001 budget announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials estimate that Russia produces about 2 tons of plutonium a
year out of spent fuel from its 29 civilian reactors. It already has stockpiled
an estimated 30 tons of plutonium from the reactors.
</P>
<P>
	   While Russia has not promised to end reprocessing permanently, U.S.
officials said they hoped the moratorium would remain in effect for several
decades, giving time to develop a system to produce waste more difficult to
convert for weapons-making.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a good development. It doesn't solve the problem, but it's an
important step in the right direction,'' said Thomas Graham Jr., president of
the Lawyers Alliance for World Security, an arms control advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   Ernest Moniz, the undersecretary of energy who discussed the agreement with
Russian officials last week in Moscow, said, ``There is an agreement in
principle. We still have some work to do with regard to scope and scheduling''
and halt to reprocessing the civilian reactor waste.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the agreement, according to U.S. officials, the United States would
provide $45 million for more secure safeguarding of spent reactor fuel at Mayak,
a nuclear complex in the southern Urals, and $38 million to build a new dry-cask
storage facility for spent reactor fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   Another part of the accord calls for $25 million in long-term nuclear
research on a safer reactor and fuel cycle process. This money would be
contingent on an end to the Russian shipments to Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, a private
advocacy group, called the agreement ``a major achievement for U.S.
negotiators.'' But he said Russia still appears intent on stockpiling civilian
plutonium as well as some of its surplus military plutonium for eventual use in
civilian reactors.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia is believed to have as much as 150 tons of plutonium and nearly 1,000
tons of highly enriched uranium in warheads and stockpiled as surplus at dozens
of sites around the country, according to various U.S. estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a previous agreement the United States and Russia agreed to reduce
both their stockpiles of plutonium by 50 tons.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Russia is not believe to have given up on the use of plutonium as a
fuel in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Russians believe that plutonium is a national treasure,'' Graham said
in an interview. ``They believe that plutonium can be used to produce power
safely, and they want to see it used for that purpose.''
</P>
<P>
	   While highly enriched uranium from weapons can easily be blended down for
use in commercial reactors, Russia's surplus plutonium ``poses far more
difficult obstacles,'' concludes a recent study on proliferation problems posed
by Russia's nuclear materials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will inevitably be many years before all of (Russia's) excess plutonium
has been transformed into forms that are no longer directly usable in nuclear
weapons,'' the study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Targets Accounting Gimmicks  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In his new budget, President Clinton proposes undoing
some accounting gimmicks that White House and congressional bargainers used last
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   In the process, he uses the artifices for the second time in a few months,
easing spending next year by $10 billion without saving the government a dime.
</P>
<P>
	   As the two sides neared the end of talks last November for the fiscal 2000
budget, they had to save several billion dollars. So they relied on several
contrivances to make the numbers fit.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them was delaying a payday for military and some civilian federal
workers from late September of this year into early October. Since fiscal 2001
begins on Oct. 1, that had the effect of pushing $4.3 billion in spending into
fiscal 2001 -- freeing up money for fiscal 2000, the year they were working on
at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget Clinton sent Congress on Monday is for fiscal 2001. Needing some
savings for that year, he proposed moving the payday back into late September.
</P>
<P>
	   This would squeeze the $4.3 billion back into 2000. Since that year's budget
is completed, that's no longer a problem.
</P>
<P>
	   The process creates $4.3 billion of room for fiscal 2001, which is now the
focus of the budget-writers, even though the government would spend the exact
same amount of money. Only the timing of the expenditure is different.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's budget provides a table describing the shifts, saying they would
``restore traditional ... timing'' of the payments.
</P>
<P>
	   The same thing happened with payments due on some federal contracts. About
$1.8 billion of these payments, due this coming September, were pushed into
October by last fall's budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's budget would reverse the process, pushing the payments back into
2000 and freeing up $1.8 billion more for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton didn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1997 budget-balancing agreement between Clinton and Congress pushed
payment of $4 billion worth of veterans' and supplemental security income
benefits from next September into October.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's budget would shove them back into September again.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Clinton proposed pushing some Medicare payments the 1997 act
pushed from September 2002 into October 2002 back into September -- ``saving''
$4.5 billion for fiscal 2003, which begins Oct. 1, 2002.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Lebanon Air Strikes  </HEADLINE>
   By SAM F. GHATTAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes struck a guerrilla stronghold and
power stations across Lebanon early Tuesday, causing widespread blackouts in
apparent retaliation for Hezbollah attacks that killed four Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike came after a week of bloody attacks by the Muslim guerrillas and
graphic footage of wounded Israelis on the evening news in Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   The bloodshed prompted talk that Israel will speed up its withdrawal from
Lebanon, but it also created fears of increased violence near the Israel-Lebanon
border. Sirens ordered residents into shelters in Israeli border towns Monday,
and heavily armed troops reported to their commanders at border crossings.
</P>
<P>
	   Jets began concentrated attacks in Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, unleashing
several air-to-surface missiles and plunging the city immediately in darkness,
witnesses said. Planes also hit a power station in the mountains east of the
northern port city of Tripoli, and followed it with a strike on the Jamhour
substation on a hill overlooking Beirut. There was no word on casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Beirut, the Lebanese capital, was plunged into darkness soon after the raid
as Israeli jets roared over the city for about half an hour. A huge ball of
orange flame and clouds of smoke rose from the Beirut station.
</P>
<P>
	   The same station was hit twice before -- once in June, when Israel
previously punished Lebanon by targeting power stations, and once in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The impacts blew out windows and doors of apartments in Baalbek as jets
roared over the Shiite Muslim-populated city, also home to world-famous Roman
ruins. Soon after the second sortie, ground gunners opened up with anti-aircraft
fire on the raiding jets.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike came hours after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's Security
Cabinet ordered a ``harsh military response,'' according to a senior Israeli
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. In the past, that has signaled air
and artillery pounding of guerrilla targets in the strip Israel occupies in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who have harmed us, will be harmed,'' Barak said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   But Israeli officials' attention also turned to the longer-term impact of
the violence. Ministers in Barak's Cabinet said Monday it was becoming clear
that a withdrawal from Lebanon without Syria's agreement was likely.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1985, Israel established a buffer zone in south Lebanon to protect nearby
northern Israeli towns from guerrilla attacks. But Islamic Hezbollah guerrillas
have been fighting to drive the Israelis out ever since, and Barak said last
July 7 that Israel would withdraw within a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak had hoped a pullout would be through an agreement with Syria, the main
power broker in Lebanon. But Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down last month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no point in waiting until July, unless someone thinks that by
then we can achieve an agreement (with Syria),'' said Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
Barak's tourism minister and one of his lead Syria negotiators.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak's Police Minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, said Israelis should not rule out
an earlier withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Some warned that a unilateral withdrawal would be counterproductive,
bringing the Hezbollah within firing range of the Israeli towns arrayed along
the border.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's easy to call for a unilateral withdrawal when you don't consider what
will happen the next day among the northern border communities,'' said
opposition Likud lawmaker Silvan Shalom.
</P>
<P>
	   But the dramatic details of the latest deaths and grisly footage of the
fighting raised public pressure on Barak to make good on his promise to get out.
This week and last, four Israeli soldiers and a senior officer in the
Israel-allied South Lebanese Army died in Hezbollah attacks. On Sunday, a medic
was killed while he was tending to three soldiers wounded in earlier firing.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Barak significantly dropped the clause ``with an agreement'' when
he repeated his pledge to meet the deadline. He also blames Syria for not
restraining -- possibly even encouraging -- the Iranian-backed Hezbollah's
intensified attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Strikes like the one Israel launched early Tuesday usually invite guerrilla
retaliation in the form of katyusha rockets aimed at northern border towns. As
soon as the army ordered people into shelters Monday night, residents fled the
oft-hit town of Kiryat Shmona in convoys.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech timed for prime-time newscasts, Barak told Israelis that they
would have to ``bite their lips in determination'' to meet the July deadline --
a warning that further violence was ahead.

<HEADLINE> Porsche Asks EU To Block BMW Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- Porsche AG has asked the European Commission to
block a multimillion-dollar rescue package worked out last year between German
rival BMW AG and the British government to save the money-losing Rover operation
in Britain, a Porsche spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Board chairman Wendelin Wiedeking sent a letter to the commission last
summer after the deal involving $227 million in government subsidies was
announced, spokesman Manfred Ayasse said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't make sense when one company gets subsidies and another doesn't,"
Ayasse said, noting that Porsche has never asked for or accepted state aid.
</P>
<P>
	   A BMW spokesman in Munich said the automaker expected the European Union
Commission to approve the deal. A decision on whether it is compatible with EU
competition rules is expected this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Including the state aid, BMW plans to invest $1.13 billion in Rover's
Longbridge plant in Birmingham, Britain's biggest car factory.
</P>
<P>
	   If the European Commission does not pass judgment by summer, BMW said it
would have to reassess its plans and possibly invest in an alternative plant in
Hungary, a country outside the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   According to EU competition laws, Britain must prove that without its
subsidies, BMW will take its money outside the 15 countries comprising the
union.

<HEADLINE> SEC Seeks $150M To Fight Web Fraud  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission, in an uphill
fight against burgeoning fraud over the Internet, is seeking $150 million for
enforcement work and investor education and another $15 million to pay its
attorneys and other professionals above government rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The market watchdog agency has lost 25 percent of its attorneys, accountants
and examiners in the past two years to lucrative jobs in private practice. For
lawyers, many of those jobs now have become even more seductive as big law firms
have offered huge pay raises to compete with high-tech companies providing
bigger salaries and juicy stock options.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposals sent to Congress on Monday are part of the SEC's $422.8
million budget request for fiscal 2001, up 12 percent from the current spending
level of $377 million for the 3,200-person agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC "has made great progress in fighting fraud on the Internet," said
Richard Walker, the agency's enforcement director. "Additional funds from
Congress will enable us to detect violations better and bring even more cases."
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC and state regulators are battling a new form of investment fraud
that has been proliferating in Internet junk mail, online newsletters,
electronic "chat rooms" and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the Internet is everywhere, unscrupulous stock promoters anywhere in
the world can cloak themselves in anonymity and lure investors across the
country, who have lost millions in such schemes in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the SEC sued a man who calls himself Tokyo Joe -- a flamboyant,
self-proclaimed stock expert with a Web site and an investment club -- for
allegedly defrauding investors by failing to tell them he was selling the same
stocks he was advising them to buy.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo Joe's attorney has said he will contest the allegations in court.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the SEC's first enforcement action against a well-known Internet
guru, but it followed several nationwide "sweeps" by the agency against online
investment fraud involving relatively minor companies and individuals.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC is seeking new funds to add 15 people to its enforcement division.
Many of them would join the "Cyberforce" team, now some 240 strong, which prowls
the Internet on the lookout for investment scams and other securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   While SEC fraud-fighters do conduct Internet surveillance, they don't have
the legal authority to go undercover online. Unlike the Justice Department, the
SEC cannot put anyone in jail; it can only file civil lawsuits against suspected
violators.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC said Monday it also will continue to go after financial accounting
fraud by publicly traded companies. It has recently accused some corporations of
manipulating their earnings to meet Wall Street analysts' projections.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, the SEC accused 68 people and companies -- including Hall of
Fame quarterback and Atlanta businessman Fran Tarkenton -- of accounting fraud
in the first nationwide "sweep" against inflating earnings and other alleged
reporting misconduct.
</P>
<P>
	   The $15 million in "special pay" the SEC is seeking for attorneys,
accountants and examiners, a premium of about 10 percent over government rates,
would put the SEC employees closer to their counterparts at the federal bank
regulatory agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., for example, pays attorneys at the
so-called GS-12 level with a couple of years of experience about $91,000,
compared with around $66,000 at the same level at the SEC.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress shot down in 1998 a proposal by SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt to pay
$7 million in bonuses, representing as much as 20 percent of salaries, to get
people to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   The steady drain of talent in recent years has included several high-level
SEC officials, including Richard Lindsey, the former director of market
regulation; former enforcement director William McLucas and his deputy, Colleen
Mahoney; ex-chief accountant Michael Sutton; Barry Barbash, formerly the top
official overseeing the mutual fund industry; and Brian Lane, former director of
the corporation finance division.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 58.01; New Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks diverged in familiar fashion Monday, with technology
shares leading the Nasdaq composite index higher for a sixth straight session
while blue-chip industrials slumped.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rose 77.63 to 4,321.77, coasting past its previous record of
4,244.14, set Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 58.01 to 10,905.79, and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 slipped 0.13 to 1,424.24.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq, dominated by technology stocks, has risen nearly 6 percent so
far this year, while the blue-chip Dow industrial average has fallen more than 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very fragmented market, and you can understand why," said Larry
Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities. "The cyclicals have run out of
gas and tech remains all the rage."
</P>
<P>
	   General Electric, down 5 1/16 to 136 1/2, and Boeing, down 2 3/16 to 41
13/16, contributed most to the Dow's decline.
</P>
<P>
	   An overall weakness in the Dow's industrial and financial components held
the blue-chip index lower despite a big gain by Hewlett-Packard. The computer
maker soared 10 1/2 to 128 1/2 after a Lehman Brothers analyst said the company
is poised to benefit from Ford Motor Co.'s plan to distribute Internet-ready
computers to its employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Campbell, chief investment officer at The Commerce Funds in St. Louis,
said fears that interest rates will rise sharply this year are weighing heavily
on investors' minds, pressuring the vast majority of stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to be a much tougher year for the equity markets," he said.
"Many stocks have reached very, very high valuations, and rising interest rates
are going to make many investors wonder if they're worth their high prices."
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates are generally bad for stocks because they cut into
corporate profits by making it more expensive to borrow money. Traditionally,
companies that place a high premium on growth are most vulnerable to higher
rates.
</P>
<P>
	   But so far this year, investors have determined that a handful of leading
technology companies are growing quickly enough to outrun interest rates. Cisco
Systems, Applied Materials and Apple Computer, strong performers in recent
weeks, all rose on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco, scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday, rose 4 1/16 to 125 3/16;
Applied Materials rose 8 1/4 to 153 5/8; and Apple gained 6 1/16 to 114 1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   "When there's a dearth of news, investors are deciding to play what works,"
Wachtel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug stocks were mostly higher after Pfizer and Warner-Lambert Co. resolved
their bruising, three-month takeover battle. Pfizer will pay $92.3 billion in
stock to acquire Warner-Lambert, creating the world's second largest
pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer rose 1 to 36 3/4 and Warner-Lambert gained 2 3/4 to 97 5/16. American
Home Products, which had also conducted merger talks with Warner-Lambert,
advanced 2 15/16 to 48 7/16. The company will be paid $1.8 billion -- the
largest breakup fee in history -- to sever its contract with Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   While shares of high-tech companies dominated buying on Wall Street,
investors received several reminders of the fragility of technology. Brokerage
Charles Schwab Corp. said clients experienced intermittent problems using the
company's Web site Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Search engine provider Yahoo! said its Web site also experienced service
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, technical problems related to a software upgrade forced the
Chicago Board Options Exchange to halt trading for about two and a half hours.
The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were unaffected.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, advancing issues led by a 5-to-4 margin.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume composite volume totaled 1.13 billion shares, compared with 1.28
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.87 to 532.39.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.0 percent. Germany's Xetra DAX
index fell 2.0 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.1 percent, and France's
CAC-40 fell 1.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Plane Negotiations Continue  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BARR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Authorities held ``fairly calm and businesslike''
negotiations over long hours Monday with apparent Afghan dissidents holding a
planeload of at least 150 people hostage at an airport outside London.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials did not disclose what political demands, if any, the hijackers put
forth. But a diplomat familiar with earlier negotiations when the airliner
landed in Moscow said those holding the plane sought to free a prisoner held in
the Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghan media speculated the hijackers were dissidents who sought the release
of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor who has been held since 1997 by
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement. Khan is a member of Afghanistan's
opposition alliance, which still rules roughly 10 percent of the war-shattered
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Once in Britain, the hijackers requested only food, water, unspecified
medical supplies and that the lavatories on the Afghan state-run Ariana Airlines
plane be emptied, said John Broughton, assistant chief constable of the Essex
Police.
</P>
<P>
	   He characterized the negotiations, conducted in English, as ``fairly calm
and businesslike'' and said authorities were patiently working toward a peaceful
solution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Negotiations remain our favorite option,'' said Joe Edwards, another
assistant chief constable. ``I will say it could be a very protracted technique.
It could go on for days.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said that eight captives released Monday at Stansted, Britain's
designated airport for handling hijackings, ``tell us they were very
well-treated while they were onboard.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mohammad Bashir Mahal, one of 10 passengers set free in Moscow, said at a
news conference Monday there were eight hijackers, and they appeared to be
Afghan because of their language and clothes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were all young -- around 25-30 years old, dressed in traditional
Afghan costume -- and to begin with they were threatening,'' he said. ``But
slowly, their aggression subsided and they treated us quite well. No one was
beaten or insulted. Relations were good.''
</P>
<P>
	   Half of those released in Moscow were old or ailing men and the other half
young men, since Afghan tradition calls for every elderly or sick person to be
accompanied by a young person, the hostages said.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's NTV television quoted another freed hostage, who wasn't further
identified, as saying that passengers did not pass through a metal detector
before they boarded the flight. The man said that 20 minutes after the plane
took off, he heard a sound and turned around and saw the eight armed hijackers,
who calmly asked the passengers to put their hands on their heads.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 727 was seized shortly after takeoff early Sunday on a domestic
Ariana flight from the Afghan capital, Kabul, to the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
	   Before landing early Monday at Stansted, about 25 miles north of London, the
hijackers had freed 22 hostages in return for supplies during earlier stops in
Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said they could not confirm the nationalities of what were
believed to be 157 hostages remaining on the airliner. They disclosed that one
passenger has a serious kidney illness, but said they did not know if that
person was among those released.
</P>
<P>
	   As night fell, the plane remained parked about a half-mile from Stansted's
main terminal, which still managed to operate at more than 80 percent capacity
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broughton said it wasn't Britain's policy ``to allow aircraft to take off
again once landed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban said it would neither negotiate nor agree to
the demands of the hijackers. A statement issued by the religious militia's
supreme leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, accused the head of an anti-Taliban
alliance, Ahmed Shah Massood, of masterminding the hijacking. The Taliban
provided no evidence, however.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are watching this closely, waiting to hear what the demands are,''
Taliban Foreign Ministry spokesman Faiz Ahmed Faiz said in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Afghanistan and Britain do not have diplomatic relations, Faiz said a
Taliban representative in London was in contact with British authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The Afghan opposition has denied any involvement in the seizure of the
plane. It faxed a formal statement to The Associated Press saying it ``adamantly
condemns the hijacking.''
</P>
<P>
	   An emergency official in Kazakstan said 20 hijackers were aboard, but the
passengers released there said eight to 10 hijackers were aboard.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Smoking Tax Hike  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Smokers, corporate America and promoters of abusive tax
shelters would see $181 billion in tax increases over 10 years under the budget
outlined Monday by President Clinton. The plan also envisions $351 billion in
tax cuts targeted at the middle class.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has previously rejected many of the tax increases, but they would
allow Clinton to use less of the projected surplus for tax cuts than measures
proposed by Republicans on Capitol Hill or the leading GOP presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's economic advisers say using too much of the surplus for tax cuts
jeopardizes other priorities including Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to make tough choices,'' said Jack Lew, director of the White
House Office of Management and Budget. ``If the tax cut grows, it's going to
push something else out.''
</P>
<P>
	   GOP lawmakers contend taxpayers should get back a bigger chunk of the
surplus. The House this week plans to begin considering a 10-year, $182 billion
plan to cut taxes for married couples, including those who pay more than they
would if they were single.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I guarantee that Republicans in Congress will strongly oppose the
president's $181 billion tax hike,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee. ``It is amazing to me that after all these
years, President Clinton still cannot resist his urge to raise taxes on the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Clinton left the plan open to GOP political attack by phasing in
the tax relief slowly, leading to net tax increases in fiscal 2001 of $9 billion
and fiscal 2002 of $1 billion, according to budget documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Clinton's proposed tax increases, which total $181 billion over 10
years:
</P>
<P>
	   --A 25-cents-a-pack increase in the federal cigarette tax, raising $66
billion over 10 years. It is less than half the 55-cent tax Clinton advocated
last year, which Congress ignored. The $66 billion total also includes proposed
fines on tobacco manufacturers of $3,000 for each teen-age smoker if teen
smoking isn't cut in half by 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   --New limits and penalties on corporate tax shelters, raising $23 billion
over 10 years. Firms that market tax shelters could be penalized with a 25
percent tax and the current penalty for corporate underreporting of income would
rise from 20 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --New restrictions on corporations that deal in ``identified tax havens,''
usually foreign countries with a friendly or nonexistent tax law, including new
penalties on companies that fail to report their business in those places.
</P>
<P>
	   --Dozens of tax increases on businesses and various corporate transactions
that would raise more than $80 billion over 10 years, including a $14 billion
increase on insurance companies, a 5-cent-a-barrel oil tax to pay for spill
cleanups, taxes on trade associations' investment income over $10,000 and
reinstatement of a tax on oil and chemical companies to pay for Superfund
cleanups.
</P>
<P>
	   Major elements of the president's 10-year tax cut plan were released earlier
this year, including $45 billion in relief from the ``marriage penalty,'' $54
billion from new retirement savings accounts, and $32.7 billion in relief for
the middle class from the alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's plan also includes numerous middle-class tax credits or deductions
for child care, long-term health care, charitable giving, college costs, school
construction and inner-city development.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are targeted at the income ranges, the activities, that are engaged
in by the vast majority of American families,'' said Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers.
</P>
<P>
	   Counting all the tax increases, Clinton's net tax relief amounts to about
$170 billion over 10 years. That is far less than the $483 billion over five
years advocated by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, or the $237 billion over five
years proposed by Arizona Sen. John McCain, both seeking the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration put its net tax relief number at $254 billion over 10
years, arguing that revenue raisers are ``user fees'' for specific industries
and that the tobacco tax hike's intent is to curb smoking, not raise money. Seen
in that light, Clinton's revenue offsets would total $96 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress, meanwhile, is contemplating a variety of tax cuts that total more
than Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also asked Congress to increase the Internal Revenue Service budget
by 9 percent to $8.8 billion. About $400 million would be used to hire 1,600
employees to improve customer service and reverse a sharp decline in enforcement
actions and audits, and to replenish an account for the IRS computer system
overhaul.

<HEADLINE> Deutch Clearances Face Review  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is examining whether to end all security
clearances for former CIA director John Deutch, Defense Secretary William Cohen
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen acknowledged for the first time that Deutch has maintained access to
``some top-secret information in terms of a narrow area of technology,'' even
though the CIA revoked his clearances at the agency last summer because he had
kept classified documents on a home computer.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon's inspector general has now asked the CIA for its evidence on
Deutch's security breaches, Cohen said at a news conference. ``I think it should
have been done sooner, but it was not,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the CIA apparently had offered no information about Deutch
previously, so his industrial security clearance at the Pentagon was not
reviewed. Limited industrial clearances are normally given to defense
contractors.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said the Pentagon revoked Deutch's broad security clearances last
August, including access to the Defense Intelligence Agency, the nation's main
military intelligence service. But as a defense industry consultant, Deutch
retained limited clearances, Cohen said. He said taking them away would require
a legal determination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There must be a compelling level of evidence that would support removing
him from income-producing activities,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Department lawyers will have to decide whether the evidence against
him is ``sufficient that we can, with due-process, terminate the relationship,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before becoming CIA director, Deutch had served as deputy secretary of
defense from 1994 to 1995. He now acts as a consultant for several organizations
with defense contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said he has no evidence Deutch had compromised any Pentagon
intelligence or operations in his activities. He described Deutch as ``fairly
aggressive in his work habits in working long hours, and I assume that had
something to do with'' his taking work home. But he said the Pentagon had not
determined whether he had done that with defense documents.
</P>
<P>
	   After news reports Saturday that Deutch retained industrial security
clearances at the Pentagon, the Defense Department inspector general contacted
the CIA to provide evidence to help determine whether all Deutch's clearances
can be dropped, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The industrial clearance allows Deutch, a professor at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, to serve as a paid consultant on defense contracts with
the MIT, SAIC Corp. and Raytheon Corp., Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Porter Goss, R-Fla.,
expressed surprise Monday that Deutch had kept his Pentagon security clearances
even after having his CIA ones revoked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that the removal of access to sensitive material should apply
universally,'' Goss said in an interview.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Kosovo Taught Lessons  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Allied forces demonstrated ``unrivaled military prowess''
in the NATO action against Kosovo, a Pentagon report concluded Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   But the report says the conflict taught some lessons that may require
changes in doctrine, training, organization and technology.
</P>
<P>
	   In a detailed review of the 78-day air war that ended last June with Serb
forces driven out of the Yugoslav province, the Pentagon said the conflict
pointed to needed improvements in U.S. precision warfare capabilities. Some
portions of the report sent to Congress remained classified.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We forced Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, degraded
his ability to wage military operations and rescued over 1 million refugees,''
Defense Secretary William Cohen said in the report's introduction.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the NATO campaign ensured the stability of Eastern Europe, thwarted
ethnic cleansing and ensured NATO's credibility.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, which accompanied the department's 2001 fiscal budget proposals,
outlines enhancements already planned for precision strike, electronic warfare,
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The harshest self-criticism in the report is on one of the biggest U.S.
errors: bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, which killed three Chinese.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a result of a failure in the process of identifying and validating
proposed targets,'' it said, adding that methods used were ``severely flawed.''
The report said immediate corrective actions were taken, however.
</P>
<P>
	   The report covers relations with Russia and considerations of a ground
option but offers no new details on the depth of concern over Russia's
opposition to the campaign or the debates within NATO over whether to use ground
forces.
</P>
<P>
	   It notes that the operation was conducted without a single combat fatality
among the 19 nations allied against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This achievement cannot be expected in every future conflict,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report contained no assessment of civilian or Serb casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Cohen said Monday he has no basis for judging the accuracy of a
Human Rights Watch report claiming 500 civilian casualties in the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Based on what I have seen, just a summary of that report, it seems to me
it does in fact expose Milosevic and his propaganda machine for the deceit that
they were perpetrating at that time, saying that there were 5,000 or more who
had been killed by this,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said every recommended target was reviewed to avoid unnecessary civilian
casualties. ``We don't want to see any innocent people harmed, and we took
extraordinary care to achieve those results,'' Cohen said.

<HEADLINE> Catholic Leader Hume Appeals To IRA  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's most respected Catholic
politician appealed Monday for the Irish Republican Army to give up a cache of
its most powerful explosives, saying such a gesture was needed to prevent the
province's government from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
	   John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, sought to
resolve the crisis that is threatening Northern Ireland's Catholic-Protestant
administration after just two months in power.
</P>
<P>
	   Hume said the U.S.-brokered peace deal that got the administration formed
also created expectations the IRA would start to disarm. The outlawed group has
so far refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I now appeal to the IRA to show their deep respect for the will of the
Irish people,'' Hume said in remarks published by the Irish News, Northern
Ireland's main Catholic newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ask them to demonstrate for all to see their patriotism and desire to
move the situation forward by strengthening the peace process through beginning,
voluntarily, the process of decommissioning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He called on the IRA to hand over some Semtex, the Czech-made plastic
explosive the group has particularly prized since receiving several tons of it
from Libya in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   But the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party rebuffed the message. Sinn Fein chairman
Mitchel McLaughlin said Hume normally demonstrated ``great sensitivity and
judgment'' -- but that it would be ``hard to imagine a more inappropriate moment
to make that particular suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hume's IRA appeal came hours after dissident IRA members bombed a rural
hotel in Irvinestown, 90 miles west of Belfast. No one was injured in Sunday's
blast, but the attack was bitter reminder of the days the province is struggling
to leave behind.
</P>
<P>
	   The Continuity IRA, a dissident splinter group that claimed responsibility
for the bombing, answered Hume by threatening further violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We intend to continue to progress our war effort regardless of how British
rule in the six occupied counties is remodeled,'' the group said in a statement
Monday, referring to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   The province's major British Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, has
threatened to withdraw from Northern Ireland's Cabinet if the IRA does not begin
to surrender its weapons. It has scheduled a meeting for Saturday to debate the
issue.
</P>
<P>
	   That has left the British government with a choice -- to watch the Cabinet
collapse outright, or try to keep it intact by rendering it powerless.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair's government announced it intends to
push legislation through the House of Commons on Tuesday. That would enable
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson to revoke the Cabinet's
authority and resume so-called ``direct rule'' from London on Friday, as he has
already said he intends to do.
</P>
<P>
	   Hume, who shared the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize with Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble, is considered a prime architect of the peace process that
produced the Good Friday peace accord in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   That pact proposed that the power-sharing Cabinet be buoyed by gradual
paramilitary disarmament. But since it did not link the two goals explicitly,
the Ulster Unionists spent more than a year demanding a start to IRA disarmament
before they would share power with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
	   The breakthrough brokered in November by American diplomat George Mitchell
required the Ulster Unionists to accept Sinn Fein before the IRA would open
negotiations with the disarmament commission. The commission issued its first
detailed report about that secret dialogue Jan. 31 -- and confirmed no concrete
progress had been made.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Defense Minister Killed  </HEADLINE>
   By JOVANA GEC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia's defense minister was fatally shot
Monday in a Belgrade restaurant, the latest and the highest-ranking victim in a
spate of gangland-style killings.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic, a loyal aide to President Slobodan
Milosevic, died at the Belgrade military hospital where he was taken after being
shot in the dining area of the soccer club Rad, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Montenegrin police said the gunman fired through a window of the restaurant,
hitting Bulatovic; the restaurant's owner, Mirko Knezevic; and banker Vuk
Obradovic from behind with automatic weapon fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Knezevic and Obradovic were slightly wounded, police said in a statement
carried by the official Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yugoslav government, which met for an urgent session, said in a
statement that Bulatovic ``was the victim of a classic terrorist act'' and
pledged to fight against ``terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agency said an urgent government session
was called for later Monday to discuss the assassination.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack came less than a month after Serbia's most infamous warlord,
Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan, was gunned down in a Belgrade hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a dozen prominent people, some close to Milosevic, have been
killed in Belgrade in the past decade. Most of the killings have never been
solved, and the killers remain at large.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the shooting, the area where Bulatovic sat at a corner table
was covered with blood and the floor was littered with debris. Pieces of plates
and broken glass were scattered around. Bullet holes were seen on the walls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bullets were shot from the outside, through the window, a few rounds
of fire,'' said waiter Andrija Jecmenica.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic, 52, had been defense minister of Yugoslavia since 1994. Bulatovic
was largely a figurehead minister, with all the major decisions being made by
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   From 1992 to 1994, Bulatovic served as Yugoslav interior minister in the
government of Milan Panic, a Serb-born businessman who was sacked by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic was a member of a pro-Serb faction in Montenegro loyal to
Milosevic and his Socialist Peoples Party is at odds with the Montenegrin
pro-Western government of President Milo Djukanovic. Yugoslavia is made up of
two republics, Serbia and the smaller Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
	   Miodrag Vlahovic, a political analyst in Montenegro's capital Podgorica,
said the killing of Bulatovic could be the result of a ``conflict of interest''
concerning business arrangements among top Yugoslav officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic was very close to Momir Bulatovic, the Yugoslav premier and close
ally of Milosevic. The two were not related.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The country in which the defense minister is killed like that in a
restaurant is a real banana republic, there is no doubt about that,'' Vlahovic
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic is survived by his wife and two children.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Lebanon Air Strikes  </HEADLINE>
   By SAM F. GHATTAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes struck a guerrilla stronghold and
power stations across Lebanon early Tuesday, causing widespread blackouts in
apparent retaliation for Hezbollah attacks that killed four Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike came after a week of bloody attacks by the Muslim guerrillas and
graphic footage of wounded Israelis on the evening news in Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   The bloodshed prompted talk that Israel will expedite a planned withdrawal
from Lebanon, but it also created fears of increased violence near the
Israel-Lebanon border. Sirens ordered residents into shelters in Israeli border
towns Monday, and heavily armed troops reported to their commanders at border
crossings.
</P>
<P>
	   Jets began concentrated attacks in Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, unleashing
several air-to-surface missiles and plunging the city immediately in darkness,
witnesses said. Planes also hit a power station in the mountains east of the
northern port city of Tripoli, and followed it with a strike on the Jamhour
substation on a hill overlooking Beirut. There was no word on casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Beirut, the Lebanese capital, was plunged into darkness soon after the raid
as Israeli jets roared over the city for about half an hour. A huge ball of
orange flame and clouds of smoke rose from the Beirut station.
</P>
<P>
	   The same station was hit twice before -- once in June, when Israel
previously punished Lebanon by targeting power stations, and once in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The impacts blew out windows and doors of apartments in Baalbek as jets
roared over the Shiite Muslim-populated city, also home to world-famous Roman
ruins. Soon after the second sortie, ground gunners opened up with anti-aircraft
fire on the raiding jets.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army said the attacks on three power plants in Lebanon were in
response to ``the severe escalation in the activities of Hezbollah and other
organizations in south Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who have harmed us, will be harmed,'' Barak said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   But Israeli officials' attention also turned to the longer-term impact of
the violence. Ministers in Barak's Cabinet said Monday it was becoming clear
that a withdrawal from Lebanon without Syria's agreement was likely.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1985, Israel established a buffer zone in south Lebanon to protect nearby
northern Israeli towns from guerrilla attacks. But Islamic Hezbollah guerrillas
have been fighting to drive the Israelis out ever since, and Barak said last
July 7 that Israel would withdraw within a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak had hoped a pullout would be through an agreement with Syria, the main
power broker in Lebanon. But Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down last month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no point in waiting until July, unless someone thinks that by
then we can achieve an agreement (with Syria),'' said Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
Barak's tourism minister and one of his lead Syria negotiators.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak's Police Minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, said Israelis should not rule out
an earlier withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Some warned that a unilateral withdrawal would be counterproductive,
bringing the Hezbollah within firing range of the Israeli towns arrayed along
the border.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's easy to call for a unilateral withdrawal when you don't consider what
will happen the next day among the northern border communities,'' said
opposition Likud lawmaker Silvan Shalom.
</P>
<P>
	   But the dramatic details of the latest deaths and grisly footage of the
fighting raised public pressure on Barak to make good on his promise to get out.
This week and last, four Israeli soldiers and a senior officer in the
Israel-allied South Lebanese Army died in Hezbollah attacks. On Sunday, a medic
was killed while he was tending to three soldiers wounded in earlier firing.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Barak significantly dropped the clause ``with an agreement'' when
he repeated his pledge to meet the deadline. He also blames Syria for not
restraining -- possibly even encouraging -- the Iranian-backed Hezbollah's
intensified attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Strikes like the one Israel launched early Tuesday usually invite guerrilla
retaliation in the form of Katyusha rockets aimed at northern border towns. As
soon as the army ordered people into shelters Monday night, residents fled the
oft-hit town of Kiryat Shmona in convoys. The army warned that an attack on
Israeli territory would lead to a ``harsh reaction from Israel.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech timed for prime-time newscasts, Barak told Israelis that they
would have to ``bite their lips in determination'' to meet the July deadline --
a warning that further violence was ahead.

<HEADLINE> One dead, one wounded in Westchester Community College shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   VALHALLA, N.Y. (AP) - A man in the midst of a breakup with his
18-year-old girlfriend accosted her in a college hallway Monday, shot her in the
head as she tried to get away, then shot and killed himself as he ran off across
the snow-covered campus.
<P>
	   "His hand went up, then his head went back. He was still running, then he
fell," said Rayvon Miller of Greenburgh, a student who witnessed the suicide at
Westchester Community College.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting was the first in the 54-year history of the college, said
Julius Ford, vice president of student services.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not really what you expect when you go to school," said Louis Ramirez,
a student from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   The wounded woman, who lives in Mount Vernon but whose name was not made
public, was listed in critical condition at the Westchester Medical Center.
Detective William Rehm of the Westchester County police said, however, that her
gunshot wound - from a bullet that glanced off her temple - did not appear to be
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
	   Rehm said the woman was in a first-floor hallway of the Academic Arts
building at about 12:15 p.m. when the man, identified only as a Yonkers man in
his 20s who was not a student, confronted her.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was an ongoing prior relationship," Rehm said. "We have reason to
believe that that relationship may have been terminated by one party or the
other."
</P>
<P>
	   They argued and she tried to leave, Rehm said, but he followed and "she
obviously felt threatened. ... She went for the first open door she came to."
</P>
<P>
	   Just as she was going through the door, the man grabbed her from behind and
fired one shot from a handgun. She fell into the room, where a staff member and
a student had been meeting, and they shut the door behind her. The bullet that
glanced off her head was found embedded in the door, Rehm said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Closing the door was good thinking on their part," the detective said. "It
ended the assault and forced the perpetrator to leave."
</P>
<P>
	   The attacker ran off along campus pathways and was near the school's
Classroom Building when he shot himself. Blood marked the snow where he fell,
the gun still in his hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Don Gregory, a journalism teacher who walked by the body soon after the
suicide, called the experience "surrealistic."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a numbing sensation to see someone lying there. ... You feel despair
at not knowing what to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said classes were not interrupted for the 20,500 students, but campus
exits were sealed for half an hour until police concluded that the dead man was
the only attacker.
</P>
<P>
	   The school offered a telephone hotline for worried parents and counseling
for any students troubled by the shootings.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said the building where the first shooting occurred is patrolled by one
unarmed guard. The school will eventually review security, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack followed a likely murder-suicide at Columbia University. Police
believe former student Thomas G. Nelford slashed his girlfriend's throat
Saturday, killing Kathleen Roskot, a 19-year-old sophomore. Nelford then jumped
in front of a subway train a few hours after her body was discovered.

<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The weekend's $34.7 million debut of "Scream 3" was the
biggest film opening on record in a January-April period.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation aimed at ending sweatshop labor by immigrants
working in the Northern Mariana Islands passed the Senate Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would replace local immigration laws
for the U.S. territory in the Pacific with federal immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Many lawmakers have also expressed concern that the Northern Mariana Islands
have become a haven for clothing industry sweatshops where workers are paid
below the federal minimum wage. Their concern comes amid allegations from
activist groups that some workers are indentured laborers forced to work against
their will.
</P>
<P>
	   Island officials have fought to keep immigration laws under local control.
</P>
<P>
	   The islands' garment industry exports about $1 billion in consumer goods to
American clothing stores like Gap and Tommy Hilfiger.

	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Authorities held ``fairly calm and businesslike''
negotiations over long hours Monday with apparent Afghan dissidents holding a
planeload of at least 150 people hostage at an airport outside London.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials did not disclose what political demands, if any, the hijackers put
forth. But a diplomat familiar with earlier negotiations when the airliner
landed in Moscow said those holding the plane sought to free a prisoner held in
the Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghan media speculated the hijackers were dissidents who sought the release
of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor who has been held since 1997 by
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement. Khan is a member of Afghanistan's
opposition alliance, which still rules roughly 10 percent of the war-shattered
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Once in Britain, the hijackers requested only food, water, unspecified
medical supplies and that the lavatories on the Afghan state-run Ariana Airlines
plane be emptied, said John Broughton, assistant chief constable of the Essex
Police.
</P>
<P>
	   He characterized the negotiations, conducted in English, as ``fairly calm
and businesslike'' and said authorities were patiently working toward a peaceful
solution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Negotiations remain our favorite option,'' said Joe Edwards, another
assistant chief constable. ``I will say it could be a very protracted technique.
It could go on for days.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said that eight captives released Monday at Stansted, Britain's
designated airport for handling hijackings, ``tell us they were very
well-treated while they were onboard.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday at a news conference in Moscow, one of 10 passengers set free
there, Mohammad Bashir Mahal, said there were eight hijackers, and they appeared
to be Afghani because of their language and clothes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were all young -- around 25-30 years old, dressed in traditional
Afghan costume -- and to begin with they were threatening,'' he said in Pashtu,
the principal language of Afghanistan. ``But slowly, their aggression subsided
and they treated us quite well. No one was beaten or insulted. Relations were
good.''
</P>
<P>
	   Half of those released in Moscow were old or ailing men and the other half
young men, since Afghan tradition calls for every elderly or sick person to be
accompanied by a young person, the hostages said.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's NTV television quoted another freed hostage, who wasn't further
identified, as saying that passengers did not pass through a metal detector
before they boarded the flight. The man said that 20 minutes after the plane
took off, he heard a sound and turned around and saw the eight armed hijackers,
who calmly asked the passengers to put their hands on their heads.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 727 was seized shortly after takeoff early Sunday on a domestic
Ariana flight from the Afghan capital, Kabul, to the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
	   Before landing early Monday at Stansted, about 25 miles north of London, the
hijackers had freed 22 hostages in return for supplies during earlier stops in
Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said they could not confirm the nationalities of what were
believed to be 157 hostages remaining on the airliner. They disclosed that one
passenger has a serious kidney illness, but said they did not know if that
person was among those released.
</P>
<P>
	   As night fell, the plane remained parked about a half-mile from Stansted's
main terminal, which still managed to operate at more than 80 percent capacity
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broughton said it wasn't Britain's policy ``to allow aircraft to take off
again once landed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban said it would neither negotiate nor agree to
the demands of the hijackers. A statement issued by the religious militia's
supreme leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, accused the head of an anti-Taliban
alliance, Ahmed Shah Massood, of masterminding the hijacking. The Taliban
provided no evidence, however.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are watching this closely, waiting to hear what the demands are,''
Taliban Foreign Ministry spokesman Faiz Ahmed Faiz said in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Afghanistan and Britain do not have diplomatic relations, Faiz said a
Taliban representative in London was in contact with British authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The Afghan opposition has denied any involvement in the seizure of the
plane. It faxed a formal statement to The Associated Press saying it ``adamantly
condemns the hijacking.''
</P>
<P>
	   An emergency official in Kazakstan said 20 hijackers were aboard, but the
passengers released there said eight to 10 hijackers were aboard.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's budget funds defense projects  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Clinton's budget request for fiscal year
2001 includes billions of dollars for submarines, aircraft and engines built in
Connecticut.
<P>
	   The $1.84 trillion plan for the year beginning Oct. 1, 2000 is "very good
news in terms of the military industrial base of our state," said Sen. Chris
Dodd.
</P>
<P>
	   Given the president's largesse both Dodd and fellow Democrat Sen. Joseph
Lieberman questioned why United Technologies Corp., the state's major military
contractor, is laying off workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Lieberman also stressed that inclusion in the president's budget indicates
the administration's support for programs but does not guarantee funding. The
federal budget is subject to Congress' approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's proposal includes $2 billion for the New Attack Submarine being
jointly produced by General Dynamics Corp.'s Electric Boat Division in Groton,
Conn., and Quonset Point, R.I., and Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Four of the submarines are slated to be built. Last year the Navy requested
a fifth but Congress did not approve it. This year Clinton is again asking for a
fifth submarine.
</P>
<P>
	   Another big ticket-defense item is $614 million for development of the
Comanche helicopter, a joint venture between United Technologies Corporation's
Sikorsky Aircraft, in Stratford, Conn. and Boeing Vertol of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one member of Congress wants to cut the program.
</P>
<P>
	   "On the Comanche, our guard is up," said Lieberman, a member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   East Hartford-based Pratt and Whitney would be one of the contractors on the
F-22, a project that Congress almost killed last session, Lieberman said. This
year Clinton is proposing nearly $4 billion to fund the program.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt and Whitney would also get the contract to build the engine of 12 new
C-17 Airlift Aircraft. The frame would be built by Boeing. The total cost of
that proposed project is approximately $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Given the downturn in the world aerospace market, the budget proposals are
not enough to keep all workers on the job, said United Technologies spokesman
Peter Dalpe.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sales to the government is an important piece of our business, but only a
piece of our business," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other defense spending proposals include:
</P>
<P>
	   - $270.7 million for CH-60S helicopters by Sikorsky.
</P>
<P>
	   - $116 million for the purchase of six Blackhawk helicopters built by
Sikorsky.
</P>
<P>
	   - $61.3 million for development of F-15A Eagle Multi-Mission fighter planes
with engines built by Pratt and Whitney.
</P>
<P>
	   - $149.2 million for the F-16 Falcon Multi-Mission fighter with engines
built by Pratt and Whitney.
</P>
<P>
	   Struggling Connecticut fishermen may also benefit from Clinton's proposed
$38 million fisheries package.
</P>
<P>
	   Programs to help fishing communities hit by depleted fish stocks include $10
million to buy back boats from those who decide to get out of the business and
$7 million from the U.S. Department of Labor to provide job counseling and
training for displaced fishermen.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Hits Russian Apartments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- An explosion ripped through a five-story apartment building
Russia's Far East on Monday night, killing two people and destroying 10
apartments, emergency officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the blast in Khabarovsk, 3,800 miles east of Moscow, was
unclear. The Interfax news agency quoted police as saying a gas leak was likely
to blame, though they did not rule out a terrorist attack. Gas explosions are
common in aging Russian apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   The explosion hit at about 5:40 a.m. Tuesday and ignited a fire that blazed
for three hours, a duty officer at the Emergency Situations Ministry said on
condition of anonymity. At least two people were killed and an unknown number of
others were injured. Residents were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
	   Russians are tense over a series of overnight bombings of apartment
buildings in Moscow and two other cities last year that killed about 300
sleeping people. The bombings were blamed on Chechen rebels, though no one
claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials warned recently that Chechens were planning terrorist acts
in Russian cities because of federal troops' progress in the Chechnya war.

<HEADLINE> NJ rail line among goodies in Clinton budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Where Democrats found much to like in President
Clinton's eighth and final budget, Republicans found too much spending and not
enough tax relief.
<P>
	   Clinton's proposed $1.84 trillion plan would expand access to health care,
shrink the national debt and cut taxes for the sick, elderly, poor and
college-bound, while spending more for the environment, schools and gun-law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey lawmakers were particularly heartened by continued funding for a
new rail line.
</P>
<P>
	   "Initiatives aimed at every citizen - tax cuts, investments in education and
health care - are proof of the nation's economic prosperity," said Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., called it "a responsible, visionary budget
that focuses on fiscal discipline and the future."
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans, who control both houses of Congress, were less impressed.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've always said we need to live within our means and the president has
chosen not to," said Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-Vineland.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-Ridgewood, said Clinton should move faster to end the
"marriage penalty" for two-earner couples. "The president says he's for
eliminating the marriage tax penalty but he wants to take 10 years to do it and
even then he leaves out homeowners," Roukema said.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget faces months of congressional hearings and debate.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey lawmakers cheered a commitment of funding to continue work on a
20-mile light rail line in Hudson and Bergen counties, running north from
Bayonne to the New Jersey Turnpike's Vince Lombardi service area in Ridgefield.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget includes $121 million for the first phase of the project, running
from Bayonne to Hoboken via Liberty State Park and the Jersey City waterfront.
The Clinton administration also indicated it will commit the federal government
to providing $500 million through 2003 to fund the project's second phase.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's office in Washington estimated that Clinton's renewed proposal
for school modernization would bring the state about $485 million in borrowing
authority to finance the building and renovation of public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Lautenberg's office and the state office, the budget also
includes:
</P>
<P>
	   -$10 million for a nine-mile extension of Newark's existing rail line,
connecting the downtowns of Newark and Elizabeth with Newark International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   -$2.4 million for a recreation facility at Naval Weapons Station Earle in
Colts Neck. Rep. Rush Holt, D-Pennington, said Clinton's five-year defense plan
also includes $3.7 million for security at the yards where explosives are
unloaded from trucks.
</P>
<P>
	   -$9.8 million for a fitness center at McGuire Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
	   -$1 million to acquire land in Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge in
Morris County; $2 million to acquire land in the Wallkill River National
Wildlife Refuge in Sussex County; and $1 million to acquire land in the Delaware
Water Gap National Recreation Area.
</P>
<P>
	   -$248 million for continued research into alternative energy sources, much
of which will go to the Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
	   -$53 million to deepen the Kill van Kull and Newark Bay Channel. At this
high level of funding, the project would be done by 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   -$12.4 million for shore protection projects, up from $11.6 million
requested last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-Paterson, cheered Clinton's proposal for a $25 million
pilot grant program to help communities obtain health and safety equipment for
their firefighters. Pascrell has been pushing to spend $5 billion over five
years to help fire departments hire more members, increase training and buy
high-tech safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Frank Pallone, D-Long Branch, said Clinton proposes continued funding
for the Sandy Hook-to-Barnegat Bay beach replenishment project and for flood
control projects in Middlesex and Monmouth counties.

<HEADLINE> Truckers Wary As Fuel Prices Soar  </HEADLINE>
    By GENE JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOW, N.H. (AP) -- The high price of diesel fuel nationwide is forcing some
truckers and transport companies to pass on the costs or even keep their rigs
off the road to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anybody who's operating with the prices this high is out of his mind," Mike
McClellan, a 31-year-old independent trucker, said Monday. "I don't like parking
my truck, but that's an extra $440 or $450 a week that comes out of my pocket."
</P>
<P>
	   The cost increase is most acute in the Northeast. The regional average rose
to about $2.10 per gallon in mid-January from about $1 a year ago, according to
the New Hampshire governor's planning office. Some large trucks average just 5.5
miles per gallon of fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   McClellan said fuel costs are forcing him to sell his truck and switch jobs.
With the national average at $1.45 a gallon, transport companies are taking
drastic steps too.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're refusing to take freight into some of those high-priced areas," said
Roy Romans, chairman of a Omaha, Neb., company. "Where we can't get fuel
surcharges that will cover the cost, we just turn down the business."
</P>
<P>
	   Larger companies are avoiding the problem by hedging, purchasing huge
quantities of fuel at set intervals to lock in the price.
</P>
<P>
	   That practice allows United Parcel Service Inc. to avoid imposing fuel
surcharges, said Bob Godlewski, a company spokesman in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   "We enter into contracts to buy fuel at a certain price for a certain
delivery date," he said. "If the price is higher on that date, we win; if it is
lower, we lose."
</P>
<P>
	   Experts say the high prices are the result of a sudden cold snap, low oil
inventories and sustained production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. Some truckers suggested fuel companies are hiking prices to
make up for slow sales during the fall, which was warmer than usual.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, truckers said, consumers will likely foot the bill: Everything
on a store's shelves came off a truck, and the increased costs will be reflected
in market prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "Millions of people are affected by the trucking industry, whether you are
buying a jug of milk or you want a bushel of corn hauled to town," said Michael
Klasna, operations manager of LaBenz Trucking Inc. in Humphrey, Neb. "The
increase in the price of fuel has to go somewhere, and it will eventually go
there if it has to."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Force in Sierra Leone Expanded  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council voted Monday to nearly double
the size of its peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone and give the force broad
new responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The resolution was approved by all 15 council members, including the United
States, which recently pledged to renew its support for peacekeeping in Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   The vote expands the U.N. force from its current 6,000 military personnel to
11,100, making it the largest U.N. force under active deployment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The peace process in Sierra Leone remains fragile, and it is in all of our
interest to help ensure its success,'' deputy U.S. Ambassador Nancy Soderberg
told the council before casting the U.S. vote in favor of the expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   The Security Council first authorized a 6,000-member peacekeeping force in
October to monitor a cease-fire agreement reached by rebels and the government
in July and to oversee the disarming of fighters in the country's eight-year
civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   The West African regional intervention force known as ECOMOG helped end the
war and was responsible for maintaining security.
</P>
<P>
	   But Nigeria, which provided the bulk of ECOMOG's forces, announced in
December it was pulling out, compelling the United Nations to recommend an
expanded U.N. presence in the country to keep the cease-fire from crumbling.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, U.N. human rights experts said rebels had violated the cease-fire
by looting villages, burning houses, raping women and mutilating civilians in
the former rebel-held towns of Port Loko, northwest of Freetown, and Kabala in
the northwest highlands.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States previously cited continued cease-fire violations in
delaying approval for the force, but senior U.S. officials, Vice President Al
Gore, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright came to the United Nations last
month to pledge U.S. support for peacekeeping in Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   With U.S. credibility on the line, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke lobbied
to get congressional approval for the force, and is working to get similar
approval for the initial stages of a peacekeeping force for the Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the resolution approved Monday, the expanded U.N. force for
Sierra Leone will now take on much of ECOMOG's responsibilities, providing
security at key government buildings, intersections and at Lungi airport outside
the capital of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. peacekeepers also are to help local law enforcement agencies maintain
order, guard weapons collections and help move humanitarian aid throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   The peacekeepers, whose mandate also was extended for another six months,
will have the power to use force to protect themselves and civilians threatened
with imminent violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Adoption of this resolution will cast another ray of hope across Sierra
Leone,'' the country's U.N. ambassador, Ibrahim Kamara, told the council.

<HEADLINE> UPDATES throughout with two witnesses describing pause, other  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Moments after Amadou Diallo died in a hail of 41
police bullets, a man could be overheard making a remark suggesting a cover-up,
a next-door neighbor testified Monday.
<P>
	   "OK. OK. We're just going to say this," witness Ida Vincent quoted the man
as saying - testimony the defense had sought to keep out the trial of four
police officers. Vincent couldn't say if the remark was made by any of the
officers accused of murdering Diallo on his Bronx doorstep.
</P>
<P>
	   Vincent also became one of three prosecution "ear witnesses" so far to tell
jurors the barrage that killed the 22-year-old West African immigrant was
interrupted by a pause. Another neighbor, a police recruit named Thomas Bell,
testified the pause lasted up to five seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Evidence of a pause could be used to argue the officers had a chance to stop
firing. The defense claims the shooting was uninterrupted and over within 10
seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy,
27, have pleaded innocent to the second-degree murder charges. If convicted,
they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying of the unarmed black man by the four white officers produced a
flood of pretrial publicity and protests alleging widespread abuse of minorities
by police. An appeals court responded by moving the case to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the plainclothes officers, while searching for dangerous
criminals, made a "conscious decision" to fire 41 bullets at Diallo at 12:40
a.m. on Feb. 3, 1999, without warning; 19 bullets struck the victim. Defense
attorneys argue the shooting was a tragic mistake made after the victim ignored
orders to stop and pulled out a black wallet that appeared to be a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers have not been charged with trying to cover up their alleged
crime. Last week, a lieutenant who arrived on the scene moments after the
shooting testified that the officers were so stunned they couldn't speak.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Vincent took the stand, State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi
barred prosecutors from asking about the fragment of conversation Vincent heard
out her front window because she couldn't identify the speaker. Defense attorney
John Patten had complained that the young housewife's account would leave the
false impression "that police were somehow concocting a story."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, when Vincent began to testify about it, the defense objected. But the
judge overruled, saying the defense itself had "opened the door" by
cross-examining Vincent about another part of the same conversation that
entailed someone cursing.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other witnesses on Monday was a ballistics unit detective who
testified that four bullets fired by Carroll, two by McMellon and two by Boss
were recovered from Diallo's body. Other bullets found under Diallo's body were
shot by Boss and Murphy.
</P>
<P>
	   As the officers' pistols were introduced into evidence and passed around the
defense table, Boss and Carroll appeared to avoid touching them; Murphy and
McMellon simply passed them on. On cross-examination, the detective testified
that the semiautomatics could fire 16 rounds in as little as four seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell, 28, told jurors on the morning of the shooting he was on the phone
with a cousin when gunfire erupted up the block from his apartment. The witness
said he heard four to five shots, followed by a three-to-five second pause, then
a longer, final volley from several guns - a sequence he tapped out on the
witness stand.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys attacked Bell's credibility, suggesting he lived too far
away from the scene to be reliable. But the witness stuck to his story.
</P>
<P>
	   "A pause is a pause, sir," he told an attorney at one point.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution is expected to conclude its case Tuesday by calling the
medical examiner who performed an autopsy on Diallo. The officers have said they
will testify in their own defense.

<HEADLINE> Bombs Damage Trucks in Virginia  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW BARAKAT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Bombs exploded in two pickup trucks Monday and a third
bomb detonated outside a nearby factory. One of the truck drivers was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Two attempted capital murder warrants were issued for Luis Cristobal, a
47-year-old Cuban citizen who lives south of Richmond, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police refused to discuss a motive for the bombings, but Cristobal's former
employer, Dave Filippi, said he believes the attacks were related to a family
dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   Cristobal was the only suspect. A white van believed to have been used by
Cristobal was recovered at an Amtrak train station. It is not known if Cristobal
boarded a train, but police said he should be considered armed.
</P>
<P>
	   The first bomb went off about 6:30 a.m. as David B. Haston turned the
ignition on his truck in a subdivision south of Richmond. Haston was
hospitalized, although his injuries were not life-threatening, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The second explosion happened about 7:50 a.m. in another subdivision as a
man put his pickup into gear. He was not injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Both trucks were damaged.
</P>
<P>
	   The third bomb detonated just before 8 a.m. outside the shop door of
Guttagard USA, a manufacturer of gutter protectors, in nearby Petersburg, state
police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said.
</P>
<P>
	   A secretary who was first to arrive at work noticed a strange smell. Then
Guttagard owner Dave Filippi discovered the bomb.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it had gone off like it was supposed to, it would have blown the end of
the building off,'' Filippi said. ``We were lucky.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bomb, which caused only minimal damage, consisted in part of a 5-gallon
gas tank, a tank for compressed air, and an alarm clock, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said one of the pickup truck bombs apparently targeted Cristobal's
brother-in-law and the other an acquaintance of Cristobal's wife. Cristobal's
brother-in-law owns a business that shares space with Guttagard, Filippi said.

<HEADLINE> Senate takes action on DiFrancesco auto emissions plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Senate on Monday easily passed Senate
President Donald DiFrancesco's plan to cut lines at centralized auto inspection
centers, but Gov. Christie Whitman said she believes action she took last week
is already bringing relief to motorists.
<P>
	   The upper house, in a 37-1 vote, passed a bill that would suspend the
tougher emissions test at all 32 Division of Motor Vehicles inspection stations
and give motorists a $50 break at private garages until a private vendor can
solve problems that prompted long lines.
</P>
<P>
	   The lone dissenter was Sen. John Adler, D-Camden, who said he issued a
protest vote to show his fear that promised probes into the seven year, $400
million deal with Parsons Infrastructure and Technology will become a
"whitewash." The centralized lanes have faced problems since a new safety and
emissions inspections test was launched Dec. 13. The emissions upgrade is part
of the state's plan to conform with federal rules to clean the air.
</P>
<P>
	   DiFrancesco's bill, S-25, drew support from private garage owners and
senators who say it would do the most to buy time until Parsons can fix a wide
range of problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to do something immediately, and this legislation offers a
practical solution," said DiFrancesco, R-Union.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman, however, says her approach - suspending the test and a more
involved computer system at 15 of the stations - is bearing fruit. Assembly
Speaker Jack Collins has said he is cool to the Senate President's idea. Both
Collins and DiFrancesco are eyeing a run for governor next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman last Monday suspended the tougher auto emissions test and a computer
system designed to monitor the process at the 15 centralized DMV stations that
had the longest waiting times. An old tailpipe test that essentially looks for
carbon monoxide is being used at these stations. Motorists whose cars pass the
old test will, until June 30, receive a sticker good for two years.
</P>
<P>
	   The new emissions test, which looks for asthma-causing smog compounds, is
still being administered at the 17 other centralized stations and at private
garages.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the governor's plan, the state is also paying up to $12 million to cut
the average $75 price tag for inspections at private garages by $25. She hopes
this will divert some drivers from centralized lanes, where there is no charge.
</P>
<P>
	   DiFrancesco, however, has a different approach: Cut out the tougher test at
all 32 centralized stations until June 30 and hand out one-year stickers to
motorists who take the less stringent tests at these stations. This is designed
to encourage motorists to take the tougher test at private garages, where they
get two-year stickers. The bill also calls for slicing the cost of inspections
at private garages by $50, with Parsons, not the state, providing the subsidy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Whitman administration is urging a delay of DiFrancesco's bill. Whitman
on Monday claimed her plan is working.
</P>
<P>
	   "The lines have gone down, the wait times have gone down at the central
lanes, and the number of people seeking to have their cars inspected by the
private inspection stations has actually gone up," Whitman said. "So the factors
that prompted that legislation being introduced now seem to be pretty well under
control."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman's office provided figures showing that the number of inspections at
private garages averaged 2,291 last week, after her plan was instituted. That's
about 150 more than the average for the week prior to the implementation,
according to the figures. One day from each week was excluded because of snowy
weather.
</P>
<P>
	   Garage owners, however, say Whitman's plan gives motorists no incentive to
use private garages. They maintain the numbers are down in the full week since
the plan went into effect.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over the last seven working days, we're experiencing an actual decrease in
the amount of inspections in private inspection facilities," said James Kenney,
vice president of the Repair Excellence Council of New Jersey, which represents
garage owners and mechanics. "Guys say since the enactment (of Whitman's plan),
they're doing three to four inspections a week, where they used to do three to
four inspections a day."
</P>
<P>
	   The federal Environmental Protection Agency prefers Whitman's approach,
according to spokeswoman Mary Mears. The EPA had threatened the loss of federal
highway funds if New Jersey didn't make good on its promise to toughen the
emissions test. Mears, however, said the EPA would "remain flexible" if
DiFrancesco's bill became law.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to wait and see what happens," Mears said. "We want the program
to work. We want New Jersey to get this clean air benefit."
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats, meanwhile, continued to call for an independent probe of how
Parsons got hired, and why a subcontractor's predictions of DMV disaster were
not heeded. Democrats charge that Parsons was hired by the state because the
company had hired people connected to the Whitman administration. Adler said he
voted no on DiFrancesco's bill to show his belief that an independent review is
needed.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said she expects an attorney general's panel to be named soon to
look into implementation of the program.

<HEADLINE> Diallo neighbor overhears remark following shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Moments after Amadou Diallo died in a hail of 41
police bullets, a man could be overheard making a remark suggesting a cover-up,
a next-door neighbor testified Monday.
<P>
	   "OK. OK. We're just going to say this," witness Ida Vincent quoted the man
as saying - testimony the defense had sought to keep out the trial of four
police officers. Vincent couldn't say if the remark was made by any of the
officers accused of murdering Diallo on his Bronx doorstep.
</P>
<P>
	   Vincent also became one of three prosecution "ear witnesses" so far to tell
jurors the barrage that killed the 22-year-old West African immigrant was
interrupted by a pause. Another neighbor, a police recruit named Thomas Bell,
testified the pause lasted up to five seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Evidence of a pause could be used to argue the officers had a chance to stop
firing. The defense claims the shooting was uninterrupted and over within 10
seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy,
27, have pleaded innocent to the second-degree murder charges. If convicted,
they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying of the unarmed black man by the four white officers produced a
flood of pretrial publicity and protests alleging widespread abuse of minorities
by police. An appeals court responded by moving the case to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the plainclothes officers, while searching for dangerous
criminals, made a "conscious decision" to fire 41 bullets at Diallo at 12:40
a.m. on Feb. 3, 1999, without warning; 19 bullets struck the victim. Defense
attorneys argue the shooting was a tragic mistake made after the victim ignored
orders to stop and pulled out a black wallet that appeared to be a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers have not been charged with trying to cover up their alleged
crime. Last week, a lieutenant who arrived on the scene moments after the
shooting testified that the officers were so stunned they couldn't speak.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Vincent took the stand, State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi
barred prosecutors from asking about the fragment of conversation Vincent heard
out her front window because she couldn't identify the speaker. Defense attorney
John Patten had complained that the young housewife's account would leave the
false impression "that police were somehow concocting a story."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, when Vincent began to testify about it, the defense objected. But the
judge overruled, saying the defense itself had "opened the door" by
cross-examining Vincent about another part of the same conversation that
entailed someone cursing.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other witnesses on Monday was a ballistics unit detective who
testified that four bullets fired by Carroll, two by McMellon and two by Boss
were recovered from Diallo's body. Other bullets found under Diallo's body were
shot by Boss and Murphy.
</P>
<P>
	   As the officers' pistols were introduced into evidence and passed around the
defense table, Boss and Carroll appeared to avoid touching them; Murphy and
McMellon simply passed them on. On cross-examination, the detective testified
that the semiautomatics could fire 16 rounds in as little as four seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell, 28, told jurors on the morning of the shooting he was on the phone
with a cousin when gunfire erupted up the block from his apartment. The witness
said he heard four to five shots, followed by a three-to-five second pause, then
a longer, final volley from several guns - a sequence he tapped out on the
witness stand.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys attacked Bell's credibility, suggesting he lived too far
away from the scene to be reliable. But the witness stuck to his story.
</P>
<P>
	   "A pause is a pause, sir," he told an attorney at one point.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution is expected to conclude its case Tuesday by calling the
medical examiner who performed an autopsy on Diallo. The officers have said they
will testify in their own defense.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Plane Hijack Talks Held  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BARR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Authorities held ``fairly calm and businesslike''
negotiations over long hours Monday with apparent Afghan dissidents holding a
planeload of at least 150 people hostage at an airport outside London.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials did not disclose what political demands, if any, the hijackers put
forth. But a diplomat familiar with earlier negotiations when the airliner
landed in Moscow said those holding the plane sought to free a prisoner held in
the Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghan media speculated the hijackers were dissidents who sought the release
of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor who has been held since 1997 by
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement. Khan is a member of Afghanistan's
opposition alliance, which still rules roughly 10 percent of the war-shattered
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Once in Britain, the hijackers requested only food, water, unspecified
medical supplies and that the lavatories on the Afghan state-run Ariana Airlines
plane be emptied, said John Broughton, assistant chief constable of the Essex
Police.
</P>
<P>
	   He characterized the negotiations, conducted in English, as ``fairly calm
and businesslike'' and said authorities were patiently working toward a peaceful
solution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Negotiations remain our favorite option,'' said Joe Edwards, another
assistant chief constable. ``I will say it could be a very protracted technique.
It could go on for days.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said that eight captives released Monday at Stansted, Britain's
designated airport for handling hijackings, ``tell us they were very
well-treated while they were onboard.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday at a news conference in Moscow, one of 10 passengers set free
there, Mohammad Bashir Mahal, said there were eight hijackers, and they appeared
to be Afghani because of their language and clothes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were all young -- around 25-30 years old, dressed in traditional
Afghan costume -- and to begin with they were threatening,'' he said in Pashtu,
the principal language of Afghanistan. ``But slowly, their aggression subsided
and they treated us quite well. No one was beaten or insulted. Relations were
good.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said they were armed with pistols, grenades and daggers.
</P>
<P>
	   Half of those released in Moscow were old or ailing men and the other half
young men, since Afghan tradition calls for every elderly or sick person to be
accompanied by a young person, the hostages said.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's NTV television quoted another freed hostage, who wasn't further
identified, as saying that passengers did not pass through a metal detector
before they boarded the flight. The man said that 20 minutes after the plane
took off, he heard a sound and turned around and saw the eight armed hijackers,
who calmly asked the passengers to put their hands on their heads.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 727 was seized shortly after takeoff early Sunday on a domestic
Ariana flight from the Afghan capital, Kabul, to the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
	   Before landing early Monday at Stansted, about 25 miles north of London, the
hijackers had freed 22 hostages in return for supplies during earlier stops in
Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said they could not confirm the nationalities of what were
believed to be 157 hostages remaining on the airliner. They disclosed that one
passenger has a serious kidney illness, but said they did not know if that
person was among those released.
</P>
<P>
	   As night fell, the plane remained parked about a half-mile from Stansted's
main terminal, which still managed to operate at more than 80 percent capacity
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broughton said it wasn't Britain's policy ``to allow aircraft to take off
again once landed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban said it would neither negotiate nor agree to
the demands of the hijackers. A statement issued by the religious militia's
supreme leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, accused the head of an anti-Taliban
alliance, Ahmed Shah Massood, of masterminding the hijacking. The Taliban
provided no evidence, however.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are watching this closely, waiting to hear what the demands are,''
Taliban Foreign Ministry spokesman Faiz Ahmed Faiz said in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Afghanistan and Britain do not have diplomatic relations, Faiz said a
Taliban representative in London was in contact with British authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The Afghan opposition has denied any involvement in the seizure of the
plane. It faxed a formal statement to The Associated Press saying it ``adamantly
condemns the hijacking.''
</P>
<P>
	   An emergency official in Kazakstan said 20 hijackers were aboard, but the
passengers released there said eight to 10 hijackers were aboard.

<HEADLINE> Doctor who admitted drug use while treating patients testifies 2nd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The lawyer for a prominent fertility doctor on trial for
insurance fraud on Monday questioned an anesthesiologist who admitted using
drugs while practicing medicine, asking him, "Are you on drugs today?"
<P>
	   Most of the questions directed to Dr. Neil Ratner by lawyer Theodore D.
Wells centered on his admitted use of drugs from 1967 through 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   Wells is using the drug history to diminish the credibility of Ratner's
testimony against Dr. Niels Lauersen, a 63-year-old Park Avenue obstetrician and
gynecologist accused of cheating insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Lauersen and Dr. Magda Binion, an anesthesiologist, are charged with
conspiracy, health care fraud and mail fraud for allegedly falsely billing
fertility surgeries that were not covered by insurance as gynecological
surgeries that were covered.
</P>
<P>
	   Ratner, 50, is a key witness for prosecutors who want to prove Lauersen
conspired with those who worked with him to lie to insurance companies and then
cover up the deceit.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Ratner admitted using drugs while practicing medicine, telling
the jury in U.S. District Court, "I was stoned a lot of the time I was giving
anesthesia."
</P>
<P>
	   Ratner testified that he was regularly using drugs when he began working for
Lauersen in 1987. He said Lauersen instructed him to leave out any reference to
fertility procedures when insurance companies were billed.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Ratner told the jury that Lauersen once told him as it became
clear a federal investigation was underway that claiming fertility procedures
were gynecological procedures was a "woman's issue."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is discrimination against women. We're going to go after it that way
and I'm going to get a big woman lawyer," Ratner recalled Lauersen telling him
as he answered a final question from a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
	   As Wells began his cross examination of Ratner, he first asked, "I am not a
big woman lawyer, right?"
</P>
<P>
	   Then he immediately attacked Ratner credibility, asking "Are you on drugs
today?"
</P>
<P>
	   For the next several hours, Wells questioned Ratner about his drug use,
eliciting from the witness that he managed to hide his use of cocaine, marijuana
and other drugs from his medical colleagues for a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   "Did you know it was wrong to be under the influence of drugs while engaging
in patient care?" Wells asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes," Ratner answered.
</P>
<P>
	   "You knew it was wrong but you kept it a secret from the medical licensing
board?" the lawyer asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At another point, Wells asked him if he had deluded himself into thinking it
was all right to take drugs and treat people too. Ratner said he had.
</P>
<P>
	   "You had years and years of success at fooling people, right?" Wells asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes," Ratner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ratner pleaded guilty in May 1998 to conspiracy to commit mail fraud, health
care fraud and to making a false statement regarding health care matters. He has
not been sentenced.

<HEADLINE> Steven Spielberg Has Kidney Removed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Steven Spielberg had a kidney removed after doctors found
an ``irregularity'' on it, but the director was expected to fully recover, a
spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem was discovered during a routine checkup, according to the
spokesman, Marvin Levy, who did not know the nature of Spielberg's kidney
ailment, when the surgery was done or whether the irregularity might have been
cancerous.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A complete recovery is promised and no followup treatment is necessary,''
Levy said.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where the surgery was done,
said the hospital could not comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Health generally is not affected by the loss of a kidney. The remaining
kidney usually enlarges to take over the functions of the missing one.
</P>
<P>
	   Spielberg was recuperating at home, Levy said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I talked with him this morning, and he sounded great, like the guy I've
always known,'' Levy said. ``He's not even, quote, off work at this point. He's
got scripts he's dealing with as we speak.''
</P>
<P>
	   Spielberg won best director Oscars for ``Schindler's List'' and ``Saving
Private Ryan.'' ``Schindler's List'' also won the Academy Award for best
picture.
</P>
<P>
	   The director's other films include ``Jaws,'' ``Jurassic Park,'' ``Raiders of
the Lost Ark,'' ``E.T. the Extraterrestrial,'' ``Close Encounters of the Third
Kind,'' ``Amistad,'' ''1941,'' ``Empire of the Sun'' and ``Indiana Jones and the
Last Crusade.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 53-year-old director also is a partner with Jeffrey Katzenberg and David
Geffen in DreamWorks SKG, the studio they formed five years ago. DreamWorks'
films include one of this year's Oscar's favorites, ``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Spielberg, who has won the Directors Guild of America award three times,
will receive the group's lifetime achievement award at a ceremony March 11.

<HEADLINE> Key SLA Trial Defense Witness Dies  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A potentially key defense witness in the upcoming trial
of a former Symbionese Liberation Army fugitive has died of cancer, just days
after lawyers asked for an emergency order giving the sick man the right to
testify.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Scott, a one-time radical sportswriter who helped Patty Hearst in her
cross-country flight from justice, died of throat cancer Sunday night in Eugene,
Ore., said defense attorney Stuart Hanlon.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Sara Jane Olson had warned the judge that Scott was near death
and asked last Friday for an emergency order to take his testimony. But
prosecutors opposed the move, and resolution of it was postponed until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyer Susan Jordan on Friday had bitterly denounced the prosecution
opposition to Scott's testimony, saying: ``This is a smokescreen. They want to
let this witness die.''
</P>
<P>
	   Olson, formerly known as Kathleen Ann Soliah, is accused of planting pipe
bombs under two Los Angeles police cars in a 1975 plot to avenge the deaths of
six SLA members in a shootout. The bombs did not explode.
</P>
<P>
	   Olson was indicted in 1976. During her years as a fugitive she married a
doctor, had three children and became a community activist and actress in local
productions in St. Paul, Minn. She was arrested near her home last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   She could face life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst, the newspaper heiress who was kidnapped by the SLA and later robbed
a bank with her captors, is expected to testify about her fear of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyers hoped Scott would be able to impeach her credibility by
testifying that she told him she had arranged her own kidnapping in order to
escape her impending marriage and that she stayed with the SLA because the group
treated her so well.

<HEADLINE> Bombs Damage Trucks in Virginia  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW BARAKAT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Bombs exploded in two pickup trucks Monday and a third
bomb detonated outside a nearby factory. One of the truck drivers was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Two attempted capital murder warrants were issued for Luis Cristobal, a
47-year-old Cuban citizen who lives south of Richmond, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police refused to discuss a motive for the bombings, but Cristobal's former
employer, Dave Filippi, said he believes the attacks were related to a family
dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   Cristobal was the only suspect. A white van believed to have been used by
Cristobal was recovered at an Amtrak train station. It is not known if Cristobal
boarded a train, but police said he should be considered armed.
</P>
<P>
	   The first bomb went off about 6:30 a.m. as David B. Haston turned the
ignition on his truck in a subdivision south of Richmond. Haston was
hospitalized, although his injuries were not life-threatening, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The second explosion happened about 7:50 a.m. in another subdivision as a
man put his pickup into gear. He was not injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Both trucks were damaged.
</P>
<P>
	   The third bomb detonated just before 8 a.m. outside the shop door of
Guttagard USA, a manufacturer of gutter protectors, in nearby Petersburg, state
police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said.
</P>
<P>
	   A secretary who was first to arrive at work noticed a strange smell. Then
Guttagard owner Dave Filippi discovered the bomb.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it had gone off like it was supposed to, it would have blown the end of
the building off,'' Filippi said. ``We were lucky.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bomb, which caused only minimal damage, consisted in part of a 5-gallon
gas tank, a tank for compressed air, and an alarm clock, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said one of the pickup truck bombs apparently targeted Cristobal's
brother-in-law and the other an acquaintance of Cristobal's wife. Cristobal's
brother-in-law owns a business that shares space with Guttagard, Filippi said.

<HEADLINE> Top Assembly Democrats in spat over gubernatorial endorsement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - By backing a candidate for governor in the 2002
election, the majority leader of the state Assembly is forgetting that his
political "focus" should be on the 2000 elections, the Assembly speaker said
Monday.
<P>
	   Speaker Sheldon Silver said it is too early to worry about the governor's
race in 2002 with a president, congressional delegation and new state
Legislature to elect this November.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there has to be an appropriate focus on the year 2000," Silver said
in reference to the activities of Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver's comments served to confirm a report in Monday's New York Post of
tensions between Silver and Bragman over Bragman agreeing to be one of four
members of an advisory committee formed to promote state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall's candidacy for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post, citing unidentified sources, reported that Silver was miffed
Bragman didn't clear his participation on the committee with Silver, and also
annoyed that Bragman wasn't worrying more about the 2000 elections at this point
than on the next gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
	   Bragman said Monday evening that he had not discussed the issue with Silver.
</P>
<P>
	   "However, no one should question my focus or my support for Assembly
campaigns, for the campaign of Hillary Clinton or any other statewide race,"
Bragman said. "If anyone should do that, then it's correct to say that there
should be a rift between that person and me."
</P>
<P>
	   Bragman said he has been a devoted follower and adviser to Clinton's
campaign and, when her announcement tour hits Syracuse Wednesday, he said he was
a chief organizer of a forum she will hold at Syracuse University and of a
fund-raiser later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall and Andrew Cuomo, the federal housing secretary and son of former
Gov. Mario Cuomo, are considered the top possible Democratic candidates for
governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   As majority leader, Bragman is the No. 2 figure in the Assembly behind
Silver. Bragman serves as traffic cop for legislation as it moves onto the floor
of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Bragman, of upstate Onondaga County, and Silver, of Manhattan, have
worked together in their current posts for seven years in the Assembly, they
have never been particularly close and relations between the two have at other
times been strained.
</P>
<P>
	   Bragman was not present at a news conference Silver called Monday to unveil
a series of managed care-related bills. Silver said he assumed Bragman was
attending to other Assembly business.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked whether a "rift" had developed between himself and Bragman,
Silver said the only rift he knew about was the much-publicized falling out that
Republican Gov. George Pataki and Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, also a
Republican, have been experiencing.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver appeared uncomfortable when pressed about his relations with Bragman
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that is not a productive use of our time here," he told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Injunction Sought Against Pa. Paper  </HEADLINE>
    By BILL BERGSTROM AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A group of newspaper publishers again sought an
injunction Monday to bar the distribution of a free tabloid at some locations
while its relationship with a state transit agency is challenged in court.
</P>
<P>
	   An attorney for the publishers of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the
Philadelphia Daily News, The New York Times and USA Today filed the request for
a preliminary injunction with the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court
took no immediate action.
</P>
<P>
	   Metro, which began publication Jan. 24, is published under contract with the
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   The other newspapers argue that the contract is unconstitutional because it
allows a government agency to assert control over a newspaper and allows the
paper to be distributed free on buses and transit platforms, where other
publications cannot be sold.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Robert F. Kelly last month denied the newspapers a
temporary restraining order, saying they failed to show that they would suffer
"immediate and irreparable harm" if it was not granted. The newspapers are
appealing the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Roberts, managing director of Metro, said he had expected the
competitors to request the injunction, and he said it is without merit.
</P>
<P>
	   SEPTA and Metro have 10 days to respond to the motion.

<HEADLINE> Assembly Democrats renew campaign vs. HMOs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Assembly Monday approved a package of
bills Monday the chamber's controlling Democrats said would restore
accountability to the treatments health maintenance organizations provide their
patients in New York.
<P>
	   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said the measures are needed to redress what
he called the growing imbalance between HMOs' protection of their bottom lines
and New Yorkers' right to proper health coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the package is a bill allowing people to sue health
maintenance organizations if they deny coverage they should be offering or
provide inadequate care, Silver said.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors and other health care professionals can currently be sued, but since
HMOs do not practice medicine directly, they cannot be brought as parties in
such actions.
</P>
<P>
	   "These corporations know that when they act contrary to the patients' best
interests, they know that they cannot be held responsible," Assemblyman Richard
Gottfried, a Democrat who chairs the Assembly's health committee, said. "New
Yorkers are suffering as a result and it's wrong."
</P>
<P>
	   The Assembly's package would also require the state Insurance Department to
hold hearings whenever HMOs seek rate increases of more than 5 percent and for
more detailed external review of cases where HMOs deny treatment for customers
with permanently disabling or degenerative medical conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the bills have passed the Assembly before but died in the
Republican-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Health Plan Association, which represents 30 managed care
health plans, said the Assembly bills would add to the cost of HMO coverage
throughout the state if they became law, and make insurance unaffordable for
tens of thousands of New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   State laws already include extensive protections for health consumers,
Health Plan Association President Paul Macielak said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This effort to pile on will only add new and duplicative layers of
bureaucracy that will make it more difficult for consumers to navigate the
health care system," Macielak said.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver denied that the Assembly bills would add to health care costs. If
they cost anything extra, the speaker said, it should come from the profits of
the HMOs' shareholders.

<HEADLINE> Assembly panel OKs controversial $100 million HMO bailout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - When a group of oncologists had no offices and no
medicine to treat 100 cancer patients, St. Peter's University Medical Center in
New Brunswick provided space and drugs.
<P>
	   The hospital took a chance. None of the patients had insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   They were among the members of a bankrupt HMO that left 165,000 people
without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, lawmakers are taking steps to make good on the state's promise to pay
hospitals and doctors that stepped in to treat these suddenly uninsured
patients.
</P>
<P>
	   The Assembly budget committee Monday passed a $100 million package to
reimburse hospitals and doctors for treating patients of two bankrupt HMOs - HIP
Healthcare of New Jersey and American Preferred Provider Plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors and hospitals are owed $150 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversial package would pay them back with a combination of $50
million in state funds and $50 million from a new assessment on the state's
surviving HMOs. Doctors and hospitals have agreed to forgive $50 million of that
debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Powerful lobbyists lined up on both sides of the issue during a 3-hour
hearing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Health insurance representatives called the plan a dangerous precedent that
forces surviving HMOs to bail out a competitor by paying their debts to
healthcare providers.
</P>
<P>
	   Randi Reichel, executive director of the American Association of Health
Plans, said no other state has taken this approach to mopping up after a failed
HMO. Typically, lawyers scrap together whatever assets they can find from the
failed business' estate, parent company and other revenue sources.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bill creates a tax or a penalty, which will be levied to the citizens
of New Jersey, and on the health plans that serve them, to benefit those
providers who entered into less than profitable business arrangements," Reichel
testified.
</P>
<P>
	   The insurers also asked lawmakers to require an independent audit of the
medical bills, saying they may be incorrect. But Insurance Commissioner Karen
Suter said the bills are already subject to court review. An audit, she said,
would only cost money and further delay payment.
</P>
<P>
	   About a dozen representatives from hospitals around the state also
testified, saying they stepped in when patients - and the state - needed help.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, they said, it's time to share the pain.
</P>
<P>
	   They called the measure a "compromise" that divvies up the financial burden.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't have an extra dollar, never mind an extra couple of million," said
Ed Curley, director of managed care for the Bon Secours New Jersey Health System
in Jersey City. "And we are not in any way responsible for the failure of the
HMOs or for the failure of the state to prevent their collapse. Nevertheless, we
have agreed to absorb one third of the losses from the HMO failures."
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the unpaid bills are for patients of the former HIP Health Plan of
New Jersey, which was the state's fourth largest HMO. HIP began failing in 1998
and went bankrupt last spring. American Preferred Provider Plan, a smaller
company, was taken over by the state in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill prohibits HMOs from passing on the increase to their customers.
Suter said the assessment would only amount to 1 percent of premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   But Paul Langevin, president of the New Jersey Association of Health Plans,
said the state's HMOs lost about $26 million in 1998. The measure would tack
another $17 million annual hit onto those losses, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this is about preventing insolvency for health plans, then I'm missing
something," Langevin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill does allow HMOs to write off some of the increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman is pushing the plan, saying payment is essential to
reward hospitals and doctors that provided care to HIP members, even though they
ran the risk of not getting paid for their services.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Tumble for Second Session  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices tumbled for a second consecutive session on
Monday as market players sold securities in preparation for a U.S. auction of
$32 billion in new debt this week. Inflation concerns also pressured the market.
</P>
<P>
	   The bond price drop pulled the Treasury market further back from a powerful
rally last week, which was triggered by news the federal government intends to
cut circulation of long-term bonds.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year bond, which had plunged 1 27/32 points on Friday,
dropped another 29/32 point, or $9.06 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which
moves in the opposite direction of price, rose to 6.34 percent from 6.27 percent
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Preparations for an infusion of supply this week pressured prices. Large
Wall Street firms sold securities to try to push down market prices for the new
securities to levels seen as attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department plans to sell $12 billion in new five-year notes
Tuesday, $10 billion in 10-year notes Wednesday and $10 billion in 30-year bonds
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The market's volatility reflects lingering uncertainty from the government's
announcement last week of plans to slash the national debt, meaning some
securities will be phased out altogether. A sharp supply cut would drive up the
value of bonds remaining in circulation.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices of short-term Treasury securities also fell Monday, dropping 3/32 to
3/16 point, while intermediate maturities fell 11/32 to 19/32 point, according
to the Bridge Telerate news service.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading Monday, yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.58
percent, with the discount falling 0.07 percentage point to 5.42 percent.
Six-month yields were 6.02 percent as the discount rose 0.07 percentage point to
5.76 percent. One-year yields finished at 6.20 percent, with the discount rising
0.01 percentage point to 5.84 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose
to 5.75 percent from 5.63 percent late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds fell 5/32 point to 91 26/32. The
yield was 6.27 percent, up from 6.26 percent.

<HEADLINE> Fall Fashion Week Opens in NYC  </HEADLINE>
   By FRANCINE PARNES
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fashion Week is blimping out. This week's jampacked lineup
of designer previews is bursting at the seams with an unprecedented 110 shows,
and nobody's complaining it looks fat.
</P>
<P>
	   Fall Fashion Week, New York edition is snatching the international fashion
spotlight while cramming the catwalks. The semiannual openings feature an
expanded, nine-day marathon.
</P>
<P>
	   This season's round of shows kicked off Thursday with some twists --
menswear shows as well as a special program dedicated to newcomer designers. Add
to the bulky mix a smattering of Europeans, including Hugo Boss, Vivienne
Westwood, Nicole Farhi.
</P>
<P>
	   The timing couldn't be better -- at least for those opening in New York. For
the third season in a row, designers stateside have stepped to the front of the
line by scheduling their collections before Paris, Milan and London.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've fallen into the cadence of being first,'' says Stan Herman,
president of 7th on Sixth, which coordinates Fashion Week. But ``there is still
shuffling as to when the shows will be in the future. In the fashion business,
once your gait is equal, they tackle you at the knees.''
</P>
<P>
	   The tents at midtown's Bryant Park, home to Fashion Week for the past five
years, have grown from three to four, to accommodate a cosmopolitan caravan of
2,000 retailers, editors, photographers and others with a passion for fashion.
</P>
<P>
	   Carolina Herrera is known for dressing the social-page set, and Richard
Tyler dresses stars. At their previews Monday, the week of women's wear shows,
both designers showed something for everyone across America -- at least for the
rarefied social strata spanning Park Avenue drawing rooms to red-carpet galas of
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These clothes travel and have to look very well everywhere,'' says
Herrera, and by that she does not mean wash-and-wear. ``They have to be
international clothes. You can go to Paris, you can go to Rio, you can go to
India. And it's also very New York.''
</P>
<P>
	   Herrera pulled out all the rich-girl trappings, with sweeping, opulent
Russian sable coats; dresses lavishly embellished with embroideries inspired by
19th century Russian architecture; and dramatic details like single-shouldered
gowns and cascading ruffles.
</P>
<P>
	   As for color, Herrera's palette is an exercise in dozens of ways to wear
blazing red, fuchsia and orange, from monochromatic leather skirts and jackets
to strapless silk gowns.
</P>
<P>
	   Why the bright idea? ``There's not one woman who doesn't have a good time in
a flame-colored dress,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on Monday, Tyler invited the fashion flock to his 150-year-old
townhouse-studio, where he previewed his top-of-the-line label, Richard Tyler
Couture, suitable for such Tinseltown clientele as Melanie Griffith, Sarah
Jessica Parker, Calista Flockhart, Heather Locklear and Meg Ryan.
</P>
<P>
	   While $6,000 for a blue-gray strapless gown might sound much, you'll get
more for the mileage: it's fashioned with three folds and tiers in back, from 40
yards of fabric.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was inspired by architecture,'' says Tyler. ``Frank Lloyd Wright's
drawings of falling water seemed to fit in with the layers.''
</P>
<P>
	   But you'd better set out early for the Academy in one of these stunning
creations. Allow time for stop-and-go traffic of your own doing, thanks to
super-high heels, ballskirts with trains and the longest, leanest gowns not
built for speed.
</P>
<P>
	   One look that promises to show up throughout the week on the runways:
high-heeled, knee-high boots, which Tyler paired even with cocktail dresses.
</P>
<P>
	   What do you get when you put preppy plaid skirts on sexy, see-through
fabrics?
</P>
<P>
	   ``High-octane Ivy League,'' says Tommy Hilfiger, whose odd ode to
traditional tartans stems from a trip last summer to the Scottish countryside.
</P>
<P>
	   With a celebrity-studded audience of Billy Baldwin, Harry and Jill Connick,
Angie Harmon and Debbie Harry, Hilfiger rocked at Roseland, a dance club space
where he staged a coed show of plaid-gone-mad, unexpectedly pieced or paneled on
slim skirts, as well as on men's trousers with a different pattern on each leg.
Plaid also paved the linings of shrunken jean jackets in navy metallic leather
for men and in black calf hair for women.

<HEADLINE> Diallo neighbor overhears remark following shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Moments after Amadou Diallo died in a hail of 41
police bullets, a man could be overheard making a remark suggesting a cover-up,
a next-door neighbor testified Monday.
<P>
	   "OK. OK. We're just going to say this," witness Ida Vincent quoted the man
as saying - testimony the defense had sought to keep out the trial of four
police officers. Vincent couldn't say if the remark was made by any of the
officers accused of murdering Diallo on his Bronx doorstep.
</P>
<P>
	   Vincent also became one of three prosecution "ear witnesses" so far to tell
jurors the barrage that killed the 22-year-old West African immigrant was
interrupted by a pause. Another neighbor, a police recruit named Thomas Bell,
testified the pause lasted up to five seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Evidence of a pause could be used to argue the officers had a chance to stop
firing. The defense claims the shooting was uninterrupted and over within 10
seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy,
27, have pleaded innocent to the second-degree murder charges. If convicted,
they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying of the unarmed black man by the four white officers produced a
flood of pretrial publicity and protests alleging widespread abuse of minorities
by police. An appeals court responded by moving the case to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the plainclothes officers, while searching for dangerous
criminals, made a "conscious decision" to fire 41 bullets at Diallo at 12:40
a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999, without warning; 19 bullets struck the victim. Defense
attorneys argue the shooting was a tragic mistake made after the victim ignored
orders to stop and pulled out a black wallet that appeared to be a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers have not been charged with trying to cover up their alleged
crime. Last week, a lieutenant who arrived on the scene moments after the
shooting testified that the officers were so stunned they couldn't speak.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Vincent took the stand, State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi
barred prosecutors from asking about the fragment of conversation Vincent heard
out her front window because she couldn't identify the speaker. Defense attorney
John Patten had complained that the young housewife's account would leave the
false impression "that police were somehow concocting a story."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, when Vincent began to testify about it, the defense objected. But the
judge overruled, saying the defense itself had "opened the door" by
cross-examining Vincent about another part of the same conversation that
entailed someone cursing.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other witnesses on Monday was a ballistics unit detective who
testified that four bullets fired by Carroll, two by McMellon and two by Boss
were recovered from Diallo's body. Other bullets found under Diallo's body were
shot by Boss and Murphy.
</P>
<P>
	   As the officers' pistols were introduced into evidence and passed around the
defense table, Boss and Carroll appeared to avoid touching them; Murphy and
McMellon simply passed them on. On cross-examination, the detective testified
that the semiautomatics could fire 16 rounds in as little as four seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell, 28, told jurors on the morning of the shooting he was on the phone
with a cousin when gunfire erupted up the block from his apartment. The witness
said he heard four to five shots, followed by a three-to-five second pause, then
a longer, final volley from several guns - a sequence he tapped out on the
witness stand.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys attacked Bell's credibility, suggesting he lived too far
away from the scene to be reliable. But the witness stuck to his story.
</P>
<P>
	   "A pause is a pause, sir," he told an attorney at one point.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution is expected to conclude its case Tuesday by calling the
medical examiner who performed an autopsy on Diallo. The officers have said they
will testify in their own defense.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Lebanon Air Strikes  </HEADLINE>
   By SAM F. GHATTAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes struck a guerrilla stronghold and
power stations across Lebanon early Tuesday, causing widespread blackouts in
apparent retaliation for Hezbollah attacks that killed four Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike came after a week of bloody attacks by the Muslim guerrillas and
graphic footage of wounded Israelis on the evening news in Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   The bloodshed prompted talk that Israel will expedite a planned withdrawal
from Lebanon, but it also created fears of increased violence near the
Israel-Lebanon border. Sirens ordered residents into shelters in Israeli border
towns Monday, and heavily armed troops reported to their commanders at border
crossings.
</P>
<P>
	   Jets began concentrated attacks in Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, unleashing
several air-to-surface missiles and plunging the city immediately in darkness,
witnesses said. Planes also hit a power station in the mountains east of the
northern port city of Tripoli, and followed it with a strike on the Jamhour
substation on a hill overlooking Beirut. There was no word on casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Beirut, the Lebanese capital, was plunged into darkness soon after the raid
as Israeli jets roared over the city for about half an hour. A huge ball of
orange flame and clouds of smoke rose from the Beirut station.
</P>
<P>
	   The same station was hit twice before -- once in June, when Israel
previously punished Lebanon by targeting power stations, and once in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The impacts blew out windows and doors of apartments in Baalbek as jets
roared over the Shiite Muslim-populated city, also home to world-famous Roman
ruins. Soon after the second sortie, ground gunners opened up with anti-aircraft
fire on the raiding jets.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army said the attacks on three power plants in Lebanon were in
response to ``the severe escalation in the activities of Hezbollah and other
organizations in south Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who have harmed us, will be harmed,'' Barak said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   But Israeli officials' attention also turned to the longer-term impact of
the violence. Ministers in Barak's Cabinet said Monday it was becoming clear
that a withdrawal from Lebanon without Syria's agreement was likely.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1985, Israel established a buffer zone in south Lebanon to protect nearby
northern Israeli towns from guerrilla attacks. But Islamic Hezbollah guerrillas
have been fighting to drive the Israelis out ever since, and Barak said last
July 7 that Israel would withdraw within a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak had hoped a pullout would be through an agreement with Syria, the main
power broker in Lebanon. But Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down last month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no point in waiting until July, unless someone thinks that by
then we can achieve an agreement (with Syria),'' said Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
Barak's tourism minister and one of his lead Syria negotiators.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak's Police Minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, said Israelis should not rule out
an earlier withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Some warned that a unilateral withdrawal would be counterproductive,
bringing the Hezbollah within firing range of the Israeli towns arrayed along
the border.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's easy to call for a unilateral withdrawal when you don't consider what
will happen the next day among the northern border communities,'' said
opposition Likud lawmaker Silvan Shalom.
</P>
<P>
	   But the dramatic details of the latest deaths and grisly footage of the
fighting raised public pressure on Barak to make good on his promise to get out.
This week and last, four Israeli soldiers and a senior officer in the
Israel-allied South Lebanese Army died in Hezbollah attacks. On Sunday, a medic
was killed while he was tending to three soldiers wounded in earlier firing.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Barak significantly dropped the clause ``with an agreement'' when
he repeated his pledge to meet the deadline. He also blames Syria for not
restraining -- possibly even encouraging -- the Iranian-backed Hezbollah's
intensified attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Strikes like the one Israel launched early Tuesday usually invite guerrilla
retaliation in the form of Katyusha rockets aimed at northern border towns. As
soon as the army ordered people into shelters Monday night, residents fled the
oft-hit town of Kiryat Shmona in convoys. The army warned that an attack on
Israeli territory would lead to a ``harsh reaction from Israel.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech timed for prime-time newscasts, Barak told Israelis that they
would have to ``bite their lips in determination'' to meet the July deadline --
a warning that further violence was ahead.

<HEADLINE> Key SLA Trial Defense Witness Dies  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A potentially key defense witness in the upcoming trial
of a former Symbionese Liberation Army fugitive has died of cancer, just days
after lawyers asked for an emergency order allowing him to testify early.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Scott, a one-time radical sportswriter who helped Patty Hearst in her
cross-country flight from justice, died of throat cancer Sunday night in Eugene,
Ore., said defense attorney Stuart Hanlon.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Sara Jane Olson had warned the judge that Scott was near death
and asked last Friday for an emergency order to take his testimony. But
prosecutors opposed the move, and resolution of it was postponed until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyer Susan Jordan on Friday had bitterly denounced the prosecution
opposition to Scott's testimony, saying: ``This is a smokescreen. They want to
let this witness die.''
</P>
<P>
	   Olson, formerly known as Kathleen Ann Soliah, is accused of planting pipe
bombs under two Los Angeles police cars in a 1975 plot to avenge the deaths of
six SLA members in a shootout. The bombs did not explode.
</P>
<P>
	   Olson was indicted in 1976. During her years as a fugitive she married a
doctor, had three children and became a community activist and actress in local
productions in St. Paul, Minn. She was arrested near her home last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   She could face life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst, the newspaper heiress who was kidnapped by the SLA and later robbed
a bank with her captors, is expected to testify about her fear of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyers hoped Scott would be able to impeach her credibility by
testifying that she told him she had arranged her own kidnapping in order to
escape her impending marriage and that she stayed with the SLA because the group
treated her so well.

<HEADLINE> University Tries To Recuperate  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Police who ousted striking students from Latin America's
largest university found trash barricading streets, classrooms turned into
campgrounds and laboratories serving as kitchens.
</P>
<P>
	   As officials on Monday surveyed the damage -- and the countless scrawls of
graffiti -- at the National Autonomous University, they faced an even more
daunting task in calming passions at a school with 270,000 students and a
crucial role in Mexican life.
</P>
<P>
	   A day after a police raid that apparently ended a 9 1/2-month strike,
university spokesman Roberto Vivanco said classes could resume after officials
clean up the campus. He gave no date.
</P>
<P>
	   It isn't clear how many students might show up. Some said they would boycott
classes until the more than 700 strike supporters arrested Sunday were freed.
And many other students had already abandoned the university for jobs or other
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike was driven by radicals who saw it as a struggle against global
free-market economics. It began as a protest against tuition increases but
continued long after officials canceled them.
</P>
<P>
	   Interior Secretary Diodoro Carrasco, who oversees the police who carried out
the raid, conceded Monday that the crisis was not over.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the recovery of the installations is a fundamental step, but it
seems to me that it has to be followed by an enormous effort of reconciliation
in the university community,'' he said in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
	   That caution is partly due to the importance of the university known as
UNAM, which is far more significant to Mexico than the Ivy League as a whole is
to the United States. With almost no tuition, its classrooms mingle the children
of Mexico's elite with promising teen-agers from the slums.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Mexico's academic scientific research is done at UNAM laboratories.
Its schools of law and economics have produced four of the past five presidents.
</P>
<P>
	   President Ernesto Zedillo studied elsewhere, but the candidate favored to
succeed him this year, Francisco Labastida, is an UNAM graduate. Most key
figures in Zedillo's administration also attended UNAM. Even the leader of the
leftist Zapatista rebels studied at UNAM.
</P>
<P>
	   Campus politics can have long-term effects on national politics. And many
anti-strike UNAM students and faculty were outraged by the use of police to end
the strike, seeing it as a blow to the university's cherished autonomy.
</P>
<P>
	   Memory of a 1968 government massacre of students was one reason why the
government avoided intervening for so long -- and why the eventual use of police
was so traumatic to many.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoping to heal those wounds, Rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente urged officials
to drop most charges against those arrested and to be lenient with those who are
convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the university, however, Mexicans favored the police action by a 2-1
margin, according to a poll published Monday by the daily newspaper Reforma.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the strike, UNAM had about 120,000 students in its system of high
schools and another 150,000 in university-level programs. All live off campus
and the total includes several research centers far beyond UNAM's sprawling
University City in southern Mexico City. The sheer size of the school
overshadows any in the United States. The University of Texas-Austin, one of the
biggest American universities, has just over 49,000 students.
</P>
<P>
	   But the strike prompted many students to take jobs or shift to other
universities. Officials have no idea how many will show up for classes once they
resume.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wanted to study at UNAM, but now, knowing how little prestige a degree
is going to have, I am going to have to go somewhere else,'' said Victor Manuel
Cabrera, an 18-year-old UNAM high school student waiting Monday outside the
federal attorney general's office for word of his sister, an arrested striker.
</P>
<P>
	   Some vowed to boycott classes until the arrested strikers are freed from
jail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot return to class and leave our comrades inside,'' said Lorena
Estejel, 17, a high-school student who wants to study dentistry.

<HEADLINE> Scopes Papers Sought After Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Tenn. (AP) -- Fire broke out at a Bryan College building that
contained historical documents from the famed Scopes ``Monkey Trial,'' but few
papers tied to the famed case were damaged and no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   The most significant loss of the college's memorabilia from the trial of
John Scopes, a science teacher prosecuted for teaching evolution, was William
Jennings Bryan's personal copy of Charles Darwin's ``The Origin of Species.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bryan, namesake for the nondenominational Christian college, argued in
support of Tennessee's ban on teaching evolution in public schools. Clarence
Darrow argued against it in the celebrated 1925 trial in Dayton, some 35 miles
north of Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
	   Scopes was convicted, but the verdict was overturned.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryan College, founded in 1930, kept parts of its ``Monkey Trial''
collection of photos, recordings, newspaper clippings and other library
materials on all three floors of the campus' main building.
</P>
<P>
	   That building caught fire Sunday evening, but only the top floor burned.
</P>
<P>
	   The third floor housed the college's rare books collection, including
Bryan's books, as well as computer laboratories and a natural history museum of
preserved animals, insects and seashells from around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All of that is gone now,'' school spokesman Tom Davis said. ``There is no
telling the value.''
</P>
<P>
	   The rest of the building, which was completed in the 1950s and had no
sprinkler system, housed administrative and faculty offices, a campus book
store, a student recreational area and a Scopes trial museum.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes for the school's 550 students were to resume Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Pop Song Becomes Campaign Fodder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A song by pop star Billy Joel has become campaign fodder in
the Senate race between Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Joel's 1973 song ``Captain Jack'' about drug use was among the songs on a
tape of ``Billy Joel's Greatest Hits'' played Sunday for the audience at the
State University of New York at Purchase prior to Clinton's official
announcement that she was running.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was a very, very orchestrated and scripted event,'' Giuliani said
Monday. ``The message that got out by mistake was, 'Let's say yes to drugs.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said campaign officials had
nothing to do with the choice of the song and that neither the first lady nor
President Clinton was in the hall when it was playing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The sound guy stuck the tape in,'' said Wolfson. ``It wasn't our tape. We
didn't hear it. We weren't aware of it.''

<HEADLINE> Diallo Neighbor Testifies on Remark  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Amadou Diallo's next-door neighbor testified Monday
that moments after Diallo died in a hail of 41 police bullets, she overheard a
man making a remark suggesting a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``OK. OK. We're going to say this,'' Ida Vincent, testifying at the murder
trial of four New York City policemen, quoted the man as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Vincent said she couldn't say whether the fragment of conversation heard
outside her front window in the Bronx came from any of the officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Vincent also became one of three prosecution ``ear witnesses'' so far to
tell jurors the barrage that killed the 22-year-old West African immigrant was
interrupted by a pause. Another neighbor, a police recruit named Thomas Bell,
testified the pause lasted up to five seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   The pause -- which Vincent said was as long as a ``few seconds'' -- could be
used to argue the officers had a chance to stop firing. The defense claims the
shooting was continuous.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell, 28, told jurors that on the morning of the shooting he was on the
phone when gunfire erupted up the block from his apartment. The witness said he
heard four to five shots, followed by a three-to-five second pause, then a
longer, final volley from several guns -- a sequence he tapped out on the
witness stand.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys attacked Bell's credibility, suggesting he lived too far
away from the scene to be reliable. But Bell stuck to his story.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A pause is a pause, sir,'' he said at one point.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant, was shot 19 times last February
by plainclothes officers searching for dangerous criminals. The defense contends
the shooting was a tragic mistake made after the victim ignored orders to stop
and pulled out a black wallet that looked like a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy,
27, could get 25 years to life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying of the black man by four white officers produced a flood of
publicity and protests alleging widespread abuse of minorities by police. An
appeals court responded by moving the case to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors plan to call to the stand a medical examiner who will testify
that one of the bullets tunneled up Diallo's leg. That could help prove the
prosecution's claim that the officers kept shooting as Diallo was falling down
or on the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense has argued Diallo remained standing throughout the barrage of
gunfire, making him appear still to be a threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Vincent took the stand, Justice Joseph Teresi had ruled that the
prosecution could not ask about the remark she claimed to have overheard.
</P>
<P>
	   When Vincent began to testify about it, the defense objected. But the judge
said the defense itself had opened the door by asking Vincent about other
remarks she claimed she overheard in the aftermath of the shooting, including a
man cursing.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Defense Minister Killed  </HEADLINE>
   By JOVANA GEC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia's defense minister was fatally shot
Monday in a Belgrade restaurant, the latest and the highest-ranking victim in a
spate of gangland-style killings.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic, a loyal aide to President Slobodan
Milosevic, died at the Belgrade military hospital where he was taken after being
shot in the dining area of the soccer club Rad, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Montenegrin police said the gunman fired through a window of the restaurant,
hitting Bulatovic; the restaurant's owner, Mirko Knezevic; and banker Vuk
Obradovic from behind with automatic weapon fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Knezevic and Obradovic were slightly wounded, police said in a statement
carried by the official Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yugoslav government, which met for an urgent session, said in a
statement that Bulatovic ``was the victim of a classic terrorist act'' and
pledged to fight against ``terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agency said an urgent government session
was called for later Monday to discuss the assassination. Milosevic sent
condolences to Bulatovic's family, media reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack came less than a month after Serbia's most infamous warlord,
Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan, was gunned down in a Belgrade hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a dozen prominent people, some close to Milosevic, have been
killed in Belgrade in the past decade. Most of the killings have never been
solved nor the perpetrators apprehended.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the shooting, the area where Bulatovic sat at a corner table
was covered with blood and the floor was littered with debris. Pieces of plates
and broken glass were scattered around. Bullet holes were seen on the walls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bullets were shot from the outside, through the window, a few rounds
of fire,'' said waiter Andrija Jecmenica.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic, 52, had been defense minister of Yugoslavia since 1994. Bulatovic
was largely a figurehead minister, with all the major decisions being made by
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   From 1992 to 1994, Bulatovic served as Yugoslav interior minister in the
government of Milan Panic, a Serb-born businessman who was sacked by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic was a member of a pro-Serb faction in Montenegro loyal to
Milosevic and his Socialist Peoples Party is at odds with the Montenegrin
pro-Western government of President Milo Djukanovic. Yugoslavia is made up of
two republics, Serbia and the smaller Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
	   Miodrag Vlahovic, a political analyst in Montenegro's capital Podgorica,
said the killing of Bulatovic could be the result of a ``conflict of interest''
concerning business arrangements among top Yugoslav officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic was very close to Momir Bulatovic, the Yugoslav premier and close
ally of Milosevic. The two were not related.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The country in which the defense minister is killed like that in a
restaurant is a real banana republic, there is no doubt about that,'' Vlahovic
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition leader Vuk Obradovic, not related to the wounded man of the same
name, said Milosevic and other top government officials must resign because they
have turned the country ``into a criminal society where no one can feel safe any
more.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic is survived by his wife and two children.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Trade Barbs  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and Sen.
John McCain charged one another Monday with running smear campaigns disguised as
telephone polling in South Carolina, a key Republican primary state.
</P>
<P>
	   Pollsters for both camps are calling voters and asking pointed questions
about their opponents, a practice that could be seen as ``push polling'' in
which an interviewer distorts a candidate's position in an attempt to sway
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's aides denied they were conducting push polls because only 300 people
were called by a firm hired by the campaign, well short of the ``thousands and
thousands'' of calls normally made during such surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said it was McCain who had commissioned a push
poll -- something the Arizona senator's camp denied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain's campaign is calling up large numbers of people and
distorting Governor Bush's position'' on tax cuts, Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's aides said their pollster, Bill McInturff, wrote a script that is
asking for voter's opinions of the candidates' positions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We do not, and will not, do push polling of any kind,'' said McCain
spokesman Dan McLagan. The campaign wouldn't say how many calls have been made.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither campaign would release full interview scripts for the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky said the campaign asks ``which of the
following statements best describes'' Bush, McCain, neither of the candidates,
both of them or don't know. He offered one example phrase: ``Is someone I like
and trust.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's a real poll question,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Push polling has nothing to do with how many people are polled,'' Opinsky
added. ``It has to do with the negative distorted information displayed as fact
under the guise of a real poll.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's supporters started the volley of accusations Monday with a press
conference in Columbia, S.C., featuring a young woman who said she received a
call on Sunday that distorted McCain's positions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Total misrepresentation is pretty much what I'd call it,'' said Suzette
Latsko, 22, who had attended a McCain rally but hadn't decided whether to vote
for him.
</P>
<P>
	   According to notes Latsko took, the pollster asked her:
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do you support McCain's effort to pass the largest tax increase in
history?''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Fleischer said the script asks voters to state whether they
approve or disapprove of the following: ``John McCain says he never voted for a
tax increase, but he wrote legislation that proposed the largest tax increase in
U.S. history.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement, Fleischer said, refers to McCain's perennial sponsorship of
tobacco reform legislation, which proposed billions of dollars in tobacco taxes.
In recent years, the bill also offered funding to help farmers find other lines
of work. South Carolina is one of the nation's top producers of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   Latsko also said she was asked: ``How do you feel about McCain's plan to
publicly fund elections?''
</P>
<P>
	   Fleischer said the script does not contain the phrase ``publicly funded,''
but states that McCain ``has written legislation that would use taxpayer dollars
to pay for political campaigns.'' McCain has said he opposes public funding of
elections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain's supporters are twisting the words in an attempt to make
it inaccurate,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fleischer said the campaign uses the responses to ``determine how much
familiarity they had with Senator McCain's record, with the status of the race
in South Carolina and with issues that they care about'' to help Bush shape his
message.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's aides scoffed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Like pornography, you know a push poll when you see one,'' said Opinsky.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Discrimination Ban Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to sign an executive order
barring federal agencies from discriminating against workers on the basis of
genetic tests, a step prompted by fears about rapid advances in scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
	   The order, which congressional aides said Clinton would sign Tuesday, echoes
a bill sponsored by Sens. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
barring employers from refusing to hire people at risk for health problems and
insurers from refusing to sell them coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Monday
that Clinton would announce his decision during a speech at the National Academy
of Sciences. White House aides declined comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Advances in genetic testing will soon allow doctors to predict the medical
futures of their patients. That has raised concerns that such information could
be against those who are likely to suffer from cancer, diabetes, heart disease
or other ailments.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has been speaking out on the issue for years. In his 1998 State of
the Union speech, he declared that ``we must see that science serves humanity,
not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any
American,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ranit Schmelzer, Daschle's spokeswoman, said the Senate minority leader has
long argued that ``as more information about people's future health becomes
available it becomes important to protect that information.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``People shouldn't be discriminated against in employment or in other areas
because of some genetic information that may be available on them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The order Clinton was signing would restrict federal agencies' abilities to
collect or use genetic information, the sources said, including family medical
histories. The order was limited to civilian employees of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Exceptions to such data collection would be allowed in cases where workers
give written consent as part of a health care program monitoring their medical
conditions. Another exception would be granted for gathering information to
study workplace safety.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the order, Clinton was expected to voice his support for the
Daschle-Kennedy legislation, which would extend assurances against abuse of
genetic information to the general public -- a step that would require
congressional action.

<HEADLINE> $1.84 Trillion Budget Unveiled  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To a chorus of Republican ridicule, President Clinton
sent Congress his budget finale on Monday, a $1.84 trillion plan to expand
health care access, shrink the national debt and shower Democratic
constituencies with election-year largesse.
</P>
<P>
	   Blessed with a budgetary bonanza that past presidents could only dream about
-- a projected $2.92 trillion in federal surpluses over the next decade --
Clinton used his spending outline to propose something for almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
	   He would cut taxes for the sick, elderly, poor and college-bound; spend more
for the environment, schools and gun-law enforcement; and erase the $3.7
trillion publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal is sure to be heavily reworked by Congress, where defiant
Republicans dismissed it as a gambit to bolster Vice President Al Gore's
presidential bid and the Democratic drive to capture Congress. They promised to
fatten the plan's tax cuts, trim its spending boosts and ignore its tax
increases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has all things for everyone they feel they'll need to get Al Gore
elected president,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio,
who called it ``the president's fantasy budget.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I look forward to working with the president in putting together a serious
spending proposal,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
``But this is a document designed to help Al Gore win election.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was little denying presidential politics at the White House, where
officials said at least a dozen Gore proposals were latticed into the outline.
But beyond that, Clinton's farewell spending blueprint -- for fiscal 2001,
beginning Oct. 1 -- was an effort to choose the terrain of this year's budget
battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton proposed $351 billion in tax cuts through 2010 that he argues can
only be enlarged by eroding Social Security's trust funds, diluting efforts to
expand and strengthen Medicare, or slashing other popular initiatives such as
hiring teachers or reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This budget, in short, makes really strong and significant steps toward
achieving the great goals that I believe America should pursue in this new
century,'' Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans said that at a time of surplus, taxpayers should get a bigger
break than Clinton wants to give them.
</P>
<P>
	   They criticized his proposal to raise other revenues by $181 billion over 10
years, including higher taxes on cigarettes and some corporate transactions. And
they noted that using Clinton's own figures, there would be a net $9 billion tax
increase in 2001 and a $1 billion increase in 2002 before annual tax cuts begin
to outweigh increases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me be very clear: This Congress will not raise taxes,'' said House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton took congressional predictions that his plan was dead on arrival in
stride: ``That's what they said in '99, and we got most of it; that's what they
said in '98, and we got most of it,'' he asserted on CNN's ``Money Line.''
</P>
<P>
	   Strikingly, the president's budget boasted few initiatives that he has not
proposed before.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the new ones was a $91 billion, 10-year effort to expand health
coverage for working poor families. It is aimed at covering 5 million of the 44
million Americans who lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   He also called for setting aside $35 billion, beginning in 2006, for extra
prescription drug coverage for the sickest Medicare patients. This is on top of
a $160 billion, 10-year plan for prescription drug benefits for Medicare
patients, similar to his proposal of last year that Congress ignored.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also proposed extra spending to help farmers deal with low
commodities prices; about the same $278 billion Pentagon budget as this year;
and extra money to buy park lands, modernize schools and hire new federal agents
and prosecutors who focus on gun laws.
</P>
<P>
	   In one area of bipartisan agreement, the president would set aside the $2.17
trillion Social Security surplus over the next decade for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   By 2013, he said, the $3.7 trillion portion of the national debt should be
gone for the first time since 1835, which economists say should lower interest
rates and add muscle to the economy. The rest of the $5.7 trillion national debt
is money in federal trust funds such as Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton estimates that over the next 10 years, there will be a $746 billion
surplus in the rest of the budget -- a figure that will be pivotal in this
year's fiscal fight.
</P>
<P>
	   He would use this money to help pay for his tax cut, the prescription drug
proposal, the health insurance initiative for poor families and additional debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Republicans have made no final decisions, they will estimate this
part of the surplus to be hundreds of billions larger than $746 billion. That
would leave more room for the bigger tax cuts favored by most Republicans,
including the $1.3 trillion, 10-year plan advanced by GOP presidential contender
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's surplus estimate is smaller because he assumes that spending for
the one-third of the budget Congress determines every year will grow annually at
nearly the rate of inflation. Republicans say spending for this portion of the
budget -- which includes everything but automatically paid benefits like Social
Security -- will not grow that fast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is government on autopilot,'' Domenici said.
</P>
<P>
	   By crediting some debt reduction to Medicare and Social Security, Clinton
said his plan would extend Social Security solvency to 2050 and Medicare's to
2025.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton proposed no overhaul of either program's benefits or revenues,
which many analysts say must occur to prepare for the looming retirement of the
baby boomers. That omission seemed a concession that bipartisan consensus this
election year is impossible on those politically charged programs.

<HEADLINE> Federal budget contains New York goodies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Clinton's farewell budget proposal beefs up
spending on education and health care, critical issues in New York that his wife
has made cornerstones of her Senate campaign.
<P>
	   The president would increase spending by millions of dollars for Head Start,
after school programs and school construction.
</P>
<P>
	   All are initiatives embraced by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who officially threw
her hat into the U.S. Senate race the day before her husband unveiled his $1.84
trillion budget proposal. The president's plan would create more than 7,000 new
Head Start slots in New York and would increase education spending by millions
of dollars largely through a class-size reduction initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's plan also contains a $10,000 college tuition tax credit at a
cost of $31 billion. The tuition tax break, popular with middle-class suburban
voters like those the first lady must woo in New York, was first put forward by
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-NY. The first lady has been pushing it lately on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
	   On the health front, the president's plan would spend $168 billion over 10
years to create a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients.
Prescription coverage is another campaign theme of the first lady, who authored
the president's ill-fated health care reform plan.
</P>
<P>
	   But the president's spending plan isn't all good news for New York.
</P>
<P>
	   While Clinton in 1998 offered the federally-owned Governor's Island for sale
to New York State for $1, the asking price was upped to some $30 million in the
fiscal year 2001 plan the Clinton administration unveiled Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   But a letter from White House Budget Director Jack Lew to Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., indicated that the White House was willing to knock
that down to "nominal price" once a plan incorporating public use was finalized.
</P>
<P>
	   New York state and city have agreed on a plan to turn the for the 172-acre
island into a tourist center complete with a major hotel, a conference and
commercial center, an arts and cultural exhibit hall, a sports complex and open
space for public use. Located in the middle of New York Harbor, Governor's
Island has been occupied only by migratory birds and a small caretakers staff
since the U.S. Coast Guard left in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has ordered it sold for "fair market value" of $500 million in
2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, an analysis of the president's budget plan conducted by Schumer
and Rep. Nita Lowey, D-Westchester County, determined that it would bring in
hundreds of millions more for New York City than the GOP-led Congress is
currently spending.
</P>
<P>
	   "This plan makes it clear that the priorities of New Yorkers are the
priorities of the administration and the Democrats in Congress," Lowey said.
</P>
<P>
	   But some Republicans groused that the president's heavy-spending plan seemed
designed to boost his wife's Senate campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's targeting his tax proposals where he believes they can do her the most
good," said Rep. John Sweeney, R-Saratoga County.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Thomas Reynolds, a Republican from the Buffalo area, agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Clinton family is the most political family in America so if there is a
way they could benefit from the budget they would," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's perfecting his legacy as an indiscriminate big spender with this
budget," Reynolds added.
</P>
<P>
	   But Moynihan praised the president's discipline in paying down the debt.
</P>
<P>
	   "As I have said on numerous occasions our first priority should be to pay
down the national debt," New York's senior senator said. "The president proposes
to do just that. Under his budget, the debt held by the public is eliminated by
2013."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the New York projects funded in the president's budget plan for New
York:
</P>
<P>
	   -$20 million to convert the James A. Farley Post Office into the new Penn
Station.
</P>
<P>
	   -$10 million for the East Side Access Project to connect the Long Island
Railroad with the New York City subway's east side trains through Grand Central
Station.
</P>
<P>
	   -$10.3 million for Fort Drum Consolidated Soldier Support Center.
</P>
<P>
	   -$13.6 million for United States Military Academy at West Point for Cadet
Physical Development Center.
</P>
<P>
	   -$7 million to combat the Asian Longhorned Beetle that has infested
thousands of trees in New York City.

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Union Meet With Mediator  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- Representatives of The Boeing Co. and its engineering and
technical workers' union met with a federal mediator on Monday to discuss an
impasse over contract issues.
</P>
<P>
	   The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace voted down
Boeing's latest offer on Wednesday, but stopped short of calling a strike when
the mediator, C. Richard Barnes, agreed to intervene.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnes, head of the Federal Mediation and Reconciliation Service, met with
both sides for five minutes Monday to lay the ground rules for the talks, then
sent them to separate rooms and began shuttling between them. The talks
continued for at least three hours.
</P>
<P>
	   At Boeing facilities, workers reacted to a company memo asking for no
demonstrations or walkouts during the talks. At least 750 employees marched in
Everett, while another 250 marched around the Museum of Flight across from
Boeing's headquarters, said SPEEA spokesman Bill Dugovich.
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to the talks, neither side seemed particularly confident about a
friendly resolution. Boeing took away its previous offer, narrowly rejected
51-49 percent, and said it would no longer collect union dues until a new
contract was approved.
</P>
<P>
	   For its part, the union spoke with picket captains over the weekend about
strike procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   "They keep trying to use these bullying tactics," said SPEEA Executive
Director Charles Bofferding, regarding Boeing's decision on union dues. "I don't
think they've shown an inkling that they're willing to negotiate with us."
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said the dues move was perfectly legal since
there is no contract, and was done to help bring leverage to bear in the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   "The union can call for a strike, and we can refuse to collect dues, which
is a courtesy to the union on our part to begin with," Conte said. "These are
pressures that both sides are bringing."
</P>
<P>
	   Bofferding said the members of the union are ready to strike, despite the
slim margin of the previous vote. He said the union was willing to give
mediation a try, but would walk out and strike if Boeing proved intractable on
its positions regarding pay raises and benefits.

<HEADLINE> Diallo Trial City Is Pro-Police  </HEADLINE>
   By LYNN BREZOSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Albany County, New York. Middle-class, 90 percent
white, with a strong Irish Catholic heritage. A place where, tradition had it,
cops were there to guard your door and ignore your wager.
</P>
<P>
	   If there's a better place to defend a police officer, Albany defense
attorney Terence Kindlon says, he hasn't heard of it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People here just like police,'' Kindlon says. ``They're inclined to trust
authority.''
</P>
<P>
	   New York Post columnist Bob McManus, who grew up here, readily agrees. He
says Albany has a strong ``Irish Catholic conservative civil service view of the
world.'' ``They like their cops,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
	   So it makes sense to both of them that the four white New York City
policemen charged with murder in the Bronx slaying of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
West African immigrant killed in a barrage of 41 bullets, would have a better
chance with a jury in Albany than one in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial opened last week after a jury of eight whites and four blacks was
selected.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was moved to Albany, 150 miles north of New York City, after
defense attorneys argued, among other things, that the Bronx has a reputation
for being hostile to police.
</P>
<P>
	   In Bronx County, which is two-thirds black and Hispanic, the police have
become outsiders, McManus says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The NYPD is second- and third-generation officers whose families' have
moved to Long Island and Rockland County to get away from the pressures of what
they were policing,'' he says. ``They're refugees going back to butt heads with
people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the outcome of the Diallo case is far from certain.
</P>
<P>
	   While the defense will argue that the four police officers thought Diallo
was reaching for a gun and that it was all a tragic mistake, the 41 shots fired
could make a powerful impression on any jury.
</P>
<P>
	   And Kindlon and McManus believe that Albany is not as pro-police as it was,
say, a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past month, Albany juries have accepted arguments that a
well-respected detective forged a confession in the murder of an 82-year-old
former minister and that police were overzealous in arresting a man who helped
an alleged cop shooter escape.
</P>
<P>
	   In that latter case, police officers were caught on videotape roughing up
store clerks in search of the alleged shooter. The video led to internal
disciplinary action against four officers that once would have been unheard of.
</P>
<P>
	   Some criminal justice experts, such as Boston College law professor Robert
M. Bloom, say confidence in police around the country and in Albany is weakening
because of such things as the Rodney King beating in Los Angeles and the Abner
Louima case in New York City, in which the black defendant was sodomized with a
broomstick in a police station bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   More recently, police officers on highways across America have been accused
of routinely pulling over blacks in what is known as racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even in a place like Albany, conservative with an almost Midwestern feel,
there is a general feeling that you just can't take a police officer's word
anymore,'' says Albany Times Union columnist Fred LeBrun.
</P>
<P>
	   The convenience store rampage by police has black activists up in arms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was very scary, to have police come out as though they were a gang.
They're supposed to be the ones protecting us. So who are we going to call?''
says Darryl Lahon, whose grocery store video camera caught police on tape.
</P>
<P>
	   It's the same frustration that is heard in the Bronx, says James Cohen, a
law professor at Fordham University there. ``The feeling is people in power --
the white people -- tend to treat people without power differently. They tend to
treat them worse,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
	   Recently there have been other cases in the Albany area that could give the
defense in the Diallo trial reason for both optimism and concern.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year in Albany, a black basketball player at the College of Saint Rose
claimed he was beaten by two white, off-duty police officers in a police garage
following a bar fight. The officers were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
	   In nearby Schenectady, a busload of partying off-duty police officers
cruised a crime-ridden area in 1997, throwing eggs out the bus windows.
Community leaders accused the officers of shouting racial slurs. Local news
agencies lost their battle to get the names of the officers released.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Frankly, you get enough of this stuff, it cracks through into people's
consciousness,'' Kindlon says. ``My sense is that every day it gets a little
easier to hear stories about bad cops all over the place.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Lebanon Air Strikes  </HEADLINE>
   By SAM F. GHATTAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes struck a guerrilla stronghold and
power stations across Lebanon early Tuesday, causing widespread blackouts in
apparent retaliation for Hezbollah attacks that killed five Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike came after a week of bloody attacks by the Muslim guerrillas and
graphic footage of wounded Israelis on the evening news in Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   The bloodshed prompted talk that Israel will expedite a planned withdrawal
from Lebanon, but it also created fears of increased violence near the
Israel-Lebanon border. Sirens ordered residents into shelters in Israeli border
towns Monday, and heavily armed troops reported to their commanders at border
crossings.
</P>
<P>
	   Jets began concentrated attacks in Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, unleashing
several air-to-surface missiles and plunging the city immediately in darkness,
witnesses said. Planes also hit a power station in the mountains east of the
northern port city of Tripoli, and followed it with a strike on the Jamhour
substation on a hill overlooking Beirut. There was no word on casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Beirut, the Lebanese capital, was plunged into darkness soon after the raid
as Israeli jets roared over the city for about half an hour. A huge ball of
orange flame and clouds of smoke rose from the Beirut station.
</P>
<P>
	   The same station was hit twice before -- once in June, when Israel
previously punished Lebanon by targeting power stations, and once in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The impacts blew out windows and doors of apartments in Baalbek as jets
roared over the Shiite Muslim-populated city, also home to world-famous Roman
ruins. Soon after the second sortie, ground gunners opened up with anti-aircraft
fire on the raiding jets.
</P>
<P>
	   A second wave of warplanes hit a television relay station belonging to
Hezbollah on the southeastern edge of Baalbek and there were reports that
Hezbollah targets south of the city were also hit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army said the attacks on three power plants in Lebanon were in
response to ``the severe escalation in the activities of Hezbollah and other
organizations in south Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who have harmed us, will be harmed,'' Barak said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   But Israeli officials' attention also turned to the longer-term impact of
the violence. Ministers in Barak's Cabinet said Monday it was becoming clear
that a withdrawal from Lebanon without Syria's agreement was likely.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1985, Israel established a buffer zone in south Lebanon to protect nearby
northern Israeli towns from guerrilla attacks. But Islamic Hezbollah guerrillas
have been fighting to drive the Israelis out ever since, and Barak said last
July 7 that Israel would withdraw within a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak had hoped a pullout would be through an agreement with Syria, the main
power broker in Lebanon. But Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down last month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no point in waiting until July, unless someone thinks that by
then we can achieve an agreement (with Syria),'' said Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
Barak's tourism minister and one of his lead Syria negotiators.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak's Police Minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, said Israelis should not rule out
an earlier withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Some warned that a unilateral withdrawal would be counterproductive,
bringing the Hezbollah within firing range of the Israeli towns arrayed along
the border.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's easy to call for a unilateral withdrawal when you don't consider what
will happen the next day among the northern border communities,'' said
opposition Likud lawmaker Silvan Shalom.
</P>
<P>
	   But the dramatic details of the latest deaths and grisly footage of the
fighting raised public pressure on Barak to make good on his promise to get out.
This week and last, five Israeli soldiers and a senior officer in the
Israel-allied South Lebanese Army died in Hezbollah attacks. On Sunday, a medic
was killed while he was tending to three soldiers wounded in earlier firing.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Barak significantly dropped the clause ``with an agreement'' when
he repeated his pledge to meet the deadline. He also blames Syria for not
restraining -- possibly even encouraging -- the Iranian-backed Hezbollah's
intensified attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Strikes like the one Israel launched early Tuesday usually invite guerrilla
retaliation in the form of Katyusha rockets aimed at northern border towns. As
soon as the army ordered people into shelters Monday night, residents fled the
oft-hit town of Kiryat Shmona in convoys. The army warned that an attack on
Israeli territory would lead to a ``harsh reaction from Israel.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech timed for prime-time newscasts, Barak told Israelis that they
would have to ``bite their lips in determination'' to meet the July deadline --
a warning that further violence was ahead.

<HEADLINE> Overheated Motors May Impact MD-80s  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW FORDAHL AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Worried about the problem suspected in the crash of
Alaska Airlines Flight 261, pilots may be inadvertently overheating the motors
on airplane stabilizers by repeatedly testing them before takeoff.
</P>
<P>
	   In the week since the Jan. 31 crash that killed 88 people, three MD-80
series jetliners have returned to their gates because of stabilizer problems.
Two can probably be traced to the pilots' testing and retesting the equipment,
airline officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It may be that some pilots are being overly cautious and are running
through their checks several more times than they typically do with their
stabilizer,'' said Jack Evans, an Alaska Airlines spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   The crew of Flight 261, en route from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San
Francisco and then Seattle, struggled with a stabilizer problem for at least 30
minutes before the plane corkscrewed into the Pacific. The MD-83 was trying to
make an emergency landing in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The horizontal stabilizer is a moveable, 40-foot wing mounted high on the
aircraft's tail. National Transportation Safety Board investigators have not
determined the cause of the crash but are focusing on the device.
</P>
<P>
	   The horizontal stabilizer controls the up-and-down motion of the plane
during flight. It is controlled by two motors that turn a jackscrew, similar to
the mechanism that controls garage door openers.
</P>
<P>
	   During a flight, the motors force more than 100 adjustments, slightly
changing the pitch as the airliner uses fuel and as other conditions change.
</P>
<P>
	   On the ground, the motors can last up to 90 seconds before overheating and
shutting down. It is usually not a problem in flight because of the cold
temperatures in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
	   After shutting down, the motors should become operative again after cooling
down for several minutes, said John Thom, spokesman for Boeing, which bought
McDonnell Douglas, maker of the MD-80 series planes, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are getting the word out there (to pilots) to make sure you give enough
time for these motors to cool down if you do go through the check again,'' Evans
said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, an Alaska Airlines MD-83 jet returned to the airport in Reno,
Nev., minutes after taking off for Seattle. The NTSB is investigating, but the
airline said it was probably caused by an overheated stabilizer motor.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, an Alaska MD-80 taxiing toward the runway in Seattle
experienced ``intermittent problems'' with the stabilizer motor. After returning
to the gate, the parts were swapped out and the plane took off without further
incident.
</P>
<P>
	   An American Airlines MD-83 flight out of Phoenix returned to the gate last
week with a stabilizer problem, but investigators said it may have been caused
by a faulty control switch in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's usually an increase in reports of concerns by pilots about similar
conditions after an accident,'' said Mitch Barker, an FAA spokesman in Seattle.
``It just raises the visibility and everyone's sensitivity to the possibility.''
</P>
<P>
	   Added Steve Roach, a pilot union official who flew MD-80s for three years:
``You don't change your procedures, but guys tend to focus a little bit more on
the systems involved. (Pilots) spend more time looking at those things, paying
attention to them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pete Harkovitch, who was a passenger on the jet that had to return to Reno,
said he will avoid MD-80 series planes until investigators figure out what
happened to Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was terrified,'' said the 42-year-old Fairbanks, Alaska, resident, who
flies two to three times a month. ``It was too close to the other accident that
killed so many innocent people. If MD-80s look like they're trouble-free, then
I'll go back on them, but if I had to fly tomorrow, I'd take something else.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Small Planes Crash Kills 4  </HEADLINE>
   By CADONNA M. PEYTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two small planes collided over Los Angeles Monday, one
crashing in flames on a golf course and the other falling into trees near a
freeway. All four people aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   No one on the ground was hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Two men were killed in the plane that plunged through power lines and landed
on the golf course, and a couple believed to be in their 60s died in the other
plane, which fell into trees near busy Interstate 5, said Fire Department
spokesman Bob Collis.
</P>
<P>
	   Golfers on the sixth fairway at Cascades Golf Club scattered as burning
debris fell out of the sky over the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
	   One group of golfers was talking about last week's Alaska Airlines crash off
the Southern California coast when the planes collided overhead about 9:50 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We heard a loud popping sort of sound,'' said Jeff Childers, 50. ``It
immediately exploded on the lines, then fell to the ground and burned intensely.
You could smell the seat materials and fuel burning.''
</P>
<P>
	   The single-engine Bellanca Citabria, was patrolling oil pipelines between
Bakersfield and Los Angeles when it collided with the couple's Questair
experimental plane, said George Petterson, investigator for the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   The Citabria is a high-wing plane, and the Questair a low-wing aircraft.
Petterson said it is possible that the combination made it difficult for the
pilots to see each other.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A wing does block your view, and it is a seen-and-be-seen concept of
flight,'' Petterson said.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB investigators were trying to determine altitude information about the
planes and recover a flight recorder, Petterson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both planes contacted Van Nuys Airport just before they collided about nine
miles north of the airport, Petterson said. The Questair pilot told controllers
the plane was going to land there, but it had not yet been given clearance at
the time of the crash, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kirsti Dunn said neither pilot
reported problems before the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Nuys Airport, in the heart of the San Fernando Valley, is considered the
world's busiest general aviation airport with nearly 607,000 flight operations
last year, according to the city airport department. About 730 aircraft are
based at Van Nuys.

<HEADLINE> Calumet Execs Guilty of Fraud  </HEADLINE>
   By MEGAN K. STACK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- The president and chief financial officer of a renowned
thoroughbred farm were convicted of conspiracy, fraud and bribery Monday for
paying off a banker to win large unsecured loans for their stables.
</P>
<P>
	   J.T. Lundy and Gary Matthews once ran one of the most celebrated
thoroughbred stables in the world, Calumet Farm. Prosecutors painted a picture
of the men's life in the late 1980s as one of prime seats at the Kentucky Derby,
forays to France, priceless art and fast money.
</P>
<P>
	   The good times came to a screeching halt in 1991, when the Lexington, Ky.,
stables declared bankruptcy. It later was sold at auction.
</P>
<P>
	   The government had spent the past three weeks describing financial schemes
they say were carried out behind the scenes during the years leading to the
collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   While Calumet's fortunes secretly evaporated, prosecutors say, Lundy and
Matthews paid First City Bancorporation vice chairman Frank Cihak a $1 million
bribe.
</P>
<P>
	   The Calumet officials also presented the Houston banker with a pair of mares
and breeding rights to Alydar, the stable's most esteemed stud, the government
alleged.
</P>
<P>
	   In exchange, First City loaned the stables $65 million without checking the
farm's credit or value, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   During closing arguments Monday, defense lawyers told the panel the
government failed to demonstrate the duo's guilt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If time has distorted the evidence to the point where (proving guilt)
can't be done, that is their problem,'' Lundy's attorney Dave McGee said,
wagging a finger at the jury. ``Not ours.''
</P>
<P>
	   First City struggled after Calumet, one of the bank's biggest loan clients,
folded. Shortly after the stables declared bankruptcy, the Houston bank failed.
</P>
<P>
	   Cihak and four associates were convicted on fraud and money laundering
charges. Cihak was sentenced to more than 12 years in federal prison in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the fate of the stallion Alydar took a tragic turn. Calumet gave
Alydar, the runner-up to Affirmed in all three Triple Crown races in 1978, a
lethal injection after the prized stud's leg was broken inexplicably.
</P>
<P>
	   Calumet cashed in a $35 million insurance policy on the stallion. The FBI is
investigating the horse's mysterious death.

<HEADLINE> Democrat Fund-Raising Trial Starts  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At the start of a long-delayed trial for a former
Clinton-Gore fund-raiser, the Justice Department said Monday that businesswoman
Maria Hsia concealed the source of more than $100,000 in illegal donations.
</P>
<P>
	   Hsia's lawyer retorted that the Los Angeles immigration consultant is the
victim of ``a smear job'' by federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The system breaks down'' because of people like Hsia, who ``time and time
again engaged in these schemes'' in the 1996 election campaign, prosecutor Eric
Yaffe told the U.S. District Court jury in opening statements.
</P>
<P>
	   In becoming ``a major player in the Democratic Party,'' Yaffe said, Hsia
tapped well-to-do business acquaintances secretly to reimburse straw donors and
conduits for cash who were falsely listed in federal election records as
contributors.
</P>
<P>
	   Hsia faces five felony counts of causing various Democratic campaign
treasurers unwittingly to file false reports with the Federal Election
Commission. Two charges deal with a 1995 Clinton-Gore fund-raiser in California,
two revolve around Democratic fund-raisers in Washington and at a Buddhist
temple in California, and the fifth deals with a fund-raiser at the same temple
for Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyer Nancy Luque said Hsia is a community activist who wanted
Asian-Americans to become part of the political process. ``Maria didn't ask any
person who made a contribution ... where they got money,'' said Luque. ``So
don't ask, don't tell.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The prosecutors want you to believe that her asking for contributions
caused someone six steps removed to lie,'' but ``Maria Hsia is not responsible
for what other people do,'' said Luque. ``Maria Hsia never lied.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yaffe said that for a fund-raiser at a Buddhist Temple in California
attended by Vice President Gore, Hsia handed an envelope with $100,000 in checks
to Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang, who will testify against Hsia.
</P>
<P>
	   The temple treasury was the source of many of the contributions, although
election records falsely listed individual people as the donors, said Yaffe.
</P>
<P>
	   Yaffe said the temple reimbursed Hsia for some of her own political
contributions. Luque denied that, saying that Hsia was simply being paid for
immigration-related work she did for the temple.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman dismissed the heart of the prosecution's
case in 1998, saying they used ``Alice-in-Wonderland'' logic to claim she was to
blame for false campaign filings.
</P>
<P>
	   An appeals court reinstated the charges. That court said, ``It is not
entirely clear what defects the district court found in the government's
theory.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court cleared the way for the trial last month by refusing to
hear Hsia's appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   As the Justice Department battled in court last year to bring the February
1998 indictment to trial, two Buddhist nuns who prosecutors regarded as crucial
to their case left the country to spend time with their religious order in
Taiwan. Bench warrants have been issued for their arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent court papers, prosecutors said that one of the missing nuns
``would typically receive a telephone call from defendant Hsia to obtain
political contributions, and ... on occasion, ... would provide the conduit
checks to defendant Hsia.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two missing nuns ``destroyed documents once the temple's activities were
discovered,'' the department said.

<HEADLINE> Diallo Trial City Is Pro-Police  </HEADLINE>
   By LYNN BREZOSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Albany County, New York. Middle-class, 90 percent
white, with a strong Irish Catholic heritage. A place where, tradition had it,
cops were there to guard your door and ignore your wager.
</P>
<P>
	   If there's a better place to defend a police officer, Albany defense
attorney Terence Kindlon says, he hasn't heard of it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People here just like police,'' Kindlon says. ``They're inclined to trust
authority.''
</P>
<P>
	   New York Post columnist Bob McManus, who grew up here, readily agrees. He
says Albany has a strong ``Irish Catholic conservative civil service view of the
world.'' ``They like their cops,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
	   So it makes sense to both of them that the four white New York City
policemen charged with murder in the Bronx slaying of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
West African immigrant killed in a barrage of 41 bullets, would have a better
chance with a jury in Albany than one in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial opened last week after a jury of eight whites and four blacks was
selected.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was moved to Albany, 150 miles north of New York City, after
defense attorneys argued, among other things, that the Bronx has a reputation
for being hostile to police.
</P>
<P>
	   In Bronx County, which is two-thirds black and Hispanic, the police have
become outsiders, McManus says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The NYPD is second- and third-generation officers whose families' have
moved to Long Island and Rockland County to get away from the pressures of what
they were policing,'' he says. ``They're refugees going back to butt heads with
people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the outcome of the Diallo case is far from certain.
</P>
<P>
	   While the defense will argue that the four police officers thought Diallo
was reaching for a gun and that it was all a tragic mistake, the 41 shots fired
could make a powerful impression on any jury.
</P>
<P>
	   And Kindlon and McManus believe that Albany is not as pro-police as it was,
say, a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past month, Albany juries have accepted arguments that a
well-respected detective forged a confession in the murder of an 82-year-old
former minister and that police were overzealous in arresting a man who helped
an alleged cop shooter escape.
</P>
<P>
	   In that latter case, police officers were caught on videotape roughing up a
store clerk following a marijuana arrest. The video led to internal disciplinary
action against four officers that once would have been unheard of.
</P>
<P>
	   Some criminal justice experts, such as Boston College law professor Robert
M. Bloom, say confidence in police around the country and in Albany is weakening
because of such things as the Rodney King beating in Los Angeles and the Abner
Louima case in New York City, in which the black defendant was sodomized with a
broomstick in a police station bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   More recently, police officers on highways across America have been accused
of routinely pulling over blacks in what is known as racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even in a place like Albany, conservative with an almost Midwestern feel,
there is a general feeling that you just can't take a police officer's word
anymore,'' says Albany Times Union columnist Fred LeBrun.
</P>
<P>
	   The convenience store rampage by police has black activists up in arms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was very scary, to have police come out as though they were a gang.
They're supposed to be the ones protecting us. So who are we going to call?''
says Darryl Lahon, whose grocery store video camera caught police on tape.
</P>
<P>
	   It's the same frustration that is heard in the Bronx, says James Cohen, a
law professor at Fordham University there. ``The feeling is people in power --
the white people -- tend to treat people without power differently. They tend to
treat them worse,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
	   Recently there have been other cases in the Albany area that could give the
defense in the Diallo trial reason for both optimism and concern.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year in Albany, a black basketball player at the College of Saint Rose
claimed he was beaten by two white, off-duty police officers in a police garage
following a bar fight. The officers were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
	   In nearby Schenectady, a busload of partying off-duty police officers
cruised a crime-ridden area in 1997, throwing eggs out the bus windows.
Community leaders accused the officers of shouting racial slurs. Local news
agencies lost their battle to get the names of the officers released.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Frankly, you get enough of this stuff, it cracks through into people's
consciousness,'' Kindlon says. ``My sense is that every day it gets a little
easier to hear stories about bad cops all over the place.''

<HEADLINE> State adopts new shore development rules, about six years late  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - After six years and several trips to court, the
state on Monday finally adopted rules designed to curb development in New
Jersey's sensitive coastal region.
<P>
	   But the new version of the Coastal Area Facility Review Act (CAFRA) won't
stop a long debate that has raged since lawmakers first ordered changes in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists on Monday continued to say the new rules will actually
prompt more development at the shore. And shore-area lawmakers once again
pledged to stop the rules, saying they hit their towns with more planning
restrictions than other parts of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials say the new rules are designed to target development to
places planners say can handle it, and keep developers away from the most
environmentally sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been a long road," said Raymond Cantor, assistant environmental
commissioner for land use management. "This is a big change. For the first time,
we're setting boundaries on where development should go. These rules will add a
significant mechanism to help prevent sprawl."
</P>
<P>
	   The rules were supposed to be adopted in 1994. However, the process was
stalled as developers and environmental groups tangled over what should be
allowed. Environmentalists in 1998 charged in court that the state was dragging
its feet while developers were carving up sensitive shore land. A state Superior
Court judge set a timetable for the state to act, and officials pledged to have
rules in place.
</P>
<P>
	   The rules force coastal towns to abide by the state master plan, which
details where development should and should not take place.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials say the rules make it easier for developers to build in
targeted areas that are already developed - and much more difficult for them to
build in undeveloped, environmentally sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The regulations would apply only to commercial buildings and residential
developments of more than 24 units. They affect much of the Atlantic coast east
of the Garden State Parkway, and the Delaware Bay shore north to the Delaware
Memorial Bridge.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists, however, say the rules allow too much development in
environmentally sensitive areas. They say the old rules protected the shore
more.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to bring sprawl and overdevelopment and ruin an area of New
Jersey that the people cherish, our shore," said Jeff Tittel, director of the
Sierra Club's New Jersey chapter.
</P>
<P>
	   Tittel said that while the rules attempt to target development, they simply
allow too much in areas that should be protected.
</P>
<P>
	   "This could turn Cape May into another Edison," Tittel said.
</P>
<P>
	   DEP's Cantor responded that such worries are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have taken worst-case scenarios of population growth and densities,
and they're ignoring the fact that there are limitations," Cantor said. "There
are now significant areas where significant development that would have been
allowed before is now limited. There are boundaries now."
</P>
<P>
	   Area lawmakers, however, say the rules are too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Senate last year passed a bill saying the proposed rules did not
follow the Legislature's intent. The measure drew a sharp response from Gov.
Christie Whitman, who said it would block smart planning. It never reached the
Assembly, however, and died when the two-year session expired last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. William Gormley, R-Atlantic, said the effort to thwart the rules will
be revived. Gormley said the Department of Environmental Protection wants to
force coastal towns to follow the state plan while other towns can ignore it. He
said when it comes to development and planning, all towns should be treated the
same.
</P>
<P>
	   "For all other towns, the implementation of the state plan involves
negotiation (with local officials)," Gormley said. "That's not the case with
these other towns. These regulations don't stop sprawl."
</P>
<P>
	   Gormley said the disagreements are "not about environmental concerns.
They're about the planning process."
</P>
<P>
	   Cantor said the Legislature in 1993 mandated that "the coast should be
regulated differently than anywhere else, and therefore what we're doing is
regional coastal development in correlation with the state plan, as the
Legislature has directed us to do."
</P>
<P>
	   While enacting the plan, the DEP immediately proposed several changes that
were partly based on concerns from municipalities and environmentalists.
Previously, the state had delayed enactment of the rules to clear up such
concerns.

<HEADLINE> Gov't: Nev. Forest Workers Safe  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA CHEREB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- U.S. Forest Service employees in Nevada have been
intimidated and harassed by local residents but are not in danger, according to
an investigation by the agency released Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Disputes over Forest Service policies have created such hostility in some
areas that Gloria Flora, the supervisor of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest,
cited concerns about her employees' safety when she resigned in November.
</P>
<P>
	   That led to the appointment of the fact-finding team that issued its report
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said the agency and local residents and officials all have a
strong desire to improve relations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The team did not find any reportable incidents of personal threats,
violence or abuse in the past several years that would cause the Forest Service
to seek criminal prosecution through the Department of Justice,'' said Joel
Holtrop, a Forest Service director who headed the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Holtrop said a dispute in northeast Nevada's Elko County, where local
officials have locked horns with the Forest Service over a remote dirt road on
national forest land, is ``unusual and antagonistic.''
</P>
<P>
	   Residents want to rebuild a dirt road along the Jarbidge River, but the
Forest Service has fought their efforts, saying the erosion would harm the
river's bull trout population.
</P>
<P>
	   Many current and former Forest Service employees in Elko reported being
treated disrespectfully and feeling ``afraid for their well-being'' while doing
field work. The report said few employees wear their uniforms or drive marked
agency vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   The spouses of two Forest Service employees said they were ostracized from
community groups and verbally abused and ridiculed in public. Another complained
of disparaging remarks against the agency made by a child's teacher.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of the approximately 35 employees we met with in Elko, the majority said
that working and living in this setting affected their sense of well-being,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the report concluded that while the experiences ``were beyond what is
typical in work environments for Forest Service employees in other places'' the
situation in Elko ``is not considered dangerous.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Says He's Reformer, Not McCain  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DOVER, Del. (AP) -- George W. Bush struck at the heart of John McCain's
candidacy Monday, accusing his presidential rival of ``saying one thing and
doing another'' on political reform. Bush said he, not McCain, was the
``reformer with results,'' changing the style and substance of his campaign to
counter his foe's momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain reacted with a sarcastic dig: ``I guess Governor Bush is now a
reformer. If so, it's his first day on the job.'' And the Arizona senator's new
TV ad accuses Bush of breaking his promise to run a positive campaign and ends
with a zinger: ``Do we really want another politician in the White House America
can't trust?''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is scrambling to regain his footing after McCain's rout in New
Hampshire shocked the GOP establishment and raised calls for a harder-hitting,
more freewheeling national front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush took the weekend off to retool his campaign, emerging with a format
that borrows from McCain's successful New Hampshire run. The Texan's stump
speech was cut in half and his question-and-answer sessions were two or three
times longer than normal.
</P>
<P>
	   And he tried to co-opt the Arizona senator's reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to remind people that in this race there is one person who can
stand up and say, 'I'm a reformer with results,''' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor stood in front of a freshly minted sign that read
``Reformer with Results.'' He used the word ``reform'' a half-dozen times in a
10-minute speech, after rarely letting the term slip from his lips before New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said as governor he fought the status quo to improve schools, pass
lawsuit reform and cut taxes. By contrast, he said McCain champions campaign
finance reform while using his influence in the Senate to leverage political
donations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hear him say, 'Let's have campaign finance reform' and on the other hand
he says, 'Let's pass the plate,''' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he had pushed for a gift ban in Congress, line-item veto power
for the president and the closing of corporate tax loopholes. ``I have a long
record of reform and it's very well known,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   When wrongly attacked, McCain said, ``We are going to fire back and we are
going to fire doubly.'' Bush said the same: ``You can cut it any way you like
it. I'm going to take it to him.''
</P>
<P>
	   The back-and-forth overshadowed Tuesday's primary here. McCain has skipped
the contest, leaving Bush and conservative Steve Forbes to do battle while the
Arizonan focuses on the Feb. 19 showdown in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush aides are predicting a Delaware victory, and they need one to help
recover from the New Hampshire loss. Forbes hopes to finish close to the Texan,
but some supporters fear he'll finish behind McCain, who is still on the ballot,
and be forced out of the race.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The elites are not picking the nominee,'' Forbes said between Delaware
stops. ``That's why I feel optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain were looking ahead to South Carolina. A loss there would
damage Bush, but his fund-raising and organizational advantages would probably
keep him afloat. McCain, however, needs to keep his momentum moving.
</P>
<P>
	   Their rivalry intensified, Bush and McCain accused each other of going
negative and breaking a pledge not to do so. Both campaigns plan to feature the
same footage from a Michigan debate in which the two candidates shook hands and
promised to run positive campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   The mudslinging was not welcomed by voters. ``I don't like any of the
negative stuff, from either guy,'' said David Dixon, pulling up a chair at a
Bush luncheon.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush decided he had no other choice after New Hampshire. McCain's victory
there erased Bush's lead in polls in South Carolina and dramatically narrowed
his edge in California, Michigan and other key primary states.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor said his mistake in New Hampshire was allowing McCain to
go unchallenged when he attacked Bush's tax policies and raised questions about
the governor's ability to serve as president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The days of smiling and letting John McCain define me are over,'' Bush
said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, he told supporters, ``If you're tired of no results and simple,
empty rhetoric, if you're tired of people saying one thing and doing another,
come and join my team.''
</P>
<P>
	   Establishment Republicans welcomed the shift. ``He's going to get down in
the pits,'' said Priscilla Rakestraw, Republican National Committee member from
Delaware. ``I think he's learned a lesson from (Vice President Al) Gore, who was
playing the king for a while. He has to reply to attacks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's new approach comes with some risk. He fielded dozens of questions in
the new format, most of them effortlessly. But he surprised one group of
veterans with his answer to a query about the anthrax vaccine administered to
U.S. troops to protect against biological warfare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the first I've heard of it,'' Bush said of the controversial
program launched in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush aides said the pointed remarks about McCain would continue. Testing
possible lines of attack, Bush pollsters were asking South Carolina residents
whether their opinion of McCain would change if they knew the Senate Ethics
Committee had said in 1991 he had ``exercised poor judgment'' in intervening
with regulators in the Keating Five banking matter.

<HEADLINE> Chavez, Fellow Coup Leaders Feud  </HEADLINE>
   By BART JONES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Three former officers who helped President Hugo
Chavez stage his famous 1992 coup attempt are lashing out at the president and
his inner circle, threatening to carve a division in Venezuela's leftist
governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   The ex-coup leaders last week used the eighth anniversary of their revolt to
publicly warn Chavez that his year-old government may be betraying the
revolutionary goals that prompted them to take up arms.
</P>
<P>
	   They offered few details. But on Monday, retired Lt. Col. Francisco Arias
Cardenas, considered the intellectual author of the 1992 coup, said Chavez's
Fifth Republic Movement political party is in crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An organization that doesn't allow contrary opinions, that doesn't debate,
that doesn't discuss, in my opinion doesn't exist,'' Arias, who is now governor
of oil-rich Zulia state, told the Globovision TV network.
</P>
<P>
	   Another former coup leader, retired Lt. Col. Jesus Urdaneta, called on
Chavez to fire two cabinet ministers and the head of the legislature. He claimed
they are leftovers from the corrupt oligarchy the former soldiers want to
destroy.
</P>
<P>
	   Government officials have shot back, fiercely criticizing the former coup
leaders and stirring the first major feud among Chavez forces. The spat has led
some to speculate that true opposition to Chavez may finally be emerging in the
South American nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Political analyst Anibal Romero said the conflict is partly about power,
since the three former coup leaders may feel sidelined in the Chavez
administration. Arias was passed over recently for vice president, and Urdaneta
was fired as head of the political police after he clashed with the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
	   The feud could cause deep rifts in Chavez's governing coalition, especially
if the discontent spreads to the military. Yet Chavez also enjoys near-fanatical
support among millions of poor people and is the most famous of the former coup
leaders. Some say it's Chavez's personality, not his governing coalition, that
really matters in Venezuelan politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez hasn't commented directly on the feud, though on Friday he announced
he was retaking control of the Fifth Republic Movement after ``letting them do
what they want'' for the last year.
</P>
<P>
	   In an apparent attempt to ease tensions, Fifth Republic leaders announced
Monday that the third former coup leader, retired Lt. Col. Joel Acosta Chirinos,
was resigning as head of the organization but will be the party's candidate for
governor in Falcon state in western Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez spent two years in prison after the coup attempt and was swept to the
presidency in December 1998 on a wave of public anger over mass poverty and some
of the world's worst corruption. Since then, he has overhauled Venezuela's
government -- winning approval for a new constitution, increasing the power of
the presidency and ousting the old Congress and Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say Chavez has concentrated power in his own hands and moved
Venezuela dangerously close to dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez's hodgepodge coalition is made up of former coup participants, the
military and leftist political parties with backing from Venezuela's poor
majority. The two traditional political parties that ruled the country during
four decades of democracy have all but disappeared, and some analysts had
predicted a viable political opposition would emerge from disenchanted Chavez
supporters.

<HEADLINE> NJ rail line among goodies in Clinton budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Where Democrats found much to like in President
Clinton's eighth and final budget, Republicans found too much spending and not
enough tax relief.
<P>
	   Clinton's proposed $1.84 trillion plan would expand access to health care,
shrink the national debt and cut taxes for the sick, elderly, poor and
college-bound, while spending more for the environment, schools and gun-law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey lawmakers were particularly heartened by continued funding for a
new rail line.
</P>
<P>
	   "Initiatives aimed at every citizen - tax cuts, investments in education and
health care - are proof of the nation's economic prosperity," said Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., called it "a responsible, visionary budget
that focuses on fiscal discipline and the future."
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans, who control both houses of Congress, were less impressed.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've always said we need to live within our means and the president has
chosen not to," said Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-Vineland.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-Ridgewood, said Clinton should move faster to end the
"marriage penalty" for two-earner couples. "The president says he's for
eliminating the marriage tax penalty but he wants to take 10 years to do it and
even then he leaves out homeowners," Roukema said.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget faces months of congressional hearings and debate.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey lawmakers cheered a commitment of funding to continue work on a
20-mile light rail line in Hudson and Bergen counties, running north from
Bayonne to the New Jersey Turnpike's Vince Lombardi service area in Ridgefield.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget includes $121 million for the first phase of the project, running
from Bayonne to Hoboken via Liberty State Park and the Jersey City waterfront.
The Clinton administration also indicated it will commit the federal government
to providing $500 million through 2003 to fund the project's second phase.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's office in Washington estimated that Clinton's renewed proposal
for school modernization would bring the state about $485 million in borrowing
authority to finance the building and renovation of public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Lautenberg's office and the state office, the budget also
includes:
</P>
<P>
	   -$10 million for a nine-mile extension of Newark's existing light rail line,
connecting the downtowns of Newark and Elizabeth with Newark International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   -$2.4 million for a recreation facility at Naval Weapons Station Earle in
Colts Neck. Rep. Rush Holt, D-Pennington, said Clinton's five-year defense plan
also includes $3.7 million for security at the yards where explosives are
unloaded from trucks.
</P>
<P>
	   -$9.8 million for a fitness center at McGuire Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
	   -$1 million to acquire land in Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge in
Morris County; $2 million to acquire land in the Wallkill River National
Wildlife Refuge in Sussex County; and $1 million to acquire land in the Delaware
Water Gap National Recreation Area.
</P>
<P>
	   -$248 million for continued research into alternative energy sources, much
of which will go to the Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
	   -$53 million to deepen the Kill van Kull and Newark Bay Channel. At this
high level of funding, the project would be done by 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   -$12.4 million for shore protection projects, up from $11.6 million
requested last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-Paterson, cheered Clinton's proposal for a $25 million
pilot grant program to help communities obtain health and safety equipment for
their firefighters. Pascrell has been pushing to spend $5 billion over five
years to help fire departments hire more members, increase training and buy
high-tech safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Frank Pallone, D-Long Branch, said Clinton proposes continued funding
for the Sandy Hook-to-Barnegat Bay beach replenishment project and for flood
control projects in Middlesex and Monmouth counties.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Discrimination Ban Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to sign an executive order
barring federal agencies from discriminating against workers on the basis of
genetic tests, a step prompted by fears about rapid advances in scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
	   The order, which congressional aides said Clinton would sign Tuesday, echoes
a bill sponsored by Sens. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
barring employers from refusing to hire people at risk for health problems and
insurers from refusing to sell them coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Monday
that Clinton would announce his decision during a speech at the American
Association for the Advancement of Science. White House aides declined comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Advances in genetic testing will soon allow doctors to predict the medical
futures of their patients. That has raised concerns that such information could
be against those who are likely to suffer from cancer, diabetes, heart disease
or other ailments.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has been speaking out on the issue for years. In his 1998 State of
the Union speech, he declared that ``we must see that science serves humanity,
not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any
American,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ranit Schmelzer, Daschle's spokeswoman, said the Senate minority leader has
long argued that ``as more information about people's future health becomes
available it becomes important to protect that information.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``People shouldn't be discriminated against in employment or in other areas
because of some genetic information that may be available on them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The order Clinton was signing would restrict federal agencies' abilities to
collect or use genetic information, the sources said, including family medical
histories. The order was limited to civilian employees of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Exceptions to such data collection would be allowed in cases where workers
give written consent as part of a health care program monitoring their medical
conditions. Another exception would be granted for gathering information to
study workplace safety.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the order, Clinton was expected to voice his support for the
Daschle-Kennedy legislation, which would extend assurances against abuse of
genetic information to the general public -- a step that would require
congressional action.

<HEADLINE> Ton of Cocaine Seized in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL LA CORTE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Authorities investigating Haitian drug trafficking have seized
nearly 3,000 pounds of cocaine and four ships docked along the Miami River in
the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal authorities searched nine freighters on the river since Jan. 29,
finding the 1.5 tons of cocaine on the four ships. They unloaded 1,000 pounds of
cocaine from one ship Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The seizures resulted from a long-term investigation of trafficking through
Haiti, a growing shipment point of drugs grown in Colombia and destined for the
United States, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're disrupting a way that looks like it's been very successful for some
time,'' said DEA spokesman Brent Eaton. ``And we're getting the evidence to
target those responsible.''
</P>
<P>
	   No arrests had been made by Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The cocaine recovered from all four ships has a street value of more than
$23 million, said Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan.
</P>
<P>
	   Between October 1997 and Feb. 1, Customs seized 10,371 pounds of cocaine, 17
freighters and $2.4 million in U.S. currency on the Miami River, not including
the four recent seizures, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   Customs also arrested 99 illegal aliens and 32 alien smugglers on the river
during that time, said special Agent Frank Figueroa.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Opening Sought in Cuba  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- An opposition coalition on Monday called for a democratic
opening in communist Cuba that would permit greater personal and economic
freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Cuba, as we have expressed many times, must not and cannot continue
trapped in a closed and immobile system,'' read a document given to foreign
journalists on Monday but dated Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The document was signed by members of five political groups, including the
Democratic Solidarity Party and the Liberal Democratic Party. The groups are not
officially registered and therefore deemed illegal by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition, calling itself the Reflective Roundtable of the Moderate
Opposition, said Cuba's problems include a ``lack of political and social
liberties, ideology and politics in all areas of national life, halted
development of individual initiative in the economic sphere.''
</P>
<P>
	   It said that the best answer to the nation's problems would be a democratic
transition.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba's communist leaders do not appear to be planning any major political
changes soon. Late last year, President Fidel Castro criticized ``so-called
democracies'' such as the United States, saying that Cuban socialism is a much
fairer and just system.
</P>
<P>
	   Last September, the Moderate Opposition sent Castro a long proposal for ``a
gradual, peaceful, thoughtful and deliberate process of changes, from one state
of society to another.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was never any government response to that first document and there was
no immediate reaction to the latest one. The government generally does not
comment on opposition groups, which it usually describes as
``counterrevolutionaries.''
</P>
<P>
	   The group's earlier document was among the most detailed and serious written
proposals made by the opposition in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike some dissident groups, the Moderate Opposition demonstrates respect
for existing Cuban institutions. It opposes violence.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Down in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was sharply higher against the yen early Tuesday
amid deepening concern Japan's economic recovery may take longer than expected.
Tokyo stocks edged lower.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was trading at 108.94 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market
early Tuesday, jumping 1.12 yen from its level of 107.82 yen late Monday and
also gaining on its late New York level of 108.78 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 46.54 points, or 0.23
percent, to 19,898.89 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Monday, the average
closed up 111.86 points, or 0.92 percent, at 19,945.43.
</P>
<P>
	   The yen extended a retreat provoked by comments from Japan's chief economic
planner, Taichi Sakaiya, who warned in a television interview Sunday that the
economy will likely shrink during the October-December quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sakaiya's remark initiated the yen selloff abroad as two quarters of
contraction are regarded as a recession," said Takeo Suzuki, assistant manger of
foreign exchange at Nomura Trust and Banking.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas traders found little consolation in assurances by the economic
planner that the government still expects to hit its growth target of 0.6
percent for the fiscal year ending March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was also supported by continued signs of strength in the U.S.
economy, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 107.08 yen, up from 105.99 yen
late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, the benchmark Nikkei edged lower as investors took
profits on high-flying technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Some sellers took their cue from a retreat by stocks on Wall Street, where
the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.4 percent to 10,905.79.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares in banks were hurt by news that the Tokyo metropolitan government
plans a new corporate tax on major lenders.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section fell 6.82 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,747.96. On Monday the TOPIX
finished up 13.56 points, or 0.77 percent, at 1,754.78.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.8950
percent from 1.8500 percent Monday. Its price fell 0.38 point to 98.34.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Alan Keyes said Monday
he will not support rival John McCain if McCain won the party's nomination
because he is ``not pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, speaking to a packed crowd at the National Press Club, said he could
not continue to support a GOP that nominates a candidate who favors abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will leave me,'' Keyes said of the party. ``I will not leave it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes criticized McCain for saying last month that any decision about ending
a pregnancy would be up to his teen-age daughter. He clarified that later,
saying it would be a ``family decision.''

	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley's campaign for Ohio's March 7
primary will be chaired by two veteran officeholders and a college friend of the
former New Jersey senator, his campaign announced Monday on the eve of his first
visit to the state this year.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Minority Leader Ben Espy, former lawmaker and Cuyahoga County
Commissioner Mary Boyle and Cleveland lawyer Robert Rawson will run Bradley's
campaign in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement came the day before Bradley's first trip to the state since
Dec. 1. He planned a town meeting Tuesday night to discuss racial unity.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, Bradley's rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, is scheduled to attend a union dinner in Dayton on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rawson was Bradley's classmate at Princeton in the early 1960s and a fellow
Rhodes Scholar.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley has told gay and lesbian leaders he will
continue to speak out against a California ballot initiative that would ban
state recognition of same-sex marriages legally performed in other states, the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic presidential candidate met with representatives of the
Washington-based group during a campaign stop Sunday at a Queens, N.Y., church.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's rival, Vice President Al Gore, also has denounced the initiative
appearing on the state's March 7 ballot. State law currently recognizes only
marriage between a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are gratified that Senator Bradley not only recognizes the inherent
unfairness of Proposition 22, but will continue to use his campaign as a bully

<HEADLINE> Rebels Take Guards in Peru Riot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- About 50 convicted Maoist rebels in a frigid Andean prison
were holding guards hostage Monday, after a riot that left at least two people
dead.
</P>
<P>
	   One guard and one rebel were killed in riots at Yanamayo prison that were
started Sunday by rebels loyal to Shining Path leader Oscar Ramirez Durand, who
was captured last year, said cable news station Canal N.
</P>
<P>
	   The Maoist inmates, armed with homemade knives, took an undetermined number
of guards hostage and demanded to be treated as prisoners of war instead of
terrorists, news stations reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The high-security prison holds some 450 rebel prisoners. Most belong to the
Shining Path, but members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, a much
smaller rebel band, are also serving sentences there.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement from the National Penitentiary Institute said an unspecified
number of hostage were taken after the rebels refused to return to their cells,
prompting a violent confrontation.
</P>
<P>
	   The official version confirmed the inmate's death, but said he died at the
hands of other rebels. The statement did not confirm the guard's death and did
not specify how many guards were taken hostage. Officials refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Television broadcast images of heavily armed police surrounding the prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Elias Aycacha, director of the Puno State Hospital told Peruvian radio
that three police guards had been injured, one critically.
</P>
<P>
	   A Justice Ministry spokesman in Lima said the rebels had been demanding
better prison conditions and more frequent family visits. President Alberto
Fujimori and Justice Minister Alberto Bustamante had visited the prison last
week to review conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yanamayo prison is 12,700 feet above sea level in Puno, 525 miles
southeast of the capital Lima and near the Bolivian border.
</P>
<P>
	   New York native Lori Berenson was held there until being transferred in 1998
for health reasons. A military judge convicted Berenson, 30, of treason in 1996
for helping lead a thwarted assault on Congress by the Tupac Amaru.
</P>
<P>
	   Peru's war against leftist rebels has left 30,000 dead since 1980. Ramirez
Durand is serving a life sentence at a naval base in Lima -- where the group's
founder, Abimael Guzman, also is imprisoned.

<HEADLINE> Assembly Democrats renew campaign vs. HMOs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Assembly approved a package of bills
Monday the chamber's controlling Democrats said would restore accountability to
the treatments health maintenance organizations provide their patients in New
York.
<P>
	   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said the measures are needed to redress what
he called the growing imbalance between HMOs' protection of their bottom lines
and New Yorkers' right to proper health coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the package is a bill allowing people to sue health
maintenance organizations if they deny coverage they should be offering or
provide inadequate care, Silver said.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors and other health care professionals can currently be sued, but since
HMOs do not practice medicine directly, they cannot be brought as parties in
such actions.
</P>
<P>
	   "These corporations know that when they act contrary to the patients' best
interests, they know that they cannot be held responsible," Assemblyman Richard
Gottfried, a Democrat who chairs the Assembly's health committee, said. "New
Yorkers are suffering as a result and it's wrong."
</P>
<P>
	   The Assembly's package would also require the state Insurance Department to
hold hearings whenever HMOs seek rate increases of more than 5 percent and for
more detailed external review of cases where HMOs deny treatment for customers
with permanently disabling or degenerative medical conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the bills have passed the Assembly before but died in the
Republican-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Health Plan Association, which represents 30 managed care
health plans, said the Assembly bills would add to the cost of HMO coverage
throughout the state if they became law, and make insurance unaffordable for
tens of thousands of New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   State laws already include extensive protections for health consumers,
Health Plan Association President Paul Macielak said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This effort to pile on will only add new and duplicative layers of
bureaucracy that will make it more difficult for consumers to navigate the
health care system," Macielak said.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver denied that the Assembly bills would add to health care costs. If
they cost anything extra, the speaker said, it should come from the profits of
the HMOs' shareholders.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Trade Accusations  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and Sen.
John McCain charged one another Monday with running smear campaigns disguised as
telephone polling in South Carolina, a key Republican primary state.
</P>
<P>
	   Pollsters for both camps are calling voters and asking questions about their
opponents, a practice that could be seen as ``push polling'' in which an
interviewer distorts a candidate's position in an attempt to sway voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's aides denied they were conducting push polls because only 300 people
were called by a firm hired by the campaign, well short of the ``thousands and
thousands'' of calls normally made during such surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said it was McCain who had commissioned a push
poll -- something the Arizona senator's camp denied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain's campaign is calling up large numbers of people and
distorting Governor Bush's position'' on tax cuts, Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Opinsky, a McCain spokesman, called the charge false. ``They provided
no evidence for their claim or anybody who had received such a call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's aides said their pollster, Bill McInturff, wrote a script that is
asking for voter's opinions of the candidates' positions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We do not, and will not, do push polling of any kind,'' said another
McCain spokesman Dan McLagan. The campaign wouldn't say how many calls have been
made.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither campaign would release full interview scripts for the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Opinsky said the campaign asks questions such as ``which of the following
statements best describes'' Bush, McCain, neither of the candidates, both of
them or don't know. He offered one example phrase: ``Is someone I like and
trust.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's a real poll question,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Push polling has nothing to do with how many people are polled,'' Opinsky
added. ``It has to do with the negative distorted information displayed as fact
under the guise of a real poll.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's supporters started the volley of accusations Monday with a press
conference in Columbia, S.C., featuring a young woman who said she received a
call on Sunday that distorted McCain's positions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Total misrepresentation is pretty much what I'd call it,'' said Suzette
Latsko, 22, who had attended a McCain rally but hadn't decided whether to vote
for him.
</P>
<P>
	   According to notes Latsko took, the pollster asked her:
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do you support McCain's effort to pass the largest tax increase in
history?''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Fleischer said the script asks voters to state whether they
approve or disapprove of the following: ``John McCain says he never voted for a
tax increase, but he wrote legislation that proposed the largest tax increase in
U.S. history.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement, Fleischer said, refers to McCain's perennial sponsorship of
tobacco reform legislation, which proposed billions of dollars in tobacco taxes.
In recent years, the bill also offered funding to help farmers find other lines
of work. South Carolina is one of the nation's top producers of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   Latsko also said she was asked: ``How do you feel about McCain's plan to
publicly fund elections?''
</P>
<P>
	   Fleischer said the script does not contain the phrase ``publicly funded,''
but states that McCain ``has written legislation that would use taxpayer dollars
to pay for political campaigns.'' McCain has said he opposes public funding of
elections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain's supporters are twisting the words in an attempt to make
it inaccurate,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fleischer said the campaign uses the responses to ``determine how much
familiarity they had with Senator McCain's record, with the status of the race
in South Carolina and with issues that they care about'' to help Bush shape his
message.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's aides scoffed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Like pornography, you know a push poll when you see one,'' said Opinsky.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Stock Manipulator Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A stock manipulator with a history of securities fraud and
an earlier jail stint was sent to prison for five years and 11 months Monday by
a judge who said he "ran afoul of the law and learned nothing from it."
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand rejected appeals for sympathy from
Joseph Pignatiello, 54. The Coral Springs, Fla., man was taken into custody by
U.S. marshals to immediately begin his sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Coleman had described Pignatiello as a risk
of flight, noting that he had obtained permission to travel to Cuba by boat.
Coleman said Pignatiello had been imprisoned, fined, censured and still
"continued securities fraud in ever more criminal and sophisticated ways."
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said Pignatiello deserved a stiff sentence for his July 15
conviction by a jury on charges of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire
fraud and commercial bribery. He called him a "sophisticated, experienced
manipulator of stocks."
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said he regularly hears from defendants who commit crimes because
they think they lack education and opportunity and have no other way to get
ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said Pignatiello was a "sophisticated person with opportunities who
ran afoul of the law and learned nothing from it."
</P>
<P>
	   The criminal case was brought by federal prosecutors but Pignatiello had
been watched closely by the Securities and Exchange Commission for the last 20
years, Sand noted.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge read from an SEC letter that said Pignatiello, even while serving
a two-year sentence in an earlier case, "has engaged in continuing schemes to
manipulate the public securities markets and reap windfall profits at the
expense of innocent investors in low-priced stocks."
</P>
<P>
	   "By his actions, Pignatiello has demonstrated that he has been, and
continues to be, a creator and facilitator of frauds that have caused millions
of dollars of losses for innocent investors," the SEC wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's sentencing resulted from Pignatiello's conviction in a case in
which FBI agents posed as corrupt brokers willing to accept bribes for selling
stock to their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Pignatiello and two others were charged with conspiring to manipulate the
price of a common stock, Spaceplex Amusement Centers International, from October
1995 through May 1996. One accomplice has been sentenced to three years and one
month in prison while a second is awaiting sentencing.
</P>
<P>
	   Before he was sentenced Monday, Pignatiello apologized to the court and his
family, including four children seated behind him.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've taught my children to know right from wrong," he said. "My problem is
that I didn't heed the voice of those discussions."
</P>
<P>
	   "I throw myself on the mercy of the court," he said. "Look in your eyes and
look in your heart for compassion."
</P>
<P>
	   Sand said he could not overlook Pignatiello's prior history.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mr. Pignatiello one time was leading a very high life and now is bankrupt,"
he said. "I'm sorry for the family but this court sends to prison mothers with
infant children, defendants with unfortunate children highly dependent on
defendants for their quality of life."

<HEADLINE> Aussie Girl Survives Croc Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARWIN, Australia (AP) -- A young girl escaped from the jaws of an 8-foot
crocodile when her little brother distracted the beast by grabbing its tail,
their father said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Roy Harrington said his daughter Martina, 8, and son Paul, 5, were hunting
for turtles on Saturday in a creek near in Australia's Northern Territory, when
the animal seized her and began dragging her into the water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I could see it pulling her down,'' Harrington told reporters. ``Paul
grabbed the tail of the croc and he threw his head up -- that gave Martina a
chance to get her feet out of his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Harrington said he then attacked and killed the crocodile with an ax.
</P>
<P>
	   Martina was treated at a clinic for bite wounds and released, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Saltwater crocodiles live in waterways throughout Australia's tropical
north.
</P>
<P>
	   The reptiles have been protected in Australia since the early 1970s and
their numbers have burgeoned.

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Union Meet With Mediator  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- Representatives of The Boeing Co. and its engineering and
technical workers' union met with a federal mediator on Monday to discuss an
impasse over contract issues.
</P>
<P>
	   The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace voted down
Boeing's latest offer on Wednesday, but stopped short of calling a strike when
the mediator, C. Richard Barnes, agreed to intervene.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnes, head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, met with
both sides for five minutes Monday to lay the ground rules for the talks, then
sent them to separate rooms and began shuttling between them. The talks
continued for at least three hours.
</P>
<P>
	   At Boeing facilities, workers reacted to a company memo asking for no
demonstrations or walkouts during the talks. At least 750 employees marched in
Everett, while another 250 marched around the Museum of Flight across from
Boeing's headquarters, said SPEEA spokesman Bill Dugovich.
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to the talks, neither side seemed particularly confident about a
friendly resolution. Boeing took away its previous offer, narrowly rejected
51-49 percent, and said it would no longer collect union dues until a new
contract was approved.
</P>
<P>
	   For its part, the union spoke with picket captains over the weekend about
strike procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   "They keep trying to use these bullying tactics," said SPEEA Executive
Director Charles Bofferding, regarding Boeing's decision on union dues. "I don't
think they've shown an inkling that they're willing to negotiate with us."
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said the dues move was perfectly legal since
there is no contract, and was done to help bring leverage to bear in the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   "The union can call for a strike, and we can refuse to collect dues, which
is a courtesy to the union on our part to begin with," Conte said. "These are
pressures that both sides are bringing."
</P>
<P>
	   Bofferding said the members of the union are ready to strike, despite the
slim margin of the previous vote. He said the union was willing to give
mediation a try, but would walk out and strike if Boeing proved intractable on
its positions regarding pay raises and benefits.

MPs Demand Stewart's Resignation
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- A chorus of opposition MPs called Monday for Human Resources
Minister Jane Stewart to take the fall for the bungled administration of federal
grants and resign.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first day back for parliamentarians after a seven-week break and
the first time opposition parties could face off with the Liberal government
over the controversy.
</P>
<P>
	   Internal audits in Human Resources Development Canada found millions in
grants and contributions were paid out without standard paperwork to back them
up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the Human Resources minister had any respect for Canadian taxpayers and
respect for the principle of ministerial accountability, she would rise in her
place and resign from cabinet,'' said Reform Leader Preston Manning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Will the minister do the honorable thing and resign?'' asked Bloquiste
Paul Crete.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Jean Chretien fielded the first volley of questions, while
Stewart sat red-faced in her seat. She later pointed out that she has a plan to
fix the problem and the money isn't missing.

Govt. Denies Overpayment, Fraud
</P>

	   OTTAWA (AP) -- The federal government has managed to fill in the gaps in its
paperwork for $11.7 million worth of job-creation, youth and training grants and
says there is no evidence of overpayment, fraud or other irregularities.
</P>
<P>
	   But another 34 projects, worth more than $20 million, remain under scrutiny
and thousands more will eventually be reviewed, officials from the Human
Resources Department acknowledged Monday.
</P>

Ex-Hockey Night Host Cornell Dies

Quebecois Flag Plan Criticized
</P>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- A Parti Quebecois resolution to ban Canadian flags from
public buildings in Quebec has some people snapping to attention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no way,'' said Pierre Roy, a retired veteran in Quebec City who
successfully lobbied to have the Maple Leaf returned to the flagpole outside the
provincial capital's city hall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Canadian flag is the flag of our country,'' Roy said Monday from
Quebec City. ``There's no provincial government allowed to do such a thing.
We'll go to the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
	   The resolution to only fly Quebec's Fleur-de-lis flag on buildings under
provincial jurisdiction such as schools and hospitals was passed at a Parti
Quebecois meeting on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The resolution is not binding on the government and Premier Lucien Bouchard
said flying only the Quebec flag would be studied but hedged when asked his
opinion on the matter.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco-Arco Merger Challenged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Following the federal government's lead, the state
governments of California, Oregon and Washington went to federal court Friday to
try to stop BP Amoco's $30 billion acquisition of fellow oil giant Atlantic
Richfield Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The three states filed a suit that mirrored the argument offered Friday in a
suit by the Federal Trade Commission: The new company would dominate Alaska oil
production and control West Coast supplies, with the power to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger was to have been completed Monday, but the companies have agreed
to wait until March 10, when a federal judge is scheduled to consider the FTC's
request for a preliminary injunction. The states' suit may be consolidated with
the FTC case.
</P>
<P>
	   London-based BP Amoco agreed last March to acquire Los Angeles-based
Atlantic Richfield, known as Arco, a purchase that would create the world's
second largest non-government oil company, behind Exxon Mobil. BP Amoco and Arco
account for about 70 percent of Alaska crude oil production.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the merger focus on its effects on Alaska oil supplies to West
Coast refiners.
</P>
<P>
	   "The merger as presently proposed would result in a harmful monopoly of
Alaska North Slope crude oil supplied to California refiners," California
Attorney General Bill Lockyer said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Californians are already suffering from a lack of competition among
major refiners, and the new merger could cause "a major loss of competition and
greater squeeze of the West Coast."
</P>
<P>
	   The two companies say their combination will not damage competition and deny
the existence of a specialized West Coast market for Alaska crude oil. They
contend the international oil market would compensate for any effect on the
price of Alaska oil.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco has agreed with the state of Alaska to sell off holdings that would
reduce the merged company's share of Alaskan production from 70 to 55 percent.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Abortion Group To Back Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By LEIGH STROPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A board member of South Carolina Citizens for Life
resigned Monday over the group's pending endorsement of Republican presidential
candidate Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Griffith said Monday that he believed the board was coerced into
supporting Bush by its parent organization, the National Right to Life
Committee, at a meeting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the name of integrity, I cannot lend my support to the use of coercion
to effect an endorsement decision,'' Griffith's resignation letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   President Deborah Bian-Lingle did not return several messages left at her
home.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffith said the Bush endorsement and ads would be announced Wednesday.
Executive Director Holly Gatling said a news conference was planned that day to
announce new ads, but she would not reveal the subject. She denied that the
board was pressured to endorse Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   National Right to Life Committee officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffith said he had to leave Saturday's board meeting early and did not get
to officially cast his vote against the endorsement. He said he is concerned
about the Texas governor's unwillingness to say that as president he would
require his judicial nominees to oppose abortion. Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
another GOP presidential contender, also has refused to agree to pledge the
same.
</P>
<P>
	   He said two National Right to Life Committee staffers attended the meeting
and attempted to sell the board on Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffith, who has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes
and worked for GOP candidate Pat Buchanan in 1996, said his personal political
preferences were not a factor in his decision to quit the anti-abortion group.
Rather, he said it was the ``method the organization has used in propagating its
position on other candidates'' and the ``method in which the endorsement
decision was brought about'' that forced his resignation.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Threat Guilty Plea Likely  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A Florida teen-ager accused of threatening Columbine High
School over the Internet plans to plead guilty, the U.S. Attorney's Office said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Ian Campbell, 18, of Cape Coral, Fla., is accused of telling a
Columbine student he would ``finish what begun'' at the high school last April,
when two teen-age gunmen killed 12 students and a teacher before committing
suicide.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell's attorneys notified a federal judge in Denver Monday ``that it's
their intention to plead guilty,'' said Jeff Dorschner, a spokesman for the U.S.
attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Dorschner would not say whether prosecutors had agreed to reduce the charge
against Campbell, who pleaded innocent. He would not discuss the details of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell was charged with transmitting a threat against another person in
interstate commerce, a felony that carries a sentence of up to five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell's lead attorney, Ellis Rubin of Miami, could not be reached for
comment Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell was scheduled to appear in court Wednesday, when details of the
agreement might be made public, Dorschner said.

<HEADLINE> Rapper Big Pun Dies at 28  </HEADLINE>
   By SHARON L. CRENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Christopher Rios, the platinum-selling rapper known as Big
Pun who was respected for his imaginative lyrics and smooth delivery, died
Monday. He was 28.
</P>
<P>
	   Rios was pronounced dead at 3:53 p.m., and the cause of death was to be
determined by the medical examiner, said a spokeswoman at White Plains Hospital
in suburban New York. His publicist, David Granoff, said it appeared Rios died
of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was beloved, and admired, and accomplished, and rich,'' Granoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   He credited Rios, who was Puerto Rican, with working to bring Latino
entertainers into rap, a style traditionally dominated by black artists.
</P>
<P>
	   The rap world started to take notice of Rios -- whose stage name was short
for Big Punisher -- after appearances with fellow rapper Fat Joe and a feature
on ``The Mix Tape Vol. 1'' put together by Funkmaster Flex.
</P>
<P>
	   His street hit ``You Ain't a Killer'' was featured on the ``Soul in the
Hole'' soundtrack and his first album, ``Capital Punishment'' went double
platinum and was nominated for a Grammy last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Rios' second album, '' Yeah, Baby,'' was due out in April.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Big Pun possessed a lyrical gift of incessant breath control and a
knockout punch with the rhymes,'' a reviewer wrote about rapper for
sonymusic.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Known earlier in his career as Big Moon Dog, the entertainer was once an
avid basketball player and boxer, but later said he took to eating ``until he
couldn't tie his shoelaces.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jimmy Rodriguez, a longtime friend, said he would be missed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anybody that knew or ever come in contact with Big Pun would have walked
away saying that they just walked away from a gentle giant,'' Rodriguez said.
``He was so special.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rios, who lived in the Bronx, was survived by his wife Liza, and three young
children: Christopher, Vanessa, and Amanda.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Move Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was sharply higher against the yen Tuesday morning
amid deepening concern Japan's economic recovery may take longer than expected.
Tokyo stocks edged lower.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was trading at 109.18 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market at
midday, jumping 1.36 yen from the 107.82 yen it bought late Monday and extending
gains from its level of 108.78 yen in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 6.18 points, or 0.03
percent, to finish the morning session at 19,939.25. On Monday, the average
closed up 111.86 points, or 0.92 percent, at 19,945.43.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, the U.S. currency touched a new five-and-a-half month high of
109.32 yen, lifted by buying from both U.S. and Japanese trust banks, dealers
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The yen's retreat was provoked by comments from Japan's chief economic
planner, Taichi Sakaiya, who warned in a television interview Sunday that the
economy will likely shrink during the October-December quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sakaiya's remark initiated the yen selloff abroad as two quarters of
contraction are regarded as a recession," said Takeo Suzuki, assistant manger of
foreign exchange at Nomura Trust and Banking.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas traders found little consolation in assurances by the economic
planner that the government still expects to hit its growth target of 0.6
percent for the fiscal year ending March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was also supported by continued signs of strength in the U.S.
economy, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 107.06 yen, up from 105.99 yen
late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, the benchmark Nikkei edged lower as investors took
profits on high-flying technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial shares were hurt by news that the Tokyo metropolitan government is
considering a new corporate tax on major banks.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders also said some sellers took their cue from a retreat by stocks on
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 58.01 to 10,905.79
points.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section fell 4.36 points, or 0.24 percent, to 1,750.42. On Monday the TOPIX
finished up 13.56 points, or 0.77 percent, at 1,754.78.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.8700
percent from 1.8500 percent Monday. Its price fell 0.17 point to 98.55.

<HEADLINE> Ricky Martin Arrives in Puerto Rico  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Screaming "Ricky, we love you!" dozens of fans
welcomed Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin as he arrived home Monday for his
first concerts on the island in two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Fans waved Puerto Rican flags as Martin stepped out of a private jet then
boarded a helicopter that took him to an undisclosed location to rest.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm happy because I'm going to see my family (and) be able to breathe that
air that you only can breathe in this land," Martin told reporters. "I'm dying
to bring my music to my people again."
</P>
<P>
	   Martin, 28, will give three concerts in San Juan over the weekend. Martin
said he might also visit Vieques, the Puerto Rican island where protesters have
camped out on a Navy bombing range to thwart military exercises. Martin has
taken their side, and he discussed the issue with one of President Clinton's
advisers during a visit to the White House last week.

<HEADLINE> Indian Tribe To Sponsor Padres  </HEADLINE>
    By BERNIE WILSON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- An Indian tribe that runs a casino in San Diego County
will be the title sponsor of the San Diego Padres' 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
	   It's believed to be the first time a major league franchise has sold such a
sponsorship. The Sycuan tribe will pay more than $1.5 million, with just under
$1 million going to the team and rest going to radio and TV advertising, two
sources familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The cash-strapped Padres also are negotiating with several other companies
and will announce three presenting sponsors during spring training, a club
source said. The title and presenting sponsorships could net the club about $3.5
million total, the source said.
</P>
<P>
	   San Diego's season will be marketed much like a bowl game or golf tournament
is. A logo reading ``Padres 2000, presented by Sycuan'' will be used on club
publications, at the ballpark and in advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   The logo, which will include the team's Swinging Friar mascot and palm trees
-- several palm trees are just beyond the outfield fence at Qualcomm Stadium --
will not be worn on the players' uniforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Padres president Larry Lucchino wouldn't confirm the exact amount, but said
Monday it was ``an attractive deal for us, and a gigantic exposure for them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lucchino said the deal, which will be announced Tuesday, is acceptable under
baseball's rules because Sycuan's casino does not have sports-book betting.
Sycuan and two other tribes with gaming operations, Viejas and Barona, have had
prior sponsorships with the Padres, although on a much smaller basis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We love this one,'' said Lucchino, who also helped pioneer exotic road
trips in recent years, with his team making two treks to Monterrey, Mexico, and
one to Honolulu. ``We think of it as a cutting edge advertising arrangement.
It's part of an aggressive effort on our part to find new revenue streams
wherever we can because of our status in the baseball hierarchy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The cartoonish Swinging Friar logo has been associated with the Padres off
and on since 1958, when they were in the minor leagues. San Diego was built
around Spanish missions settled by Franciscan friars to convert Indians to
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
	   The Padres say they have sustained operating losses since software mogul
John Moores bought the team in December 1994, with Lucchino as a minority
partner. Although San Diego is among the nation's biggest cities, it is a small
broadcast market, meaning there's less money to be made from radio and TV deals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's very much a work in progress, but we are optimistic it will
become a more customary kind of approach for our team and other teams in the
future,'' Lucchino said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sycuan will have a chance to extend the sponsorship a second year, said Fred
Mort, president and CEO of Fantastic Sports, which brokered the deal. The tribe
also is interested in discussing bigger partnerships with the Padres, possibly
including the naming rights of the Padres' downtown ballpark, scheduled to open
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a unique opportunity,'' Mort said. ``There's a realization that in
today's economy, sports franchises have to get creative and innovative to create
new sources of revenues instead of passing costs on to the fans.''
</P>
<P>
	   There's another reason the Padres need the cash. As part of the deal to
extend the Padres' lease at Qualcomm Stadium while the downtown ballpark is
being built, the Padres regained advertising rights from the NFL's Chargers, at
a net cost of between $4 million and $5 million, a team source said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from Sycuan didn't immediately return telephone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some things are allowed. Obviously, we will have to talk to the Padres and
find out what the details are,'' baseball spokesman Rich Levin said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MAGNOLIA, Ark. (AP) -- A 15-year-old girl was found beaten to death near a
freshly dug grave, and two of her high school classmates were arrested and
charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheriff Wayne Tompkins said the boys had planned the slaying for days or
even weeks and had dug the 3-foot-deep grave hours beforehand.
</P>
<P>
	   The sheriff gave no motive.
</P>
<P>
	   The body of Brittni Jone Pater was found early Saturday near a logging road.
Prosecutor Jamie Pratt said an autopsy showed that the girl was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
	   Matthew Ryan Elliott, 16, and William E. Davis, 17, were charged Monday as
adults with capital murder. Columbia County Circuit Judge Larry Chandler denied
bond and entered innocent pleas on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   The sheriff said authorities believe Elliott picked up the girl outside her
home Friday night. When her body was found, a shovel was stuck upright in the
dirt, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both boys are juniors at Magnolia High School and Pater was a sophomore. The
victim and Elliott were members of the band.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Seek Core Democrats  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Aiming at the coast-to-coast primaries of March 7, Al Gore
and Bill Bradley opened a national battle Monday for Democratic core
constituencies -- minorities, women and union members -- where Gore has shown a
clear edge.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley campaigned for black support in Florida, while Gore steered his
drive for union and gay support to a construction site and a Lincoln Center
stage in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president fired up union members by reviving his characterization
of Bradley as a bad Democrat who is running for the party's presidential
nomination ``by running down the progress and achievements of the Democratic
Party over the past seven years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's audience inside AFSCME District Council 37 cheered.
</P>
<P>
	   In cowboy boots and a green union-label hardhat, he earlier clambered over a
stack of pipes to greet workers constructing a 41-story apartment building on
the West Side. And later, he was taking the stage at Lincoln Center with The New
York City Gay Men's Chorus for a performance of ``The Battle Hymn of the
Republic'' and a narration of Aaron Copland's ``Lincoln Portrait.''
</P>
<P>
	   With the local issues and living rooms of Iowa and New Hampshire a memory,
the Democratic rivals must assemble coalitions to form majorities in key
primaries coming up.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was targeting minority voters, campaigning in Tampa by criticizing
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's plan to replace racial and gender preferences in
education and business with increased outreach efforts and broader
anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Affirmative action is about fairness, it's about social justice. It's
about insuring that everyone has a fair chance,'' Bradley told about 200 people
gathered at a local Italian club.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A governor sets a tone, a president sets a tone,'' he said of the plan by
Bush, the brother of GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush. ``This sets
the wrong tone. It is the wrong signal at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Bradley was to be in South Carolina to wade into the dispute
surrounding the flying of the Confederate flag over the Statehouse in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's been Gore who has built strong ties to key Democratic
constituencies including labor and minorities over the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
	   He has kept those ties tight in meetings like the one he had at his hotel
Monday with New York labor leaders. ``It's always good to have that one-on-one
communication, to touch the flesh,'' Lee Saunders, administrator of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees local, said afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on Monday, the AFL-CIO dropped 1 million pro-Gore fliers at 10,000
workplaces statewide, saying, ``No one is better on working family issues'' than
Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside analysts said it won't be easy for Bradley to push past such deeply
rooted feelings among core Democratic supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gore is much better known among black politicians for a much longer period
of time,'' said Merle Black of Emory University. ``I don't know how Bradley
breaks through that.''
</P>
<P>
	   And then there was Larry White, one of the construction workers waiting to
shake Gore's hand in New York. Asked about Bradley, White shrugged. ``Don't know
nothing about him, don't want to. Al Gore has the experience because he's been
in the White House for eight years with the president,'' said White.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to break through, Bradley was diverting from his tight focus on
states where primaries are planned March 7, going for the symbolism of the
Confederate flag in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is a former professional basketball player, and he also frequently
brings in teammates and competitors from his playing days who are especially
popular figures in the minority community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's probably some linkage there,'' said Thad Beyle of the University
of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show Gore with a big lead nationally over Bradley. On Monday, the
latest Field Poll in California, where both candidates will campaign at week's
end, showed Gore 41 points ahead of Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore led in CNN-USA Today-Gallup and Pew polls in late January by at least
40 points among women and more than 40 points among blacks. He also led by
almost 40 points in labor households.
</P>
<P>
	   In actual voting, in Iowa, Gore had a 35-point lead over Bradley in labor
households, and in the closer race in New Hampshire he had a 25-point lead,
according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
	   The competition for core Democratic groups could lay land mines for the
general election if, for example, Bradley and Gore try to one-up each other on
affirmative action. By contrast, Bill Clinton courted moderates in 1992 by
challenging black groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republicans will gleefully take notes and throw it back at them in the
fall,'' said Hugh Graham, of Vanderbilt University.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on Monday, representatives of the Gore and Bradley campaigns failed to
reach agreement on whether the candidates will hold regular debates, according
to Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser. Bradley has challenged Gore to debate once a
week, while the vice president wants to debate twice a week -- but only if the
two candidates give up most TV ads as part of any deal. The two sides will
discuss the issue again Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Mexico University Tries Recovering  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Police who ousted striking students from Latin America's
largest university found trash barricading streets, classrooms turned into
campgrounds and laboratories serving as kitchens.
</P>
<P>
	   As officials on Monday surveyed the damage -- and the countless scrawls of
graffiti -- at the National Autonomous University, they faced an even more
daunting task in calming passions at a school with 270,000 students and a
crucial role in Mexican life.
</P>
<P>
	   A day after a police raid that apparently ended a 9 1/2-month strike,
university spokesman Roberto Vivanco said classes could resume after officials
clean up the campus. He gave no date.
</P>
<P>
	   It isn't clear how many students might show up. Some said they would boycott
classes until the more than 700 strike supporters arrested Sunday were freed.
And many other students had already abandoned the university for jobs or other
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike was driven by radicals who saw it as a struggle against global
free-market economics. It began as a protest against tuition increases but
continued long after officials canceled them.
</P>
<P>
	   Interior Secretary Diodoro Carrasco, who oversees the police who carried out
the raid, conceded Monday that the crisis was not over.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the recovery of the installations is a fundamental step, but it
seems to me that it has to be followed by an enormous effort of reconciliation
in the university community,'' he said in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
	   That caution is partly due to the importance of the university known as
UNAM, which is far more significant to Mexico than the Ivy League as a whole is
to the United States. With almost no tuition, its classrooms mingle the children
of Mexico's elite with promising teen-agers from the slums.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Mexico's academic scientific research is done at UNAM laboratories.
Its schools of law and economics have produced four of the past five presidents.
</P>
<P>
	   President Ernesto Zedillo studied elsewhere, but the candidate favored to
succeed him this year, Francisco Labastida, is an UNAM graduate. Most key
figures in Zedillo's administration also attended UNAM. Even the leader of the
leftist Zapatista rebels studied at UNAM.
</P>
<P>
	   Campus politics can have long-term effects on national politics. And many
anti-strike UNAM students and faculty were outraged by the use of police to end
the strike, seeing it as a blow to the university's cherished autonomy.
</P>
<P>
	   Memory of a 1968 government massacre of students was one reason why the
government avoided intervening for so long -- and why the eventual use of police
was so traumatic to many.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoping to heal those wounds, Rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente urged officials
to drop most charges against those arrested and to be lenient with those who are
convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorney general's office announced that 38 people arrested in the sweep
but not involved in the strike have been released.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the university, however, Mexicans favored the police action by a 2-1
margin, according to a poll published Monday by the daily newspaper Reforma.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the strike, UNAM had about 120,000 students in its system of high
schools and another 150,000 in university-level programs. All live off campus
and the total includes several research centers far beyond UNAM's sprawling
University City in southern Mexico City. The sheer size of the school
overshadows any in the United States. The University of Texas-Austin, one of the
biggest American universities, has just over 49,000 students.
</P>
<P>
	   But the strike prompted many students to take jobs or shift to other
universities. Officials have no idea how many will show up for classes once they
resume.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wanted to study at UNAM, but now, knowing how little prestige a degree
is going to have, I am going to have to go somewhere else,'' said Victor Manuel
Cabrera, an 18-year-old UNAM high school student waiting Monday outside the
federal attorney general's office for word of his sister, an arrested striker.
</P>
<P>
	   Some vowed to boycott classes until the arrested strikers are freed from
jail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot return to class and leave our comrades inside,'' said Lorena
Estejel, 17, a high-school student who wants to study dentistry.

<HEADLINE> $1.84 Trillion Budget Unveiled  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To a chorus of Republican ridicule, President Clinton
sent Congress his budget finale on Monday, a $1.84 trillion plan to expand
health care access, shrink the national debt and shower Democratic
constituencies with election-year largesse.
</P>
<P>
	   Blessed with a budgetary bonanza that past presidents could only dream about
-- a projected $2.92 trillion in federal surpluses over the next decade --
Clinton used his spending outline to propose something for almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
	   He would cut taxes for the sick, elderly, poor and college-bound; spend more
for the environment, schools and gun-law enforcement; and erase the $3.7
trillion publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal is sure to be heavily reworked by Congress, where defiant
Republicans dismissed it as a gambit to bolster Vice President Al Gore's
presidential bid and the Democratic drive to capture Congress. They promised to
fatten the plan's tax cuts, trim its spending boosts and ignore its tax
increases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has all things for everyone they feel they'll need to get Al Gore
elected president,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio,
who called it ``the president's fantasy budget.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I look forward to working with the president in putting together a serious
spending proposal,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
``But this is a document designed to help Al Gore win election.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was little denying presidential politics at the White House, where
officials said at least a dozen Gore proposals were latticed into the outline.
But beyond that, Clinton's farewell spending blueprint -- for fiscal 2001,
beginning Oct. 1 -- was an effort to choose the terrain of this year's budget
battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton proposed $351 billion in tax cuts through 2010 that he argues can
only be enlarged by eroding Social Security's trust funds, diluting efforts to
expand and strengthen Medicare, or slashing other popular initiatives such as
hiring teachers or reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This budget, in short, makes really strong and significant steps toward
achieving the great goals that I believe America should pursue in this new
century,'' Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans said that at a time of surplus, taxpayers should get a bigger
break than Clinton wants to give them.
</P>
<P>
	   They criticized his proposal to raise other revenues by $181 billion over 10
years, including higher taxes on cigarettes and some corporate transactions. And
they noted that using Clinton's own figures, there would be a net $9 billion tax
increase in 2001 and a $1 billion increase in 2002 before annual tax cuts begin
to outweigh increases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me be very clear: This Congress will not raise taxes,'' said House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton took congressional predictions that his plan was dead on arrival in
stride: ``That's what they said in '99, and we got most of it; that's what they
said in '98, and we got most of it,'' he asserted on CNN's ``Money Line.''
</P>
<P>
	   Strikingly, the president's budget boasted few initiatives that he has not
proposed before.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the new ones was a $91 billion, 10-year effort to expand health
coverage for working poor families. It is aimed at covering 5 million of the 44
million Americans who lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   He also called for setting aside $35 billion, beginning in 2006, for extra
prescription drug coverage for the sickest Medicare patients. This is on top of
a $160 billion, 10-year plan for prescription drug benefits for Medicare
patients, similar to his proposal of last year that Congress ignored.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also proposed extra spending to help farmers deal with low
commodities prices; about the same $278 billion Pentagon budget as this year;
and extra money to buy park lands, modernize schools and hire new federal agents
and prosecutors who focus on gun laws.
</P>
<P>
	   In one area of bipartisan agreement, the president would set aside the $2.17
trillion Social Security surplus over the next decade for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   By 2013, he said, the $3.7 trillion portion of the national debt should be
gone for the first time since 1835, which economists say should lower interest
rates and add muscle to the economy. The rest of the $5.7 trillion national debt
is money in federal trust funds such as Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton estimates that over the next 10 years, there will be a $746 billion
surplus in the rest of the budget -- a figure that will be pivotal in this
year's fiscal fight.
</P>
<P>
	   He would use this money to help pay for his tax cut, the prescription drug
proposal, the health insurance initiative for poor families and additional debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Republicans have made no final decisions, they will estimate this
part of the surplus to be hundreds of billions larger than $746 billion. That
would leave more room for the bigger tax cuts favored by most Republicans,
including the $1.3 trillion, 10-year plan advanced by GOP presidential contender
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's surplus estimate is smaller because he assumes that spending for
the one-third of the budget Congress determines every year will grow annually at
nearly the rate of inflation. Republicans say spending for this portion of the
budget -- which includes everything but automatically paid benefits like Social
Security -- will not grow that fast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is government on autopilot,'' Domenici said.
</P>
<P>
	   By crediting some debt reduction to Medicare and Social Security, Clinton
said his plan would extend Social Security solvency to 2050 and Medicare's to
2025.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton proposed no overhaul of either program's benefits or revenues,
which many analysts say must occur to prepare for the looming retirement of the
baby boomers. That omission seemed a concession that bipartisan consensus this
election year is impossible on those politically charged programs.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Lebanon Air Strikes  </HEADLINE>
   By SAM F. GHATTAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes struck a guerrilla stronghold and
power stations across Lebanon early Tuesday, causing widespread blackouts in
apparent retaliation for Hezbollah attacks that killed five Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike came after a week of bloody attacks by the Muslim guerrillas and
graphic footage of wounded Israelis on the evening news in Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   The bloodshed prompted talk that Israel will expedite a planned withdrawal
from Lebanon, but it also created fears of increased violence near the
Israel-Lebanon border. Sirens ordered residents into shelters in Israeli border
towns Monday, and heavily armed troops reported to their commanders at border
crossings.
</P>
<P>
	   Jets began concentrated attacks in Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, unleashing
several air-to-surface missiles and plunging the city immediately in darkness,
witnesses said. Planes also hit a power station in the mountains east of the
northern port city of Tripoli, and followed it with a strike on the Jamhour
substation on a hill overlooking Beirut. There was no word on casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Beirut, the Lebanese capital, was plunged into darkness soon after the raid
as Israeli jets roared over the city for about half an hour. A huge ball of
orange flame and clouds of smoke rose from the Beirut station.
</P>
<P>
	   The same station was hit twice before -- once in June, when Israel
previously punished Lebanon by targeting power stations, and once in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The impacts blew out windows and doors of apartments in Baalbek as jets
roared over the Shiite Muslim-populated city, also home to world-famous Roman
ruins. Soon after the second sortie, ground gunners opened up with anti-aircraft
fire on the raiding jets.
</P>
<P>
	   A second wave of warplanes hit a television relay station belonging to
Hezbollah on the southeastern edge of Baalbek and there were reports that
Hezbollah targets south of the city were also hit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army said the attacks on three power plants in Lebanon were in
response to ``the severe escalation in the activities of Hezbollah and other
organizations in south Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who have harmed us, will be harmed,'' Barak said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   But Israeli officials' attention also turned to the longer-term impact of
the violence. Ministers in Barak's Cabinet said Monday it was becoming clear
that a withdrawal from Lebanon without Syria's agreement was likely.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1985, Israel established a buffer zone in south Lebanon to protect nearby
northern Israeli towns from guerrilla attacks. But Islamic Hezbollah guerrillas
have been fighting to drive the Israelis out ever since, and Barak said last
July 7 that Israel would withdraw within a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak had hoped a pullout would be through an agreement with Syria, the main
power broker in Lebanon. But Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down last month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no point in waiting until July, unless someone thinks that by
then we can achieve an agreement (with Syria),'' said Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
Barak's tourism minister and one of his lead Syria negotiators.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak's Police Minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, said Israelis should not rule out
an earlier withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Some warned that a unilateral withdrawal would be counterproductive,
bringing the Hezbollah within firing range of the Israeli towns arrayed along
the border.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's easy to call for a unilateral withdrawal when you don't consider what
will happen the next day among the northern border communities,'' said
opposition Likud lawmaker Silvan Shalom.
</P>
<P>
	   But the dramatic details of the latest deaths and grisly footage of the
fighting raised public pressure on Barak to make good on his promise to get out.
This week and last, five Israeli soldiers and a senior officer in the
Israel-allied South Lebanese Army died in Hezbollah attacks. On Sunday, a medic
was killed while he was tending to three soldiers wounded in earlier firing.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Barak significantly dropped the clause ``with an agreement'' when
he repeated his pledge to meet the deadline. He also blames Syria for not
restraining -- possibly even encouraging -- the Iranian-backed Hezbollah's
intensified attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Strikes like the one Israel launched early Tuesday usually invite guerrilla
retaliation in the form of Katyusha rockets aimed at northern border towns. As
soon as the army ordered people into shelters Monday night, residents fled the
oft-hit town of Kiryat Shmona in convoys. The army warned that an attack on
Israeli territory would lead to a ``harsh reaction from Israel.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech timed for prime-time newscasts, Barak told Israelis that they
would have to ``bite their lips in determination'' to meet the July deadline --
a warning that further violence was ahead.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Plane Hijack Talks Held  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BARR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Authorities held ``fairly calm and businesslike''
negotiations over long hours Monday with apparent Afghan dissidents holding a
planeload of at least 150 people hostage at an airport outside London.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials did not disclose what political demands, if any, the hijackers put
forth. But a diplomat familiar with earlier negotiations when the airliner
landed in Moscow said those holding the plane sought to free a prisoner held in
the Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghan media speculated the hijackers were dissidents who sought the release
of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor who has been held since 1997 by
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement. Khan is a member of Afghanistan's
opposition alliance, which still rules roughly 10 percent of the war-shattered
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Once in Britain, the hijackers requested only food, water, unspecified
medical supplies and that the lavatories on the Afghan state-run Ariana Airlines
plane be emptied, said John Broughton, assistant chief constable of the Essex
Police.
</P>
<P>
	   He characterized the negotiations, conducted in English, as ``fairly calm
and businesslike'' and said authorities were patiently working toward a peaceful
solution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Negotiations remain our favorite option,'' said Joe Edwards, another
assistant chief constable. ``I will say it could be a very protracted technique.
It could go on for days.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said that eight captives released Monday at Stansted, Britain's
designated airport for handling hijackings, ``tell us they were very
well-treated while they were onboard.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday at a news conference in Moscow, one of 10 passengers set free
there, Mohammad Bashir Mahal, said there were eight hijackers, and they appeared
to be Afghani because of their language and clothes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were all young -- around 25-30 years old, dressed in traditional
Afghan costume -- and to begin with they were threatening,'' he said in Pashtu,
the principal language of Afghanistan. ``But slowly, their aggression subsided
and they treated us quite well. No one was beaten or insulted. Relations were
good.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said they were armed with pistols, grenades and daggers.
</P>
<P>
	   Half of those released in Moscow were old or ailing men and the other half
young men, since Afghan tradition calls for every elderly or sick person to be
accompanied by a young person, the hostages said.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's NTV television quoted another freed hostage, who wasn't further
identified, as saying that passengers did not pass through a metal detector
before they boarded the flight. The man said that 20 minutes after the plane
took off, he heard a sound and turned around and saw the eight armed hijackers,
who calmly asked the passengers to put their hands on their heads.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 727 was seized shortly after takeoff early Sunday on a domestic
Ariana flight from the Afghan capital, Kabul, to the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
	   Before landing early Monday at Stansted, about 25 miles north of London, the
hijackers had freed 22 hostages in return for supplies during earlier stops in
Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said they could not confirm the nationalities of what were
believed to be 157 hostages remaining on the airliner. They disclosed that one
passenger has a serious kidney illness, but said they did not know if that
person was among those released.
</P>
<P>
	   As night fell, the plane remained parked about a half-mile from Stansted's
main terminal, which still managed to operate at more than 80 percent capacity
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broughton said it wasn't Britain's policy ``to allow aircraft to take off
again once landed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban said it would neither negotiate nor agree to
the demands of the hijackers. A statement issued by the religious militia's
supreme leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, accused the head of an anti-Taliban
alliance, Ahmed Shah Massood, of masterminding the hijacking. The Taliban
provided no evidence, however.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are watching this closely, waiting to hear what the demands are,''
Taliban Foreign Ministry spokesman Faiz Ahmed Faiz said in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Afghanistan and Britain do not have diplomatic relations, Faiz said a
Taliban representative in London was in contact with British authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The Afghan opposition has denied any involvement in the seizure of the
plane. It faxed a formal statement to The Associated Press saying it ``adamantly
condemns the hijacking.''
</P>
<P>
	   An emergency official in Kazakstan said 20 hijackers were aboard, but the
passengers released there said eight to 10 hijackers were aboard.

<HEADLINE> Catholic Leader Hume Appeals To IRA  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's most respected Catholic
politician appealed Monday for the Irish Republican Army to give up a cache of
its most powerful explosives, saying such a gesture was needed to prevent the
province's government from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
	   John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, sought to
resolve the crisis that is threatening Northern Ireland's Catholic-Protestant
administration after just two months in power.
</P>
<P>
	   Hume said the U.S.-brokered peace deal that got the administration formed
also created expectations the IRA would start to disarm. The outlawed group has
so far refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I now appeal to the IRA to show their deep respect for the will of the
Irish people,'' Hume said in remarks published by the Irish News, Northern
Ireland's main Catholic newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ask them to demonstrate for all to see their patriotism and desire to
move the situation forward by strengthening the peace process through beginning,
voluntarily, the process of decommissioning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He called on the IRA to hand over some Semtex, the Czech-made plastic
explosive the group has particularly prized since receiving several tons of it
from Libya in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   But the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party rebuffed the message. Sinn Fein chairman
Mitchel McLaughlin said Hume normally demonstrated ``great sensitivity and
judgment'' -- but that it would be ``hard to imagine a more inappropriate moment
to make that particular suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hume's IRA appeal came hours after dissident IRA members bombed a rural
hotel in Irvinestown, 90 miles west of Belfast. No one was injured in Sunday's
blast, but the attack was bitter reminder of the days the province is struggling
to leave behind.
</P>
<P>
	   The Continuity IRA, a dissident splinter group that claimed responsibility
for the bombing, answered Hume by threatening further violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We intend to continue to progress our war effort regardless of how British
rule in the six occupied counties is remodeled,'' the group said in a statement
Monday, referring to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   The province's major British Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, has
threatened to withdraw from Northern Ireland's Cabinet if the IRA does not begin
to surrender its weapons. It has scheduled a meeting for Saturday to debate the
issue.
</P>
<P>
	   That has left the British government with a choice -- to watch the Cabinet
collapse outright, or try to keep it intact by rendering it powerless.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair's government announced it intends to
push legislation through the House of Commons on Tuesday. That would enable
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson to revoke the Cabinet's
authority and resume so-called ``direct rule'' from London on Friday, as he has
already said he intends to do.
</P>
<P>
	   Hume, who shared the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize with Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble, is considered a prime architect of the peace process that
produced the Good Friday peace accord in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   That pact proposed that the power-sharing Cabinet be buoyed by gradual
paramilitary disarmament. But since it did not link the two goals explicitly,
the Ulster Unionists spent more than a year demanding a start to IRA disarmament
before they would share power with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
	   The breakthrough brokered in November by American diplomat George Mitchell
required the Ulster Unionists to accept Sinn Fein before the IRA would open
negotiations with the disarmament commission. The commission issued its first
detailed report about that secret dialogue Jan. 31 -- and confirmed no concrete
progress had been made.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Defense Minister Killed  </HEADLINE>
   By JOVANA GEC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia's defense minister was fatally shot
Monday in a Belgrade restaurant, the latest and the highest-ranking victim in a
spate of gangland-style killings.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic, a loyal aide to President Slobodan
Milosevic, died at the Belgrade military hospital where he was taken after being
shot in the dining area of the soccer club Rad, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Montenegrin police said the gunman fired through a window of the restaurant,
hitting Bulatovic; the restaurant's owner, Mirko Knezevic; and banker Vuk
Obradovic from behind with automatic weapon fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Knezevic and Obradovic were slightly wounded, police said in a statement
carried by the official Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yugoslav government, which met for an urgent session, said in a
statement that Bulatovic ``was the victim of a classic terrorist act'' and
pledged to fight against ``terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agency said an urgent government session
was called for later Monday to discuss the assassination. Milosevic sent
condolences to Bulatovic's family, media reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack came less than a month after Serbia's most infamous warlord,
Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan, was gunned down in a Belgrade hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a dozen prominent people, some close to Milosevic, have been
killed in Belgrade in the past decade. Most of the killings have never been
solved nor the perpetrators apprehended.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the shooting, the area where Bulatovic sat at a corner table
was covered with blood and the floor was littered with debris. Pieces of plates
and broken glass were scattered around. Bullet holes were seen on the walls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bullets were shot from the outside, through the window, a few rounds
of fire,'' said waiter Andrija Jecmenica.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic, 52, had been defense minister of Yugoslavia since 1994. Bulatovic
was largely a figurehead minister, with all the major decisions being made by
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   From 1992 to 1994, Bulatovic served as Yugoslav interior minister in the
government of Milan Panic, a Serb-born businessman who was sacked by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic was a member of a pro-Serb faction in Montenegro loyal to
Milosevic and his Socialist Peoples Party is at odds with the Montenegrin
pro-Western government of President Milo Djukanovic. Yugoslavia is made up of
two republics, Serbia and the smaller Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
	   Miodrag Vlahovic, a political analyst in Montenegro's capital Podgorica,
said the killing of Bulatovic could be the result of a ``conflict of interest''
concerning business arrangements among top Yugoslav officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic was very close to Momir Bulatovic, the Yugoslav premier and close
ally of Milosevic. The two were not related.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The country in which the defense minister is killed like that in a
restaurant is a real banana republic, there is no doubt about that,'' Vlahovic
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition leader Vuk Obradovic, not related to the wounded man of the same
name, said Milosevic and other top government officials must resign because they
have turned the country ``into a criminal society where no one can feel safe any
more.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Magic 120, Warriors 100  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- John Amaechi scored a career-high 25 points, all but
two in the first half, to lead the Orlando Magic to a 120-100 rout of the Golden
State Warriors on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Amaechi's backup, Michael Doleac, had a season-high 23 points and Ron Mercer
scored 18 in his second game since coming to the Magic in a trade last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Antawn Jamison led Golden State with 22 points. Vonteego Cummings had 19
points, all in the second half, and Jason Caffey finished with 18.
</P>
<P>
	   But after winning four in a row, the Warriors have reverted to their old
ways the last two games. They never led Monday night, and coach Garry St. Jean
was ejected when he drew two technicals for comments to officials with 2:18 left
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando shot 61 percent to build a 66-44 halftime lead. The Warriors missed
17 of 25 shots in the opening quarter and was 18-for-52 (35 percent), including
1-of-8 on 3-point attempts, at the break.
</P>
<P>
	   The Magic's usually low-scoring centers led the first-half domination.
</P>
<P>
	   Amaechi, averaging 8.6 but coming off a 19-point outing in Saturday night's
win over Indiana, made 7 of 10 shots from the field and was 9-for-10 from the
foul line for 23 first-half points.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no dropoff when Doleac, a part-time starter averaging just under
eight points per game, entered. He made 6 of 7 shots and had 13 points at the
half.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando blew a 17-point lead before pulling away from the Pacers in the
fourth quarter of Saturday night's game. The Warriors, however, never made a
serious run after falling behind 27-9 with just over three minutes left in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Magic led by 30 before Golden State trimmed its deficit to 112-97 with
3:07 to go. But by then it was much too late to get back in the game.

<HEADLINE> Waco Protesters Greet Reno in Texas  </HEADLINE>
   By CONNIE MABIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno fought off angry questions
Monday night from a small group of Branch Davidian supporters who labeled her
the ``Butcher of Waco.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reno was visiting the University of Texas to lecture about community problem
solving.
</P>
<P>
	   Led by Austin talk show host Alex Jones, fewer than a dozen protesters
carried signs bashing Reno and the Clinton administration outside the Lyndon B.
Johnson Presidential Library and Museum before Reno's speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones labeled Reno the ``Butcher of Waco'' and the ``Supreme Obstructer of
Justice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reno never mentioned the Waco raid during her 45-minute speech, which
touched on topics ranging from crime and education to technology and
volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
	   During the question and answer session, Jones and others were heckled by the
audience of several hundred as they asked Reno about the April 19, 1993, fire at
the Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
	   The blaze ended a 51-day standoff between Davidian leader David Koresh and
the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the FBI. Some 80
followers died, some from the fire, others from gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Janet Reno has systematically suppressed evidence, covered up her
wrongdoings, and engaged in dozens of other Byzantine practices,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno refused to comment about most of the Waco-related questions, citing the
investigation by former Sen. John Danforth, the independent counsel who is
looking into whether federal personnel fired into the retreat as it burned to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress also continues to investigate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes, I owe an explanation to the American people and I have given it once,
twice, a third time and I will continue to give it, but at the time now with
Senator Danforth investigating I think I owe it to him to make sure that he can
conduct this investigation in the appropriate way,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the Justice Department asked a federal judge to throw out key
parts of the wrongful-death lawsuit against the government over the Waco raid.
The case, brought by surviving Davidians and relatives of those who died, is
scheduled for trial in mid-May.

<HEADLINE> W.Va. Candidate Admits 150 Arrests  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER BUNDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Gubernatorial candidate Joseph Oliverio beat his
detractors to the punch Monday and announced he's been arrested 150 times for
fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   He's also received 60 speeding tickets, has ``inhaled,'' at times abused
alcohol and lost his driver's license for a while but got it back in 1998, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just feel it's made me a stronger person. These guys want to make it out
like I'm some real bad individual,'' the 43-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
	   Oliverio, one of four Republicans challenging Gov. Cecil Underwood in the
state's GOP primary on May 9, said he decided to make the announcement after
receiving anonymous phone calls from someone threatening to reveal his past. He
said the caller claimed to be from a rival campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody threatens me,'' Oliverio said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't feel I have anything to hide. I may be embarrassed by some of the
stuff I have done. I've never done anything terrible. I never raped. I never
murdered. I never had children out of wedlock. I've been married for 20 years,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the fights were from the 5-foot-8 painting contractor's younger
years, and usually, someone else was the instigator, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said all the charges were misdemeanors and he never spent a day in jail.
``In West Virginia it's usually easier to pay a fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Oliverio said he stopped drinking excessively and fighting about seven years
ago and hasn't been arrested since then.

<HEADLINE> Memorial Held for Crash Victims  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WARREN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN MATEO, Calif. (AP) -- Eighty-eight monarch butterflies were released
into the chilly air Monday afternoon by family and friends of the 88 passengers
and crew killed in the Alaska Airlines crash a week ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Each butterfly is a symbol of those we are remembering today,'' said Lanny
Pinole, a Pomo/Miwok Indian spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
	   As he spoke, he burned sage in a healing ritual, sending pungent smoke
drifting into the eyes of about 800 grieving people, Red Cross volunteers and
Coast Guard officers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just like the soul, (the butterflies) have the ability to transcend from
earth to heaven,'' Pinole said, referring to an Indian legend about butterflies
carrying people's secret wishes. ``Each time you see a butterfly it will be a
reminder of the wish you made today.''
</P>
<P>
	   The butterflies were released at 4:26 p.m., the exact time that Flight 261
spiraled into the Pacific one week earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Concluding the service, a Coast Guard helicopter circled overhead carrying
two wicker chests full of flowers to be scattered into the Pacific Ocean along
the plane's intended flight path. Coastal fog grounded the helicopter Monday.
Officials hoped to scatter the flowers in the ocean Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, under a big white tent at the Bay Meadows racetrack, three company
executives spoke, followed by leaders of the Catholic, Episcopal, Jewish and
Muslim faiths.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Please take the time to look into the eyes of our Eskimo, and remember the
lives of those we have lost,'' said Cliff Argue, a vice president at the
airline, which lost a large contingent of employees in the crash. The airline's
logo, on the tail of each of its planes, is an Eskimo.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline paid for the service, which was organized by the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
	   The religious leaders urged people to accept that their loved ones are gone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``May we be willing to give permission to them to be dead. It is the way to
love and honor them now. It is the way they are now,'' said the Rev. Gerry
O'Rourke, representing the archdiocese of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   Christa Apelar lost her best friend, Jacqueline Choate, and the man Apelar
considered her adoptive father, Toni Choate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've never felt this kind of pain before. It's indescribable,'' said
Apelar, clutching an armful of long white carnations. ``I don't know when I'll
be better. It was really good to see the butterflies though. Jacqui loved
butterflies.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, McCain in Close S.C. Race  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain are locked in a very
close race in a poll of those most likely to vote in South Carolina's Republican
primary, and McCain is narrowing the gap nationally.
</P>
<P>
	   An ABC-Washington Post poll released Monday gave Bush, the Texas governor,
48 percent, and McCain 43 percent while Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes were in the
low single digits in the race to win South Carolina's Feb. 19 primary. The
difference between Bush and McCain was just outside the 4.5 percentage point
error margin for most likely voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The ABC-Post poll was designed to measure the sentiments of those very
likely to vote in a primary with relatively low turnout. Turnout in the last
three GOP primaries has been low, averaging below 10 percent of the state's
voting age population, ABC pollster Gary Langer noted. This poll allowed for
slightly higher voter participation in such a competitive primary, about 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   On 10 of 11 personal qualities, McCain scored higher than Bush in the
ABC-Post poll. South Carolina's potential voters saw him as more likely to say
what he really thinks, not a typical politician, someone who knows world affairs
and who has an inspiring personal story.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush performed better than McCain among core Republican groups in South
Carolina, leading among those who identify themselves as Republicans,
conservatives and members of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
	   More than four-out-of five said McCain would be a good commander in chief,
while two-thirds said that of Bush. McCain's overall performance was stronger
with the inclusion of more independents and Democrats, who can vote in the
state's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   In national polls of likely voters in the Democratic primaries, Vice
President Al Gore has a 30-point to 50-point lead over Bill Bradley, depending
on the poll.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has cut into Bush's lead in national polls since late January when
the Texas governor led by about 50 points, according to other surveys released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush led McCain, 56 percent to 34 percent, in a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll
taken after McCain's win in the New Hampshire GOP primary, compared with a 65-16
lead for Bush in the days immediately after he won the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   A Zogby poll showed Bush leading McCain 48 percent to 30 percent among
likely voters in Republican primaries. The ABC-Post poll had Bush at 63 percent
and McCain at 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Bush supporters have said he is the best hope of victory in November
and the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll indicated that a majority, 57 percent, still
feels Bush gives Republicans the best chance of winning the White House, while
39 percent said that of McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has caught up with Bush in how the public views them personally, with
67 percent viewing the Arizona senator favorably, compared with 51 percent who
said that in late January in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. Only 12 percent had
an unfavorable view of McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's favorable rating was at 63 percent, down slightly from the 71 percent
in October, while 31 percent viewed him unfavorably, up slightly from 21 percent
in October.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican race recently has focused on who is more of a Washington
insider and who is the outsider challenging the system. Interestingly, more
people saw Bush as a Washington insider, 35 percent, than saw McCain, a member
of Congress since 1983, as an insider, 27 percent, in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup
poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Six-out-of-10 people said McCain wants to be president because he has a
sincere desire to help the country, while people were about evenly split on
whether Bush wanted political power or wanted to help the country.
</P>
<P>
	   By a 2-to-1 margin, Republicans said they want a candidate who is not tied
to the party's leaders, in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. That's a description
that more closely fits McCain than Bush. A narrow majority of Democrats said
they wanted a nominee who was loyal, reflecting the advantage the vice president
has in that race.
</P>
<P>
	   The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of 1,018 people and the Zogby poll of 1,024
were taken Friday through Sunday. They both had error margins of plus or minus 3
percentage points. The ABC-Post poll of 1,013 people nationwide and 490 of the
most likely voters in South Carolina was taken Thursday through Sunday. It has
an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points nationally and 4.5 percent
for the most likely voters in South Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Pacers 109, 76ers 84  </HEADLINE>
    By HANK LOWENKRON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Four years ago, Larry Brown coached the Pacers to a
franchise record 17 consecutive victories at home. On Monday night, he was an
unwilling spectator as Indiana broke the record by defeating Philadelphia
109-84.
</P>
<P>
	   Reggie Miller overcame a slow start to score a season-high 32 points despite
sitting out the fourth quarter, and the Pacers limited Allen Iverson to just 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson, who matched his career high with 50 points Sunday in a 119-108
triumph over Sacramento, made only 6-of-19 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Indiana's 12th consecutive home triumph over Philadelphia, including
two playoff games last year when the Pacers swept the 76ers in four games.
Philadelphia's last victory at Indiana came on Nov. 24, 1993, the first of four
years that Brown coached the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
	   Jalen Rose, who spent much of Brown's final season at Indiana on the bench,
contributed 20 points to the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller had his first four shots blocked before finding his range to score 21
in the first half, including three of his five 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Theo Ratliff led Philadelphia in scoring for the first time this season with
16.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana, undefeated at home since Nov. 25, used a 20-2 run to take the lead
for good. Miller's first 3-pointer began the run with 2:15 left in the first
quarter and Indiana trailing 22-14.
</P>
<P>
	   The basket ignited a nine-point burst by Indiana and the quarter ended with
Philadelphia leading 24-23 following a layup by Matt Geiger.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana then pulled away by scoring the first 10 points of the second
quarter while the 76ers missed their first four shots and had an offensive foul
called on another possession.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pacers were up 62-44 at the break, having enjoyed their most productive
second quarter of the season. Indiana shot 82.4 percent from the field
(14-of-17) and made all eight of its free throws in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana went on to take a 25-point lead in the third period, and
Philadelphia never drew closer than 17.

<HEADLINE> Chief Rabbi: Pope Must Come to Us  </HEADLINE>
   By JACK KATZENELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- One of Israel's chief rabbis on Monday said that if the
pope wants to meet him during a March visit to the Holy Land, it must be on the
rabbi's turf.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau rejected a draft itinerary in which he and
Israel's chief Sephardic Rabbi are to meet Pope John Paul II while he visits the
Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site.
</P>
<P>
	   He said going to meet the pontiff on the wall's outdoor plaza would be
demeaning, and that the pope should come to one of their offices in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He will come to meet us in a place convenient for him for reasons of
health and for reasons of security,'' Lau told Israel's Channel Two TV.
</P>
<P>
	   The TV said that Chief Rabbi Eliahu Bakshi-Doron, who represents Sephardic
Jews of Middle Eastern descent, brought the issue to the attention of Lau, who
represents Ashkenazi Jews of European descent.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked what would happen if the Pope refused to accept the rabbis' position,
Lau said, ``If he cannot come (to our office), we wish him all the best. We do
not imagine that he will want to come here without meeting us.''
</P>
<P>
	   An official of the Catholic Church in the Holy Land said the program is not
yet finalized, and the Holy See will take into account the sensitivities of the
Jewish and Muslim leaders whom the Pope is to meet during his pilgrimage March
20-26.
</P>
<P>
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, could not say whether the
Pope would agree visit the seat of the chief rabbinate.

<HEADLINE> Seton Hall 69, No. 4 Syracuse 67  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN KEKIS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Imperfect in almost every way Monday night, No. 4
Syracuse is perfect no more.
</P>
<P>
	   Darius Lane hit a 3-pointer with 39 seconds left off a pass from Shaheen
Holloway to lift Seton Hall to a 69-67 victory over the previously unbeaten
Orangemen, whose season-opening win streak ended at 19 games.
</P>
<P>
	   The win, Seton Hall's third straight in the Carrier Dome, moved the Pirates
(16-4, 8-2) within a game of the Big East-leading Orangemen (19-1, 9-1).
</P>
<P>
	   "We fought, we battled, we knew Syracuse was a tough team," said Holloway,
who had 12 points, 11 rebounds, and nine assists. "But we wanted to come in and
try to make a statement, and I think we did that. It makes it that much sweeter
because they were undefeated."
</P>
<P>
	   And yet despite hitting just 2-of-13 3-pointers, shooting 37.3 percent, and
getting only seven points combined from starters Damone Brown, Ryan Blackwell
and Tony Bland, Syracuse hung in until the end.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Carrier Dome crowd reaching deafening levels, Blackwell scored his
only points of the game with 1:07 left, hitting two free throws to put Syracuse
ahead for the last time, 67-66.
</P>
<P>
	   Lane, who finished with 20 points, won it with a long 3 from the left side.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a real big victory," said Lane, who was 6-for-14 from long range.
"We worked so hard to get to this point, and we wanted to prove to everybody in
the conference and the nation that we're a good team. I think we did that."
</P>
<P>
	   The game was rescheduled from Jan. 22 due to a tragic dormitory fire that
killed three Seton Hall students. The Orangemen offered no excuses for the loss.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our effort wasn't that good on defense," said Jason Hart, who led Syracuse
with 14 points but had no assists. "They just hit some tough shots. You can't
allow a team to just sit out there and hit 3-point shots."
</P>
<P>
	   But that's exactly what the Pirates did -- converting 12-of-28 to give them
26 in the last two games -- and Syracuse didn't. The Orangemen made just 2-of-13
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were missing easy shots around the basket," Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim
said. "You're playing a good team that's making shots and you've got to make
shots."
</P>
<P>
	   The frustration peaked for Syracuse in the final 10 seconds. The Pirates
survived a 3-point try by Preston Shumpert and close-in shots by Blackwell and
Etan Thomas in the final 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   "The effort was there," said Thomas, who had 14 points and 13 rebounds. "We
kept fighting and we kept clawing and scratching. We just didn't come out on top
this game."
</P>
<P>
	   Rimas Kaukenas had 16 points and Al Harris a career-high 10 for Seton Hall.
Shumpert had 12 points and DeShaun Williams 11 for Syracuse, which outrebounded
the Pirates 43-29.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall, which used some great passing in the first half -- the Pirates
had 10 assists -- reverted in the second half to the long-range shooting that
had crushed West Virginia 97-66 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   After Shumpert's three-point play put Syracuse ahead 47-46 with 11:36 to go,
the Pirates began hitting 3s. Holloway hit the first, and Ty Shine and Lane each
had two to put the Pirates back on top 60-55 with 5:58 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams led Syracuse on an eight-point surge with a steal and fast-break
layup and a 3 to move the Orangemen within 64-63. And when Lane missed two free
throws, it appeared Syracuse might again escape as it had a week earlier against
St. John's.
</P>
<P>
	   But even a tremendous save by Williams to Thomas, who then fed Hart for a
layup with 1:41 left to keep the Orangemen's hopes alive was not enough.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew it was going to very tough," Seton Hall coach Tony Amaker said.
"Very rarely is a team going to go undefeated, as good as they are and as tough
as they are at home. It's tough to do that. But we also told our guys, 'Why not
us? Why not our team?"'

<HEADLINE> Hornets 95, Knicks 85  </HEADLINE>
    By JOE MACENKA AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Contrary to how it may have appeared, Eddie Jones
said his performance was nothing personal against the New York Knicks and Kurt
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones scored a season-high 34 points -- one short of his career-best -- to
lead the Charlotte Hornets to a 95-85 victory over the injury-ravaged Knicks on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was one of those nights when I think I just wanted it a lot more than
anybody else," said Jones, who made 13 of 20 field-goal attempts, including
5-for-7 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones was facing New York for the first time since a hard foul Dec. 20 by
Thomas left him with a torn ligament in his left elbow. The injury sidelined
Jones for 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was something that didn't have to happen, yeah, but I wasn't upset,"
Jones said. "We can't control some of the things that we do."
</P>
<P>
	   When Jones came out for the opening tip, he shook hands with all of New
York's starters -- with the exception of Thomas.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh, did I? I didn't know that," Jones said. "Don't read anything into that.
I was just focused."
</P>
<P>
	   Jones, voted a starting guard for the Eastern Conference in next weekend's
All-Star game, helped the Hornets make a season-high 10 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Eddie was outstanding," coach Paul Silas said. "Every time we needed it, he
stepped up. He hit big 3-pointers, he drove to the hoop, he got steals. If he'd
missed a couple of shots, New York would have been right back in it. I think it
was his best game by far."
</P>
<P>
	   The Hornets helped their cause by getting Patrick Ewing into foul trouble.
Ewing, coming off a 44-minute outing Sunday in which he had 25 points and 14
rebounds to lead the Knicks over Miami, followed it up against Charlotte with 15
points, 10 rebounds and four fouls in 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Derrick Coleman added 29 points and 13 rebounds as Charlotte improved to
19-3 at home and sent the Knicks to their fourth consecutive road loss.
</P>
<P>
	   "We didn't play well enough to beat the team that has the second-best record
at home," New York coach Jeff Van Gundy said. "It wasn't a letdown. We got beat
by a team that played better."
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami game cost the Knicks forward Larry Johnson, who broke a foot, and
Marcus Camby, who tore a knee ligament.
</P>
<P>
	   Allan Houston limped off in the third quarter with a twisted left ankle. But
he returned for the fourth quarter, when he scored six of his 26 points.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think everybody's banged up right now," Van Gundy said. "We've still got
to find ways to win on the road."
</P>
<P>
	   Ewing had seven points in the final quarter of a game that was originally
scheduled for Jan. 14 but was postponed following the death of Charlotte's Bobby
Phills.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlotte set the tone immediately, scoring its first three baskets by
driving directly at the 37-year-old Ewing. By halftime, Ewing and his only
available replacement, Chris Dudley, both had three fouls and the Hornets were
ahead to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hornets closed the third quarter with a 19-7 run, including eight points
by Jones, to go up 77-63.
</P>
<P>
	   The closest the Knicks got the rest of the way was 88-83 on a layup by Ewing
with 3:49 remaining, but the Hornets scored the next five points to push their
lead back to double digits.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Lebanon Air Strikes  </HEADLINE>
   By SAM F. GHATTAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes struck a guerrilla stronghold and
power stations across Lebanon early Tuesday, retaliating for Hezbollah attacks
that killed five Israeli soldiers. Witnesses said 15 people were wounded in the
heaviest airstrikes in months.
</P>
<P>
	   Large areas of Lebanon were plunged into darkness, including the capital of
Beirut, Baalbek and the cities of Sidon and Tyre in the south.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said the air raids began with concentrated attacks on Baalbek,
targeting a power station on the edge of the town and a Hezbollah stronghold.
The town immediately lost electricity. The power station was still burning hours
after the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   The 15 people injured, including four women and four children, lived in
houses near the station, witnesses said. Their injuries were caused by flying
glass and debris. Some houses in the area cracked and shop shutters were blown
off.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All we can remember is that we were hit and now we are here,'' said one of
the injured, 18-year-old Ibrahim Noon, who was hospitalized for cuts on his legs
and arms.
</P>
<P>
	   Damage to the Hezbollah position of Al-Aseera wasn't immediately clear. The
impacts blew out windows and doors of apartments in Baalbek as jets roared over
the Shiite Muslim-populated city, chased by anti-aircraft fire. A television
relay station belonging to Hezbollah was also fired on.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli jets also hit power transformers in the mountains east of the
northern port city of Tripoli, knocking out power to some surrounding areas,
according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli jets repeatedly focused on a Beirut power station. Anti-aircraft
fire and tracers lit up the Beirut night sky. Witnesses said a missile hit the
road in front of the facility, creating a huge crater that prevented fire
fighters from reaching the site for about 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Beirut was plunged into darkness as Israeli jets roared low over the city
for about half an hour. A huge ball of orange flame and clouds of smoke rose
from the Beirut station. The same station was hit twice before -- once in June,
when Israel previously punished Lebanon by targeting power stations, and once in
1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army said attacks were in response to ``the severe escalation in
the activities of Hezbollah and other organizations in south Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's raids came hours after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
Security Cabinet ordered a ``harsh military response,'' according to a senior
Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Those who have harmed
us, will be harmed,'' Barak said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah has been fighting to drive the Israelis out of a security zone
they established in southern Lebanon in 1985 to protect the country's northern
settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks. Barak said last July 7 that
Israel would withdraw from the area within a year. He had hoped a pullout would
be through an agreement with Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, but
Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The dramatic details of the latest deaths in southern Lebanon and grisly
footage of the fighting raised public pressure on Barak to make good on his
promise to get out. Besides the five soldiers, a senior commander in the
Israel-allied South Lebanon Army died in Hezbollah attacks last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Strikes like the one Israel launched early Tuesday usually invite guerrilla
retaliation in the form of Katyusha rockets aimed at northern border towns. As
soon as the Israeli army ordered people into shelters Monday night, residents
fled the oft-hit town of Kiryat Shmona in convoys.

<HEADLINE> W.Va. Candidate Admits 150 Arrests  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER BUNDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Gubernatorial candidate Joseph Oliverio beat his
detractors to the punch Monday and announced he's been arrested 150 times for
fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   He's also received 60 speeding tickets, has ``inhaled,'' at times abused
alcohol and lost his driver's license for a while but got it back in 1998, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just feel it's made me a stronger person. These guys want to make it out
like I'm some real bad individual,'' the 43-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
	   Oliverio, one of four Republicans challenging Gov. Cecil Underwood in the
state's GOP primary on May 9, said he decided to make the announcement after
receiving anonymous phone calls from someone threatening to reveal his past. He
said the caller claimed to be from a rival campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody threatens me,'' Oliverio said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't feel I have anything to hide. I may be embarrassed by some of the
stuff I have done. I've never done anything terrible. I never raped. I never
murdered. I never had children out of wedlock. I've been married for 20 years,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rod Blackstone, Underwood's spokesman, said the governor is running on his
record of ``accomplishments and achievements of moving West Virginia into the
21st century.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If other candidates want to run on other records, that's up to them,''
Blackstone said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Oliverio's fights were from the 5-foot-8 painting contractor's
younger years, and usually, someone else was the instigator, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said all the charges were misdemeanors and he never spent a day in jail.
``In West Virginia it's usually easier to pay a fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Oliverio said he stopped drinking excessively and fighting about seven years
ago and hasn't been arrested since then.
</P>
<P>
	   West Virginia Republican Party chairman David Tyson said campaigns should
focus on issues rather than personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that personal attacks are never very helpful but an individual's
past record is a public document. I think it's good that Mr. Oliverio is
choosing to address those things that are being raised,'' Tyson said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Alan Keyes said Monday
he will not support rival John McCain if McCain won the party's nomination
because he is ``not pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, speaking to a packed crowd at the National Press Club, said he could
not continue to support a GOP that nominates a candidate who favors abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will leave me,'' Keyes said of the party. ``I will not leave it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes criticized McCain for saying last month that any decision about ending
a pregnancy would be up to his teen-age daughter. He clarified that later,
saying it would be a ``family decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes has said the answer lacked the strong anti-abortion position he
considers crucial.

	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley's campaign for Ohio's March 7
primary will be chaired by two veteran officeholders and a college friend of the
former New Jersey senator, his campaign announced Monday on the eve of his first
visit to the state this year.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Minority Leader Ben Espy, former lawmaker and Cuyahoga County
Commissioner Mary Boyle and Cleveland lawyer Robert Rawson will run Bradley's
campaign in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement came the day before Bradley's first trip to the state since
Dec. 1. He planned a town meeting Tuesday night to discuss racial unity.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, Bradley's rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, is scheduled to attend a union dinner in Dayton on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rawson was Bradley's classmate at Princeton in the early 1960s and a fellow
Rhodes Scholar.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley has told gay and lesbian leaders he will
continue to speak out against a California ballot initiative that would ban
state recognition of same-sex marriages legally performed in other states, the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic presidential candidate met with representatives of the
Washington-based group during a campaign stop Sunday at a Queens, N.Y., church.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's rival, Vice President Al Gore, also has denounced the initiative
appearing on the state's March 7 ballot. State law currently recognizes only
marriage between a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are gratified that Senator Bradley not only recognizes the inherent
unfairness of Proposition 22, but will continue to use his campaign as a bully
pulpit to organize and get his supporters out to vote against it,'' said Kerry
Lobel, the group's executive director.
</P>

	   A Bradley spokesman confirmed the meeting, but declined to go into details.

	   OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- GOP presidential candidate Steve Forbes, long a
favorite of Washington's social conservatives, got a lift Monday when the
Republicans' 1998 Senate nominee, Linda Smith, announced her endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   The former state legislator and former congresswoman and longtime leader of
the state's politically powerful religious conservatives said she is sending an
endorsement letter to the 42,000 supporters on her mailing list.
</P>
<P>
	   In it, she declares Forbes to be her choice for the presidential nomination,
calling him ``a bold leader who stands on principle.'' Her nod is considered
significant, since she has built up a loyal following from previous campaigns,
her statewide initiatives and work on campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith's letter, released by Forbes' national campaign office, said, ``When I
compare today's presidential candidates to Ronald Reagan, I would have to say
the one that comes closest to him is Steve Forbes. Steve Forbes is the kind of
leader that we have wanted for many years.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' forces are hoping to do well in the state's precinct caucuses on
March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith's is the first major endorsement for Forbes in the state. Most of the
state's GOP establishment, including Sen. Slade Gorton and Rep. Jennifer Dunn,
have signed on to George W. Bush's campaign.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Christopher Rios, the platinum-selling rapper known as Big
Pun who was respected for his imaginative lyrics and smooth delivery, died
Monday. He was 28.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman said Rios was pronounced dead at and the cause of death was to
be determined by the medical examiner. Publicist David Granoff, who represented
the rapper, said it appeared Rios died of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Granoff credited Rios, who was Puerto Rican, with working to bring Latino
entertainers into rap, a style traditionally dominated by black artists.
</P>
<P>
	   The rap world started to take notice of Rios -- whose stage name was short
for Big Punisher -- after appearances with fellow rapper Fat Joe and a feature
on The Mix Tape Vol. 1 put together by Funkmaster Flex. His street hit ``You
Ain't a Killer'' was featured on the ``Soul in the Hole'' soundtrack and his
first album, ``Capital Punishment'' went double platinum.
Samuel J. Silberman
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Samuel J. Silberman, a former cigar manufacturing executive
and philanthropist, died Jan. 29. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1934, Silberman went to work for the Consolidated Cigar Corp., which was
founded by his maternal grandfather, Julius Lichtenstein. Silberman's father,
Alfred Silberman, was a tobacco grower and later was president of Consolidated.
</P>
<P>
	   Samuel Silberman became the company's chief executive and chairman. He
headed many charity campaigns with which the cigar industry was involved.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1964, he donated $4 million to New York City for social work education
and research. The gift led to the construction of the Hunter College School of
Social Work building in Manhattan.
Peter Tripp
</P>
<P>
	   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Peter Tripp, who entertained radio audiences with
his mid-1950s Top-40 countdown record shows on WHB in Kansas City, and later at
New York City's WMGM, died Jan. 31 of an in apparent stroke at his West Hills,
Calif., home. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
	   Tripp became a well-known Top-40 countdown radio personality beginning in
1954 at WHB. He was at WMGM from 1955-1960, hosting the ``Your Hits of the
Week'' program.
</P>
<P>
	   Tripp's name was linked to the payola scandal of the late 1950s and early
1960s, in which popular disc jockey Alan Freed's empire collapsed in disgrace
after it was revealed he had accepted money from record companies to play their
songs.

Israel Launches Lebanon Air Strikes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes struck a guerrilla stronghold and
power stations across Lebanon early Tuesday, causing widespread blackouts in
apparent retaliation for Hezbollah attacks that killed five Israeli soldiers.
The strike came after a week of bloody attacks by the Muslim guerrillas and
graphic footage of wounded Israelis on the evening news in Israel. Islamic
Hezbollah guerrillas have been fighting to drive the Israelis out and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak said last July 7 that Israel would withdraw within a
year. Barak had hoped a pullout would be through an agreement with Syria, the
main power broker in Lebanon. But Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down last
month.

$1.84 Trillion 2001 Budget Unveiled
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sent Congress his final budget today, a
$1.84 trillion plan to expand health care access and shrink the national debt.
He plans to cut taxes for the sick, elderly, poor and college-bound; spend more
for the environment, schools and gun-law enforcement; and erase the $3.7
trillion publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013. The proposal is
sure to be heavily reworked by Congress, where defiant Republicans dismissed it
as a gambit to bolster Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid and the
Democratic drive to capture Congress.

Mexico University Tries Recovering
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Police who ousted striking students from Latin America's
largest university found trash barricading streets, classrooms turned into
campgrounds and laboratories serving as kitchens. As officials on Monday
surveyed the damage -- and the countless scrawls of graffiti -- at the National
Autonomous University, they faced an even more daunting task in calming passions
at a school with 270,000 students and a crucial role in Mexican life. A day
after a police raid that apparently ended a 9 1/2-month strike, university
spokesman Roberto Vivanco said classes could resume after officials clean up the
campus. He gave no date.

Officials Talk With Afghan Hijackers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Authorities said they spent hours Monday holding
"fairly calm and businesslike" talks with apparent Afghan dissidents who are
holding at least 150 hostages in an airplane outside London. Although there has
been no official word on the exact demands of the hijackers, a diplomat familiar
with earlier negotiations when the airliner landed in Moscow said those holding
the plane sought to free a prisoner held in the Afghan city of Kandahar. The
Boeing 727 was seized shortly after takeoff early Sunday on a domestic Ariana
flight from the Afghan capital, Kabul, to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.

Hackers Break Into Yahoo!

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hackers attacked internet giant Yahoo! leaving the most
popular site on the Web inaccessible for most of today. A spokeswoman for the
company called the hacking technique a denial of service attack, which is
similar to pranksters repeatedly dialing a company's telephone number to block
all other incoming calls. Technicians ultimately were able to identify the type
of data and filter it out, which restored service.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 115, Bucks 111  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Portland's dominant defense didn't go to work until it
counted the most.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Smith had 24 points and hit a key jumper with 34 seconds left as the
Trail Blazers beat Milwaukee 115-111 on Monday night for their ninth victory in
10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Portland, which improved its road record to 20-8 and finished its Eastern
road swing with a 3-1 record, raised its league-best record to 37-11. The Bucks
have lost three of their last four.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing one day after a 100-94 victory in Boston, the Trail Blazers trailed
much of the night before storming back against the inconsistent Bucks, who shot
56 percent from the field but couldn't execute in the fourth quarter. Portland
hit 11 of 15 shot in the final period.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucks scored at will for much of the night, but after Glenn Robinson's
jumper tied it at 97 with 5:21 to play, the Blazers made an 11-4 run keyed by
big defensive plays from Greg Anthony, Rasheed Wallace and Smith. Milwaukee
managed just two jumpers by Danny Manning in a four-minute span.
</P>
<P>
	   Ray Allen's three-point play cut the lead to 111-109 with 18 seconds left,
but the Bucks let 10 seconds run off the clock before fouling Brian Grant. The
66 percent free-throw shooter hit two free throws, and Smith added two more with
2.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Portland took its first lead since the second quarter at 89-88 on a jumper
by Detlef Schrempf with 8:55 to play. Five reserves got the Blazers back into
the game with a 15-7 run spanning the third and fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson led the Bucks with 27 points, Allen had 26 and Sam Cassell added 18
points and 13 assists. Wallace had 17 points and Anthony added 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Milwaukee lost for the fourth time in six home games. Consecutive home
losses have killed the good vibes the Bucks had from a 3-2 Western road swing
last week, and Milwaukee fell further back in the Eastern Conference playoff
picture.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers struggled much of the night against the Bucks' free-flowing
offense. Milwaukee's 111 points were 23 more than Portland's league-low
defensive average of 88.6 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy, who coached the Bucks from 1992-96, beat his
former team for the first time.

<HEADLINE> Magic 120, Warriors 100  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Doc Rivers worried that the Orlando Magic might be
ripe for a letdown after beating two of the best teams in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   But there was no cause for alarm Monday night with the Golden State Warriors
playing more like the team that lost 12 straight in December and January than
the club that recently won four in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   "After beating New York and Indiana back to back, this game scared me a
little bit," Rivers said after the Magic never trailed in a 120-100 rout of the
team with the third-worst record in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
	   " I think the last three or four games we've really hit a nice stretch
defensively, which has scored a lot of points for us. It's all about defense,
and tonight we never let up."
</P>
<P>
	   Second-year center John Amaechi scored a career-high 25 points, all but two
in the first half. His backup, Michael Doleac, had a season-high 23 points,
while Ron Mercer scored 18 in his second game since joining the Magic in a trade
last week.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were very concerned about this team because we just played two tough
teams," Amaechi said. "We were smoked by these guys last time (113-100 at Golden
State on Jan. 17), so we knew we had to play."
</P>
<P>
	   Antawn Jamison led Golden State with 22 points. Vonteego Cummings had 19
points, all in the second half, and Jason Caffey finished with 18.
</P>
<P>
	   But after winning four in a row, the Warriors have returned their old ways
in losses to New Jersey and Orlando the past two days.
</P>
<P>
	   They never led Monday night, and coach Garry St. Jean was ejected when he
drew two technicals for comments to officials with 2:18 left in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think you have to look at what the Magic did to us instead of what we
didn't do," said Warriors assistant coach Rod Higgins, who filled in for St.
Jean after the ejection.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought they came out very energetic ... You don't want to make excuses.
I think the Magic deserved the lead, but I think there were some things we
could've done better, especially transition defense."
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando shot 61 percent to build a 66-44 halftime lead. The Warriors missed
17 of 25 shots in the opening quarter and were 18-for-52 (35 percent), including
1-of-8 on 3-point attempts, at the break.
</P>
<P>
	   The Magic's usually low-scoring centers led the first-half domination.
</P>
<P>
	   Amaechi, averaging 8.6 but coming off a 19-point outing in Saturday night's
win over Indiana, made 7 of 10 shots from the field and was 9-for-10 from the
foul line for 23 first-half points.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no dropoff when Doleac, a part-time starter averaging just under
eight points per game, entered. He made 6 of 7 shots and had 13 points at the
half.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando blew a 17-point lead before pulling away from the Pacers in the
fourth quarter of Saturday night's game. The Warriors, however, never made a
serious run after falling behind 27-9 with just over three minutes left in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's what Doc focused on at halftime," Doleac said. "That we've got to
take care of business, and just because we have the lead, don't let up and let
them back in the game."
</P>
<P>
	   The Magic led by 30 before Golden State trimmed its deficit to 112-97 with
3:07 to go. But by then, it was much too late.

<P>
    CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Nikki Teasley came off the bench to score 20 of
her 24 points after halftime, including two free throws with 22 seconds left in
overtime that clinched North Carolina's 66-63 win over No. 22 Virginia on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Teasley scored North Carolina's last 10 points of regulation. Her two foul
shots with 25 seconds to play tied it at 57, and Virginia missed two shots in
the final five second.
</P>
<P>
	   This marked the fourth overtime game in the last eight meetings between
North Carolina (12-10, 4-7) and Virginia (17-6, 9-2).
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia, which did not get off a shot in overtime after Teasley's free
throws, had not lost in the Atlantic Coast Conference since Dec. 5 at Duke.
</P>
<P>
	   LaQuanda Barksdale gave North Carolina the lead for good with a reverse
layup, making it 63-61 with 1:45 to play. She added a foul shot with 57 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Telisha Quarles got Virginia's last basket on a jumper that cut North
Carolina's lead to 64-63 with 45 seconds to play.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) -- Desmond Mason scored 31 points as No. 14 Oklahoma
State beat No. 20 Kansas 86-53 on Monday night, giving coach Roy Williams the
worst loss of his 400-game career.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cowboys (19-2, 8-1 Big 12) shut down the Big 12's highest-scoring team
for their fifth straight victory and ninth in the past 10 games. They also ended
an eight-game losing streak to Kansas that dated to Feb. 6, 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas (17-6, 6-3) has lost four of its past six, all on the road. The
Jayhawks came in averaging 83 points, but shot just 34 percent against the
league's stingiest defense. Kenny Gregory, their leading scorer with a 13.7
average, didn't score until the 13:36 mark of the second half and finished with
eight.
</P>
<P>
	   Mason was 10-of-14 from the field and finished one point shy of his career
high. He did miss two dunk attempts, but made all five of his 3-point tries and
turned one of those into a four-point play.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma State took control early and didn't give it up.
</P>
<P>
	   After Kansas took its only lead, 6-4 on a 3-pointer by Kirk Hinrich,
Oklahoma State went on a 21-5 run during the next seven minutes to take a 25-11
lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas, which averages 17 offensive rebounds, had only five in the first
half and was held to one shot on just about every possession during the Cowboys'
run. Meanwhile, Oklahoma State went 9-of-12, doing most of its damage inside.
</P>
<P>
	   Mason scored eight of the Cowboys' 12 points during one stretch later in the
half when they took their biggest lead, 43-22.
</P>
<P>
	   Things didn't get any better for Kansas in the second half, as the Cowboys
kept up their defensive intensity and gradually pulled away even further.
</P>
<P>
	   Hinrich led Kansas with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Monday, Williams' worst loss was a 123-95 loss at Oklahoma on Jan.
18, 1989, his first season at Kansas.

<HEADLINE> Pacers 109, 76ers 84  </HEADLINE>
    By HANK LOWENKRON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Four years ago, Larry Brown coached the Pacers to a
franchise record 17 consecutive victories at home. On Monday night, he was an
unwilling spectator as Indiana broke the record by defeating Philadelphia
109-84.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were great," Brown said of the Pacers, who shot 54 percent,
outrebounded the 76ers 43-39 and blocked 12 shots. "They shot well and defended
well."
</P>
<P>
	   Reggie Miller overcame a slow start to score a season-high 32 points despite
sitting out the fourth quarter, and the Pacers limited Allen Iverson to just 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "Reggie was just sensational," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson, who matched his career high with 50 points Sunday in a 119-108
triumph over Sacramento, made only 6-of-19 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   "Naturally the emphasis was to stop him and make sure he didn't get easy
looks at the basket. I thought we did a great job of swarming to the ball each
time he put it on the floor," said Travis Best, one of four Indiana guards that
helped hold the league scoring leader 17 points below his average.
</P>
<P>
	   "Guys really kept a hand in his face and made it tough on him."
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson declined to credit the Pacers for their defensive effort.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only person who could stop me is myself. I made some bad shots early
and had some bad judgments," added Iverson, who often had Miller defending him
with help from teammates.
</P>
<P>
	   "Reggie has played good defense as long as I've been watching the league.
He's an All-Star. What can I say, he played well," Iverson said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Indiana's 12th consecutive home triumph over Philadelphia, including
two playoff games last year when the Pacers swept the 76ers in four games.
Philadelphia's last victory at Indiana came on Nov. 24, 1993, the first of four
years that Brown coached the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's as well as we've played in a long time at both ends," said Indiana
coach Larry Bird. "We did a good job of getting helps early. It seemed like we
always had two guys there to help. The other night I talked about how selfish we
were in Orlando and tonight was the opposite. When we're like that, we're one of
the best teams in the league."
</P>
<P>
	   Jalen Rose, who spent much of Brown's final season at Indiana on the bench,
contributed 20 points to the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller had his first four shots blocked before finding his range to score 21
in the first half, including three of his five 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Theo Ratliff led Philadelphia in scoring for the first time this season with
16.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana, undefeated at home since Nov. 25, used a 20-2 run to take the lead
for good. Miller's first 3-pointer began the run with 2:15 left in the first
quarter and Indiana trailing 22-14.
</P>
<P>
	   The basket ignited a nine-point burst by Indiana and the quarter ended with
Philadelphia leading 24-23 following a layup by Matt Geiger.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana then pulled away by scoring the first 10 points of the second
quarter while the 76ers missed their first four shots and had an offensive foul
called on another possession.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pacers were up 62-44 at the break, having enjoyed their most productive
second quarter of the season. Indiana shot 82.4 percent from the field
(14-of-17) and made all eight of its free throws in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana went on to take a 25-point lead in the third period, and
Philadelphia never drew closer than 17.

<HEADLINE> Administration Seeks Embassy Safety  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two years after the bombing of two U.S. embassies, the
Clinton administration asked Congress on Monday for $1.05 billion to improve
embassy security for fiscal 2001 and an additional $3 billion over the three
ensuing years for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   Historically, Congress resists advance appropriations, but the
administration is hopeful lawmakers will make an exception for embassy security
given the vulnerability of overseas missions to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been a sense of urgency on the diplomatic security issue since the
bombing of U.S. embassies in East Africa in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   An independent panel led by Adm. William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, recommended a year ago an ambitious $14 billion program over 10
years to upgrade security at U.S. embassies and consulates and undertake new
construction where necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress appropriated $567 million for fiscal 2000, more than $800 million
short of what Crowe and his Accountability Review Panel recommended.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowe said he was pleased with the $1.05 billion the administration
requested Monday even though the figure is still almost a third less than his
panel had recommended.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whatever figure you turn in, you're always going to get a little less,''
Crowe said in a telephone interview. ``I'm going to keep agitating.'' He spoke
before the administration disclosed its intention to request an advance
appropriation.
</P>
<P>
	   Marshall Adair, president of the union that represents career diplomats,
said he was pleased that embassy security was given higher priority. But he
complained the administration is still about $1 billion behind where it should
be after two years, based on the recommendations of the Crowe panel.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that an estimated 80 percent of U.S. embassies are considered
substandard in terms of security.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright acknowledged that the $1.05 billion
contemplated for fiscal 2001, plus the advance appropriation request is not
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she is ordering a review of current plans ``to ensure that
cooperation encountering threats to our security from whatever source is at the
highest level.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our goal is to ensure that as far as humanly possible and consistent with
their professional responsibilities, our people are fully protected, to make
certain that the classified information we handle is fully secure, and to drive
home the message that at the Department of State, security is everybody's
everyday.''

<HEADLINE> 1 dead, 1 wounded in Westchester Community College shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   VALHALLA, N.Y. (AP) - A man in the midst of a breakup with his
18-year-old girlfriend accosted her in a college hallway Monday, shot her in the
head as she tried to get away, then shot and killed himself as he ran off across
the snow-covered campus.
<P>
	   "His hand went up, then his head went back. He was still running, then he
fell," said Rayvon Miller of Greenburgh, a student who witnessed the suicide at
Westchester Community College.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting was the first in the 54-year history of the college, said
Julius Ford, vice president of student services.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not really what you expect when you go to school," said Louis Ramirez,
a student from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   The wounded woman, Joy Thomas of Mount Vernon, was listed in critical
condition at the Westchester Medical Center. Detective William Rehm of the
Westchester County police said, however, that her gunshot wound - from a bullet
that glanced off her temple - did not appear to be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
	   Rehm said the woman was in a first-floor hallway of the Academic Arts
building at about 12:15 p.m. when the man, identified only as a Yonkers man in
his 20s who was not a student, confronted her.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was an ongoing prior relationship," Rehm said. "We have reason to
believe that that relationship may have been terminated by one party or the
other."
</P>
<P>
	   They argued and she tried to leave, Rehm said, but he followed and "she
obviously felt threatened. ... She went for the first open door she came to."
</P>
<P>
	   Just as she was going through the door, the man grabbed her from behind and
fired one shot from a handgun. She fell into the room, where a staff member and
a student had been meeting, and they shut the door behind her. The bullet that
glanced off her head was found embedded in the door, Rehm said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Closing the door was good thinking on their part," the detective said. "It
ended the assault and forced the perpetrator to leave."
</P>
<P>
	   The attacker ran off along campus pathways and was near the school's
Classroom Building when he shot himself. Blood marked the snow where he fell,
the gun still in his hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Don Gregory, a journalism teacher who walked by the body soon after the
suicide, called the experience "surrealistic."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a numbing sensation to see someone lying there. ... You feel despair
at not knowing what to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said classes were not interrupted for the 20,500 students, but campus
exits were sealed for half an hour until police concluded that the dead man was
the only attacker.
</P>
<P>
	   The school offered a telephone hotline for worried parents and counseling
for any students troubled by the shootings.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said the building where the first shooting occurred is patrolled by one
unarmed guard. The school will eventually review security, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack followed a likely murder-suicide at Columbia University. Police
believe former student Thomas G. Nelford slashed his girlfriend's throat
Saturday, killing Kathleen Roskot, a 19-year-old sophomore. Nelford then jumped
in front of a subway train a few hours after her body was discovered.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco-Arco Merger Challenged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Following the federal government's lead, the state
governments of California, Oregon and Washington went to federal court Monday to
try to stop BP Amoco's $30 billion acquisition of fellow oil giant Atlantic
Richfield Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The three states filed a suit that mirrored the argument offered Friday in a
suit by the Federal Trade Commission: The new company would dominate Alaska oil
production and control West Coast supplies, with the power to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger was to have been completed Monday, but the companies have agreed
to wait until March 10, when a federal judge is scheduled to consider the FTC's
request for a preliminary injunction. The states' suit may be consolidated with
the FTC case.
</P>
<P>
	   London-based BP Amoco agreed last March to acquire Los Angeles-based
Atlantic Richfield, known as Arco, a purchase that would create the world's
second largest non-government oil company, behind Exxon Mobil. BP Amoco and Arco
account for about 70 percent of Alaska crude oil production.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the merger focus on its effects on Alaska oil supplies to West
Coast refiners.
</P>
<P>
	   "The merger as presently proposed would result in a harmful monopoly of
Alaska North Slope crude oil supplied to California refiners," California
Attorney General Bill Lockyer said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Californians are already suffering from a lack of competition among
major refiners, and the new merger could cause "a major loss of competition and
greater squeeze of the West Coast."
</P>
<P>
	   The two companies say their combination will not damage competition and deny
the existence of a specialized West Coast market for Alaska crude oil. They
contend the international oil market would compensate for any effect on the
price of Alaska oil.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco has agreed with the state of Alaska to sell off holdings that would
reduce the merged company's share of Alaskan production from 70 to 55 percent.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Talks With Union To Continue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- Representatives of The Boeing Co. and its engineering and
technical workers' union met with a federal mediator on Monday to discuss an
impasse over contract issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks lasted more than 5 1/2 hours and were scheduled to resume Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Union spokesman Bill Dugovich said there were no breakthroughs and strike
preparations continue.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're giving this mediation our best shot. We're hoping for the best but
preparing for the worst," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said, "Boeing participated fully in the process
and will do so when the process continues tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
	   The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace voted down
Boeing's latest offer on Wednesday, but stopped short of calling a strike when
the mediator, C. Richard Barnes, agreed to intervene.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnes, head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, met with
both sides for five minutes Monday to lay the ground rules for the talks, then
sent them to separate rooms and began shuttling between them.
</P>
<P>
	   At Boeing facilities, workers reacted to a company memo asking for no
demonstrations or walkouts during the talks. At least 750 employees marched in
Everett, while another 400 to 600 people marched around the Museum of Flight in
Seattle's industrial district, Dugovich said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to the talks, neither side seemed particularly confident about a
friendly resolution. Boeing took away its previous offer, narrowly rejected
51-49 percent, and said it would no longer collect union dues until a new
contract was approved.
</P>
<P>
	   For its part, the union spoke with picket captains over the weekend about
strike procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   "They keep trying to use these bullying tactics," said SPEEA Executive
Director Charles Bofferding, regarding Boeing's decision on union dues. "I don't
think they've shown an inkling that they're willing to negotiate with us."
</P>
<P>
	   Conte said the dues move was perfectly legal since there is no contract, and
was done to help bring leverage to bear in the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   "The union can call for a strike, and we can refuse to collect dues, which
is a courtesy to the union on our part to begin with," Conte said. "These are
pressures that both sides are bringing."
</P>
<P>
	   Bofferding said the members of the union are ready to strike, despite the
slim margin of the previous vote. He said the union was willing to give
mediation a try, but would walk out and strike if Boeing proved intractable on
its positions regarding pay raises and benefits.

<HEADLINE> Indiana OK's Ten Commandments Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE SMITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indiana House approved legislation Monday that
would let government entities, including public schools, post the Ten
Commandments in their buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   The House approved the bill 92-7. The Senate already has approved a similar
measure, and it seems certain that one of the bills will end up on the desk of
Gov. Frank O'Bannon. O'Bannon has said he would sign the bill if it was
constitutional, and he believes the current versions are.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the bill, the commandments could be posted in schools, courthouses or
on other government property if displayed with other documents of historical
significance that have formed and influenced the U.S. legal system.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate comes amid a nationwide push to display the commandments in
public venues. Supporters say America based its system of laws on the 10 rules
the biblical Book of Exodus says God gave to Moses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indiana Civil Liberties Union and its national counterpart, the American
Civil Liberties Union, say that's not a good reason to post the commandments in
public buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that posting the commandments in
schools violates First Amendment protections against a government's promoting
religion. But new lawsuits are pending.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Vernon Smith, D-Gary, said the bill made sense, especially given crime
rates and violence in schools.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot separate the religious history of this country from the
government history of this country because they are intertwined,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think God is everything to this nation. I think the reason our nation is
in trouble is because we have cut off our roots.''

<P>
   NELSPRUIT, South Africa (AP) -- Floodwaters caused by torrential rains in the
northern part of South Africa left at last 19 people dead as they washed away
roads and bridges and snarled traffic, news reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   South African Broadcasting Corp. said that 15 people drowned when they tried
to cross a swollen river in Northern Province. Two others drowned in the same
province, while details of the remaining deaths were not reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Parts of the popular Kruger National Park were isolated because of flooded
roads. Parks customer relations manager Chris van der Linde said 18.4 inches of
rain had fallen in 18 hours. A restaurant's windows were broken and furniture
was floating away, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Administration Seeks Embassy Safety  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two years after the bombing of two U.S. embassies, the
Clinton administration asked Congress on Monday for $1.05 billion to improve
embassy security for fiscal 2001 and an additional $3 billion over the three
ensuing years for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   Historically, Congress resists advance appropriations, but the
administration is hopeful lawmakers will make an exception for embassy security
given the vulnerability of overseas missions to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been a sense of urgency on the diplomatic security issue since the
bombing of U.S. embassies in East Africa in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   An independent panel led by Adm. William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, recommended a year ago an ambitious $14 billion program over 10
years to upgrade security at U.S. embassies and consulates and undertake new
construction where necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress appropriated $567 million for fiscal 2000, more than $800 million
short of what Crowe and his Accountability Review Panel recommended.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowe said he was pleased with the $1.05 billion the administration
requested Monday even though the figure is still almost a third less than his
panel had recommended.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whatever figure you turn in, you're always going to get a little less,''
Crowe said in a telephone interview. ``I'm going to keep agitating.'' He spoke
before the administration disclosed its intention to request an advance
appropriation.
</P>
<P>
	   Marshall Adair, president of the union that represents career diplomats,
said he was pleased that embassy security was given higher priority. But he
complained the administration is still about $1 billion behind where it should
be after two years, based on the recommendations of the Crowe panel.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that an estimated 80 percent of U.S. embassies are considered
substandard in terms of security.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright acknowledged that the $1.05 billion
contemplated for fiscal 2001, plus the advance appropriation request is not
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she is ordering a review of current plans ``to ensure that
cooperation encountering threats to our security from whatever source is at the
highest level.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our goal is to ensure that as far as humanly possible and consistent with
their professional responsibilities, our people are fully protected, to make
certain that the classified information we handle is fully secure, and to drive
home the message that at the Department of State, security is everybody's
business every day.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Christopher Rios, the platinum-selling rapper known as Big
Pun who was respected for his imaginative lyrics and smooth delivery, died
Monday. He was 28.
</P>
<P>
	   Rios was pronounced dead at White Plains Hospital in suburban New York and a
spokeswoman said the cause of death would be determined by the medical examiner.
Publicist David Granoff, who represented the rapper, said it appeared Rios died
of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Granoff credited Rios, who was Puerto Rican, with working to bring Latino
entertainers into rap, a style traditionally dominated by black artists.
</P>
<P>
	   The rap world started to take notice of Rios -- whose stage name was short
for Big Punisher -- after appearances with fellow rapper Fat Joe and a feature
on The Mix Tape Vol. 1 put together by Funkmaster Flex. His street hit ``You
Ain't a Killer'' was featured on the ``Soul in the Hole'' soundtrack and his
first album, ``Capital Punishment'' went double platinum.
Samuel J. Silberman
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Samuel J. Silberman, a former cigar manufacturing executive
and philanthropist, died Jan. 29. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1934, Silberman went to work for the Consolidated Cigar Corp., which was
founded by his maternal grandfather, Julius Lichtenstein. Silberman's father,
Alfred Silberman, was a tobacco grower and later was president of Consolidated.
</P>
<P>
	   Samuel Silberman became the company's chief executive and chairman. He
headed many charity campaigns with which the cigar industry was involved.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1964, he donated $4 million to New York City for social work education
and research. The gift led to the construction of the Hunter College School of
Social Work building in Manhattan.
Peter Tripp
</P>
<P>
	   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Peter Tripp, who entertained radio audiences with
his mid-1950s Top-40 countdown record shows on WHB in Kansas City, and later at
New York City's WMGM, died Jan. 31 of an in apparent stroke at his West Hills,
Calif., home. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
	   Tripp became a well-known Top-40 countdown radio personality beginning in
1954 at WHB. He was at WMGM from 1955-1960, hosting the ``Your Hits of the
Week'' program.
</P>
<P>
	   Tripp's name was linked to the payola scandal of the late 1950s and early
1960s, in which popular disc jockey Alan Freed's empire collapsed in disgrace
after it was revealed he had accepted money from record companies to play their
songs.
</P>
<P>
	   Tripp, who denied taking money from anyone, left WMGM and took assignments a
KYA in San Francisco, KGFJ in Los Angeles, and WOHO in Toledo, Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Michigan AD to Resign  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan athletic director Tom Goss is expected to
resign as early as Tuesday, ending a rocky 29-month tenure, according to media
reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit's WKBD-TV reported late Monday that Goss submitted his resignation
earlier in the day, though school officials said they could not comment.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, The Ann Arbor News cited unidentified sources as saying Goss
would be fired Tuesday if he didn't resign.
</P>
<P>
	   Goss, who last week rejected reports that his resignation was imminent, did
not immediately return a message left Monday night at his home.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Madej, the school's sports information director, and Julie Peterson,
the university's spokeswoman, said they had no details about the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't even tell you no comment, because I don't know," Madej said before
directing questions to Lee Bollinger, the school's president who Madej said was
out of town.
</P>
<P>
	   Bollinger, who hired Goss in 1997, could not be reached late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Detroit News reported Tuesday that Goss' departure comes after he
angered Bollinger by not telling him of an NCAA probe of the eligibility of
freshman basketball player Jamal Crawford.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the NCAA suspended Crawford, the team's leading scorer, for six
games for his living arrangements while in high school.
</P>
<P>
	   The Free Press reported that Goss and Bollinger are expected to appear
together to discuss Goss' departure, though it was not clear when that would
take place.

<HEADLINE> Search Continues in German Wreck  </HEADLINE>
   By JOACHIM SONDERMANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUEHL, Germany (AP) -- Authorities struggled on Monday to identify
mutilated bodies pulled from the wreckage of a weekend train crash, saying more
victims might still be found.
</P>
<P>
	   Three of the eight confirmed dead -- one woman and two men -- were
identified as Germans. A police spokesman in Cologne said the severe injuries of
the other five, all male, was hampering efforts to determine their names or
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
	   Another 149 passengers were injured shortly after midnight Sunday when the
train, en route from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to Basel, Switzerland, derailed
just south of Cologne.
</P>
<P>
	   Workers managed to cut apart one of the two most severely damaged cars from
the nine-car train and remove it from the tracks. ``It is possible we will still
find more bodies,'' police spokesman Juergen Goebel said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was sleeping and woke up minutes before the crash -- maybe less than
that -- because I heard I think when it derailed,'' said one passenger, Daniel
Susskind, 22, of North Potomac, Maryland. ``It was very loud and it was also
shaking a lot.''
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said the train was going too fast -- 76 mph in a 25 mph zone --
when it hit a switch and went off the tracks.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Wille, a spokesman for the federal railway oversight office, said there
was no apparent technical reason why the train would have speeded up by itself,
especially considering it had braked normally just a few minutes earlier before
entering the station.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of Germany's Deutsche Bahn rail system, Hartmut Mehdorn, also said
Monday that mechanical defects played no role in the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of train safety is particularly sensitive after the June 1998
derailment of a high-speed train near Eschede that killed 101 people --
Germany's deadliest train accident ever. In a report released last month, the
cause of that crash was found to be a broken wheel.

    STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Two freshmen for No. 13 Connecticut are being
investigated for allegedly discussing swapping game tickets for shoes with
employees at a clothing at a Hartford-area mall, according to televised reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Freshmen Doug Wrenn and Tony Robertson were suspended for Saturday's
Michigan State game for an off-campus incident that occurred last month. Coach
Jim Calhoun would not elaborate on the incident but said he learned of it on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Television stations WTIC, WVIT, WTNH and WFSB reported Monday night the two
are the subject of police investigation stemming from the incident at the
clothing store. The store manager apparently stepped in and prevented the
transaction, according to the reports, which all cited sources that were not
identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither police nor the university would comment on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Wrenn and Robertson did not practice on Monday. Calhoun said he would make a

all the information that I need."
</P>
<P>
	   It's not the first time Wrenn has run afoul of Calhoun. He and reserve

against Iowa during the Coaches vs. Cancer tournament in Madison Square Garden.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 115, Bucks 111  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- It wasn't Portland's 37 points in the fourth quarter. It
wasn't the ferocious defensive stand in the closing minutes. It wasn't even the
acrobatic array of dunks, 3-pointers and blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
	   The most impressive facet of the Trail Blazers' 115-111 victory over
Milwaukee on Monday night was how remarkably easy it looked.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Smith had 24 points and hit a key jumper with 34 seconds left as
Portland roared from behind to squash the Bucks and record its ninth victory in
10 games -- even though the Blazers were playing their fourth road game in five
nights.
</P>
<P>
	   Portland, which has the league's best overall record at 37-11, is playing
with an ease that comes from depth, experience and, above all, confidence.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have an ability to stay in games and pull them out in the end," guard
Greg Anthony said. "We didn't play great all night, but when it's time to go, we
go."
</P>
<P>
	   Portland improved its road record to a 20-8 while playing just one night
after a 100-94 victory in Boston. The travel and the heavy work didn't seem even
to faze the Blazers, who handed Milwaukee its third loss in four games.
</P>
<P>
	   "First of all, we've got good bench support, and that gets us through some
tough stretches," coach Mike Dunleavy said. "Our stats look different every
night. Different guys do it for us every night."
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers trailed much of the game before storming back against the
inconsistent Bucks, who shot 56 percent from the field but couldn't execute in
the fourth quarter. Portland hit 11 of 15 shots in the final period.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a prime example of us not taking advantage of possessions,"
Milwaukee's Ray Allen said. "Portland did that. They went to the free-throw line
or took advantage of every other possession. That's how they won the game."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucks scored at will for much of the night, but after Glenn Robinson's
jumper tied it at 97 with 5:21 to play, the Blazers made an 11-4 run keyed by
big defensive plays from Anthony, Smith and Rasheed Wallace. Milwaukee managed
just two jumpers by Danny Manning in a four-minute span.
</P>
<P>
	   While all this was going on, the man many call the game's best defensive
player was a spectator. Scottie Pippen played just one minute in the fourth
quarter and finished with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's tough sometimes, but Mike leaves it up to the players to determine
who's going to play," Pippen said. "The guys who were in there were getting the
job done."
</P>
<P>
	   Allen's three-point play cut the lead to 111-109 with 18 seconds left, but
the Bucks let 10 seconds run off the clock before fouling Brian Grant. The 66
percent free-throw shooter hit two free throws, and Smith added two more with
2.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Portland took its first lead since the second quarter at 89-88 on a jumper
by Detlef Schrempf with 8:55 to play. Five reserves got the Blazers back into
the game with a 15-7 run spanning the third and fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was the bench guys stepping up," Anthony said. "Once we got them
stopped, we got some shots to fall."
</P>
<P>
	   Milwaukee's 111 points were 23 more than Portland's league-low defensive
average of 88.6 points. Robinson led the Bucks with 27 points, Allen had 26 and
Sam Cassell added 18 points and 13 assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallace had 17 points and Anthony added 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Milwaukee lost for the fourth time in six home games. Consecutive home
losses have killed the good vibes the Bucks had from a 3-2 Western road swing
last week, and Milwaukee fell further back in the Eastern Conference playoff
picture.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are a prolific team, and I think they got the benefit of the calls,"
said Milwaukee coach George Karl, who spent much of the fourth quarter arguing
over the 11 fouls called on the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
	   Dunleavy, who was the Bucks' coach and general manager from 1992-96, beat
his former team for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   "I root for these guys when we're not playing them," Dunleavy said of the
Bucks. "I drafted three All-Stars (Allen, Robinson and since-traded Vin Baker)
while I was here."

<HEADLINE> L.A. Small Planes Crash Kills 4  </HEADLINE>
   By CADONNA M. PEYTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two small planes collided over Los Angeles Monday, one
crashing in flames on a golf course and the other falling into trees near a
freeway. All four people aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   No one on the ground was hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Two men were killed in the plane that plunged through power lines and landed
on the golf course, and a couple believed to be in their 60s died in the other
plane, which fell into trees near busy Interstate 5, said Fire Department
spokesman Bob Collis.
</P>
<P>
	   Golfers on the sixth fairway at Cascades Golf Club scattered as burning
debris fell out of the sky over the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
	   One group of golfers was talking about last week's Alaska Airlines crash off
the Southern California coast when the planes collided overhead about 9:50 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We heard a loud popping sort of sound,'' said Jeff Childers, 50. ``It
immediately exploded on the lines, then fell to the ground and burned intensely.
You could smell the seat materials and fuel burning.''
</P>
<P>
	   The single-engine Bellanca Citabria, was patrolling oil pipelines between
Bakersfield and Los Angeles when it collided with the couple's Questair
experimental plane, said George Petterson, investigator for the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   The Citabria is a high-wing plane, and the Questair a low-wing aircraft.
Petterson said it is possible that the combination made it difficult for the
pilots to see each other.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A wing does block your view, and it is a see-and-be-seen concept of
flight,'' Petterson said.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB investigators were trying to determine altitude information about the
planes and recover a flight recorder, Petterson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both planes contacted Van Nuys Airport just before they collided about nine
miles north of the airport, Petterson said. The Questair pilot told controllers
the plane was going to land there, but it had not yet been given clearance at
the time of the crash, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kirsti Dunn said neither pilot
reported problems before the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Nuys Airport, in the heart of the San Fernando Valley, is considered the
world's busiest general aviation airport with nearly 607,000 flight operations
last year, according to the city airport department. About 730 aircraft are
based at Van Nuys.

<HEADLINE> Pitt Player Said Arrested For Drugs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PITTSBURGH (AP) -- University of Pittsburgh basketball player Isaac Hawkins
was arrested Monday on charges involving marijuana possession, according to
broadcast news reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkins was arrested at his apartment after neighbors complained of a strong
odor of marijuana, KDKA-TV reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Police found marijuana in Hawkins' apartment, according to WPXI-TV. He lived
in the city's Oakland neighborhood, near the Pitt campus.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-foot-8 senior forward was a redshirt this season after breaking a leg
in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkins' arrest is the latest offcourt incident for the Panthers. Chris
Seabrooks was arrested last fall for fighting and pleaded guilty to harassment
and disorderly conduct, receiving a 90-day suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Freshman Donatas Zavackas was benched for two games this season for
undisclosed reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   And last year, Pitt was embarrassed when former player Fred Primus was
arrested on theft charges during a road trip to Villanova.

Israel Hits Lebanon With Air Strikes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes launched a guerilla stronghold on
Lebannon power stations early Tuesday, retaliating for Hezbollah attacks that
killed five Israeli soldiers. The strike came after a week of bloody attacks by
the Muslim guerrillas and graphic footage of wounded Israelis on the evening
news in Israel. Islamic Hezbollah guerrillas have been fighting to drive the
Israelis out and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said last July 7 that Israel
would withdraw within a year. Barak had hoped a pullout would be through an
agreement with Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon. But Israeli-Syrian peace
talks broke down last month.

Indiana OK's Ten Commandments Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indiana House approved legislation Monday that
would let government entities, including public schools, post the Ten
Commandments in their buildings. Under the bill, the commandments could be
posted in schools, courthouses or on other government property if displayed with
other documents of historical significance that have formed and influenced the
U.S. legal system. Supporters say America based its system of laws on the 10
rules the biblical Book of Exodus says God gave to Moses. In 1980, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled that posting the commandments in schools violates First
Amendment protections against a government's promoting religion. But new
lawsuits are pending.

	   BRUEHL, Germany (AP) -- Authorities struggled on Monday to identify
mutilated bodies pulled from the wreckage of a weekend train crash, saying more
victims might still be found. Three of the eight confirmed dead -- one woman and
two men -- were identified as Germans. Another 149 passengers were injured
shortly after midnight Sunday when the train, en route from Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, to Basel, Switzerland, derailed just south of Cologne. Authorities
said the train was going too fast -- 76 mph in a 25 mph zone -- when it hit a
switch and went off the tracks.

$1.84 Trillion 2001 Budget Unveiled
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sent Congress his final budget Monday,
a $1.84 trillion plan to expand health care access and shrink the national debt.
He plans to cut taxes for the sick, elderly, poor and college-bound; spend more
for the environment, schools and gun-law enforcement; and erase the $3.7
trillion publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013. The proposal is
sure to be heavily reworked by Congress, where defiant Republicans dismissed it
as a gambit to bolster Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid and the
Democratic drive to capture Congress.

alcohol and lost his driver's license for a while but got it back in 1998, he
said. Oliverio, one of four Republicans challenging Gov. Cecil Underwood in the

<HEADLINE> No. 14 Oklahoma St. 86, Kansas 53  </HEADLINE>
    By OWEN CANFIELD AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) -- As milestones go, this was one Kansas coach Roy
Williams would rather forget.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams, coaching his 400th game, watched Desmond Mason score 31 points
Monday night as No. 14 Oklahoma State beat the 20th-ranked Jayhawks 86-53.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss was the third-worst in Kansas history and worst since a 100-63 loss
to Kentucky on Dec. 23, 1974. For Williams, it was his worst showing since a
123-95 loss at Oklahoma on Jan. 18, 1989, his first year at Kansas.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was the worst feeling that I've ever had on the bench," he said. "I
felt like I was useless.
</P>
<P>
	   "I did not have them prepared to face this kind of exhibition. I was totally
outcoached in every way and we were totally manhandled on the court."
</P>
<P>
	   The Cowboys (19-2, 8-1 Big 12) won their fifth straight and ninth in 10
games. They also ended an eight-game losing streak to Kansas that dated to Feb.
6, 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas (17-6, 6-3) has lost four of six, all on the road. The Jayhawks came
in averaging 83 points, but shot just 34 percent against the league's stingiest
defense.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told Roy that we played a little over our heads tonight," coach Eddie
Sutton said. "You play like that, you can play with most people in the country.
I thought our defense was outstanding."
</P>
<P>
	   Mason was 10-of-14 from the field and finished one point shy of his career
high. He did miss two dunk attempts, but made all five of his 3-point tries and
turned one of those into a four-point play.
</P>
<P>
	   "Desmond led us tonight like he did against Texas," said Oklahoma State's
Doug Gottlieb, referring to Mason's 30-point game against the Longhorns on Jan.
19. "He's a great player, and great players play great in big games."
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma State, which shot 54 percent, took control early and didn't give it
up.
</P>
<P>
	   After Kansas took its only lead, 6-4, on a 3-pointer by Kirk Hinrich,
Oklahoma State went on a 21-5 run during the next seven minutes to take a 25-11
lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas had only five offensive rebounds in the first half and was held to
one shot on just about every possession during the Cowboys' run. Meanwhile
Oklahoma State went 9-of-12, doing most of its damage inside.
</P>
<P>
	   Mason scored eight of the Cowboys' 12 points during one stretch later in the
half when they took their biggest lead, 43-22.
</P>
<P>
	   Things didn't get any better for Kansas in the second half, as the Cowboys
kept up their defensive intensity and gradually pulled away even further.
</P>
<P>
	   "They outplayed us in every phase," Nick Bradford said. "Coming into the
game we didn't want to give them open looks because they have great shooters.
That's what ended up happening -- they got open looks and knocked them down."
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Adkins had 18 points and Gottlieb scored 12. He also was 6-of-10 from
the foul line, where he came in shooting just 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Hinrich led Kansas with 12 points. Kenny Gregory, Kansas' leading scorer
with a 13.7 average, didn't score until the 13:36 mark of the second half and
finished with eight points.
