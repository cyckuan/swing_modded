<HEADLINE> Panel OK's $2B for Drug Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee approved $3.2 billion in  
spending Wednesday for substance abuse and mental health programs 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure represents an increase of $773 million over current  
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, states would share up to $2 billion in block  
grant funds for substance abuse programs, up from the current $1.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also would authorize $450 million in block grants  
for mental health programs, as well as $796 million in 
discretionary funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee  
approved the bill 17-1, sending it to the full Senate for further 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., voted against the legislation  
because religious groups receiving federal aid to assist substance 
abusers could require their workers to follow its teachings. The 
panel voted 10-8, along party lines, to defeat a Democratic 
amendment that would have removed that provision from the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., also  
includes $150 million for grants to help local communities help 
children cope with violence, $74 million for grants to assist youth 
substance abusers and $40 million for grants to help youthful 
offenders released from detention or suffering from emotional 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes funding to help the homeless.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 976.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Tumble / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices tumbled on Thursday after the  
government reported that U.S. wages and benefits surged in the 
second quarter, rekindling investors' concerns about inflation and 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped 25/32  
point, or $7.81 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 6.07 percent from 6.00 percent on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices plunged after the Labor Department said its  
Employment Cost Index -- a measure of changes in wages and benefit 
costs -- rose 1.1 percent from April through June. That was the 
biggest quarterly change since the second-quarter of 1991, when 
compensation increased 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher compensation raised worries among investors that the  
Federal Reserve might push up short-term interest rates again 
before the end of the year to check nascent inflation pressures. 
Higher rates would erode the value of fixed-rate investments 
already held by investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed last raised interest rates by a quarter point on June  
30. Greenspan in his midyear report to Congress this week said the 
nation's central bankers have not ruled out another rate increase 
this year if inflation flares. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices recovered somewhat by the end of the trading day as  
a plunge in stocks sent investors running for cover in the 
fixed-income market. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell by 1/8 point to 3/16 point, while intermediate-term Treasurys 
fell by 3/8 point to 19/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.71 percent and  
the discount increased to 4.59 percent, each rising 0.03 percentage 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields finished at 4.82 percent with a discount rate  
of 4.64 percent, up 0.04 percentage point. One-year yields were 
5.08 percent with a discount of 4.83 percent, up 0.07 percentage 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.13 percent from 4.94 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 11/16 to 117 31/32. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.58 percent, up from 5.54 percent.

<HEADLINE> Census Reveals New Ethnic Category </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A new U.S. Census form will allow people to  
write in their ethnicities instead of having to pick one category 
and ignore others to which they may also belong. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Census officials unveiled the new form Wednesday and also  
outlined the agency's plans for counting the nation's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	The new form will allow participants to write in their own  
ethnicity in the ``some other race'' category if it isn't included, 
said Anthony Greno, a census manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, Americans have been asked to choose one of four  
racial categories listed on the census. In recent years the growth 
in the number of people of mixed race led to calls for a new, 
multiracial category. 
</P>
<P>
	The government in 1997 rejected a separate ``multiracial''  
category but said it would allow people to list their ethnicities. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear how the ``other'' category will be  
considered by federal authorities who use census figures in 
compiling national trends and statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Worley, an assistant regional census manager for Southern  
California, said census-takers will now count the homeless on an 
individual basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time, we're going to soup kitchens, we're going to  
shelters and we're going to community-based facilities,'' Worley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also plans to increase cooperation with  
homeless-advocacy groups and hire the homeless as census-takers, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> T-Wolves' Coach Signs Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders  
signed a multi-year contract extension Thursday, more than doubling 
his $1.1 million salary of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders will average about $2.5 million over the life of the  
contract, which is guaranteed through the 2001-02 season. The team 
has the option for two additional seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders, 44, a native of Cleveland, became coach in December  
1995, replacing Bill Blair. Saunders, who has a 130-146 record, led 
the Wolves to a third straight playoff appearance last season. He 
is 3-9 in postseason games. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the team as general manager on May 11, 1995, and  
retains that title. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Minnesota athletic officials had recently talked  
to Saunders about possibly taking the coaching job vacated when 
Clem Haskins took a $1.5 million buyout of his contract. Saunders, 
however, declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are excited to have Flip continue as our head coach and  
general manager,'' owner Glen Taylor said in a prepared statement. 
``He is such a big part of our success the last three years, and we 
look forward to him leading our team into the next century.''

	Heat Death Toll Climbs to 59  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Much of the country is sweltering through  
another day of scorching temperatures today as a heat wave that has 
killed people in 10 states rolled on with little relief forecast 
until the weekend. The hot weather has been blamed for at least 63 
deaths since July 19. Hardest hit have been Missouri, with 22 
deaths, and Illinois, with 19. In St. Louis, two men in their 80s 
were found dead yesterday in their homes with air conditioners 
turned off and the windows closed. Meanwhile, utility companies are 
bracing for more heavy demand as millions keep their air 
conditioners cranked up.

	Clinton Vows Veto on GOP Tax Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate Republican plan to give Americans  
$792 billion in tax cuts over the next decade faced challenges 
today from a rival GOP proposal and a bipartisan package that 
reduces the cut by several billion dollars. President Clinton said 
again today that he will veto the ``large and risky tax cut,'' 
which he asserted could carry America back ``to the dark old days 
of huge deficits.'' Backers of the 10-year tax cut were confident, 
despite misgivings among several Republicans about its size, of 
winning passage by the end of the week and moving quickly to work 
out differences with a similar House-passed bill.

	Autopsy May Reveal Texas Hate Crime  
</P>
<P>
	EMORY, Texas (AP) -- Federal officials said they are  
investigating as a possible hate crime the death of a black man who 
the NAACP believes was tied to a tree and set on fire. The results 
of an autopsy are scheduled for release today in the death of H.W. 
Walker of Greenville, who disappeared in early May. His decomposed 
body was found June 2 in a remote section of Rains County, about 50 
miles east of Dallas. A 16-year-old white male has been in custody 
in connection with the slaying since the day after Walker's remains 
were discovered. NAACP officials in Greenville and Dallas conducted 
their own investigation and approached federal officials with the 
findings.

American Embassy in this island nation off the southeast coast of 
Africa. The jeep-type vehicle was stopped during a routine check at 
a roadblock installed in June to screen cars approaching the 
embassy. The street outside the embassy in downtown Antananarivo 
was immediately sealed off, but employees are still working, a 
security official said. The embassy in Mozambique, located on 
Africa's southeast coast, was closed last week for similar checks 
and remains closed today. Employees were working at home using

they concede that arresting anyone may be difficult. In a story in 
the Washington Post, David Schneider, a rehabilitation counselor 
from Jessup, Md., who was working as a volunteer at Woodstock, said 
he saw women being pulled into the mosh pit and having their 
clothes removed, before being assaulted and raped by men in the 
crowd. ``It seemed like most of the crowd around was cheering them 
on,'' he said. Calls to festival spokeswoman Hayley Sumner seeking 
comment were not immediately returned today.

	U.S. Economic Growth Slows Abruptly

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. economic growth slowed abruptly to 2.3  
percent during the second quarter as consumers curtailed exuberant 
spending that had been the major force behind the recent economic 
boom. The Commerce Department reported today that the gross 
domestic product grew by $44 billion from April through June to an 
inflation-adjusted $7.8 trillion. In a separate report today, the 
Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, considered the 
best measure of changes in wages and benefit costs, rose 1.1 
percent in the second quarter. That's the biggest quarterly 
increase since 1991, but it follows a record low 0.4 percent rise

<HEADLINE> China-Based Diplomat Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former China-based U.S. diplomat and the  
State Department office that investigated him for possible visa 
fraud refused to discuss the case with a congressional committee 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bonnie R. Cohen, under secretary of state for  
management, told the lawmakers that now-retired foreign service 
officer Charles Parish was aggressively investigated in 1996 and 
the inquiry ``did not reveal criminal wrongdoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parish, subpoenaed to appear before the Government Reform  
Committee, said he was following his attorney's advice when he 
invoked the constitutional protection against self-incrimination. 
He declined to answer any questions except to confirm his identity. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacquelyn L. Williams-Bridgers, the State Department's inspector  
general, also refused to talk about the case at the hearing. She 
said the Justice Department had advised her that discussing it 
could violate grand jury secrecy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general's investigation of Parish was conducted  
jointly with the FBI as part of the Justice Department's probe of 
campaign contributions, for which a grand jury was impaneled. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic fund-raiser Johnny Chung told the same congressional  
committee in May that Parish helped him get visas for dozens of 
Chinese. Chung said he ended his relationship with Parish after the 
president of a Chinese beer company asked him to deliver ``a 
shopping bag of money'' to the then-consular officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Parish, a 16-year State Department veteran, handled visa matters  
at the embassy in Beijing from 1994 to 1996. He retired last year 
after being transferred to State Department headquarters during the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., said he was appalled at  
Williams-Bridgers' refusal to discuss the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is absolutely the most ridiculous thing I've ever  
heard,'' he said, saying it was typical of what he considered the 
Justice Department's stonewalling on campaign fund-raising issues 
under Attorney General Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton said his staff found that foreigners are willing to pay  
up to $20,000 for a U.S. visa. 
</P>
<P>
	He accused the State Department of bumbling its investigation of  
Parish, destroying documents before reviewing them and failing to 
interview witnesses or subpoena bank records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody dropped the ball,'' Burton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the federal government ``aggressively pursued leads''  
in the case and found no need to take action against Parish. She 
said he ``performed in an excellent manner'' on visa duties in 
Washington where he did not have the managerial responsibilities he 
had in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter E. Bergin, acting assistant secretary for diplomatic  
security, said Parish was investigated in Beijing in April 1996 
when allegations of questionable management practices and special 
favorable treatment of some visa applicants were first raised 
against him. Files on the investigation were made available to the 
FBI and the department's inspector general in January 1998, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Company Raises Assault Tally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Carnival Cruise Lines, which earlier this month  
reported 62 sexual assaults aboard its ships during a five-year 
period, has raised the number to 108 -- an increase of more than 70 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest cruise ship company said Wednesday that 22  
of the assaults were reported as rapes, including 16 passengers who 
said they were attacked by crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnival said 28 incidents were described only as kisses. The  
rest involved touching or other ``advances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The revised report included actions taken about each allegation.  
Forty-nine crew members were fired, even if the company could not 
confirm the allegations, The Miami Herald reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial report was never intended to be considered complete,  
said Curtis Mase, an attorney for the cruise line. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had explicitly stated that we had prepared the information  
very hastily,'' he said Wednesday. ``We anticipated amending and 
supplementing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incidents happened over five years, ending last August. The  
62 incidents were revealed as part of a lawsuit by a former crew 
member alleging a shipboard rape. Gary Fox, a lawyer for the woman, 
accused Carnival of concealing information. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they say they omitted these 46 allegations because they  
didn't have enough time to thoroughly research it, that is 
completely bogus,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Royal Caribbean Cruises settled a lawsuit  
brought by the family of a 15-year-old Canadian boy who said he was 
sexually assaulted by a crew member last year. Terms were not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16 members of the International Council of Cruise Lines this  
week said ships out of U.S. ports will now report all crimes to the 
FBI. The cruise lines had previously left it to victims to report a 
crime once back in port.

<HEADLINE> Ban on Floating Casinos Opposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shipbuilding and cruise industry supporters  
tried Wednesday to torpedo an effort to ban floating casinos that 
take gamblers on ``cruises to nowhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They said the ban proposed by Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., would only  
hurt ships flying under the U.S. flag, giving foreign-flagged 
vessels a monopoly in the lucrative market of gambling in 
international waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Such cruises have stirred particular controversy in Florida,  
South Carolina, Massachusetts and New York, where some residents 
and politicians complain that gambling has arrived on their shores 
without the public having a say. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Congress approved changes to maritime law to allow the  
transport and possession of gambling devices on ships, so long as 
they are not used while the vessel is within state boundaries. A 
judge interpreted the changes to mean gambling cruises could dock 
and pick up passengers even in states that did not allow casino 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, an appeals court overturned the decision,  
restoring authority to states. Wolf said Congress should make clear 
that such cruises are presumed to be illegal under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	These cruises are ``one of the most simple and easiest ways to  
bring high stakes gambling to any coastal state, regardless of that 
state's laws,'' Wolf told a House Transportation and Infrastructure 
subcommittee. ``No other gambling operation can simply circumvent 
state law like 'cruises to nowhere.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Wolf's bill, such cruises would be illegal unless a state  
explicitly authorizes it. A national commission that studied 
gambling recently supported that approach. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., who sponsored the 1992 changes  
that opened the door for gambling cruises, noted that state 
legislatures already can vote to outlaw the cruises. 
</P>
<P>
	After Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth testified in  
support of Wolf's bill, Taylor pressed him on why Florida lawmakers 
cannot simply pass a ban: ``Are you asking Big Brother to save you 
from the Florida Legislature?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butterworth replied that the legislature shouldn't have to act  
because Florida citizens have rejected casino gambling three times 
over 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterworth is one of 15 attorneys general to endorse Wolf's  
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Horn, representing the National Coalition Against  
Gambling Expansion, said casino cruises are less regulated, and 
therefore more susceptible to fraud, than land casinos while 
creating fewer economic boosts to a region. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in support of the industry, Robert Williams, chairman  
of the Port of Palm Beach, said the cruises are an important source 
of jobs and money in his part of Florida. And Allen Walker, 
president of the Shipbuilders Council of America, said more than 50 
gambling ships worth almost $900 million have been built in U.S. 
shipyards since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry desperately needs the work generated by the  
cruises-to-nowhere trade to continue along the road to recovery and 
modernization,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chi. Control Center Fumes Spur Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration has started  
rotating crews at the nation's busiest air traffic control center 
to limit exposure to noxious fumes that have sickened many workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Downen, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers  
Association local, said about 50 employees missed work because of 
illness Wednesday at the control center in Aurora. The FAA put the 
figure at just over 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FAA made great strides in terms of doing the right  
thing,'' said Bryan Zilonis, vice president of the local, adding 
that the FAA started rotating controllers in and out of the control 
room every half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Hartman, an injured controller, filed a class-action  
lawsuit Wednesday alleging negligence by the company hired to do 
sealing work at the center. Calls to the company, Spectrum 
Contracting Corp., in suburban Chicago were not returned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers at the center 36 miles west of Chicago began  
experiencing nausea, headaches and blurred vision Monday night 
after inhaling fumes from maintenance work above the control room. 
The problem slowed air traffic Tuesday and caused delays of up to 
two hours for flights into O'Hare and Midway airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Air traffic at Chicago airports was not affected Wednesday, nor  
was passenger safety threatened, the FAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fumes came from a sealer with a chemical used in adhesives  
that can cause damage to the liver, kidneys and lungs from exposure 
in high concentrations, according to the Environmental Protection 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspectors  
were at the control center to examine whether safety regulations 
had been violated.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth Slows in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. economic growth slowed abruptly to 2.3  
percent during the second quarter as consumers curtailed exuberant 
spending that had been the major force behind the recent economic 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
	But a second report showing a sharp increase in labor costs  
raised concerns about inflation and the possibility of another 
interest rate increase. That fear set off a selling spree on Wall 
Street and by early afternoon the Dow Jones industrial average had 
lost 250 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that the gross domestic  
product, the nation's total output of goods and services, grew by 
$44 billion from April through June to an inflation-adjusted $7.8 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-quarter slowdown came after the economy surprised  
many analysts by growing at a bigger-than-expected 4.3 percent 
annual rate during the first three months of 1999. Economists have 
been predicting that slower growth would calm fears that the 
economy could overheat. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are still out there buying but at a more subdued pace,  
and if this is not just an aberration what it means is we're 
getting what was hoped for,'' said Robert G. Dederick, economic 
consultant with Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	New restraint by consumers, whose purchases account for  
two-thirds of the nation's economic activity and whose spending 
proclivity has helped the United States weather two years of global 
economic crisis, was largely responsible for putting on the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer spending grew by 4 percent from April through June,  
compared with a torrid 6.7 percent during the first three months of 
1999. It was the slowest spending increase since the fourth quarter 
of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	An inflation gauge tied to the GDP showed consumer prices rose  
more quickly during the spring, at an annual rate of 2.1 percent, 
compared to 1.2 percent in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Labor Department said its Employment  
Cost Index, considered the best measure of changes in wages and 
benefit costs, rose 1.1 percent in the second quarter. That's the 
biggest quarterly increase since 1991, but followed a record low 
0.4 percent rise during the first three months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest unemployment rate in 29 years has raised fears that  
employers scrambling for workers will have to raise wages, and 
therefore prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Americans filing initial claims for unemployment  
benefits fell last week to the lowest level in two years, the Labor 
Department also reported, indicating the labor market continues to 
tighten. Jobless claims fell 40,000 to 275,000, lowering a 
four-week moving average of claims to 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned that economic growth is too rapid and might spark  
inflation, the Federal Reserve in June raised interest rates by a 
quarter of a point. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan in his midyear 
report to Congress this week said the nation's central bankers have 
not ruled out another rate increase this year if inflation flares. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts said the numbers should not ring alarm bells,  
since wage and price increases are only moderate after an unusual 
lull. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a sense we're really having what Dr. Greenspan ordered and  
if that's the case I would suggest that he doesn't at least 
immediately need to do anything to help it along,'' Dederick said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the lingering international financial crisis, overseas  
markets for American products have dwindled and a flood of imports 
from troubled countries trying to unload their own goods here at 
discount prices has helped keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there has been some recent improvement in the trade  
picture as foreign economies have begun to recover. The record U.S. 
trade deficit shaved just 0.75 percent off total economic growth in 
the second quarter of 1999, compared to a 2.23 percent offset in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, investment by American businesses -- spending on new  
equipment and plants -- picked up from April through June, growing 
by 10.8 percent, compared to 8.5 percent in the first three months 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising mortgage rates, however, dampened the housing market,  
with spending on new homes and apartments growing by 5.1 percent, 
much slower than the 15.4 percent rate in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though consumers tempered their buying spree in the second  
quarter, they are still spending more than they earn. The personal 
savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable income, fell to 
a record low: negative 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Doug Flutie To Put Out a Music CD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo Bills quarterback Doug Flutie has  
been expressing his musical side while waiting for the start of 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last few days, the Heisman trophy winner has been  
recording a 10-song CD with his band The Flutie Gang. 
</P>
<P>
	Drumming is a lot like being a quarterback, he told the  
Rochester Democrat and Chronicle in Thursday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in each you have the ability to control tempo,'' he  
said. ``You have a big say in whether a play or a piece succeeds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the proceeds of the CD, which is being released by  
Frequency Records in the fall, will benefit the Doug Flutie Jr. 
Foundation for Autism. His popular ``Flutie Flakes'' cereal also 
benefited the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cut a CD four or five years ago, but we were disappointed  
with the production quality; it was kind of a rush job,'' said 
Flutie, who reports to the Buffalo Bills training camp in Fredonia, 
39 miles southwest of Buffalo, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie's brother Darren plays guitar in the band. Over the last  
ten years, the pair have played in their hometown, Natick, Mass. 
and in clubs in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great release for me,'' Flutie said. ``Football is my  
profession. This is my hobby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other members of the group, Tom Groleau, Bobby O'Donnell and  
Mike Smith are professional musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug may say this is a hobby, but he is a perfectionist at  
this, too,'' said Smith, who plays guitar and sings and writes 
songs. ``I've played with him for several years and he has improved 
tremendously. He more than holds his own as a musician.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The band recently entertained a crowd of 18,000 in downtown  
Buffalo. Last month near Boston, Flutie played a set with the 
Barenaked Ladies. 
</P>
<P>
	The band hasn't come up with a name for the CD yet. One of the  
producers, Gregory Smith, has suggested calling it ``Ramblin' 
Scramblin' Man'' in reference to Flutie's football moves and Bob 
Seger's ``Ramblin' Gamblin' Man,'' the only cover song on the CD.

<HEADLINE> Help Wanted Ads Volume at 2-Yr. Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	New York (AP) -- The volume of help-wanted advertising in major  
U.S newspapers fell in June to the lowest level in two years, the 
Conference Board reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The private business research group said its monthly help-wanted  
advertising index dropped to 84 in June from 89 in May. It was also 
89 in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time it was lower was in May 1997 when the advertising  
index reached 82. 
</P>
<P>
	The index is used as a private gauge of changes in local,  
regional and national job supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``Labor demand dipped this summer,'' said Kenneth Goldstein, the  
Conference Board's economist. But Goldstein said it is unlikely the 
labor market will weaken in the second half of the year, adding 
that ``this pause could prove to be temporary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's unemployment rate had fallen to a 29-year low of  
4.2 percent in May, although it edged up to 4.3 percent in July. 
</P>
<P>
	From April through June, help-wanted advertising fell in every  
region except New England, where it increased by 11.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The steepest declines took place in the West South Central  
region, which includes Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, New Orleans, 
Oklahoma City, and Tulsa, Okla., down 8.9 percent; the East South 
Central region, which includes Birmingham, Ala.; Knoxville, Memphis 
and Nashville in Tennessee; and Louisville, Ky., down 8.1 percent; 
and Mountain regions, including Denver, Phoenix and Salt Lake City, 
down 8.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted advertising index, which stood at 100 in  
the base year of 1987, is derived from measuring the volume of 
employment ads in 51 major newspapers across the country each 
month.

<HEADLINE> Malcolm Shabazz Escapes Briefly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VALHALLA, N.Y. (AP) -- Malcolm X's grandson Malcolm Shabazz, who  
set the fire that killed his grandmother, escaped briefly from a 
youth detention facility for the third time in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	A police officer stopped at a traffic light spotted Shabazz, 14,  
in a taxi and arrested him Wednesday, three hours after he was 
reported missing from the detention center. Shabazz was caught 
without incident and returned to the center. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, when he was 12, Shabazz was convicted of the juvenile  
equivalents of manslaughter and arson for setting a fire in the 
apartment of his grandmother, Betty Shabazz, the civil rights 
activist and Malcolm X's widow. Mrs. Shabazz died of burns three 
weeks after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	He was staying with his grandmother because his mother, Qubilah  
Shabazz, had battled alcohol abuse and legal problems. Prosecutors 
said he may have set the fire in hopes of being sent back to his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Malcolm Shabazz was transferred to the center in Valhalla this  
month after twice escaping a youth home in Yonkers. 
</P>
<P>
	Westchester County Attorney Alan Scheinkman said the boy would  
probably be charged with escape in the latest incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure that Malcolm is not in a position to do  
harm to anyone in the community or to himself,'' Scheinkman said.

<HEADLINE> Hall Tells Eagles He Might Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- Free agent defensive tackle Rhett Hall  
told the Philadelphia Eagles on Thursday he will sit out the entire 
season and might retire because his ailing left knee hasn't 
responded to rehab. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, 30, has not recovered from surgery to repair a fractured  
kneecap that forced him to miss the final 14 games last season. He 
had major surgery on the same knee to repair torn ligaments in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rhett's knee did not respond the way he wanted it to,'' Eagles  
coach Andy Reid said. ``He's going to take a year off and get that 
thing where he wants it. Obviously, if it doesn't respond then 
he'll discontinue playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall led the Eagles with eight sacks in 1997 and then signed a  
$2.4 million, one-year contract as the team's transition player. He 
tore ligaments in his left knee in the 15th game of the '97 season, 
then suffered a stress fracture in Week 2 against Atlanta last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to take a year to really think about this thing and  
continue to rehab it,'' Reid said. ``He needs to get that pain out 
of there and get back to where he can function, if he's lucky, on 
the football field but definitely for the rest of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall was drafted in the sixth round by Tampa Bay in 1991 and has  
been waived six times. The highlight of his injury-plagued career 
was a stint with the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	After signing with the Eagles in 1995, Hall missed 14 games with  
blood clots in his lungs.

<HEADLINE> Druckenmiller Focuses on Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- Jim Druckenmiller is in the San  
Francisco 49ers training camp anxious to make a fresh start and put 
his difficult offseason behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got something to prove every year, and that's the way I'm  
taking it,'' said Druckenmiller, a backup quarterback with the 
49ers since being drafted in the first round out of Virginia Tech 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm out here to let everybody know what my abilities are and  
how good I can be. I hope to prove that in this camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a time, there were questions whether Druckenmiller, 26,  
would even be around to compete with Jeff Garcia and Steve 
Stenstrom for the No. 2 job behind Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bill Walsh panned his skills last April,  
complaining his dropback style didn't mesh with an offensive scheme 
stressing mobility and timing. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that same month, Druckenmiller was charged with the rape  
of a Virginia Tech student in Blacksburg, Va., where he attended 
college. He was tried, and last week the jury that heard the case 
took one hour to acquit him. 
</P>
<P>
	Relieved, Druckenmiller was able to report to training camp on  
time. He said he's learned some painful lessons that will stay with 
him for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's humiliating and it's embarrassing -- not only for me but  
for my family,'' Druckenmiller said. ``It just amazes you how easy 
allegations are these days. But that's the way it is, and there is 
no changing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to keep yourself out of situations and surround  
yourself with good people,'' Druckenmiller added. ``You can't 
always control who comes up to you, who's around you, but you can 
definitely take yourself away. You can definitely walk away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller still faces some legal problems. Two men who  
accused him of participating in an assault outside a Blacksburg bar 
in 1996 claim the former Virginia Tech star and three others 
ignored a lawsuit in which they are seeking damages for their 
injuries. A hearing in the civil case is set for Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, meanwhile, has tempered his criticism of Druckenmiller,  
perhaps because he realized the 49ers would take a $450,000 salary 
cap hit if they traded him or released him and he was picked up by 
another team 
</P>
<P>
	While describing the competition for the No. 2 quarterback job  
as wide open, Walsh said Druckenmiller has looked sharp so far in 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my third year here. Now it's time,'' Druckenmiller  
said. ``I've learned all I can from the books. I'm coming out guns 
loaded, guns firing.''

<HEADLINE> Navy: New Sonar System No Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A new sonar system designed to detect the  
latest generation of near-silent enemy submarines should not 
endanger marine life and human divers exposed to the loud pulses, 
the Navy has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	But the environmental impact statement on the system, to be  
published Friday, already is drawing criticism from some 
conservationists and scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel the testing they've done has not been comprehensive,''  
said Gerry Leape of Greenpeace in Washington D.C. ``We hope they'll 
be receptive to criticism, because there will be a lot of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy study followed concerns over whether the system's  
``pings'' harm marine mammals or disrupt their feeding, mating, 
migration or communication patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional sonar detected enemy submarines by simply listening  
to the sounds they made. But as submarines grew quieter, making 
detection ranges shorter, the Navy began developing a system a 
decade ago that sends out loud pulses of sound from 18 
bathtub-sized speakers strung along an underwater array. 
</P>
<P>
	Technicians then listen for the sounds to return, said Joe  
Johnson, program manager. Sound waves bouncing off submarines sound 
different from waves ricocheting off rocks or animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Two phases of the study conducted off the California coast and  
one held off Hawaii's west coast found ``negligible'' effects from 
the pulses, some of which can initially measure 215 decibels, a 
little louder than the noise at a rocket launching pad, said 
Johnson, who works for the Pentagon's Space and Naval Warfare 
Systems Command. 
</P>
<P>
	``One can't prove a negative, so we actually tried to show there  
was an effect,'' Johnson said. ``The prevailing theory in 
scientific literature was that animals will not stay around 140 
decibels, so we went out to show that. But we weren't very 
successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the results are encouraging,'' said Sylvia Earle, a  
National Geographic Society explorer in residence based in Oakland. 
``But given the fundamental importance of sound to creatures in the 
sea, not just whales, fish as well, it's premature to draw sweeping 
conclusions from the limited research accomplished thus far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy plans to hold public meetings around the country on the  
impact report starting Aug. 4 in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Panthers' Daniel Suffers Neck Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Carolina Panthers rookie Robert Daniel  
will miss the season after an examination revealed a fractured disc 
in his neck, the team said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery to fuse the two vertebrae between the disc will be  
performed next week after swelling goes down, the Panthers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recovery is expected within three or four months for the  
sixth-round draft choice from Northwestern (La.) State. He should 
be able to play next season, according to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary prognosis for Daniel had been a bruised spinal  
cord, but a test Wednesday night at Carolinas Medical Center in 
Charlotte revealed the fracture between the third and fourth 
cervical veterbrae. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel was injured during a blocking sled drill at Wofford  
College in Spartanburg, S.C. Daniel's head buckled when his helmet 
collided with the sled. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookies and selected veterans began working out Tuesday at  
Wofford. The rest of the veterans arrived Thursday and new coach 
George Seifert planned a late afternoon meeting with players. The 
first practice for the full roster will be Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Mayor Back in Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- It happened again Thursday: When crisis came to  
town, Mayor Bill Campbell enlisted Atlanta's most visible spokesman 
to address the media and calm the populace -- Mayor Bill Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell assumed his by-now familiar role as Atlanta's Chief  
Public Face once again after a shooting rampage left nine dead in 
two of his city's office buildings. In news conferences carried 
live nationally, he sedately outlined what he knew, what he didn't 
-- and even, occasionally, how he felt. 
</P>
<P>
	``From Colorado to Atlanta, these things occur. We do not know  
why,'' Campbell said after gunman Mark O. Barton committed suicide 
Thursday night. ``We'll simply have to search our souls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Pray for our city,'' the second-term mayor implored.  
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, a Democrat first elected in 1993, has made a habit of  
holding live news conferences soon after other crises -- including 
the Centennial Olympic Park bombing and, more recently, a mass 
shooting that left all but one member of an Atlanta family dead 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a role that most cities delegate to a spokesperson or, in  
serious situations, a chief of police, though Police Chief Beverly 
Harvard was out of town Thursday. But Campbell's aides say he 
recognizes the need for leadership in such situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the mayor of the city, and when something like this  
happens, he needs to be here,'' said his spokesman, Nick Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell remained soft-spoken and solemn but stayed very  
involved, pacing the scene as he received updates on his cell 
phone. It was, for him, a task that is growing far too familiar. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past two weeks, we've had two deranged people kill 17  
people, perhaps more, in this city,'' he said. ``I have no 
explanation for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The third black to hold the mayor's office in the history of the  
city, Campbell addressed the media after the city's three bombings, 
including one of an abortion clinic in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second explosion is clearly designed to maim and hurt  
those who were coming to assist,'' Campbell said at the time, 
providing detail usually reserved for detectives. ``So we're 
dealing with a warped mind here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fugitive Eric Robert Rudolph has been charged with the three  
bombings -- the abortion clinic, a gay nightclub and the 1996 
Olympic bombing that killed one. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in October 1996, Campbell handled media duties during a  
hostage standoff that resulted in the release of three people and 
the death of a 5-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell has also been in the national spotlight for his ardent  
defense of the city's affirmative-action program and his suit 
against gunmakers, which was outlawed by the Georgia General 
Assembly.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks were down Thursday, falling to  
their lowest levels in nearly four months with the automobile 
industry leading the drop. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler's stock plummeted 6 euros, or 7.5 percent, to 74  
euros, after the company's second quarter results disappointed 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 10th-most heavily weighted stock in the Dow Jones Stoxx  
Index of 591 European companies, DaimlerChrysler's fall pulled down 
the entire index. It dropped 1.6 percent to close at 296.13 points, 
the lowest level since March 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides auto stocks, pharmaceutical and telecommunications  
shares were also poor performers of the day, with drops of 3.7 
percent and 3.1 percent in the respective indexes. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaxo Wellcome, the eighth-most heavily weighted stock in the  
Dow Jones Stoxx Index, fell 11.4 percent, or 199 pence, to 1553 
pence, and was the worst performing share among Britain's blue 
chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Glaxo's results were at the top end of expectations,  
investors focused on a warning that full-year growth targets won't 
be met. 
</P>
<P>
	British Telecommunications ended down 44 pence at 1086 pence,  
after first-quarter results were below analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	In Frankfurt, shares of Deutsche Telekom fell 1.40 euros to 37  
euros, after the company reported a decline of 4.5 percent in 
first-half net profit. Reports that the company might buy the 
British mobile telephone operator One2One didn't help the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 296 companies in  
countries joining the single currency, ended down 7.95 points at 
307.83. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index closed down 104.45 points at  
3580.19, while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index was down 102.82 points at 
3556.50. 
</P>
<P>
	European bourses extended losses in afternoon trading, after  
U.S. inflation data raised new concerns about global interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	London's FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares closed down 2.9  
percent to 6,117.50, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index lost 3.4 percent 
to 5,052.32 and the Paris CAC-40 index fell 2.8 percent to 4,306.4. 
</P>
<P>
	In Frankfurt, utilities fell on reports that the sector may face  
a higher-than-expected tax bill. The sector already makes heavy 
provisions for expenses, such as maintenance and decommissioning of

<HEADLINE> Mets Still Seek First Complete Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Leiter isn't asking to be a modern-day Old  
Hoss Radbourn. The New York Mets pitcher would just like to get one 
chance to complete what he started. 
</P>
<P>
	One hundred fifteen years after Radbourn completed all 73 games  
he started -- and finished two in relief as well -- Leiter and the 
Mets are still looking for their first complete game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get sick and tired that we don't have a complete game,''  
said Leiter, who had four last year but hasn't gone past the eighth 
inning this season. ``There are other teams that have one. But when 
you just have the goose egg up there, it's something to write 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, every other team has at least one. And Curt Schilling  
and Randy Johnson have eight each. The Mets, however, haven't 
thrown a complete game since Leiter did it last Sept. 4 against 
Atlanta -- a streak of 124 games. That is the second-longest stretch 
ever, 16 short of the record set by the Anaheim Angels in 1998-99. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest the Mets came was an 8 1-3 inning performance by  
40-year-old Orel Hershiser on June 29 against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes no difference nor any sense for me to worry about  
that,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said Sunday after pulling 
Leiter with a 5-1 lead after eight innings. ``He threw 130 pitches. 
I didn't want him to throw 150 just to get the complete game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of complete games hasn't hurt the Mets in the  
standings, where they trail Atlanta by a half-game in the NL East. 
But it is taking its toll out on the team's bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets relievers, who average more than 3.1 innings per game, are  
second in the majors with a 3.26 ERA. Turk Wendell leads the NL 
with 54 appearances, followed by teammates Armando Benitez (52) and 
Dennis Cook (49). 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Steve Phillips is concerned enough about  
possible burnout in the bullpen that he is aggressively looking to 
deal for another reliever before Saturday's trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets starters aren't the only ones struggling to complete  
what they began. In recent years, the complete game has gone the 
way of the scheduled doubleheader and the two-hour game. They just 
aren't many anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, 21 percent of starts resulted in complete games, and  
Phil Niekro led the majors with 23. The next year, with Billy 
Martin at the helm, the Oakland Athletics completed 94 games and 
had three pitchers with more than 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Through Wednesday, only 4.3 percent of starts have been  
completed and Baltimore and Philadelphia lead the majors with 11 
complete games. 
</P>
<P>
	There are many reasons for the change in the high-octane offense  
'90s. Perhaps most important is the use of specialized relievers. 
Most managers would prefer to use a fresh reliever in late innings 
than let a tiring starter face a batter for a third or fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The formula for success used to be five starters, a setup man  
and a closer,'' Rangers pitching coach Dick Bosman said. ``That 
formula has changed. Now you hope for five maybe six or seven 
innings out of the starter and match up the rest of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bullpen specialists aren't the only factor limiting complete  
games. With the proliferation of statistics and medical technology, 
managers are realizing the effects high pitch counts can have on a 
pitcher's performance and health. 
</P>
<P>
	And with more runs scored meaning more batters, and more patient  
hitters and smaller strike zones meaning more pitchers per at-bat, 
pitch counts are rising and managers are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	After Cubs phenom Kerry Wood blew out his elbow following a  
rookie season when he topped 121 pitches four times in five starts, 
other managers have taken heed. The Tigers refuse to let Jeff 
Weaver top 110 pitches, sometimes to the detriment of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't sacrifice the future for right now,'' Tigers manager  
Larry Parrish said. ``Some people are thinking I don't want to win. 
I feel like I want to win more than anybody. I'm the guy that it 
affects the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But how much do complete games really mean? The Mets, despite  
not having one, are one win off the major league lead. The Orioles, 
despite leading the majors in them, are mired in fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips probably put it best when he was asked recently if it  
mattered that Baltimore had 11 more complete games than his staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a better record than they do,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Immigrant Aid Deal Struck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis has struck a deal with civil  
rights organizations nullifying a controversial ballot measure that 
limited state aid to illegal immigrants, the Los Angeles Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal court had ruled that much of Proposition 187, approved  
by 60 percent of California voters in 1994, was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure sought to bar illegal immigrants from attending  
public schools or receiving social services and subsidized health 
care. It also required local authorities, school administrators and 
social and medical workers to turn in suspected illegal immigrants 
to federal and state authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Davis, a Democrat, opposed 187, he previously said  
he felt bound to uphold the will of voters who approved the 
measure. In April, he asked the court to submit the dispute to 
mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks then followed between Davis and the civil rights groups.  
The newspaper said Davis now has agreed not to appeal the ruling 
that invalidated much of the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
	All that would remain of 187 under the agreement are two  
relatively minor laws that establish state criminal penalties for 
the manufacture and use of false documents to conceal illegal 
immigration status.

<HEADLINE> Online Cos. Join Parental Web Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of the Internet's most popular sites are  
putting aside their rivalry for a project to help parents keep 
their children safe while surfing the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, Lycos Inc., The Walt Disney Co., Microsoft  
Corp., Yahoo! and others launched a Web site Thursday that includes 
details about more than 80 commercial software programs parents can 
use to block Web sites inappropriate for children. It also offers 
collections of recommended sites safe for children of different 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet industry has stepped forward as a strong and  
responsible corporate citizen,'' said Vice President Al Gore. ``It 
is safe to say that never before in the history of a new industry 
have so many companies that compete in the boardroom come together 
to ensure our children's safety in the living room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Companies in the campaign, which claim almost 95 percent of the  
Internet's traffic flows through their sites, will offer prominent 
connections to the site -- www.getnetwise.org -- or will present the 
information themselves. That's partly a concession to 
ultra-competitive high-tech companies, which struggle to keep 
consumers from spending time at Web sites not under their control. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably going to be as ubiquitous as anything on the  
Internet,'' said Rick White, a former Republican congressman from 
Washington and co-founder of the Congressional Internet Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Commerce Secretary William Daley joined company  
executives at a news conference to unveil the $1 million site. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is so much out there that's good on the Internet, it  
would be a pity for a parent to tell a child not to go on the 
Internet because they were afraid,'' said David Baker, a vice 
president at MindSpring Enterprises Inc., one of the nation's 
largest Internet providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some companies that design Internet filtering software  
helped pay for the site, details about all such technology tools 
are listed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not substituting for parents, but we're giving parents a  
leg up,'' said Jerry Berman, president of the Washington-based 
Internet Education Foundation and one of the project's principle 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Allen, chief executive officer for the National Center for  
Missing and Exploited Children, said organizers sought to design 
the Web site for parents anxious about what children might find 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an incredible resource, but it's scary,'' Allen said.  
``Your kids know more about it than you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Participation in the campaign was so broad that it brought  
together otherwise bitter rivals: Microsoft and AOL -- currently 
feuding over software that lets consumers send electronic ``instant 
messages'' -- as well as AT&AMP;T and the nation's Internet providers, 
which are battling over the future of high-speed Web access over 
cable-television lines. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, the world's largest Internet provider with more  
than 17 million customers, said it will offer the information 
within its ``parental controls'' section, one of the first areas a 
parent sees when signing onto AOL. It also will include a link on 
its popular AOL.com Web site.

<HEADLINE> Falling Stocks Pull Down Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A selloff in the stock market dragged the dollar  
lower against other currencies Thursday as a government report on 
rising wages set off investor jitters about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0730, up  
from $1.0659 late Wednesday. The dollar also was quoted at 115.40 
Japanese yen, down from 116.12 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell sharply after a report signaled that wages are  
rising faster than expected, heightening concerns about inflation 
and a possible increase in interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial 
average fell 1.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	With traders selling U.S. stocks and bonds, more money flowed  
into assets denominated in other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4889 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5001, and 1.5060 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5065. The British 
pound rose to $1.6189 from $1.5977. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8228 German 
marks, down from 1.8339; 6.1125 French francs, down from 6.1540.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybeans futures prices were mixed  
early today on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders weighed the 
effect of the current Midwestern heat wave against a more favorable 
weather forecast for next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans futures prices each fell slightly in early  
trading, but losses were limited by sweltering temperatures in key 
growing states. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders have been focusing on extended weather forecasts calling  
for cooler, wetter weather to return to the Midwest by Sunday and 
continue for several days. Crop conditions have been nearly ideal 
in some key states, including Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	But temperatures above 100 degrees in some parts of the Midwest,  
expected to scorch already thirsty crops, helped stem the slide of 
corn and soybeans futures prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans futures also were helped by better-than-expected weekly  
export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices fell in early trading, returning some of  
the gains made Wednesday on expectations of increased demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 2 1/2 cents to $2.70 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn fell 3/4 cent to $2.06 1/4 a bushel; December oats fell 1/4 
cent to $1.13 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans fell 2 1/4 cents to $4.26 1/2 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures retreated in early trading on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .47 cent to 64.70 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .52 cent to 76.95 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell .72 cent to 48 cents a pound; August pork bellies fell 
.40 cents to 48.85 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `Runaway Bride' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Last year Julia Roberts was desperately seeking to sabotage her  
best friend's wedding. This summer she's walking out on her own 
nuptials -- four of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Runaway Bride'' offers that far-fetched but amusing premise,  
and a sterling group of actors play it to the hilt. Long a purveyor 
of sitcoms, director Garry Marshall knows how to make even the most 
trivial of scenes pay off in terms of laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall is reunited with Roberts and Richard Gere, his stars of  
the 1990 hit ``Pretty Woman,'' in which she played a Hollywood 
Boulevard hooker, and he was her wealthy customer. This time she 
runs a hardware store in a Maryland hamlet, and he writes a 
newspaper column so misogynistic that old ladies belt him on the 
streets of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuck for a column idea, Gere retires to his favorite bar where  
he regularly finds inspiration. A barfly tells him the tale of a 
Maryland lass who has made multiple escapes at the altar, once on 
horseback. Gere writes the column, with much embellishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Too much, it turns out. The hotshot reporter checked none of his  
facts and invented his own. That prompts his editor (Rita Wilson), 
who also happens to be his ex-wife, to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
	Gere wheedles a magazine assignment for a followup, and he sets  
out for Hale, Md., vengeance in his eye. ``Kazaam! I'm in 
Mayberry!'' he mutters to himself on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	He immerses himself in the small-town culture, much to the  
irritation of Roberts. (Rule No. 1 of romantic comedies: Boy and 
girl must be at odds until the final reel.) 
</P>
<P>
	Waiting for the final clinch can grow wearisome, but Marshall  
and the screenwriters (Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott) supply 
enough diversions to keep things lively. They never adequately 
explain the heroine's aversion to saying the words ``I do.'' (Rule 
No. 2: Do not seek logic in a romantic comedy.) 
</P>
<P>
	``Runaway Bride'' gives Julia Roberts a chance to test her  
unsuspected talent for knockabout comedy, and she has never been so 
lively. Gere uses his eye-blinking charm in a not altogether 
sympathetic role. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those playing the townspeople of Hale (actually Berlin,  
Md.), Joan Cusack stands out as the bride's buddy, along with Paul 
Dooley as her father, and Christopher Meloni as one of the rejected 
husbands. Wilson and Hector Elizondo hold their own on the New York 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Runaway Bride'' is a joint production of Paramount Pictures  
and Disney's Touchstone Pictures, which may help explain why seven 
people are listed as producers and executive producers. The rating 
is PG but it might as well be G. Running time: 116 minutes, which 
could have been trimmed of the anticlimactic ending.

<HEADLINE> Football Fans in LA Still Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Is Los Angeles going to be a professional  
football town anytime soon? No one is committing, least of all the 
NFL. It seems to be third down and millions to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have worked very hard to make it happen for almost four  
years. We are not giving up,'' Mark Fabiani, adviser to an investor 
group led by Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz, said Thursday after the 
latest setback for Los Angeles football supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	During a meeting in Chicago Wednesday, NFL owners failed to  
commit to the proposal submitted by Los Angeles, saying there were 
too many questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``How much risk will need to be born by the perspective owner?  
That's what it comes down to,'' City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas 
said. ``Everybody wants to be confident that the return of the NFL 
won't be met by the same fate experienced by the Rams and the 
Raiders. Nobody wants another team to flop in this market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league also said there would be no set franchise fee, that  
they would take bids from the two Los Angeles groups vying for 
ownership. Those groups joined forces on a stadium proposal after 
the NFL said it wanted the team to play at the Coliseum, but 
ownership is still up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Chadwick, chosen by Gov. Gray Davis to negotiate with the  
NFL to bring a team back to Los Angeles, was confident going into 
the meeting that the owners would sign off on the stadium proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know whether what the NFL wants is possible,''  
Chadwick said Thursday. ``I'm not sure how to feel, but I'm not 
quitting. ... I learned quite a bit while I was in Chicago. Based 
on what I learned, I have to re-evaluate the possibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Los Angeles doesn't come up with a proposal that satisfies  
the owners by Sept. 15, the NFL will likely turn to Houston, which 
has a plan largely embraced by the owners. Houston initially came 
in second to Los Angeles only because of its size. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am concerned that we have a lot to do in a relatively short  
amount of time,'' Ridley-Thomas said. ``We can't afford to waste 
one day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue has said the September deadline  
won't be pushed back under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Los Angeles groups -- one led by Ovitz and billionaire  
Ron Burkle, the other by developer Eli Broad and hockey owner Ed 
Roski -- presented a unified stadium plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue now is how to pay for all of the improvements'' to  
the Coliseum and the area around Exposition Park, Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, Chadwick presented league owners with plans to raise  
$150 million from bonds for 15,000 additional parking spaces. He 
also called on the NFL to contribute up to $150 million for 
development of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also calls for the team owner to pay the state an  
annual rent of $5 million, subject to increases every five years. 
Many NFL teams play in rent-free stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Chadwick thought the NFL would sign off on his proposal before  
he left Chicago, but Tagliabue called it a work in progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need further negotiations. ... There are a number of  
economic issues that need to be improved in order for the team to 
be successful,'' Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chadwick said the NFL feels public participation in the project  
is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the NFL wants, I believe, is for political entities to  
use their general funds to participate in the renovation and 
historic preservation of the Coliseum,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad has said it will take about $900 million to ensure a team  
for Los Angeles, including the stadium and franchise fee. He also 
believes a team would generate a profit of $25 million to $28 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad wrote in a guest editorial for the Los Angeles Times  
recently that if he had known ``how skimpy the returns were going 
to be on this deal at the start, I would never have gotten 
involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said Wednesday, ``I'm emotionally invested now in making  
this work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broad did not return telephone messages left Thursday.

	At Least 9 Dead in Atlanta Shooting  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta's mayor said nine people are confirmed  
dead in today's shooting at an office building. Police hunted for 
the gunman and said he may have fled to a roof across the street. 
Mayor Bill Campbell said the gunman was a day trader who had done 
business with a brokerage in the building. The man, identified as 
Mark O. Barton, 44, of suburban Morrow, ``was concerned about 
financial losses,'' he said. Some witnesses told WSB-TV the 
shootings were at All-Tech Investment Group, a day-trading company 
on the third floor of the building.

	3 Held in Serb Farmers' Massacre  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO decided today to keep three  
suspects in the slaying of 14 Serb farmers in jail while it seeks 
more evidence. The three have not been charged, but investigators 
said there was sufficient evidence to detain them for up to a week, 
said Col. Robin Hodges, spokesman for the British forces in Kosovo. 
Serbs believe the killings were carried out by ethnic Albanians, 
seeking revenge for more than a year of Serb repression that 
culminated in the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of people 
during NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia.

	Clinton Fined $90,686 in Jones Suit  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge today ordered President  
Clinton to pay a $90,686 sanction for false testimony about his 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Most of the money, which 
Clinton's legal defense fund could pay, will go to Paula Jones and 
the attorneys who represented the former Arkansas state worker in 
her sexual harassment lawsuit. Clinton's testimony in that case led 
to his impeachment by the House and eventual acquittal in a Senate 
trial.

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The United States and South Korea  
warned today they will mobilize ``all available means'' against 
North Korea if the Stalinist state goes ahead with another 
ballistic missile launch. The warning was issued after U.S. 
Secretary of Defense William Cohen and his South Korean 
counterpart, Cho Sung-tae, reviewed the security situation in 
Northeast Asia. Cohen said North Korea will face economic and 
diplomatic penalties if it proceeds with a new rocket test.

	GOP Tax Cut Plan Faces Challenge

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate Republican plan to give Americans  
$792 billion in tax cuts is facing a bipartisan challenge that 
proposes to reduce the cut by several billion dollars. The proposal 
backed by Republican and Democratic moderates would cap the tax cut 
at $500 billion. President Clinton said again today that he will 
veto the ``large and risky tax cut.''

	Heat Death Toll Rises to 64

<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Folks across the eastern half of the nation  
sweated it out today as a heat wave that has killed people in at 
least 11 states dragged on with little relief forecast until the 
weekend. The hot weather has been blamed for at least 64 deaths 
since July 19 and has made millions miserable. Hardest hit have 
been Missouri, with 22 dead, and Illinois, with 19. Temperatures 
were again expected to reach the 90s from the Plains to the East 
Coast today, with the heat index breaking 100 in many places.

	Researchers Show New Stem Cell Use  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have shown that master cells from  
rodent embryos can be used to repair nerves in the spinal cord and 
brain, a step toward new treatment for nerve disorders such as 
Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. In laboratory studies, 
researchers guided the evolution of embryonic stem cells from mice 
into mature nerve cells that were transplanted into rats where they 
produced a nerve insulating material that the rats lacked. ``This 
approach could be used for a number of diseases,'' said Dr. Ronald 
D.G. McKay, a molecular biologist at the National Institutes of 
Health.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today as a government report  
signaled that wages are rising faster than expected in a tight 
labor market. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 180.78 points 
to 10,791.29. after falling as much as 258.04 earlier in the day. 
Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange led advancers

	NL Accepts 13 More Ump Resignations  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball accepted the resignations of 13 more  
National League umpires were today, meaning nearly one-third of 
major league umps will depart Sept. 2. Joe West, famous for 
slamming pitcher Dennis Cook to the ground in 1990, and Eric Gregg, 
criticized for a wide strike zone in the 1997 playoffs, were among 
those let go, one official said. After most umpires announced their 
resignations July 14, baseball hired 25 replacements from Triple-A, 
effective Sept. 1. Nine AL umpires were told Monday that their 
resignations had been accepted.

<HEADLINE>  Bomber Kills Sri Lanka Lawmaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A suicide bomber leaped onto a car as  
it traveled through a busy intersection today, detonating 
explosives strapped to his body and killing a moderate Sri Lankan 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
	Neelan Tiruchelvam, a member of the moderate Tamil United  
Liberation Front party, TULF, and head of a think tank studying 
ethnic strife between the dominant Sinhalese and the Tamil 
minority, was killed instantly. 
</P>
<P>
	His driver, five police guards and a bystander were wounded in  
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	No one claimed immediate responsibility, but officials blamed  
the Liberation Tigers for Tamil Eelam, which is fighting for an 
independent Tamil homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiruchelvam was a member of the team that drafted President  
Chandrika Kumaratunga's peace plan, and was actively lobbying for 
its support in parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was to be formally submitted to the Legislature next  
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy denounced the killing of the Harvard-educated  
Tiruchelvam, a popular analyst often consulted by diplomats, 
journalists and visiting dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We profoundly regret and strongly condemn the violent attack  
which claimed his life,'' said spokesman Peter Claussen. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction from the government, but the  
president's party, the People's Alliance, expressed regret over the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomber jumped off the back of a motor scooter and onto  
Tiruchelvam's car as it approached a busy intersection near his 
house, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The assailant also was killed in the explosion, said Col. A.  
Amunugama, an army colonel who was among the first persons to reach 
the scene. The vehicle was shattered. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three vehicles were damaged in the explosion, police  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tamil Tigers have been blamed for the assassination of three  
TULF politicians, including its founder, Appapillai Amritalingam, 
in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The TULF advocates solving the ethnic dispute through talks and  
devolution of power to the provinces. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers have been fighting security forces since 1983 to  
carve out a homeland for the minority Tamils in the north and the 
east. They allege that the majority Sinhalese discriminate against 
the Tamils. Some 58,000 people have been killed in the fighting so 
far.

<HEADLINE> Ranch King Tractors Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission  
recalled 1,600 riding lawn mowers Thursday because of faulty fuel 
lines that may cause fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Two WCI Outdoor Products' tractors -- the Ranch King and the  
Ranch King Pro -- may have fuel lines which are installed too close 
to engine parts that can sever the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the way the gasoline line is routed around the  
gears, it can leak and allow gasoline to spill out,'' said 
commission spokesman Ken Giles. The company is going to repair it 
and move the gasoline line, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	WCI Products of Cleveland has received a report of one minor  
fire and two reports of damaged fuel lines, but no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The mowers were sold exclusively at Quality Farm &AMP; Fleet stores  
in the Midwest and East for $1,400 to $1,700. Owners should call 
(888) 677-2995 to determine if their mower is part of the recall.

<HEADLINE> Steelers' Stewart: More Completions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LATROBE, Pa. (AP) -- The fallout from Kordell Stewart's first  
failed season in the NFL will be visible on TV screens nationwide 
this season. Or, to be more accurate, won't be visible. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, whose career as a pitchman seemed as promising a year  
ago as his fast-ascending career as a passer, spent far less time 
this offseason on commercials and far more time on completions. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what a 7-9 season and seven more interceptions (18) than  
touchdown passes will do to a quarterback's endorsement portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did a few commercial things, but I don't think you'll see me  
on TV as much,'' Stewart said Thursday after reporting to the 
Pittsburgh Steelers training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticized a year ago by backup Mike Tomczak for not devoting  
enough of his offseason to conditioning, Stewart spent most of this 
seven-month layoff learning new offensive coordinator Kevin 
Gilbride's system. 
</P>
<P>
	That system is partially to bring back Stewart's alter ego of  
Slash, the multi-dimensional scrambler-passer-playmaker whose 
production and confidence dropped precipitously in Ray Sherman's 
one and only season as offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, despite a dreadful year that saw him produce nearly  
two-thirds fewer touchdowns than he did in leading the Steelers to 
the AFC championship game in 1997, Stewart signed a $27 million 
contract extension that included an $8.1 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	That is about $623,000 for each of his 11 touchdown passes and  
two touchdown runs a year ago, but Stewart is convinced that 1998 
was an anomaly and not an indicator of where his career is going. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers are, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair to blame Kordell,'' director of football  
operations Tom Donahoe said. ``He had a lot of help from the 
players and the entire organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Stewart realizes that unless he produces this season --  
and produces like he did in 1997 -- the Steelers may be forced to 
look for a new quarterback for 2000, his huge signing bonus 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart gave one sign he has warmed to Gilbride more than he  
ever did to Sherman; he initially referred to the former San Diego 
Chargers coach as ``Coach Kevin,'' then caught himself and quickly 
switched to the more formal ``Coach Gilbride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working real well with each other,'' he said. ``It's a  
new system, but it's nothing I'm not used to. Every year it seems 
like something new was happening for me here. He's already staying 
on me, getting on me, making sure I'm the player I can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers badly need Stewart to once again be the playmaker  
he was in leading them to the AFC championship game in 1997, when 
he threw for 21 touchdowns and ran for 11 in his first season as an 
NFL starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	His scrambling ability was effectively neutralized in Sherman's  
offense, which tried to transform a player more accustomed to 
improvising into a read-the-defense, stay-in-the pocket 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be in a position again to make things happen,''  
Stewart said.

<HEADLINE> Drug Company Settles With 37 States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The maker of Synthroid has agreed to pay $41.8  
million to 37 states to settle charges that it wrongfully claimed 
the synthetic thyroid hormone drug was superior to competing 
brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoll Pharmaceuticals Co. agreed to the settlement, which  
includes ``assurances that any misleading or deceptive claims about 
its product will cease,'' the Maryland Attorney General's office 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoll, a subsidiary of BASF Corp. based in Mount Olive, N.J.,  
did not admit any wrongdoing. Spokeswoman Linda Mayer said the 
company wanted to ``avoid the burden and expense of litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys general from Maryland and the other states alleged  
that Knoll violated consumer protection laws by claiming that 
Synthroid was unique or superior to competing brands. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys general also said Knoll attempted to prevent the  
publication of a study that showed that Synthroid was no more 
effective than some generic thyroid drugs. The other drugs are two 
to three times less expensive than Synthroid. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mayer said the findings of that study have been disputed.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a class-action suit involving consumers is still  
pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The other states in the settlement were Arkansas, Arizona,  
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, 
Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, 
New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode 
Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, 
Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Report Says Missle Defense Flawed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressional report says manufacturing  
flaws still plague an antimissile defense system designed to down 
long-range weapons before they can hit U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, says  
problems remain even though the Pentagon has addressed the 
underlying troubles with the $3.8 billion experimental Theater 
High-Altitude Area Defense system, known as THAAD. 
</P>
<P>
	After six straight failures, an experimental THAAD missile  
scored its first hit on June 10 in New Mexico as it shot down a 
rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is designed to use ground-launched missiles to  
destroy incoming, high-altitude enemy missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative  
arm of Congress, says that even though the Pentagon restructured 
the program, ``reliability ... remains a concern because most 
components were produced when the contractors' quality assurance 
system was inadequate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report found that ``flight-test failures have been caused  
primarily by manufacturing defects rather than problems with 
advanced technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It blames previous problems on short flight-test schedule which,  
investigators said, did not allow adequate testing. The Pentagon 
has since lengthened the test schedule, removed deployment 
requirements and increased emphasis on quality, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Dallas Arena May Include WNBA Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Plans for the new American Airlines Center  
indicate the facility may not only be bigger and more costly than 
planned, but may have to accommodate another tenant. 
</P>
<P>
	A WNBA spokesman confirmed Wednesday that the Dallas Mavericks  
have approached the league about adding a counterpart team. It was 
also learned that the arena -- originally planned to house the 
Mavericks and the NHL's Stars -- will cost about $46 million more 
and be 10 percent larger than originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
	WNBA spokesman Mark Pray said the Mavericks have had frequent  
discussions with the league about bringing an expansion team to 
Dallas. With that in mind, they asked that the arena include locker 
room and practice facilities for a possible new franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Those plans expanded the size of the original arena and it is  
now expected to be more than 800,000 square feet and will cost 
about $276 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Pray said the addition of expansion teams are decided by an  
eight-member operating committee and one of those members is 
Mavericks president and CEO Terdema Ussery. 
</P>
<P>
	But the WNBA announced last month that it will add four teams to  
begin play in 2000 -- Miami, Seattle, Indianapolis and Portland, 
Ore. No decisions have been made on expansion beyond that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Pray did say that accommodating facilities at the American  
Airlines Center would be a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly the playing facility and the availability to deliver  
dates is a prerequisite of ours,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Groundbreaking on the arena is scheduled for this fall.  
Construction is expected to be completed by fall 2001.

<HEADLINE> Albanians Greet Albright in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright, greeted by ethnic Albanians as a liberator, pledged today 
that ``as long as you choose, Kosovo will remain your home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have been through a terrible ordeal this past year. ...  
Much as been lost and cannot be regained,'' Albright, the 
highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the Serbian province since 
the 78-day NATO air war, told a cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that today we may pledge that here in Kosovo never  
again will people with guns come in the night, never again will 
houses and villages be burned, and never again will there be 
massacres and mass graves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 Albanians, many chanting ``U.S.A.,'' turned out to  
greet Albright, whom they affectionately call ``Nona,'' or Mother. 
American, Albanian and British flags waved in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary of state came to Pristina for a firsthand look at  
postwar reconstruction. The crowd responded enthusiastically when 
she declared that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``should 
answer for his crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She is the best woman in the world,'' said Lirie Hana, 54,  
``She is the one who made it possible to breathe free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Ibrahim Hallaci, 44: ``I'm here to await and thank her for  
everything she did for us. As a simple citizen, I am very, very 
happy that I could come and chant her name in freedom for which she 
worked so hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Albright got a hostile reception when she visited a  
Serbian Orthodox monastery in Gracanica, just south of Pristina. 
About 150 people, mostly Serb men, chanted ``Serbia, Serbia'' and 
``Slobo, Slobo,'' referring to Milosevic. Some shouted obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
	When Albright's spokesman, James Rubin, alighted from his car he  
was greeted with a thumbs-down gesture and several shouted an 
obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright went first to the headquarters of the NATO peacekeeping  
force, known as KFOR, where she met with the NATO commander, 
British Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson, and the chief U.N. administrator in 
the province, Bernard Kouchner of France. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously there's a lot of work to be done, but there's also a  
tremendous amount of enthusiasm and willingness to work,'' Albright 
said after the briefings. ``I am very encouraged by the cooperation 
between KFOR and UNMIK,'' the U.N. Mission in Kosovo. ``They are 
working well together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the Serbs and what she would say to local Serb  
leaders in a meeting later, she said: ``I will tell them that the 
system is here to protect them. KFOR and UNMIK will cooperate for 
everybody's future. But don't forget that some disgusting things 
happened here. But we want them to stay if we want to build a 
multiethnic Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a tense moment earlier when a gunshot rang out as  
Hashim Thaci, head of the Kosovo Liberation Army and de facto 
leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, pulled up to the U.N. 
headquarters for a meeting with Albright. U.N. security agents 
rushed ran out of the building and Thaci's guards surrounded his 
car. Many bystanders dropped to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	British soldiers guarding the area said there was no indication  
where the shot came from or where it might have been aimed. 
Albright was inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving Rome for Pristina on Wednesday, Albright,  
referring to the pace of reconstruction, told reporters: ``Clearly 
one would wish that this were moving faster.'' But she decline to 
criticize the U.N. operation attempting to resettle hundreds of 
thousands who were displaced from Kosovo during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	As for destruction from Serb assaults on Kosovo Albanians and  
from NATO bombing, she said that, based on preliminary estimates, 
there ``has been less damage than initially feared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said $500 million the United States has pledged to help feed  
and house refugees returning to Kosovo was ``a good start,'' 
although she emphasized that Western allies will have to pick up 
the brunt of reconstruction costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, more than 60 nations and dozens of international aid  
agencies have pledged $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process of building up is proceeding more slowly than we  
had anticipated,'' Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said at a 
news conference with Albright on Wednesday after the two had a 
working lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright was to meet with U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo, plus  
officials of the Kosovo Liberation Army and political influence 
groups. She also was expected to fly over some areas where there is 
evidence of atrocities from the Serb offensive against the 
province, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the Kosovo visit, Albright will join President Clinton  
on Friday for a conference in Sarajevo with other world leaders on 
Balkans reconstruction. Milosevic will not be there. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said the  
conference would underscore the isolation of Milosevic and remind 
Serbs that ``he has brought them four wars and a ruined economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a good deal of disaffection (in Serbia) with Slobodan  
Milosevic, and I think that one of the most important elements of 
Friday will be the empty chair,'' Berger said Wednesday in 
Washington. ``Serbia will be the only country not there, (the) only 
country not part of an enterprise that means rebuilding and rebirth 
and growth and better lives for the people of the region.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Killer's Sister Gets Reward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The sister of alleged railroad killer Angel  
Maturino Resendiz has received $86,000 in reward money for helping 
to arrange his surrender, the FBI said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuela Maturino of Albuquerque, N.M., could receive up to  
$40,000 more if her brother is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reward was set up for whoever provided information that  
led to his getting arrested, and that's exactly what we feel like 
she did,'' said Bill Livingston, chief of police in Weimar, Texas, 
where Maturino Resendiz is suspected of killing a minister and his 
wife last May. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendiz, 39, ended a nationwide manhunt by  
surrendering on July 13, after his sister brokered an arrangement 
with a rookie sergeant in the Texas Rangers. Maturino Resendiz is 
jailed without bond in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The rail-riding Mexican drifter is suspected of killing six  
people in Texas, two in Illinois and a college student in 
Lexington, Ky. He is charged with five murders.

<HEADLINE> Albanians Greet Albright in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright, greeted by ethnic Albanians as a liberator, pledged today 
that ``as long as you choose, Kosovo will remain your home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have been through a terrible ordeal this past year. ...  
Much as been lost and cannot be regained,'' Albright, the 
highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the Serbian province since 
the 78-day NATO air war, told a cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that today we may pledge that here in Kosovo never  
again will people with guns come in the night, never again will 
houses and villages be burned, and never again will there be 
massacres and mass graves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 Albanians, many chanting ``U.S.A.,'' turned out to  
greet Albright, whom they affectionately call ``Nona,'' or Mother. 
American, Albanian and British flags waved in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary of state came to Pristina for a firsthand look at  
postwar reconstruction. The crowd responded enthusiastically when 
she declared that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``should 
answer for his crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She is the best woman in the world,'' said Lirie Hana, 54,  
``She is the one who made it possible to breathe free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Ibrahim Hallaci, 44: ``I'm here to await and thank her for  
everything she did for us. As a simple citizen, I am very, very 
happy that I could come and chant her name in freedom for which she 
worked so hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Albright got a hostile reception when she visited a  
Serbian Orthodox monastery in Gracanica, just south of Pristina. 
About 150 people, mostly Serb men, chanted ``Serbia, Serbia'' and 
``Slobo, Slobo,'' referring to Milosevic. Some shouted obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
	When Albright's spokesman, James Rubin, alighted from his car he  
was greeted with a thumbs-down gesture and several shouted an 
obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright went first to the headquarters of the NATO peacekeeping  
force, known as KFOR, where she met with the NATO commander, 
British Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson, and the chief U.N. administrator in 
the province, Bernard Kouchner of France. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously there's a lot of work to be done, but there's also a  
tremendous amount of enthusiasm and willingness to work,'' Albright 
said after the briefings. ``I am very encouraged by the cooperation 
between KFOR and UNMIK,'' the U.N. Mission in Kosovo. ``They are 
working well together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the Serbs and what she would say to local Serb  
leaders in a meeting later, she said: ``I will tell them that the 
system is here to protect them. KFOR and UNMIK will cooperate for 
everybody's future. But don't forget that some disgusting things 
happened here. But we want them to stay if we want to build a 
multiethnic Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a tense moment earlier when a gunshot rang out as  
Hashim Thaci, head of the Kosovo Liberation Army and de facto 
leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, pulled up to the U.N. 
headquarters for a meeting with Albright. U.N. security agents 
rushed ran out of the building and Thaci's guards surrounded his 
car. Many bystanders dropped to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	British soldiers guarding the area said there was no indication  
where the shot came from or where it might have been aimed. 
Albright was inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving Rome for Pristina on Wednesday, Albright,  
referring to the pace of reconstruction, told reporters: ``Clearly 
one would wish that this were moving faster.'' But she decline to 
criticize the U.N. operation attempting to resettle hundreds of 
thousands who were displaced from Kosovo during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	As for destruction from Serb assaults on Kosovo Albanians and  
from NATO bombing, she said that, based on preliminary estimates, 
there ``has been less damage than initially feared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said $500 million the United States has pledged to help feed  
and house refugees returning to Kosovo was ``a good start,'' 
although she emphasized that Western allies will have to pick up 
the brunt of reconstruction costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, more than 60 nations and dozens of international aid  
agencies have pledged $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process of building up is proceeding more slowly than we  
had anticipated,'' Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said at a 
news conference with Albright on Wednesday after the two had a 
working lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright was to meet with U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo, plus  
officials of the Kosovo Liberation Army and political influence 
groups. She also was expected to fly over some areas where there is

<HEADLINE> Energy Futures Extend Their Rally  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gasoline futures prices continued to surge Thursday on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange amid reports of low inventories and talk 
of problems at an Exxon refinery. 
</P>
<P>
	On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures prices  
rebounded, while silver futures climbed 3.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	August unleaded gasoline prices climbed sharply, spurred in part  
by a U.S. Department of Energy report showing unexpected declines 
in crude and gasoline stockpiles last week. Gasoline supplies are 
at their lowest levels since December. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a continuing decline in gasoline inventories,''  
said George Beranek, an analyst with Petroleum Finance Co. in 
Washington. ``We're getting down close to the levels in 1997.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rally also was fueled by talk of problems with the catalytic  
crackers at an Exxon Corp. refinery in Baytown, Texas, analysts 
said. Traders anticipated the problems could cut gasoline 
production. Exxon denied the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices have been on an upward trend this year, driven  
in part by an agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum 
Exporting Countries and non-OPEC oil producers to reduce world 
output. A report this month showed the countries were at between 93 
percent and 95 percent compliance with their accord. 
</P>
<P>
	September crude oil futures prices hit a 21-month spot contract  
high, driven in part by the strength of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for September delivery rose 43 cents to $20.97 a barrel;  
August heating oil rose 1.28 cents to 52.73 cents a gallon; August 
unleaded gasoline rose 1.90 cents to 64.98 cents a gallon; 
September natural gas fell 0.37 cent to $2.569 for each 1,000 cubic 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in  
September rose 46 cents to $19.80 a barrel at the International 
Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybeans futures prices ended their slide on the  
Chicago Board of Trade as scorching weather continued to bake the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices got a boost from the heat wave, which is  
expected to last into the weekend. The heat, reaching the high 90s 
in key states such as Illinois and Iowa, could parch crops and 
reduce yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices were helped by a report Thursday from the  
U.S. Department of Agriculture showing better-than-expected weekly 
export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But the gains were limited by extended weather forecasts calling  
for cooler, wetter weather to return to the Midwest by Sunday and 
continue for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 1/2 cent to $2.73 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn rose 4 1/4 cents to $2.11 1/4 a bushel; December oats rose 
2 3/4 cent to $1.16 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 4 3/4 cents to 
$4.33 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	September silver futures jumped 17 cents on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange amid an improved chart picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures prices rose to a 2 1/2-month high of $5.46 per troy  
ounce during trading before settling to close at $5.435 per troy 
ounce.

<HEADLINE> 300-Year Alcohol Ban Stands in Md. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMITH ISLAND, Md. (AP) -- A cafe owner's attempt to end a  
300-year ban on alcohol sales on this Chesapeake Bay island has 
ended in failure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Somerset County liquor board voted 2-1 Wednesday to deny a  
liquor license to Steven Eades, the owner of Driftwood General 
Store, according to Tony Bruce, an attorney for the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Eades, who moved to Smith Island two years ago, was opposed by  
longtime residents, many of whom are Methodists and believe 
drinking alcohol is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Locals also feared selling alcohol would lead to fighting. The  
nearest police officer is a 40-minute boat ride away. 
</P>
<P>
	``My reaction is `Praise the Lord,''' said Jennifer Dize, a  
Methodist who was born on the island 49 years ago. ``I'm very glad 
the vote went the way it did and I think most of the island is, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the island's 350 or so residents headed to  
the mainland last month to encourage the board to turn Eades down. 
</P>
<P>
	Eades maintained that times have changed since the island was  
settled in 1657 and that the sale of alcohol is a sign of progress.

<HEADLINE> Strong Gains Abroad Boost 3M Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- New products introduced in the Asia-Pacific  
region helped 3M boost its net income 23 percent in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. earned $476 million, or  
$1.17 a share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with 
$386 million, or 94 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings included a one-time pretax gain of $104 million  
related to divestiture of two businesses, 3M said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the gain, 3M earned $421 million, or $1.03 per share.  
Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had projected earnings of $1 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
	During the quarter, 3M announced the sale of 3M Cardiovascular  
Systems to Terumo Medical Corp. and agreed to sell Eastern Heights 
Bank to Northwest Bank Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency effects reduced earnings by 2 cents a share, the  
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter sales for the Maplewood-based maker of Scotch  
brand tape, scouring pads and other consumer, industrial and 
electronics products rose 2.5 percent to $3.86 billion, from $3.77 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales volume in the Asia Pacific region rose 11 percent, the  
second consecutive quarter of solid gains in that region. 
</P>
<P>
	``While Korea, Thailand and other Asian economies are  
recovering, proprietary new 3M products were the principal driver 
of our Asia-Pacific growth,'' said L.D. DeSimone, chairman and 
chief executive, in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	DeSimone said sluggish economies in Europe and Latin America  
hurt sales in those regions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, 3M's consumer, telecommunications,  
automotive and dental products sold well, but overall growth was 
held back by lower sales of pharmaceuticals and by slow sales of 
visual systems and some industrial products, 3M said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of 1999, net income was up 9 percent to $860  
million, or $2.12 a share, from $786 million, or $1.92 a share, a 
year earlier. Sales rose to $7.64 billion, from $7.47 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our results for the first six months were on plan, and we have  
good momentum entering the second half of the year,'' DeSimone 
said. ``We expect continued solid earnings growth, led by new 
products and ongoing productivity improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	3M also said it has reduced its work force by more than 5,000  
over the past year and is now thinking about potential 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly we have to grow in this company and we have to grow  
through quality acquisitions. Now we have to buy some business,'' 
Giulio Agostini, senior vice president-finance/administrative 
services, told analysts in a conference call. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 3M announced plans to reduce its low-profit business  
and cut 4,500 jobs. Agostini said the restructuring is nearly 
complete and is expected to save $250 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Employment reductions have also exceeded original projections,  
but they are also nearly complete. ``We may arrive at 5,200. We 
still are looking around, but not huge numbers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of 3M rose $1.68 3/4 to $90.81 1/4 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Three Records Fall at Euro Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Stev Theloke of Germany won the 50-meter  
backstroke and set one of three European records at the European 
Swimming Championships on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Zoe Baker and Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands were  
the other record breakers, both in semifinals -- Baker in the 
50-meter breaststroke and de Bruijn in the 100-meter butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
	Theloke was timed 25.66, breaking the record of 25.71 set by  
Frenchman Franck Schott in Lille, France, in 1994. Jeff Rouse of 
the United States holds the world record of 25.13 set in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker set a European record in the 50-meter butterfly by  
swimming her semifinal heat in 31.43, breaking her own previous 
record of 31.52 that she had set 21 days before in Sheffield. South 
Africa's Penny Heyns holds the word record of 30.95 from last Aug. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the block I was so nervous I was shaking,'' Baker said,  
adding that in Friday's final, ``I hope I can go faster and I feel 
the world record is now in my grasp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her race, De Bruijn led from the start and powered her way  
through the turn, never looking back as she took the semi in 58.92. 
De Bruijn shaved one-hundreth of a second off Swede Johanna 
Sjoberg's 58.93 record set on July 2 at the Swedish national 
championships in Halmstad. The world record of 57.93 is held by 
American Mary T. Meagher, set in August 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	France captured its first two men's gold medals when Franck  
Esposito won the men's 200-meter butterfly and Stephan Perrot took 
the 200-meter breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Pieter Van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands easily qualified  
for the finals of the men's 200 meter freestyle with an 
exceptionally fast 1 minute 47.79 seconds, the third best this 
year. He was within a second of the world record 1:46.69 set by 
Australia's Grant Hackett in Brisbane last year, and seemed ready 
to go for the mark in Friday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoogenband was competing just one day after winning the  
100-meter freestyle and breaking Russian Alexander Popov's 
decade-long European winning streak in the event. He has already 
racked up golds in the 400 relay and 50 butterfly, and is also 
aiming for the 50 freestyle and 400 medley relay.

<HEADLINE> Dallas Arena May Include WNBA Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Plans for the new American Airlines Center  
indicate the facility may not only be bigger and more costly than 
planned, but may have to accommodate another tenant. 
</P>
<P>
	A WNBA spokesman confirmed Wednesday that the Dallas Mavericks  
have approached the league about adding a counterpart team. It was 
also learned that the arena -- originally planned to house the 
Mavericks and the NHL's Stars -- will cost about $46 million more 
and be 10 percent larger than originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
	WNBA spokesman Mark Pray said the Mavericks have had frequent  
discussions with the league about bringing an expansion team to 
Dallas. With that in mind, they asked that the arena include locker 
room and practice facilities for a possible new franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Those plans expanded the size of the original arena and it is  
now expected to be more than 800,000 square feet and will cost 
about $276 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Pray said the addition of expansion teams are decided by an  
eight-member operating committee and one of those members is 
Mavericks president and CEO Terdema Ussery. 
</P>
<P>
	But the WNBA announced last month that it will add four teams to  
begin play in 2000 -- Miami, Seattle, Indianapolis and Portland, 
Ore. No decisions have been made on expansion beyond that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Pray did say that accommodating facilities at the American  
Airlines Center would be a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly the playing facility and the availability to deliver  
dates is a prerequisite of ours,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Groundbreaking on the arena is scheduled for this fall.  
Construction is expected to be completed by fall 2001.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers signed right wings  
Mikael Renberg and Sandy McCarthy to one-year contracts, Flyers 
president and general manager Bob Clarke said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Renberg, 27, had 11 goals and 15 assists for 26 points and 14

</P>
<P>
	McCarthy, 27, had one assist and 25 penalty minutes in 13  
regular-season games last year with the Flyers. He was also

<HEADLINE> Yosemite Killer on Suicide Watch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- The hotel handyman who confessed to  
beheading a Yosemite National Park naturalist and killing three 
sightseers was put on suicide watch Thursday after he was 
transferred to the Fresno County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner, 37, was moved from Sacramento, where he was  
arrested in the death of naturalist Joie Ruth Armstrong. She was 
killed July 21 and found a day later near her home in the park. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner arrived by van under heavy security. He was escorted  
into the jail in handcuffs and leg shackles and then met briefly 
with a public defender. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner will be segregated from the rest of the jail population  
because the nature of the slayings could make other inmates want to 
harm him, Sheriff Richard Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner is scheduled to be arraigned Aug. 6 in federal court in  
Fresno on a murder charge in Ms. Armstrong's death. 
</P>
<P>
	He is considered a suspect in the February killings of Carole  
Sund, her daughter Juli and family friend Silvina Pelosso. They 
were last seen alive at a lodge outside Yosemite where Stayner 
lived and worked.

civil rights groups agreed to end a legal battle over Proposition 
187, the measure that sought to limit services to illegal 
immigrants but was largely ruled unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor contended that much of measure's intent was covered  
by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreement that has been reached over the months  
essentially embraces the spirit of Proposition 187,'' Davis told a 
news conference at the conclusion of an unusual mediation process 
to resolve litigation over the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis agreed not to appeal the federal court ruling that held  
much of Proposition 187, approved by voters in 1994, was 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was expected to be approved today by the 9th U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is 187 struck down by this agreement? Yes. But it is  
supplanted by federal law ... that implements the same provisions 
as 187,'' the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have dissolved a divisive wedge issue in a way that is fair  
to the voters, the Constitution and the law,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said the parties also agreed that the state ``has  
the obligation to enforce federal law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Rosenbaum, legal director of the American Civil Liberties  
Union of Southern California, said the action ends years of racial 
divisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 187 was endorsed by 60 percent of California voters,  
but most of its provisions have gone unenforced due to court 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis opposed the measure but had to decide whether to defend it  
in court after becoming governor. He said previously he had no 
intention of enforcing that part of the proposition denying 
education to undocumented schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement follows three months of meetings between Davis and  
anti-Proposition 187 forces after his decision in April to submit 
the contentious issue for court-sponsored mediation, which prompted 
a barrage of criticism.

<HEADLINE> DEA Said Not Setting Enough Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Drug Enforcement Administration has failed  
to create measurable performance goals for its programs, making 
their effectiveness hard to determine, a government audit says. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of  
Congress, recommends in its report that the DEA work closer with 
the Justice Department to help set up goals -- with specific dates 
or targets -- to accompany the agency's numerous objectives. 
</P>
<P>
	Auditors also suggested that the DEA work with the White House's  
Office of National Drug Control Policy, since both try to reduce 
drug abuse, drug-related crime and drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO noted in its report, which was released last week, that  
the DEA uses data on arrests and drug seizures it has made to help 
demonstrate the agency's effectiveness in carrying out enforcement 
programs. However, auditors said they failed to find such figures 
useful. 
</P>
<P>
	``The use of arrest data as a performance indicator can be  
misleading without information on the significance of the arrests 
and the extent to which they lead to prosecutions and 
convictions,'' according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The disbandment of a drug cartel or the arrest of its leader  
doesn't necessarily mean an end to the drug flow, said Norman 
Rabkin, director of the GAO's Administration of Justice Issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``People take their places and new organizations and leaders  
come into to fill the void,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Using arrest data as a performance target also ``can lead to  
undesirable consequences when law enforcement agencies place undue 
emphasis on increasing the numbers of arrests at the expense of 
developing quality investigations,'' according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	DEA responded to auditors by saying it has set up preliminary  
targets, which it plans to submit with its next budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's fine -- it's a step in the right direction but they  
should have had it a few years ago,'' Rabkin said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Marzouk Al Otaibi scored four goals as Saudi  
Arabia routed Egypt 5-1 en route to securing a semifinal berth in 
the Confederations Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia earned the berth with Mexico's 1-0 decision over  
Bolivia in Thursday night's late game. It will likely play Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico won Group A with seven points and Saudi Arabia finished  
second with four.

	Group B play concludes Friday night in Guadalajara, with Brazil  
facing New Zealand and the United States playing Germany. Brazil 
has locked up a semifinal berth, but the top spot in the group is 
still up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia took advantage of Egypt's weak defense, with Al  
Otaibi scoring in the seventh and 33rd minutes in the first half. 
The Egyptian team responded with rough play, which led to three 
expulsions, further weakening the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia's Ibrahim Al Shahrani scored in the 63rd minute to  
put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt's only goal came on Ibrahim Samir's penalty shot in the  
69th minute. With only eight Egyptian players left on the field, Al

<HEADLINE> NBC Overhauling Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- In a bid to remain the top-rated  
network, NBC is adding four characters to crown jewel ``ER'' this 
fall and overhauling other shows, including ``Suddenly Susan'' and 
``Veronica's Closet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network also is joining the ethnic diversity bandwagon: NBC  
executives Thursday announced development deals for black sitcoms 
with Keenen Ivory Wayans and producer Yvette Lee Bowser. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the NAACP condemned the absence of minority  
characters on TV and said it was considering a boycott or other 
action. On Tuesday, a Hispanic coalition also demanded more 
minority representation. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC West Coast President Scott Sassa acknowledged Thursday that  
the criticism led to the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be totally disingenuous to stand up here and say we  
did this totally on our own,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, ABC executives said at least five of their shows  
would add minorities but said the changes had been in the works 
since May. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the cast additions on NBC involve ethnic actors:  
Sherri Shepherd on ``Suddenly Susan''; Jesse L. Martin on ``Law &AMP; 
Order'' and Michelle Hurd on its spinoff, ``Law &AMP; Order: Special 
Victims Unit''; Darryl Theirse on ``Jesse'' and Michael Michele and 
Ming-Na on ``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Michele (``Homicide: Life on the Street'') will play a  
second-year resident, while Ming-Na is reprising her role from the 
medical drama's first season as Dr. Deb Chen. Joining them will be 
Maura Tierney (``NewsRadio'') and Goran Visnjic. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Alda and Rebecca DeMornay will guest star in several ``ER''  
episodes, and recurring character Dr. Romano (Paul McCrane) is 
becoming a regular. The series returns Thursday, Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly Susan'' is gaining a quartet of characters: Besides  
Ms. Shepherd, Eric Idle (``Monty Python''), Rob Estes (``Melrose 
Place'') and Currie Graham will be added as the show makes a plot 
change: The characters are working for a revamped Gate magazine, 
now a sports publication. 
</P>
<P>
	``Veronica's Closet'' is losing Ron Silver and bringing aboard a  
new adversary for Veronica (Kirstie Alley): the Silver character's 
young widow. The series, which has failed to capitalize on its 
Thursday slot behind top-rated ``ER,'' is moving to Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``West Wing,'' a new series set in the White House and  
criticized for being unrealistically all white in its characters, 
will add a black actor in a recurring role, said NBC Entertainment 
President Garth Ancier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa said the network is aware ``we should have done a better  
job'' in creating racially diverse shows. Diversity is good 
business for the network, he said, because NBC-owned stations in 
big cities draw more ethnic viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC hopes to rush the new shows from Ms. Bowser (``Living  
Single'') and Wayans on the air this season. Wayans' show was 
described as ``Not the Bradys,'' a comedy featuring a merged family 
with an interracial marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa also said the network is trying to develop more  
family-oriented sitcoms and ensure that bawdiness in other shows is 
not excessive. Sex has got to be ``germane to the story line, not 
just gratuitous,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's new schedule will debut the week of Sept. 20. The network  
finished last season as No. 1, but has seen its post-''Seinfeld'' 
ratings slip and CBS make significant gains.

<HEADLINE> Inkster Looks To Cap Great Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRIDDIS, Alberta (AP) -- Juli Inkster wasted no time putting  
herself into position to win her third consecutive major 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	After a wedge into tap-in range for birdie on the first hole and  
a 15-foot eagle putt on the third, Inkster cruised through the 
first round of the du Maurier Classic on Thursday with a 4-under 68 
that left her one stroke out of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Patti Rizzo, winless the past 10 years, made seven birdies in  
her round of 67 and was tied for the lead with Rosie Jones, who 
birdied three of the last four holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Jones, one of the scrappiest competitors on the LPGA Tour,  
couldn't help but talk about Inkster's run at history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too bad she didn't play good in the Dinah (Shore). She could  
have just wrapped up the majors this year,'' Jones said with a 
laugh. ``This is a perfect golf course for her. She doesn't 
necessarily have to hit it perfect, but she can play a golf course 
like this so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't a perfect round, even though Inkster played without a  
bogey on the hilly, difficult Priddis Greens course. She didn't 
always have the right club in her hand, and she didn't make every 
15- to 20-foot birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
	But for a 39-year-old who lacks only one victory to become the  
17th player to qualify for the Hall of Fame, she had few 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is all over me about two majors and the Hall of  
Fame,'' said Inkster, her two daughters and one of their friends 
sitting at her feet. ``I'm just trying to go out there and keep 
doing what I'm doing. That's what I've been doing all year, just 
getting myself in position. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day, I go out there and try to shoot a solid round,''  
she said. ``That's what I did today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 26th consecutive round of par or better for Inkster.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones, the first-round leader in the LPGA Championship that  
Inkster eventually won to complete the modern career Grand Slam, 
also played bogey-free and hit enough shots close to the pin to 
make her 67 look relatively easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought if I shot 2- or 3-under, I would be in pretty good  
shape,'' Jones said. ``So right now, I'm feeling pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scotland's Catriona Matthew made two birdies and an eagle in her  
round of 68 and Gail Graham was another stroke behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham wasn't the Canadian a boisterous gallery threw its  
support behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorie Kane, third on the money list but still seeking her first  
LPGA victory, asked her family to stay home in Prince Edward Island 
so she could reduce the pressure of trying to win a major in her 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Some good that did.  
</P>
<P>
	Kane was greeted like a national hero on the first tee, and it  
took her about five holes to settle down. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure is something I've never felt before,'' she said.  
``So much for my plan of keeping it a normal week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with Inkster turned out to be a blessing. Setting aside  
whatever pressure Inkster feels, she told Kane, ``You can handle 
this, just like I handled it at the U.S. Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kane made four birdies on the back nine and was at 2-under 70.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of pressure for her to play well here,'' Inkster  
said. ``But you've just got to play your own game and root for 
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadians can appreciate how Inkster played and what she is  
trying to accomplish. Not since Pat Bradley in 1986 has a player 
won three majors in one season. Mickey Wright and Babe Zaharias 
also won three majors, while Ben Hogan is the only PGA Tour player 
to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't on Inkster's mind Thursday on a day of fickle  
weather in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies -- sunshine and 
heat, followed by cloud cover and cooler temperatures, and wind 
that at times whipped up as strong as 20 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster took only 13 putts on the front nine and kept it simple  
the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm playing with a lot of confidence and playing aggressive,''  
Inkster said. ``I don't know what the other players think, but I 
think I have just as good a shot as anybody if I'm right in that 
hunt with three or four holes to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After her start Thursday, that's a distinct possibility.  
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Aces seems to be air at Priddis Greens. Sara Sanders  
made her first hole-in-one on the LPGA Tour in the first round, a 
9-iron from 122 yards on No. 15. Sanders received a $1,000 check 
for the ace. In the pro-am Wednesday, Dale Eggeling and Catrin 
Nilsmark got aces, as did two amateurs. ... Just like at Augusta 
National, caddies in the du Maurier are required to wear coveralls 
(red, not white). The exception is Jeff ``Tree'' Cable, the 
6-foot-7 caddie for Se Ri Pak. Tournament officials couldn't find 
one that fit him, so he was allowed to wear a bib. ... Gail Graham 
puts ice on her left thumb after every round because of tendinitis, 
which causes pain and numbness. ... Kelli Kuehne didn't hit a green 
in regulation until her sixth hole and wound up with a 79, her 
highest first-round score this year.

<HEADLINE>  Alexandra Stevenson Talks Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The first woman to reach the  
semifinals of Wimbledon as a qualifier has been described as a 
cross between Andre Agassi and a Valley Girl. It's easy to see why. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennis star Alexandra Stevenson loves to talk -- about boys,  
black cocktail dresses, Julia Roberts, dancing and her high school 
prom. Things aren't good, they are ``awesome.'' She is only 18, 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some subjects, though, that aren't discussed, most  
notably the attention that surrounded the revelation she was the 
out-of-wedlock daughter of Hall of Fame basketball player Julius 
Erving. 
</P>
<P>
	The news broke in the midst of her Wimbledon success and trailed  
her to the Pan American Games, her first tournament since then. 
``It's all old news,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The games are sort of a debutante ball for the teen-ager who is  
now ranked No. 37 in the world, a way to glide back into tennis 
before the overwhelming scrutiny she will face from the U.S. media 
when she appears at the U.S. Open in New York later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Safely in Canada, Stevenson can be herself and not just the  
daughter of someone famous. It's a different sort of tournament 
than the pros normally take on. The prize is a gold medal, no cash 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	For Stevenson, it also provides a chance to move on. Her first  
news conference here in Winnipeg showed off the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The questions, given the subject, were polite. She easily  
deflected hapless efforts to dig out a response to the ``Dr. J.'' 
question with an almost cheerful ``No comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A teen-ager clearly unafraid of attention instead pointed out to  
reporters that it wasn't fair her teammates were being ignored. She 
gushed about how much fun she was having on the Canadian prairie in 
a big international event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very excited to be here, to represent my country is a  
great honor,'' she said. ``I can't wait to start playing and hope 
to see you there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson's presence should direct attention to the U.S. team,  
which otherwise lacks stars. That's good for everyone, says U.S. 
coach Lynne Rolley -- even if Stevenson gets most of the attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the Olympics for us,'' Rolley said. ``We're here to  
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. coach, who has known Stevenson for years, sees her  
coming into her own, taking her game to a new level. Wimbledon was 
only the first step. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone in sports is building for that moment when they make  
a breakthrough, and everyone recognizes that,'' Rolley said. ``It 
feels good. That's why we're in sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the day before her 6-2, 6-0 victory against Miriam  
D'Agostini, the No. 2 ranked player in Brazil, Stevenson and 
teammate Lilia Osterloh of Canal Winchester, Ohio, got busy getting 
into the spirit of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	After practice, the two athletes sped off to a beauty salon to  
have their nails done in red, white and blue. Stevenson's toes 
still had Wimbledon's chipped shades of green and purple and it was 
definitely coming off. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very serious,'' she told Osterloh while laughing.  
</P>
<P>
	As a somewhat stunned manicurist took on a pair of famous feet,  
Stevenson talked about plans to equal the accomplishments of heroes 
like Margaret Court while becoming a crowd-pleaser like Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tennis is entertainment. You buy a ticket, right? Andre  
realizes that,'' she said, pointing out he and other showmen Jimmy 
Connors and John McEnroe have an affinity to play to a crowd. 
``That's what I want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While she became a sensation at Wimbledon, she was disappointed,  
because her goal was to win. She paid no attention to the fury set 
off when a newspaper retrieved her birth certificate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in my own bubble,'' she said. ``I ignored everyone.''  
</P>
<P>
	Though she also eventually wants to act, dance and sing,  
Stevenson is working right now on being No. 1 in tennis. In the Pan 
Ams, she's focusing on winning a gold medal, having a ``blast,'' 
and dismissing the dad issue. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, he's her dad. So what?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still the same,'' she said. ``Nothing has changed.''

<HEADLINE> GM Objecting to `Lawsuit Coupons' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Critics of General Motors thought the  
automaker got off easy when it agreed to settle a big lawsuit 
alleging some of its trucks had gas tanks that could explode. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, GM is facing a much bigger payout than expected and the  
automaker has gone to court complaining the settlement's terms are 
being violated. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the dispute is resolved, there will be a longer wait for  
nearly 6 million truck owners to get their share of the settlement 
in a class-action suit that has been bouncing through the courts 
since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are discount coupons, worth $1,000 each toward the  
purchase of a new GM car or truck, that the automaker agreed to 
provide truck owners to settle the dispute over side-mounted fuel 
tanks. The suit contended the tanks are prone to blow up in 
collisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar settlements of two other suits were rejected by federal  
courts in Texas and Philadelphia before a state judge in Louisiana 
approved this settlement in January. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, critics complained that GM would pay little since  
few of the coupons probably would be redeemed. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, a market has developed for the coupons, and GM could be  
facing a flood of redemptions through deals that could enrich 
enterprising middlemen. 
</P>
<P>
	Middlemen plan to buy the coupons from truck owners and sell  
them at a profit to banks, leasing companies and GM dealers, who 
could, in turn, offer the discounts to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, a Houston company, the Certificate Redemption  
Group, has offered to buy the coupons from truck owners for $100 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has been outmaneuvered, said Stephen Gardner, a Dallas lawyer  
and co-chairman of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	``GM is now saying, `Gee, we never thought people would use  
them,' and they're trying to change the rules of the game. They're 
terrified that it might actually cost them money,'' Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some truck owners say they might be interested in selling to a  
middleman. 
</P>
<P>
	Loy R. Gaar, 74, of Dodson, La., who owns a 1984 Chevrolet C-10  
pickup truck, said he doubts he would ever buy another truck at his 
age. Even if he did, ``a thousand dollars isn't much when you're 
talking about a $25,000 truck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect I'd be willing to negotiate,'' Gaar said of the  
coupon. ``A hundred dollars is a hundred dollars more than I have 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM did not admit liability in the settlement, which involves C-  
and K-series trucks built from 1973 to 1987 and R- and V-series 
trucks built from 1987 to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Coupons have been used to settle consumer complaints in many  
class-action suits. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, nine major airlines used a discount coupon to help  
settle a price-fixing suit. Many consumers and travel agents later 
complained the coupons were difficult to use. Even after the 
discount, they said, the fares were higher than those available 
through regular purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	In the GM case, there could be a large market for the re-sold  
coupons, even though the settlement specifies that if the coupons 
are sold to third parties, their value decreases to $500. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's court filing says large re-sales of the coupons by  
middlemen are not allowed by the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an approved court agreement that all sides had agreed  
to,'' said GM spokesman Terry Rhadigan. ``When it became time to 
execute it, they tried to change the deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Crow, an attorney for the plaintiffs, did not return a  
call for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge Jack Marionneaux, who approved the  
settlement, has rejected GM's complaint. But an appeals court 
agreed July 15 to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
	With no date set yet for a hearing, this month's scheduled  
mailing of the coupons to the truck owners has been delayed 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Some owners, unimpressed with the prospect of a $1,000 discount  
on a purchase of a car or truck at a time when rebates are 
plentiful, have given up waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``A dealer would give you $1,000 for just walking in,'' said  
Wayne Guchereau, 40, of Harahan, La. 
</P>
<P>
	Guchereau recently sold his 1981 Series C truck for $1,000.  
Guchereau said he bought a used Nissan truck that has crossed the 
100,000-mile mark. ``It runs like a champ,'' he said, but conceded, 
``I hate to buy foreign.''

<HEADLINE>  Heat Death Toll Climbs to 71 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The sun beat down on Tom Matthews as he  
wiped his brow and unloaded a beat-up pickup truck at the steamy 
Southside Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't had heat like this for 10 years, maybe 15,''  
Matthews said with a sigh amid the stench of rotting garbage and 
the wavering diesel fumes from a bulldozer nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a thing you can do about it,'' said Matthews,  
sweat soaking through his cloth gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	Folks across the eastern half of the nation sweated it out  
Thursday as a heat wave that has killed people in at least 12 
states dragged on, with little relief forecast until the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The hot weather has been blamed for at least 71 deaths since  
July 19 and has made millions miserable. Hardest hit have been 
Missouri, with 27 dead, and Illinois, with 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The extreme heat has come as a drought withers crops and lawns  
across the East. On Thursday, Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening 
declared the first-ever statewide drought emergency and urged all 
Marylanders to conserve water. Conservation measures could become 
mandatory by mid-week if the area does not receive substantial 
rain, the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If water consumption continues at the current rate, there is  
only a 35-day supply in these reservoirs,'' Glendening said. 
</P>
<P>
	By 10:30 a.m., it was 94 in Kansas City, Mo. -- making Thursday  
the 15th straight day the state had seen temperatures in the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures also reached the 90s from the Plains to the East  
Coast, with the heat index -- a measure of temperature and humidity 
-- breaking 100 in many places. 
</P>
<P>
	In Annapolis, Md., where temperatures have hovered in the 90s,  
Carolyn Heinlein has been shepherding tourists around the city's 
historic district, dressed in 18th century garb -- a plaid 
ankle-length skirt, a vest-like bodice over a cotton shift, and a 
straw hat. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in their shorts and tank tops are looking at me, but I  
tell them, I don't believe I'm any hotter than you are,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	How does she cope?  
</P>
<P>
	``Shade is a gift from God,'' she said. ``You bathe and bask in  
the air conditioning when you go into a building, and when a breeze 
comes along, you embrace it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A man who walked all the way from his home state of Georgia to  
deliver a petition to the American Medical Association in Chicago 
said it was a sweltering trek through the heat belt. Stuart Perry, 
who arrived Thursday, said he made the thousand-mile journey to 
educate people about depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Clutching a straw hat drenched in sweat, he said the heat was  
like a wall once he hit Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like you were cooking on the inside,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Council Grove, Kan., a town of 2,400 about 50 miles from  
Topeka, Bill and Pat Fisher joined friends at the ``Bull Session 
Table'' of the air-conditioned Saddlerock Cafe. Bill Fisher said it 
was his way of beating the heat by just staying indoors ``doing 
nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're coping with it damn poor,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Back in Indiana, the two glass doors of Sparkle Cleaners -- just  
down the street from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway -- were propped 
wide open to let a breeze in. It didn't matter much. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seven fans in here and it doesn't do a thing,'' owner  
Ryan White said, talking loudly so he could be heard over a pop 
song on the radio and the hissing of a steam presser. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so hot back there that one of my pressers -- she's an  
older lady -- after a full day of pressing she was getting ready to 
leave and just passed out right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White said the woman is a diabetic.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if it was the combination of heat and low sugar  
or what,'' he said, ``but since then, on these hot days, she's had 
to call in and say, `I can't make it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The heat is not just bothering people.  
</P>
<P>
	At the Oklahoma City Zoo, timers periodically turned on  
sprinklers to help zebras and other animals stay cool. Primates at 
the ape exhibit were periodically given Popsicle-like ice treats, 
some with fruit in them. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nebraska, where temperatures have pushed into the 100s in  
some places, the heat has killed at least 3,000 cattle. Some of the 
animals are registering a skin temperature of 120 degrees, said Dr. 
D. Griffin, a veterinarian with the University of Nebraska 
Cooperative Extension Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are cooking,'' he said. ``They are absolutely cooking.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Sign Rutledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals signed  
second-round draft pick Johnny Rutledge to a four-year contract for 
just over $2 million Thursday night, but the team's top pick, David 
Boston, was frustrated in his attempts to reach a deal in time to 
join the team when training camp workouts begin Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals' other first-round pick, L.J. Shelton, also  
remained unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's sister, Alicia, a Dallas lawyer who is acting as one of  
his agents, seemed exasperated with the Arizona organization, 
saying that her brother has repeatedly compromised while the 
Cardinals haven't given an inch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're extremely disappointed that we have been unable to reach  
a compromise with the organization,'' Alicia Boston said Thursday 
night. ``We have been extremely creative. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have tried to study the other deals in the first round and  
come up with proposals that we believe were reasonable with what 
was going on in draft spots around David, and they have rejected 
each and every one in its entirety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said more talks were scheduled Friday morning ``but it does  
not look good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston, the No. 8 pick overall who broke 11 school records in  
three seasons as a wide receiver at Ohio State, reportedly was 
seeking a four-year contract while the Cardinals preferred five 
years, but his sister didn't want to get into the specifics of the 
disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals were staying mum on the situation. General manager  
Bob Ferguson had no comment. Shelton, an offensive tackle from 
Eastern Michigan, was believed to be nowhere near an agreement. His 
agent, Lamont Smith, did not return telephone messages left on his 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge, a Florida linebacker who was the 51st pick overall,  
signed a $2.0185 million contract that includes a $825,000 signing 
bonus. His first-year salary will be $217,000. If NFL contract 
minimums increase as projected, the deal will grow to $2.1775 
million over the four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was important to come here and push and try to  
get a deal done on time for Johnny's development,'' said Rutledge's 
agent, Leigh Steinberg, who flew to Phoenix to wrap up 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge drew national attention in recent months when he and  
two other former Florida players admitted taking money from agent 
William ``Tank'' Black while still in college. Rutledge was the 
first to go public with the admission. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL Players Association has proposed stripping Black of his  
license for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	All three of the Cardinals' top picks figure prominently in the  
team's plans this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge, 6-foot-2 and 246 pounds, is considered a candidate for  
significant playing time with the departure of Jamir Miller to free 
agency. Boston figures to be the team's third wide receiver and do 
punt or kick return duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Still left to be resolved is the status of wide receiver Rob  
Moore and defensive tackle Mark Smith, who both are holding out in 
contract squabbles. Moore, miffed at being declared the Cardinals' 
franchise player and thereby limiting his income and options, wants 
a long-term contract. He has, however, picked up a Cardinals' 
playbook, an indication that he may not be too far from an 
agreement. Smith reportedly is demanding $1.2 million to $1.3 
million for the coming season. The Cardinals have offered about 
one-third that amount.

<P>
	WILBERFORCE, Ohio (AP) -- Seminaries are thought of as refuges  
from the roar of the outside world, cocoons where students study 
the word of God and train to become shepherds of their flocks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rev. Obery Hendricks Jr. sees a more activist role. And  
the former kick-boxer and Wall Street executive is using his 
energies and experience to make it happen at Payne Theological 
Seminary, the nation's oldest black seminary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really feel we are part of an important movement in  
theological education,'' said Hendricks, president of the seminary. 
``Its purpose is to empower the church to make a real difference in 
this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 46-year-old Hendricks knows all about activism. He grew up  
in East Orange and Newark, N.J. In the 1960s, he left the Baptist 
church, where his father was a trustee, because he felt it was too 
quiet on social issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``After hearing Malcolm X, I rebelled,'' Hendricks recalled. He  
joined the Black National Movement and spent seven years as an 
orthodox Muslim. Along the way, he earned a black belt in karate 
and was a competitive kick-boxer, he said. He is also a jazz and 
blues guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, Hendricks jumped into the whirlwind world of Wall  
Street, working as an investment executive. But he left in 1986 
after several deals went sour, which Hendricks took as a sign to 
change the direction of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a while I started feeling empty, like I really wasn't  
making a contribution,'' he said. ``I was serving people who really 
didn't need help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hendricks decided to study divinity, earning a master's degree  
from Princeton Theological Seminary and a Ph.D. from Princeton 
University before coming to Payne. 
</P>
<P>
	A world away from Wall Street in this southwest Ohio hamlet,  
Hendricks greets visitors with soft jazz from an office radio. 
Outside, the quiet is broken only by the sounds of birds and 
crickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The seminary was founded in 1844 by Bishop Daniel Payne, a  
social activist and the first African Methodist Episcopal minister 
to receive formal theological training. He also founded nearby 
Wilberforce University, a private, historically black school. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne is one of eight accredited black seminaries in the nation.  
Its 65 students, candidates for master's degrees in divinity, come 
from as far away as California and include several attorneys, a 
psychologist and other second-career students. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see people who have skills who really want to make a  
difference, a contribution,'' said Hendricks. ``And they don't feel 
they're doing that by dedicating their lives to really broadening 
the bottom line of corporate America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, there were 3,239 blacks enrolled in U.S. and Canadian  
seminaries offering master's degree programs in divinity, up 27 
percent from the 2,558 five years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Biekman, a 40-year-old engineer with an MBA, is a student  
at Payne who works as a manager at a machine-parts manufacturer. He 
said he went into engineering for the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I found was a real lack of fulfillment after I had  
achieved the so-called American Dream,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Biekman, who arrived at Payne in 1996, said he has seen a  
greater emphasis by the seminary on social activism. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, he said, a class called ``Politics of Jesus''  
examines Jesus' call for solidarity among the poor. One of 
Biekman's assignments required him to work in poorer communities by 
helping rehabilitate houses and teaching people how to start 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very much called to do more than just pastor,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Biekman said he hopes his knowledge of the corporate sector will  
enable him as a minister to relate to business executives, whom he 
may call upon to help the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Billingsley, professor of African American Studies at the  
University of South Carolina, said some seminaries have begun 
putting more emphasis on social reform, a role few have taken over 
the years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to want to do things in the community, but the  
traditional preparation of ministers doesn't include much 
know-how,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendricks said he plans to give his students economic  
development skills. ``We want them to be able to speak to bankers, 
real estate developers, using their own language,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the cases of the Rev. Floyd Flake, a Payne trustee and  
former congressman who helped start a clinic, Head Start program 
and credit union in the Queens section of New York City; and the 
Rev. Otis Moss, who built a clinic in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendricks said he also aims to affect national social  
legislation by attending forums, publishing papers and just raising 
the seminary's profile. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've not always played our part on the larger stage,'' he  
said. ``I think you're going to see more of an activist role from 
seminaries.''

<HEADLINE> Cards' Davis Is Trying To Recover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Eric Davis, whose book is called ``Born to  
Play,'' is a spectator again. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Cardinals outfielder, who came back strong in 1998  
after surviving colon cancer the previous year, has been out more 
than a month with a partially torn rotator cuff and a deep bruise. 
When or if he'll be back is a big question. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just waiting and trying to do what they tell me to do,''  
Davis said. ``I've never had a tear. Hopefully they give me the 
right advice and things work out. To have the same pain is not 
encouraging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 36, hurt the shoulder making a diving catch that saved  
rookie teammate Jose Jimenez's no-hitter June 25. He said he'd do 
it again, even though the price has been high. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd do it at the drop of a hat,'' he said. ``I'm a playmaker.  
That's what I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he'd have done it even if it ended his career.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the shoulder is permanently damaged, then it was meant to  
be,'' Davis said. ``I can't worry about preserving myself. I didn't 
get to this point by not going after balls. I didn't get Gold 
Gloves by not attacking the wall, and I'm not going to keep the 
respect of my peers by not doing it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' trials and tribulations are detailed in his book, written  
with Ralph Wiley. The eight surgeries in seven years that led to a 
year of retirement in 1995 and the colon cancer he fought and beat 
in 1997 are major parts of the book. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the one that caused them to put padding on the walls all  
around National League ballparks,'' Davis writes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since coming in heralded as the next Willie Mays, Davis has been  
on the disabled list 12 times in 15 seasons. He nearly died from a 
ruptured kidney sustained making a diving catch in the 1990 World 
Series, and survived another close call with colon cancer in 1997 
before making a quick recovery and returning to the Baltimore 
Orioles in the same season after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He also persevered after the drug-related death of his older  
brother, Jim, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has been told his story is an inspiration.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was something that needed to be said, it was information  
that needed to be put out there,'' he said. ``People need to 
understand first and foremost that we're human, and that everything 
is not peaches and cream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He compares the chemotherapy that followed the removal of a  
baseball-sized tumor in 1997 with ``snakebite, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overcoming life-and-death situations have not, however, made it  
easier for him to watch while he waits for signs of progress in his 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're used to playing, it's never easy to sit,'' Davis  
said. ``If you've got the flu, you don't want to sit down. When you 
have that competitive drive, you want to keep going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How much longer, he's not sure. Davis said he'll know it's time  
to retire again, this time for good, when he has to push his body 
to the brink to get ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the end is near, and it's based on what I want to do  
and how long I want to play,'' he said. ``I can still run, I can 
still throw, I can still hit. When I walk away from this game, 
it'll be because I'm mentally drained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis takes a few controversial stands in the book, including  
supporting Pete Rose for the Hall of Fame. He also credits Rose 
with molding the Reds team that won the World Series the year after 
he was banned from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete was just a Yoda-type dude to me,'' Davis writes.

<HEADLINE> Economics Adviser Named 'Hot Catch' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Who says those Washington policy wonks are all  
work and no sex appeal? 
</P>
<P>
	W magazine has named White House economics guru Gene Sperling  
one of the city's most eligible bachelors, noting he is ``smart and 
powerful (and sort of sexy, by Washington standards.)'' 
</P>
<P>
	The single, 40-year-old chairman of the National Economic  
Council is ``one of the hottest catches on the Washington social 
scene,'' the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart had a bit of fun with  
Sperling's new sex-symbol status Wednesday. By way of introducing 
Sperling at a White House briefing, Lockhart played the theme from 
``The Dating Game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Please welcome our first briefer today,'' Lockhart began. ``He  
loves tennis, rapid GDP growth and romantic midnight walks on West 
Executive Drive'' outside the White House, Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's bring out the man Wall Street calls the sexiest deficit  
hawk in all of Washington, Bachelor No. 1, Gene Sperling!'' 
Lockhart said, as reporters chuckled and Sperling grimaced.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper To Publish Online Only </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OREM, Utah (AP) -- Nine months after printing its first paper,  
The Orem Daily Journal has announced it will stop distributing a 
print edition and will publish exclusively online. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper planned to distribute its final print edition  
today and resume publication online Aug. 5, publisher Levor Oldham 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Oldham said some employees -- particularly those involved in  
distribution -- are being laid off. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, only the newspaper's classified advertisements have  
been available on the Internet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal may be the first daily paper in the nation to move  
its publication exclusively online, said Larry Pryor, executive 
editor of Online Journalism Review and a journalism professor at 
the University of Southern California. ``Weekly publications have 
moved online, but I am unaware of any dailies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oldham said common sense drove the move. ``Clearly, the future  
of newspapers is on the Web.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orem Daily Journal is one of three Utah County newspapers  
published by Springville-based Journal Publications, which also 
designs and markets software for newspapers. It began publishing 
7,500 copies in late October, positioning itself as a competitor to 
The Daily Herald in Provo, which has a circulation of about 33,000.

	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Wake Forest University, steeped in  
Baptist tradition, is opening a nondenominational divinity school 
whose first class of 24 includes a Catholic, a Lutheran, 
Presbyterians, Episcopalians and Moravians. 
</P>
<P>
	The students, who will embark on a three-year quest for a master  
of divinity degree Aug. 25, range in age from 21 to 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Within three years, school officials expect the program to  
enroll about 110 students, with a full-time faculty of eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Wake Forest Institute was founded in 1834 by the Baptist State  
Convention of North Carolina. It was rechartered as Wake Forest 
College in 1838. In 1956, the college moved all its operations from 
Wake Forest to Winston-Salem. 
</P>
<P>
	The divinity school is the first professional school to open at  
Wake Forest since the Babcock Graduate School of Management was 
founded in 1969. Trustees in 1989 approved the idea of opening the 
divinity school, contingent on the university getting adequate 
financial support. The divinity school has received more than $10 
million in pledges and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	The school's curriculum will focus on biblical studies, church  
history, theology and ministry studies such as pastoral care and 
preaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that theological education brings a completion to  
the university in the midst of our professional schools because the 
ideas and issues relative to faith, ethics and theological ideas 
are important on a university campus,'' said Bill J. Leonard, a 
Baptist minister and dean of the new school.

 *Amazing maize maze    	
</P>
<P>
	POE, Ind. (AP) -- Field corn prices are down, but hopes are up at  
the Zion Friedheim Evangelical Lutheran Church which is banking on 
a three-acre stand of corn to pay for a new roof. 
</P>
<P>
	The congregation at the 100-year-old church built a maze among  
the corn rows between Poe and Decatur. For $5 admission, anyone can 
traverse the 1 1/2 miles of paths. The trip averages one hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazes have been around for thousands of years for contemplation  
and protection and are enjoying somewhat of a renaissance. But 
professional designs are expensive, so church member Judy Werling 
took on the task and her husband, Mike, donated the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the corn is about head high, it's just a question of  
whether anyone will come. Zion Friedheim figures if 400 show up 
each weekend the church will reach its financial goal of $30,000 by 
Halloween. The maze also will be open by appointment for groups on 
Tuesdays and Fridays.

 *Three Protestant `Restoration' branches confer    	
</P>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Nine delegates from the three denominations  
with roots in the 19th century Protestant ``restoration'' movement 
recently met for a breakthrough, though unofficial, conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants came from the Christian Church (Disciples of  
Christ), which released news of the encounter, and two more 
conservative groups, the Churches of Christ and the independent 
Christian Churches. 
</P>
<P>
	All told these groups include 3.4 million U.S. members.  
</P>
<P>
	Participants discussed ideas on fostering better relationships.  
They hope to have larger delegations meet three times by the end of 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The session originated when Richard Hamm, president of the  
Disciples of Christ, expressed interest in contacting the other two 
branches.

 *Minor loss for Lutheran group    	
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the  
nation's fifth largest Protestant body, reports a baptized 
membership of 5.2 million, a loss of 6,830 members since 1998. The 
slight drop is in keeping with a 10-year decline of 73,309, or 1.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Members who have undergone confirmation declined in 1998 by  
4,033, to 3.8 million, and members counted as ``communing and 
contributing'' declined 14,337, to 2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The denomination said 30.5 percent of baptized members attend  
worship in the average week, about the same as a decade ago.

	The Evangelical Lutheran Church currently has 10,862 local  
congregations.

<HEADLINE> Women's Soccer Team To Go On Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The World Cup-winning U.S. women's soccer team  
struck a deal Thursday that will allow it to go on an indoor tour 
while keeping its outdoor commitment with the U.S. Soccer 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The USSF sought to block the team from going on the indoor tour,  
which was arranged through an independent sports marketing company. 
But team spokesman Aaron Heifetz said a tentative arrangement was 
worked out that will allow the women to do both. 
</P>
<P>
	John Collins, legal counsel for the USSF, said part of the  
settlement was that the players would wear Federation uniforms on 
the indoor tour. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not disclosed, however, exactly what compromise was  
reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will play indoors the last three months of the year,  
making stops in 11 U.S. cities. The players' plans conflicted with 
plans by the Federation to send the team on a tour of South Africa, 
Egypt and Australia.

<HEADLINE> Procter &AMP; Gamble's Earnings Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Fourth-quarter net earnings at Procter &AMP;  
Gamble Co. decreased 40 percent, primarily as the result of a $385 
million after-tax charge for the costs of a reorganization 
announced in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $414 million, or 29  
cents per share, compared with $686 million or 47 cents per share, 
in the same period ending June 30 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G president and chief executive Durk Jager said the new  
Organization 2005 program announced in June is in place and the 
Cincinnati-based company anticipates significant benefits for the 
coming fiscal year and beyond. The multiyear initiative is designed 
to accelerate sales and earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the charge from Organization 2005, the company said  
its core earnings reflected a 16 percent increase in the fourth 
quarter to $799 million, or 55 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call were expecting earnings of 53  
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter ending June 30 increased 2 percent to  
$9.45 billion, compared with $9.27 billion in 1998. Sales for the 
year increased 3 percent from $37.1 billion in 1998 to $38.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, P&AMP;G said net earnings were down less than 1  
percent, from $3.78 billion in 1998 to $3.76 billion in 1999. Per 
share earnings for 1999 were $2.59, compared with $2.56 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has said that the Organization 2005 program is  
expected to cost $1.9 billion after taxes over the six-year period 
and will affect 15,000 positions worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sells about 300 product brands in more than 140  
countries. These brands include Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, 
Pantene Pro-V shampoo, Pringles snack chips and Pampers disposable 
diapers. P&AMP;G employs more than 110,000 employees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of P&AMP;G rose $2 to $88.12 1/2 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Players Lament Sanders' Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Awesome. Amazing. In a class by himself.  
</P>
<P>
	After announcing his retirement, Barry Sanders was lauded with a  
string of superlatives from former teammates and opponents of the 
Detroit Lions running back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been an awesome player,'' said Atlanta Falcons coach Dan  
Reeves. ``I don't know anybody who's been as big for their team as 
Barry for his. If the guy is sincere and he hangs it up, you're 
going to miss a great running back that was one of the best of all 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Troy Vincent said stopping  
Sanders was the ultimate challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you prepare your game plan during the week, you throw all  
11 guys flying at Barry,'' Vincent said. ``It's fun watching Barry 
embarrass people and do things other people can't do. But when you 
line up against Barry, your heart is pumping all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland linebacker Chris Spielman, who used to play for the  
Lions, said Sanders was ``in a class by himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The best way to describe Barry is that he did something every  
single week, whether it would be in practice or a game, that would 
absolutely amaze you,'' Spielman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said Wednesday he was retiring from the NFL after 10  
years, even though he is just 1,458 yards shy of breaking Walter 
Payton's career rushing record. The mark apparently wasn't that 
important to Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry was never much on records or stats. He was all about  
winning,'' Spielman said. ``For him to play just to break Payton's 
record would be very much out of character for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, who suffers from a rare liver disease and is awaiting a  
transplant, said he understood Sanders' decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not about money. It is not about statistics. It is about  
the romance kindled by playing the game the way it was supposed to 
be played,'' Payton said. ``As I am engulfed in my personal trials, 
my family, friends and life are more important than any yard or 
touchdown ever scored. And in a sense, Barry is fighting for the 
same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver running back Terrell Davis, the league's MVP last season,  
also will miss Sanders. They were scheduled to play against each 
other for the first time this season, on Christmas Day in the 
Silverdome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to play against Detroit without Barry, so I am  
going to miss out on that opportunity,'' Davis said. ``I am like 
anyone else. I am disappointed. ... Barry's been doing things I 
wouldn't try to do. I'm a running back. Barry's an athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' running style was unique, combining the speed of a  
sprinter with the contortions of a gymnast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could say I'm glad I don't have to play against him, but  
he's exciting to play against,'' said defensive tackle Mike Wells, 
now with Chicago. ``I was a teammate of his for four years, and I 
was a fan as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 31, Sanders was in his prime, and the retirement announcement  
was unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not retiring, is he? Y'all are joking. Please! That's got  
to be a joke,'' said Dallas' Emmitt Smith, now the leading active 
career rusher with 12,566 yards. ``I don't buy it just yet because 
the man has many, many, many more years left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami Dolphins assistant Pat Jones, who recruited and coached  
Sanders at Oklahoma State, said the running back was one of the 
best in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had a chance to be around sheer greatness, like Michael  
Jordan or Sam Snead or Jack Nicklaus or Dan Marino,'' Jones said. 
``He has withstood the test of time. He'll go down as one of the 
greatest backs that has ever played the game.''

<HEADLINE> WWII Letter Warned of Nazi Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The letter came anonymously from someone along  
the German-Swiss border in December 1940, telling of systematic 
killings of mentally ill patients in German asylums. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurry, the correspondent wrote, ``and with your expressions of  
horror prevent further murders!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter ended up a month later in high offices of the U.S.  
War Department, offering early evidence of the Nazis' brutality 
against their own people. 
</P>
<P>
	But recently declassified documents do not show anything was  
done about that and other warnings in the months before Germany's 
``euthanasia'' programs became undeniably known and the full weight 
of the Holocaust descended. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents found at the National Archives by the Simon Wiesenthal  
Center, a Los Angeles research organization named after the famed 
Nazi hunter, point to still earlier communications by U.S. 
officials about the programs to kill the feeble-minded and deformed 
even among Hitler's favored ``Aryans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1940, a U.S. consul in Leipzig told top State  
Department officials of a sudden increase in death notices 
published in local newspapers by relatives of people in the 
Grafeneck mental asylum in southwest Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``Details so far gathered concerning these notices give them a  
'Frankenstein' setting; their attendant circumstances, described in 
this despatch, are fantastic and gruesome,'' vice consul Paul Dutko 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Historians are divided on whether the United States could have  
saved many victims of euthanasia before entering the war in 
December 1941, either by sending diplomatic protests to Berlin or 
by disclosing what it knew earlier and mobilizing public opinion 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Los Angeles center, said  
Thursday a strong condemnation from the United States of asylum 
killings ``would have possibly changed Hitler's approach to how 
much he could get away with. ... Hitler may not have been able to 
put across his Final Solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The December 1940 letter, signed only by ``A Christian, who  
cannot bear to witness this any longer,'' was sent to NBC in New 
York in the hope that the radio network would expose the secret 
killings in sanitariums and nursing homes in southern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was given to a military intelligence major, Frederick  
Sharp, in New York. He in turn sent it to the acting chief of staff 
in the War Department along with his opinion that ``everything 
points to it being correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unknown correspondent wrote that ``thousands of patients are  
secretly murdered monthly,'' including paying patients and those 
who were only slightly ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is done in a bath tub by electrical means, possibly also by  
poisoning,'' the letter went on, adding the bodies were cremated 
and families then informed the patients ``had died of some 
disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington knew early in 1940 that Germany was deporting Jews to  
Poland and did not believe they were going to labor camps as 
claimed, Hier said. But officials decided not to protest because 
they did not want to drag the United States into war. 
</P>
<P>
	Hier said the same attitude apparently prevailed when evidence  
of asylum killings came in, before the publication of eyewitness 
reports in the summer of 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	``After having received all of this information the United  
States did nothing but deep-six this material,'' he said. ``They 
never protested or let on that they knew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suspicions about what was going on in asylums spread through  
southern Germany in part because even Catholics were being 
cremated, despite opposition to cremation by bishops. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Detroit Casino Ready to Roll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Mayor Dennis Archer stood at the craps table in  
Detroit's new $225 million casino, pulled out a large pair of fuzzy 
dice and gave them a roll. They came up seven. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to see things come to fruition,'' Archer said  
Wednesday, hours after the Michigan Gaming Control Board granted 
the MGM Grand Detroit Casino the state's first casino license. 
``What this means ... is we will now be about the business of 
seeing so many people be gainfully employed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grand opening of the temporary casino, scheduled for this  
afternoon, makes Detroit the largest U.S. city with casino 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're obviously very excited about this. The opportunity to be  
a part of the rebirth of a great city is a very important factor,'' 
said J. Terrence Lanni, chairman of MGM Grand. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino is in a renovated Internal Revenue Service building  
on the western fringe of downtown, close to a freeway and the Joe 
Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	It has two floors with 2,370 slot machines and video poker games  
and 83 table games. It will stay open around the clock and is 
expecting more than 10,000 visitors a day, MGM Grand President Lyn 
Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino plans to employ about 2,700 people, called ``cast  
members'' in MGM Grand parlance, about half of whom live in 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Michigan voters approved a ballot proposal authorizing  
three casinos in Detroit. Four previous proposals from 1976 to 1988 
had been defeated by wide margins. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer allowed the three casino groups to open temporary  
operations while developers build billion-dollar hotel-casino 
complexes on Detroit's riverfront. The other two temporary casinos 
are expected to open later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under its agreement with the city, the three temporary casinos  
can stay open only four years, and space for gambling is limited to 
75,000 square feet. The conditions are designed to spur the 
building of the permanent casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Martha Jean Steinberg, a longtime Detroit radio personality and  
an investor in the MGM Grand, said she hoped the casino would help 
to heal the rift between Detroit and its suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means hope, it means jobs, it means entertainment, it means  
excitement, it means coming to see something beautiful and not 
always looking at a war zone,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Owner Sells Part of Hornets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Michael Jordan's disinterest turned into  
the opportunity of a lifetime for Ray Wooldridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitalizing on Jordan's decision to abandon attempts to buy a  
share of the Charlotte Hornets, Wooldridge on Thursday became a 
minority owner of the NBA franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal calls for George Shinn, formerly the sole owner of the  
team, to remain the managing partner. Wooldridge has the right to 
buy up to 50 percent of the team within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Shinn nor Wooldridge would reveal financial terms of the  
deal. But team officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, 
said it was worth between $75 million and $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
	While that represents a significant profit for Shinn, who  
brought the Hornets into the NBA in 1988 for an expansion fee of 
$32.5 million, Wooldridge had no complaints. Less than three months 
ago, he figured there was no chance of buying any part of the 
Hornets, regardless of price. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Shinn was locked in negotiations to sell a  
portion of the team to Jordan. But the retired NBA superstar broke 
off talks in early May after Shinn refused to sell more than a 
minority share or give Jordan a say in key business decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not willing to give up 100 percent control for half the  
price,'' Shinn said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's withdrawal opened the door for Wooldridge, an Atlanta  
businessman who chuckled when asked how quickly he called Shinn 
after learning of Jordan's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was within the hour,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wooldridge, 55, admittedly won't create the fanfare that someone  
like Jordan would. Wooldridge hasn't played basketball since high 
school and said that other than coaching youth teams, his main 
attachment to the game is as a fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the thrills of my life,'' said Wooldridge, who  
recently sold Space Master International Inc., an Atlanta-based 
modular office construction business, for about $270 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Wooldridge said he contacted commissioner David Stern several  
years ago to express an interest in purchasing a share of a team. 
Wooldridge said Stern introduced him to Shinn. 
</P>
<P>
	Wooldridge becomes a part owner of a team that has never  
advanced past the second round of the playoffs and failed to 
qualify for the postseason this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn has had trouble getting support for his claim that the  
Hornets need a new arena to replace the 23,799-seat Charlotte 
Coliseum, where attendance has dipped in recent years. Shinn said a 
new facility with more luxury suites would allow him to raise more 
money to pay the salaries needed to attract the most talented free 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets used to sell out every game at the Charlotte  
Coliseum, but attendance fell to an all-time low average of 19,232 
last season. The Hornets failed to sell out a single home game. 
</P>
<P>
	Wooldridge said his main responsibility will be to spearhead the  
drive for a new arena in downtown Charlotte.

<HEADLINE> Sting Moving Talk Called Premature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Talk that Charlotte may lose its WNBA  
franchise because of poor attendance is premature, league 
commissioner Val Ackerman said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman, in town to attend the Sting's game against Detroit,  
said league officials have no plans to move the team, which went 
into the game with a league-low attendance average of 6,234. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to believe that the potential exists to do as well  
here as in some other cities,'' Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman said the WNBA would evaluate attendance for all of its  
franchises after the season ends but would be more inclined to try 
more aggressive marketing approaches before electing to move clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything is possible along those lines,'' she said of  
franchise moves, ``but it's not desirable. We've invested quite a 
bit here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman said the league office maintains regular contact with  
officials of the Charlotte franchise, which was one of the charter 
members of the WNBA in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte was among the league leaders in attendance its first  
two seasons, but the Sting got off to a slow start this year, 
struggling to stay near the .500 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest we have expected that the league would experience  
what we call a stabilization, and that's happened,'' Ackerman said. 
``But on whole I would say we're actually encouraged.''

<HEADLINE> Einhorn Ordered To Pay $907 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The family of a woman killed by a former  
counterculture guru appears to stand little chance of collecting 
the $907 million awarded them by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	That's all right, their lawyer said -- the point was to prevent  
Ira Einhorn from profiting in the future from any book or movie 
deals about the case. Any such attempt by Einhorn, lawyer James 
Beasley said, would be a waste of time ``because you'll never make 
a nickel out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The award handed down Wednesday cannot be appealed because  
Einhorn, a fugitive, did not respond to court papers he signed for 
in France and never put forward a defense to the wrongful death 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Einhorn, convicted in absentia of the 1977 murder of Helen  
``Holly'' Maddux, his live-in girlfriend, is fighting extradition 
from France. He did not attend the two-day civil trial and did not 
send a lawyer to represent him. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Sandra Moser Moss to rule Einhorn's failure to respond  
meant he had effectively admitted liability, and jurors had only to 
decide how much, if anything, he should pay. 
</P>
<P>
	After about an hour's deliberation, the jury awarded the family  
$752 million in punitive damages and $155 million in compensatory 
damages. Jurors left court quickly after exchanging kisses, hugs 
and handshakes with the Maddux family. It was unclear how jurors 
arrived at those specific figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just wanted to send a message to deter this kind of thing  
happening to any other family,'' said jury foreman Donald Wilent. 
``I can't judge Mr. Einhorn because I don't know him personally. 
But a real man answers for what he does wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Several of them were in tears,'' said Elizabeth Hall, one of  
Ms. Maddux's sisters. ``More than one of them said, `There isn't 
enough money to give you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Beasley said if Einhorn does get a book or film contract, he  
will serve the publisher or movie producer with legal papers 
ordering that no payment be made to Einhorn until the $907 million 
judgment is paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maddux was bludgeoned to death in 1977, but her body was not  
found until 18 months later in a closet in Einhorn's home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within 10 feet of his bed lay the coffin of Holly Maddux,''  
Beasley said during his closing argument. ``What type of individual 
could conceivably spend 18 months within 10 feet of a corpse that 
he put in a trunk?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A prominent antiwar campaigner and activist in the 1960s,  
Einhorn, now 58, fled the United States shortly before his 1981 
trial and was sentenced to life in prison following the 1993 trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Einhorn could not be reached Wednesday for comment on the  
verdict. He did not return calls from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the syndicated radio talk show Radio  
America on Wednesday morning, Einhorn said he was interested in 
writing a book but had no desire to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am innocent of the crime as charged, and I will declare that  
until my dying breath,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pacifica To Reopen Berkeley Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Protesters outside community radio  
station KPFA were unmoved -- literally and figuratively -- by news 
that station owners planned to end a two-week staff lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a positive move, but we're still concerned that the sale  
of the station is still on the table,'' said protester Tracy 
Rosenberg of the free-speech advocacy group Media Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	KPFA supporters have been in an uproar over the past few weeks,  
claiming that station owners want to sell and let the radical 
station go mainstream. Two weeks ago, owners locked out staffers 
and put them on paid leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenberg was among 30 protesters Wednesday night who carried on  
as they had for the past two weeks, planning food runs and night 
watches outside the station. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier, the Pacifica Foundation, which owns KPFA,  
announced it would end the lockout, inviting staff to resume 
regular programming at 9 a.m. Friday. Security personnel would be 
asked to leave, and Pacifica would ``remove itself from management 
of the station for six months to one year,'' according to a news 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rosenberg and others said they saw the announcement as an  
offer that would need approval from the staff's union at mediation 
sessions that were scheduled to continue today. Meanwhile, they 
would sit tight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue tomorrow to see the results of the mediation.  
Then we'll take it from there,'' Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacifica Chairwoman Mary Frances Berry has denied the station  
was for sale, but Pacifica board member Pete Bramson said the issue 
was under discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacifica board said in a resolution Wednesday that if it  
cannot resolve the situation at KPFA within six months it would 
talk to people interested in buying the station, according to a 
copy of the statement obtained by the San Jose Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
	KPFA's troubles date to April when a popular station manager was  
dismissed. A subsequent management edict that the issue not be 
discussed on the air set the stage for a series of showdowns. A 
talk show host and music programmer were fired and more than a 
dozen protesters arrested for trespassing. In mid-July, veteran 
newsman Dennis Bernstein was yanked off the air for talking about 
the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacifica also owns stations in Los Angeles, Houston, New York  
and Washington, D.C.

<HEADLINE> Sacramento Council OKs Pepsi Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Pepsi, the self-anointed ``choice of a  
new generation,'' will soon be the only option for thirsty workers 
and visitors on city property in California's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sacramento City Council has approved a $2 million deal to  
dub Pepsi the official drink of Sacramento, making Pepsi products 
the only choice at city hall, city parks, community centers and 
golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is one of several soft-drink bottlers have struck with  
cities and school districts across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives the city of Sacramento a shot in the arm,  
financially,'' Councilman Robbie Waters said Wednesday. ``It's a 
good deal for everyone involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, the local Pepsi Bottling Group pays the  
city at least $200,000 a year for 10 years to stock only Pepsi 
products at vending machines and concession stands on city 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, approved 5-3 Tuesday night, does not affect sales at  
non-government sites, such as stores and restaurants, or existing 
contracts that vendors may have with other beverage companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Williamson, a spokesman at Coca-Cola's Atlanta  
headquarters, said becoming a city's official soft drink is not 
part of the company's national marketing strategy, though it does 
increase name recognition and brand loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We encourage our bottlers to do it,'' Williamson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Opponents fear Sacramento will look less like the state capital  
and more like Pepsi headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be done tastefully,'' Waters said.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Four goals by forward Marzouk Al Otaibi led  
Saudi Arabia to a 5-1 victory over Egypt Thursday night and 
strengthened the Saudis' hopes of making it to the Confederations 
Cup semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia took advantage of Egypt's weak defense, with Al  
Otabi scoring in the seventh and 33rd minutes in the first half. 
Saudi Arabia's Ibrahim Al Shahrani scored again in the 63rd minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt's only goal was on a penalty shot in the 69th minute by  
Ibrahim Samir. With only eight Egyptian players left on the field, 
Al Otaibi scored again in the 77th and 84th minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The game virtually eliminated Egypt's chances of moving on to  
the semifinals, while it gave hope to Saudi Arabia, which lost 5-1 
to Mexico at the beginning of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the four teams based in Mexico City will advance to the  
semifinals, along with the top two of the Guadalajara group, which 
includes Brazil, Germany, the United States and New Zealand.

<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Jay Heaps' goal in the seventh  
shootout round gave the Miami Fusion a 3-2 victory over the Tampa 
Bay Mutiny in Major League Soccer Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	After Tampa Bay's Eric Quill and Miami's Welton converted in the  
first five rounds of the regulation shootout rounds, the Mutiny's 
Josh Keller and the Fusion's Tyrone Marshall scored in the 
following elimination round. 
</P>
<P>
	When a shot by Tampa Bay's Chad McCarty sailed over the Fusion  
goal, Heaps capitalized on his shot, beating Tampa Bay goalkeeper 
Andy Kirk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion erased a 2-0 first-half deficit on Welton's third  
goal of the season at the 76th minute. Welton headed in a shot past 
Kirk after a crossing pass from Tim Sahaydak. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's first goal in the opening minute of the second half was  
an own goal, when Mutiny defender Steve Trittschuh deflected a pass 
from Marshall into his own goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mutiny stunned the Fusion with a two-goal outburst within a  
13-minute period of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Musa Shannon opened the scoring with his ninth goal of the  
season in the 13th minute, when the Mutiny forward capitalized on a 
turnover by defender Jeremy Aldrich and blasted a shot from 18 
yards past Garth Lagerway. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal ended Lagerway's 244-minute scoreless streak.  
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Valderrama and Raul Diaz Arce combined on the Mutiny's  
second goal. Valderrama, in his second match against the Fusion 
since being traded, fed Diaz Arce with a long pass originating from 
the Mutiny end. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz Arce retrieved the pass and flicked a shot from 35 yards.  
Lagerway came out to retrieve but misplayed it and the ball sailed 
past him for the Mutiny's second goal and Diaz Arce's seventh of 
the season.

	Joy Canton, 37, of Detroit was third in line. But her reason for  
showing up had little to do with gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never set foot inside a casino before,'' she said. ``I  
want to see the grandeur of it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $225 million casino, built in a renovated IRS building,  
brings 2,700 jobs and a projected 10,000 visitors a day to the 
city's blighted downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino's opening is the latest in a string of revival  
projects in Detroit. Within four years, three permanent casinos are 
to be built on Detroit's riverfront. 
</P>
<P>
	The MGM Grand Detroit is near two sports stadiums under  
construction as well as other commercial development projects in a 
downtown area that had slid largely into ruin after the 1967 riots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once all three temporary casinos are open, and you combine  
that with all the great restaurants in downtown, the stadiums 
opening up and the (office) project, I think the city is ready to 
ignite,'' MGM Grand Detroit President Lyn Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the casino doors opened at 4:30 p.m., crowds stretched  
from a parking lot onto the street. One of the first players inside 
was Cenus McMillan, a Detroit retiree who showed up at the casino 
at 9:45 a.m. and had to be taken inside a little early because of 
the sweltering heat. 
</P>
<P>
	She immediately headed for the 25-cent slot machines.  
</P>
<P>
	What she saw inside -- an art deco interior meant to evoke a  
1930s movie theater holding 2,370 slot machines and video poker 
games and 83 table games -- impressed her. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is gorgeous!'' Ms. McMillan said. ``I'm so glad they're  
finally opening up. I don't know what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MGM officials said the casino can hold up to 5,700 patrons.  
</P>
<P>
	The temporary casinos are expected to create about 11,000 jobs --  
as many as General Motors Corp. has in the city. Analysts say the 
three casinos should do well in Detroit, the largest U.S. city with 
casino gambling, and estimate the market at $1.5 billion a year -- 
just behind Las Vegas, Atlantic City, N.J., and Tunica, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has been seeking new businesses for decades; since the  
late 1950s, Detroit has lost nearly half its people. Suburban 
flight sped up after the 1967 riots. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1970s, investors have pitched casinos in Detroit, but  
voters turned down gambling four times from 1976 to 1988. Seventeen 
Indian casinos have opened since 1993, but the nearest was 2 1/2 hours 
from Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in 1994, Canada's Ontario province opened a casino in  
Windsor, a five-minute drive across the Detroit River, drawing 
throngs. Finally, in 1996, city residents gave permission to open a 
casino in its own backyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's casinos are counting on gamblers like Peggy Jennings,  
who visits Casino Windsor three times a week, to take pride in 
their hometown casino offering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to spend my money in Detroit, where we all live,''  
said Ms. Jennings. ``Let 'em tax me.''

<HEADLINE> Severe Storm Pounds Western Pa. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A severe thunderstorm swept through  
drought-weary southwestern Pennsylvania, leaving thousands of 
people without power this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.43 inches of rain at Pittsburgh International Airport on  
Wednesday set a record for any day in July and was the third-most 
rain recorded on any day since record-keeping began in southwestern 
Pennsylvania in 1870. 
</P>
<P>
	Another storm system that moved through the city overnight added  
nearly an inch more at the airport, with flash flood watches issued 
early this morning for much of the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The lunchtime storm Wednesday snarled power lines across several  
counties, flooded low roads and delayed airplanes, trains and 
buses. Pea-sized hail pummeled unsuspecting folks who were caught 
outside, and wind up to 70 mph knocked trees onto roadways. 
</P>
<P>
	The downpour will help ease the state drought a little but is  
still no substitute for a steady, sustained rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that we'll see an increase in is the reservoirs,  
which is a good thing,'' said Betsy Mallison, spokeswoman for the 
state Department of Environmental Protection. ``But the rain we got 
today is probably too heavy to help groundwater too much. It hit 
the ground and ran off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 110,000 customers lost power at some point and as many as  
196,000 lost water or some water pressure when electricity went out 
at two water pumping stations. Some 55,000 customers remained 
without power this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our crews could be working a couple of days on this one,''  
said Duquesne Light spokeswoman Jean Grogan. 
</P>
<P>
	As the storm system crossed Ohio on Wednesday, four people  
suffered minor injuries when strong winds -- possibly a tornado -- 
ripped the roof off a campground pavilion in Holmes County. A 
lightning-caused fire heavily damaged a church in Elyria Township. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of northeast Ohio was under a tornado warning early this  
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 42,000 customers in parts of Michigan were also without  
power today after storms passed through.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Pay Fine in Contempt Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge ordered President  
Clinton to pay almost $90,000 to Paula Jones' legal team Thursday 
in an unprecedented action aimed at penalizing him for false 
testimony and deterring others ``who might consider emulating the 
president's misconduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money, which is in addition to $850,000 paid to Mrs. Jones  
to settle her sexual harassment lawsuit, is to compensate for legal 
costs related to Clinton's denial that he had a sexual relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's testimony in the Jones case led to his impeachment by  
the House. He was later acquitted in a Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers, who had argued that he should pay no  
more than $33,737, said he would comply with the ruling. It was 
unclear whether the money would come from Clinton's legal defense 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the money will be passed on to Mrs. Jones, her lawyers  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court takes no pleasure in imposing contempt sanctions  
against this nation's president and, no doubt like many others, 
grows weary of this matter,'' U.S. District Judge Susan Webber 
Wright wrote in her order. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nevertheless ... sanctions must be imposed to redress the  
president's misconduct and to deter others who might consider 
emulating the president's misconduct,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalties could end the president's five-year battle with  
Mrs. Jones in the courts, although at least one of her attorneys is 
considering an appeal for more money. The Jones attorneys had asked 
for five times as much. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel the court vastly underestimated the reasonable amount  
of time'' spent working on perjury and obstruction-of-justice 
issues, the Dallas-based law firm of Rader, Campbell, Fisher &AMP; Pyke 
said in a statement. ``In sum, we continue to assert that Ms. 
Jones' attorneys are entitled to the full amount of fees claimed, 
if not more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones declined to comment when a reporter visited her home  
near Cabot, Ark. She made a zipper-like motion with one hand across 
her lips. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge in April had issued a historic contempt ruling against  
Clinton and said she would order him to pay for costs that resulted 
from ``false, misleading and evasive answers'' in his January 1998 
deposition in Mrs. Jones' lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We accept the judgment of the court,'' Clinton lawyer Robert  
Bennett said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Lavallee, administrator of Clinton's legal fund, said the  
trustees won't consider whether they can use the money they've 
raised for legal fees to pay the president's fine unless Clinton 
tells them he wants them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the sanctions, the judge also ordered Clinton to pay  
the court $1,202 for her trip to Washington at the president's 
request to preside over his deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas law firm of Rader, Campbell, Fisher &AMP; Pike was  
awarded $79,999. The Rutherford Institute, a public interest law 
firm that also served on Mrs. Jones' team, will receive $9,485. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards were far short of the firms' itemized bills --  
$437,825 from the Dallas firm and $53,333 from the Virginia-based 
Rutherford Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	In her order, Wright said the lawyers' claims were ``excessive  
and must be reduced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Whitehead of the Rutherford Institute said he was pleased  
that Clinton was penalized but might appeal the amount. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key thing is how history will view this,'' he said.  
``They're not going to look at the money but at the first sitting 
president that was ever held in contempt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawyers had argued that they should be reimbursed  
for all legal work after Clinton's deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, however, limited the sanctions to the costs most  
directly associated with Clinton's testimony about Ms. Lewinsky, 
beginning after he gave a false answer in a written statement Dec. 
23, 1997. The judge noted that about 20 percent of Clinton's Jan. 
17, 1998, deposition dealt with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	At the deposition, Clinton testified, ``I have never had sexual  
relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' Months later, after the 
president's DNA was found on a dress belonging to Ms. Lewinsky, he 
acknowledged to a federal grand jury that he had an ``inappropriate 
intimate relationship'' with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the relationship did not fall under the definition  
of ``sexual relations'' provided by Mrs. Jones' lawyers during his 
deposition, and that his testimony was legally accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	In her lawsuit, Mrs. Jones claimed that Clinton made an unwanted  
sexual advance in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991 while he was 
Arkansas governor and she was a state employee. Wright dismissed 
her suit on April 1, 1998, but Clinton agreed to the $850,000 
settlement after Mrs. Jones appealed the dismissal. Clinton 
admitted no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones lawyers' drew Ms. Lewinsky into the case in an  
attempt to show a pattern of sexual misconduct by Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Federal Judge Nominees Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eight nominees for federal judgeships,  
including a former aide to the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, 
won approval Thursday from the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House only this week nominated Ted Stewart, the Utah  
state aide and friend of Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. For several 
months, Hatch had blocked Senate action on President Clinton's 
nominees to the federal bench in a battle with the administration 
over Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch resumed hearings in June after saying Clinton had assured  
him that Stewart, chief of staff to Utah Republican Gov. Mike 
Leavitt, would be nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 50, is opposed by some Democrats and environmental  
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Stewart, Hatch's committee approved three  
candidates for the federal appeals court and four for district 
court vacancies in New York and California. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee voted 10-8 in favor of elevating U.S. District  
Judge Richard Paez of Los Angeles to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals. Clinton first nominated Paez in January 1996. The 
remaining nominations were approved by voice votes and the entire 
batch of names sent to the full Senate for confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, however, was not expected to act on the nominations  
before Congress breaks next week for a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven judicial nominations were before the full Senate before  
Thursday's committee action, which brought the total to 15, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine judges have been confirmed this year, compared with 33 by  
this time last year, said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the 
committee's senior Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still remain well behind the pace of last year, but over  
the last few weeks we have been making progress,'' Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, a lawyer who has worked on Capitol Hill, also served on  
Utah's Public Service Commission and was executive director of its 
Commerce and Natural Resources departments before joining the 
governor's office. At the resources agencies, he criticized 
environmental groups and opposed federal land policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents pointed to his lack of courtroom experience. Stewart  
never has tried a case and is listed as ``inactive'' by the Utah 
State Bar. Defenders say he gained judicial experience at the 
public service commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bar Association found Stewart qualified to be a  
federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who know Ted know he will continue to serve the public  
well,'' Hatch said Thursday at an earlier hearing on seven of the 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch also cautioned the nominees against what is known as  
``judicial activism,'' whereby judges make law from the bench. 
Their job is to interpret the law, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judges, if they don't abide by the rule of law, then they  
shouldn't be on the bench, especially lower court judges,'' Hatch 
said. ``I think it's very important that you understand the role 
that you have, not to make the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paez's nomination also has been controversial.  
</P>
<P>
	A Hispanic, Paez angered conservatives with his outspoken  
opposition to two California ballot initiatives that ended many 
state affirmative action programs and excluded many illegal 
immigrants from government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The other nominees approved are:  
</P>
<P>
	--U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry of New Jersey to the  
3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. She is the sister of real estate 
developer Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
	--Raymond C. Fisher of California to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court  
of appeals. A lawyer, Fisher has been an associate U.S. attorney 
general since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	--U.S. Magistrate Naomi Reice Buchwald of New York to be a U.S.  
District judge for the Southern District of New York. A former 
assistant U.S. attorney, Buchwald became a magistrate in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	--U.S. Magistrate David N. Hurd of New York to be a U.S. District  
judge for the Northern District of New York. He has been a 
magistrate since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	--M. James Lorenz of California to be a U.S. District judge for  
the Southern District of California. He is a former U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	--Victor Marrero of New York to be a U.S. District judge for the  
Southern District of New York. A native of Santurce, Puerto Rico, 
and a former Fulbright Scholar, Marrero is U.S. ambassador to the 
Organization of American States.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Slip in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index slipped  
Friday morning after the government released more gloomy economic 
data. The dollar was slightly lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 18.67 points,  
or 0.10 percent, to finish the morning session at 17,851.25. On 
Thursday, the average rose 290.01 points, or 1.65 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.43 yen in late morning, down 0.25 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo but higher than its late New York level of 
115.40 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices started lower Friday following news of worsening  
joblessness in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's unemployment rate soared to a record high 4.9  
percent in June from 4.6 percent in May as many companies 
accelerated their restructuring, the government announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is struggling to bail out of its worst downturn since  
World War II and companies are reducing staffs in a campaign to 
trim costs and regain competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo market was also hit by a decline on Wall Street, where  
the Dow Jones industrial average fell 180.78 points, or 1.7 
percent, to 10,791.29 at Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 2.64 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,470.37. The 
TOPIX closed up 17.40 points, or 1.20 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, traders said fear of dollar-buying  
intervention by Japan's central bank aimed at stemming the yen's 
rapid rise might help slow the dollar's slide for the rest of 
Friday's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the Bank of Japan repeatedly bought dollars in  
an attempt to suppress the yen's surge and aid the nation's 
fledgling economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains in the yen make Japanese exports more costly abroad, and  
thus less competitive, while cutting the value of foreign revenue 
in yen terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a regular news conference  
that Japan is carefully watching the foreign exchange market, 
though he said that recent dollar-yen moves reflect a weakening of 
the dollar rather than a strengthening of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.52 yen, down  
from 123.56 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.7900 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8050 percent, driving 
its price up to 100.08 yen from 99.95 yen.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Profits Rise 16 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna's second-quarter operating profits rose a  
better-than-expected 16 percent, as the health insurance giant 
increased its managed care enrollment while controlling rising 
medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding unusual costs and revenues, Aetna earned $170.6  
million, or $1.10 per share in the three months ended June 30, up 
from $153.0 million or 95 cents per share in the same period a year 
ago. Results, announced Thursday, beat Wall Street forecasts by 1 
cent, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the quarter was $227.2 million, or $1.50 a share,  
down from $265.7 million, or $1.69 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues increased 23 percent to $5.95 billion from $4.84  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits from Aetna's U.S. Healthcare health insurance business  
leaped 29 percent to $134.5 million, excluding Year 2000 costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna's HMO enrollment rose 44.3 percent to 6.89 million,  
largely reflecting the company's purchase last July of NYLCare, a 
New York area health plan. Total managed care membership increased 
by 22 percent to 13.39 million. Aetna, which acquired Prudential's 
health insurance business this summer, is the nation's largest 
health insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's medical loss ratio, which reflects the percentage  
of premium dollars the insurer spends on health costs, fell 
markedly in treating its Medicare HMO members. Aetna spent 90.4 
cents for each premium dollar on health costs in the second quarter 
of 1999, compared to 94.2 cents in the same period a year ago. The 
ratio is a key indicator of health insurers ability to control 
health costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical loss ratio increased slightly to 82.2 cents from  
81.0 cents on the commercial HMO business. 
</P>
<P>
	Unusual items in the second quarter included a $50.2 million  
after-tax benefit from a reduction of reserves in the company's 
pensions division. The company also earned $24.2 million from the 
sale of its domestic individual life insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended June 30, Aetna had operating earnings  
of $406.6 million or $2.60 per share, compared to $433.2 million or 
$2.13 a share in the year earlier period. Revenues rose 27 percent 
to $11.65 billion from $9.16 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Aetna fell $1.87 1/2 to $83.75 amid a broad decline on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Study Refutes Miscarriage Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A controversial fertility treatment that involves  
injecting women with their partner's white blood cells to prevent 
miscarriage does not work, a new study indicates. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions about the  
treatment, sought by about 12,000 women a year worldwide who have 
had recurring miscarriages. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of the therapy criticized the study by Dr. Carole  
Ober of the University of Chicago, published in Friday's issue of 
The Lancet, a British medical journal, saying the immunizations 
were not done properly. Others praised it as confirming that the 
therapy offers false hope. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea behind the treatment is similar to the theory of why  
people reject transplants. The hypothesis is that mothers normally 
produce an antibody that prevents their immune system from 
rejecting a fetus in pregnancy and that sometimes the antibodies 
are missing, leading to recurrent miscarriages. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents believe that injecting the mother with the white  
blood cells of her partner stimulates her immune system to block 
the attacks against the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the latest study, the largest to date, Ober found that  
miscarriages were actually more common among the women who had the 
injections than among those who had no treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The study involved 171 women who had suffered three or more  
unexplained miscarriages and given birth to no more than one child. 
Eighty-six were injected with the white blood cells of their 
partners, while 85 were given a fake injection. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 31 of the 68 women who became pregnant in the  
treatment group had a baby within the next year, a success rate of 
46 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 41 of the 63 women in the group that had no treatment  
had babies -- a success rate of 65 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only were there more miscarriages in the treatment group,  
but the miscarriages occurred later in pregnancy and many of the 
miscarried fetuses had deformities, Ober said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows there are no embryos to rescue,'' said Ober, a  
professor of human genetics and obstetrics and gynecology. ``If the 
treatment really was helping, we would not be seeing this high rate 
of birth defects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Women with recurring miscarriages should not take this as bad  
news that there is not a treatment for them,'' Ober said. ``In many 
of these couples, there is really nothing wrong with them. They 
just hit a run of bad luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Alan E. Beer, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology  
and immunology at Chicago Medical School and a major proponent of 
the treatment, said he believes Ober's study showed no benefit 
because there was something wrong with the technique -- either the 
cells were not prepared properly before injection or the women were 
not given enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Mowbray, an emeritus professor of immunopathology at  
London's Imperial College of Medicine, agreed. He said that storing 
the father's cells overnight might have been the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does work,'' he said. ``I've seen 5,000 couples with  
repeated miscarriages and have had a very high success rate and 
very low abnormality rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ober says that no technique, regardless of the method, has been  
proven to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Johnson, head of reproductive immunology at the University  
of Liverpool in England, added that there is no evidence that 
immune rejection has anything to do with recurring miscarriages. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason why it has become very popular, particularly in  
private medicine and in the United States, is that it appears to 
offer hope to a lot of women who are putting pressure on their 
doctors ... and there is money to be made from it,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is playing on the expectations and fears of women who have  
been through a very distressing history and they are going to try 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of women who have had recurring miscarriages will  
deliver a child the next time around, regardless of what is done, 
he said, adding that the field needed a ``proper, independent 
study.''

<HEADLINE> Apple, AOL Plan Messaging Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The public tiff over instant messaging on the  
Internet escalated Thursday, with combatants America Online Inc. 
and Microsoft Corp. showing few signs of backing down. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, the nation's largest Internet service, enlisted  
Apple Computer Inc., maker of the popular iMac desktop, to help add 
more users to AOL's Instant Messenger service, the hottest trend 
since e-mail exploded on the scene in the early 1990s. The two 
companies agreed Thursday to work together to let Macintosh users 
more easily zap messages to the 40 million users of AOL's service. 
</P>
<P>
	While AOL already makes its instant messaging service for  
Apple's computers, the agreement refers to future products such as 
pre-loaded AOL software on Mac machines. That would free Mac users 
from having to download software off the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance came a day after Microsoft touted that more than  
700,000 people already are using its own just-launched service. But 
AOL continues to try to electronically block messages from users of 
the MSN service, even as Microsoft attempts to circumvent those 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The back-and-forth skirmishes add fuel to an Internet battle  
that flared last Wednesday when Microsoft, the world's largest 
computer software maker, unmasked a service similar to AOL's 
Instant Messenger, allowing users of its MSN network to instantly 
send messages to AOL subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's service previously hadn't been compatible with other  
systems. But AOL said what really bothered it was that the MSN 
program asks AOL users for user names and passwords, raising 
privacy concerns. AOL has since retaliated with an electronic 
blockade against instant messages from the MSN service, which 
Microsoft is trying to work around. 
</P>
<P>
	By reaching an agreement with Apple, AOL wants to help its  
service continue to grow despite Microsoft's foray. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a way to make sure that AOL stays on top of the  
competition here, and staves off any competitive threats that 
Microsoft may be throwing onto the table,'' said Emily Meehan, an 
analyst with The Yankee Group research firm, based in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	A Microsoft official said the company plans to come out with a  
Mac version of its instant messaging service before the end of the 
year and that Thursday's announcement would not change those plans. 
Microsoft argues that instant messages, like e-mail, should flow 
freely between online services for all to use, just like slower 
electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``This announcement is a smokescreen by AOL to divert attention  
from the real issue to create an industry standard and working 
together with the broad industry to really solve the problem for 
consumers,'' said Robert Bennett, group product manager for MSN 
Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	But some say that contention sounds hypocritical, since  
Microsoft is battling a government antitrust lawsuit that accuses 
it of abusing its computer operating system dominance to shut out 
software rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weakness in that argument is that Microsoft hasn't been  
particularly open about its software,'' said Mark Levitt, an 
analyst with the International Data Corp. research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, AOL says that it supports ``intra-operability''  
between instant messaging systems, but not at the expense of its 
business. AOL claims that Microsoft has ``hacked'' into its network 
to figure out how to make its MSN messaging product compatible with 
AOL's. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Brackbill, an AOL spokeswoman, said the company had formed a  
group to reach out the industry to form standards for enabling 
different message systems to work with each other. The group 
includes AOL chief technology officer Marc Andreessen; Apple CEO 
Steve Jobs; Novell Inc. chief executive Eric Schmidt; and Rob 
Glaser, head of the RealNetworks Inc., which enables Internet users 
to receive video and audio broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that by getting a group together we can really  
jump-start those efforts,'' Brackbill said.

<HEADLINE> American Express Exec Goeltz Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American Express Co. said Thursday its vice  
chairman and chief financial officer, Richard Goeltz, will retire 
from the credit card company. 
</P>
<P>
	Goeltz, 57, joined American Express three years ago from  
National Westminster Bank PLC. He will stay on until a replacement 
is found, and will help screen candidates for his successor. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I will miss his advice and counsel, I understand his  
desire to do other things after a long and successful corporate 
career,'' wrote Harvey Golub, chairman and chief executive of 
American Express, in a letter to employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The news comes just three months after Golub, 60, announced his  
own plans to retire. He named Ken Chenault, one of the top black 
executives in America, as his successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael O'Neill, a spokesman for American Express, said Goeltz's  
departure was ``unrelated'' to the changes in the top suite at the 
credit card company. 
</P>
<P>
	Goeltz was unavailable for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of American Express fell $2.68 3/4 to $138.56 1/4 on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Teen Boards Plane at Boston Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A 17-year-old boy wanting to impress Israeli  
intelligence officials sliced through a fence at Logan 
International Airport and stowed away on a British Airways flight 
to London, The Boston Globe reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The July 12 incident is under investigation by British Airways,  
the Federal Aviation Authority and the Massachusetts Port 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham Derman of Brookline reportedly sliced through razor wire  
before dropping onto the tarmac north of the airport's main 
terminals. 
</P>
<P>
	He then walked across restricted areas, climbed up a jetway and  
boarded Flight 214 bound for London, the newspaper said, citing 
aviation sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy found an empty seat in coach and was discovered only  
after he entered a restricted area at London's Heathrow Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline returned him to Boston, where he told investigators  
the stunt was an attempt to impress Mossad, the Israeli 
intelligence agency, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed. The FAA declined comment to the  
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Port Authority spokesman Jeremy Crockford said officials were  
taking the incident seriously, but stressed it was an 
``aberration.''

<HEADLINE> Detroit's First Casino Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit's first casino opened Thursday in what  
was once an IRS building, bringing $225 million worth of Las 
Vegas-style glamour to the effort to revitalize the city's blighted 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The MGM Grand Detroit Casino is one of three temporary casinos  
planned, the last of which is expected to open by November. Within 
four years, three permanent casinos are to be built on Detroit's 
riverfront. 
</P>
<P>
	People were lined up around the block at midday, long before the  
Art Deco gaming floor opened at 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Before casino gambling, ``there was really no reason to come  
here,'' said Veronica Drakos, a real estate agent waiting to get 
in. ``Hopefully, this will bring people back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The MGM Grand, owned by MGM and local investors, will bring  
2,700 jobs and a projected 10,000 visitors a day. It is near two 
sports stadiums under construction as well as other commercial 
development projects in a downtown area that had slid largely into 
ruin after the 1967 riots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once all three temporary casinos are open, and you combine  
that with all the great restaurants in downtown, the stadiums 
opening up and the project, I think the city is ready to ignite,'' 
MGM Grand Detroit president Lyn Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-story, gold-and-cream building has two floors packed  
with 2,370 slot and video poker machines and 83 gaming tables. The 
casino is decorated to look like a 1930s theater lobby, with milky 
glass chandeliers, gold statues and black and white photos of 
Hollywood stars. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first players inside was Cenus McMillan, a Detroit  
retiree who showed up at the casino at 9:45 a.m. and had to be 
taken inside a little early because of the heat. She immediately 
headed for the 25-cent slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is gorgeous!'' she said. ``I'm so glad they're finally  
opening up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Dennis Archer is counting on the three temporary casinos  
for $50 million of the city's $2.9 billion budget this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, voters authorized casino gambling in Detroit, which has  
been seeking new businesses for decades. Since the late 1950s, 
Detroit has lost nearly half its people in a suburban flight that 
sped up after the riots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of us who came here from the West Coast -- you hear a lot  
of terrible things about Detroit,'' said MGM Grand Inc. chief 
executive J. Terrence Lanni. ``Frankly, my colleagues and I have 
found it to be a much different city than it was reported to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new $285 million stadium for the Detroit Tigers is under  
construction nearby, and land is being cleared for a new $225 
million domed stadium for the Detroit Lions next door. Compuware 
Corp. has plans for a $1.5 billion complex downtown that would add 
7,000 jobs. And General Motors Corp. has promised a billion-dollar 
remodeling of the landmark Renaissance Center and the neighborhood 
around it. 
</P>
<P>
	The temporary casinos are expected to create about 11,000 jobs --  
as many as GM has in the city -- and draw thousands of tourists. 
Analysts say the three casinos should do well in Detroit and 
estimate the market at $1.5 billion a year -- just behind Las Vegas, 
Atlantic City, N.J., and Tunica, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to spend my money in Detroit, where we all live,''  
said Peggy Jennings, who usually travels across the border to 
Canada to gamble. ``Let 'em tax me.''

<HEADLINE> Pols Get Free Devil Rays Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The free tickets to Tampa Bay Devil  
Rays games were supposed to be used as an economic development tool 
or to reward city employees and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, city council members and their families have been using  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The seats, which cost $22 each, run along the first-base line in  
the lower box level, not far from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Council members defended their use of the tickets for family  
outings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sacrifice a lot. My family sacrifices at lot for this job,''  
said council member Jay Lasita, who last season asked the city 
clerk to notify him whenever the city's field-level tickets were 
available. ``I honestly think it's just a way to do things. I don't 
think we've abused it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the Devil Rays' 1 1/2 seasons at taxpayer-financed Tropicana  
Field, many of the seats have been used the way they were intended. 
</P>
<P>
	But field-level tickets for 12 of the 131 home games played in  
the team's brief existence were used by three City Council members, 
their families and friends. No tickets have been used by the city's 
economic development staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``The primary use should be the people in the community,'' said  
council member Frank Peterman, who used city tickets for personal 
reasons last year but has not this season. ``The next purpose is to 
use tickets as the council members see fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No city ordinance governs the use of the tickets or suite. A  
legal opinion held that council members who use the seats for 
themselves, family or friends should declare the tickets' value as 
income. But the city has never deducted withholding taxes from the 
checks of any of the three council members, including Bill Foster, 
who acknowledged personal use of the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Records show that council members occasionally go together to  
host groups in the city's luxury suite. On at least one occasion, 
the entire council attended a game in the city's suite, raising 
questions about compliance with the spirit of Florida's Sunshine 
Law. That law requires discussion of city business between elected 
officials to take place in a public meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone affiliated with the city government can request the  
field-level tickets or use of the suite by filling out a form. 
During two seasons, City Clerk Jane Brown has filled 268 requests, 
including 69 going to neighborhood groups, 51 to volunteers and 
social service groups, 41 to city staff, 19 for youth sports teams 
and 14 for other government groups. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 percent of the requests were from council members.

-- aims to ``deter others who might consider emulating the 
president's misconduct.'' Most of the money, which Clinton's legal 
defense fund can pay, will go to Paula Jones and the attorneys in

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth Slows in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. economic growth slowed abruptly to 2.3  
percent during the second quarter as consumers curtailed exuberant 
spending that had been the major force behind the recent economic 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that the gross domestic  
product, the nation's total output of goods and services, grew by 
$44 billion from April through June to an inflation-adjusted $7.8 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-quarter slowdown came after the economy surprised  
many analysts by growing at a bigger-than-expected 4.3 percent 
annual rate during the first three months of 1999. Economists have 
been predicting that slower growth would calm fears that the 
economy could overheat. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are still out there buying but at a more subdued pace,  
and if this is not just an aberration what it means is we're 
getting what was hoped for,'' said Robert G. Dederick, economic 
consultant with Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	New restraint by consumers, whose purchases account for  
two-thirds of the nation's economic activity and whose spending 
proclivity has helped the United States weather two years of global 
economic crisis, was largely responsible for putting on the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer spending grew by 4 percent from April through June,  
compared with a torrid 6.7 percent during the first three months of 
1999. It was the slowest spending increase since the fourth quarter 
of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	An inflation gauge tied to the GDP showed consumer prices rose  
more quickly during the spring, at an annual rate of 2.1 percent, 
compared to 1.2 percent in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report today, the Labor Department said its  
Employment Cost Index, considered the best measure of changes in 
wages and benefit costs, rose 1.1 percent in the second quarter. 
That's the biggest quarterly increase since 1991, but followed a 
record low 0.4 percent rise during the first three months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest unemployment rate in 29 years has raised fears that  
employers scrambling for workers will have to raise wages, and 
therefore prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Americans filing initial claims for unemployment  
benefits fell last week to the lowest level in two years, the Labor 
Department also reported, indicating the labor market continues to 
tighten. Jobless claims fell 40,000 to 275,000, lowering a 
four-week moving average of claims to 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned that economic growth is too rapid and might spark  
inflation, the Federal Reserve in June raised interest rates by a 
quarter of a point. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan in his midyear 
report to Congress this week said the nation's central bankers have 
not ruled out another rate increase this year if inflation flares. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street investors reacted with trepidation about inflation  
signals in today's economic reports, pulling the Dow Jones average 
of industrial stocks down 130 points within 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts said the numbers should not ring alarm bells,  
since wage and price increases are only moderate after an unusual 
lull. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a sense we're really having what Dr. Greenspan ordered and  
if that's the case I would suggest that he doesn't at least 
immediately need to do anything to help it along,'' Dederick said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the lingering international financial crisis, overseas  
markets for American products have dwindled and a flood of imports 
from troubled countries trying to unload their own goods here at 
discount prices has helped keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there has been some recent improvement in the trade  
picture as foreign economies have begun to recover. The record U.S. 
trade deficit shaved just 0.75 percent off total economic growth in 
the second quarter of 1999, compared to a 2.23 percent offset in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, investment by American businesses -- spending on new  
equipment and plants -- picked up from April through June, growing 
by 10.8 percent, compared to 8.5 percent in the first three months 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising mortgage rates, however, dampened the housing market,  
with spending on new homes and apartments growing by 5.1 percent, 
much slower than the 15.4 percent rate in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though consumers tempered their buying spree in the second  
quarter, they are still spending more than they earn. The personal 
savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable income, fell to 
a record low: negative 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gore Goes to Bush's Backyard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's Spanish may not be quite  
as fluent as that of Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	But just by showing up at the National Council of La Raza on  
Wednesday -- a meeting Bush skipped -- and telling Latinos he intends 
to fight for their issues if he becomes president, Gore seemed to 
score points with listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hit on all the right issues like education and the  
economy,'' said Kathryn Diaz Garcia, a Houston attorney. ``I'm glad 
he showed the respect to show up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wooing a constituency that could have a big role in picking the  
next president in 2000 and mocking Bush's slogan of ``compassionate 
conservatism,'' Gore said Americans shouldn't have to settle for 
``crumbs of compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the annual conference of La Raza, the nation's largest  
Hispanic advocacy group, Gore was warmly applauded by many in the 
crowd of 2,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Though invited, the vacationing Bush did not attend and that  
snub upset some activists who warned that the governor should not 
take the Hispanic vote -- usually Democratic in any event -- for 
granted. Bush drew strong support from Texas Hispanics in his 
reelection as governor, getting about half of their vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore never mentioned Bush by name but underscored some of the  
social problems in Texas and took a glancing swipe at the 
Republican presidential candidate's description of his beliefs as 
``compassionate conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do things the right way,'' he said. ``Not letting  
people fend for themselves or hope for crumbs of compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was in English, but Gore sprinkled phrases and sentences in  
Spanish throughout his address. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly not satisfied when over 10 percent of all  
uninsured children in America live in the state of Texas,'' he 
said, then used a phrase that became a refrain: ``Nuestras familias 
merecen lo mejor (Our families deserve the best).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speech was labeled ``official business'' as opposed to a  
campaign address, and was paid for with public money. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore tailored the administration's argument against the  
Republican tax-cut plan to fit his audience, saying that the tax 
cuts proposed in Washington would endanger Medicare, upon which 
elderly and disabled Hispanics are disproportionately reliant. 
</P>
<P>
	He also focused on education issues, among the most critical for  
the 31 million Hispanics making up America's fastest growing 
minority group. Just 62 percent of Hispanic adults age 25-29 
completed high school compared with 87 percent of blacks and 93 
percent of whites, according to federal figures. 
</P>
<P>
	As well, high school dropout rates are far higher.  
</P>
<P>
	``How can we expect to break down the barriers of opportunity if  
the Hispanic dropout rate remains an unacceptable 75 percent higher 
than that for blacks and whites?'' Gore asked. ``The time for quick 
fixes has passed. Its time for a renewed commitment to our public 
schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not satisfied when even one Latino is left out of our  
prosperity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In introducing Gore, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, the  
highest ranking Hispanic in the Clinton administration, called next 
year's elections ``The most important year in the history of Latino 
political development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Latinos are seeking to turn sheer numbers into political muscle  
that can select mayors, governors and strongly influence the 2000 
presidential election. Gore is seeking the Democratic nomination 
and Bush the Republican one. 
</P>
<P>
	With Hispanics heavily concentrated in key electoral states like  
New York, California, Texas, Florida and Illinois, the Latino 
influence could be huge there, said Carmen Joge, a La Raza policy 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have numbers but it hasn't translated to political power  
just yet,'' Joge said. ``But we recognize that we have to keep 
educating our young people to vote so when they become eligible, 
they know the issues and are ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the number of Hispanic registered voters rose to 5.4  
million in 1996 from 4.2 million in 1992 and has continued to 
surge, over a third of the Hispanic population is under 18. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Gore joked that since his first grandchild was  
born on the Fourth of July earlier this year, a future one might be 
born on Cinco de Mayo, a national Mexican holiday on May 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Examples of the newfound voting clout can be found primarily in  
Western states with the election of California Lt. Gov. Cruz 
Bustamante in November to statewide office and the election of Ken 
Salazar as Colorado's first Latino attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton won 72 percent of Latino voters in 1996 but  
Hispanic leaders say it's important for Latinos not to became 
captive of one party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its great to be on both sides,'' Joge said. ``We know that  
candidates have to talk issues. They can't just talk about their 
party,''

<HEADLINE> Balkan Leaders Discuss the Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Needing Western economic aid  
but skeptical about the strings attached, Balkan leaders gathered 
today to offer their own vision for bringing stability and 
democracy to a region that has known little peace this century. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders will discuss how to shape the future of their  
nations at a meeting today that will be followed by a one-day 
summit of world leaders on Friday in Sarajevo on stabilizing the 
Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and leaders from about 40 nations are expected  
to endorse a ``stability pact'' to promote democracy, disarmament 
and economic recovery throughout southeastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	As Balkan delegations began arriving today, Bosnian authorities  
closed major streets in the capital and ordered residents to stay 
off balconies overlooking major routes to the venue at the Zetra 
sports complex. Heavily armed international peacekeepers stood 
along the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Before departing Bucharest for the meeting, Romanian President  
Emil Constantinescu said today that the summit marked a ``historic 
breakthrough'' because ``it is the first time that the great powers 
are not imposing a solution, but soliciting views of leaders from 
the region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov said he expected the summit  
to yield clear visions for forever integrating the region and 
making it a part of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Western officials saw the meetings as a crucial first step in  
bolstering the region, which had dragged Europe into World War I, 
endured a half-century of communist misrule and exploded into 
violence when Yugoslavia disintegrated in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Alpo Russi, an adviser to Finnish President Marti Ahtissari,  
praised world leaders for not ignoring the troubled region and 
seizing the chance to ``turn the tide of history by helping to 
bring peace, stability and prosperity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The media in most Balkan countries, however, have given little  
attention to the upcoming summit. The Romanian newspaper Curierul 
National headlined its report: ``Western aspirin to Balkan cancer 
patients,'' reflecting widespread skepticism about Western resolve 
to devote years and considerable resources to rebuilding the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Balkan leaders also appeared to have misgivings. Slovenia  
and Croatia were reluctant to commit themselves to any pact that 
might tie their chances of EU membership to the performance of 
poorer candidates, such as Albania and Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Yugoslav republics, especially Croatia, have feared that  
establishing an economic and political bloc in the region would 
threaten their newly won independence from Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovene President Milan Kucan told Clinton that Slovenia was  
ready to help with the Balkan recovery, but shunned the idea of 
being formally linked to other less-developed former Yugoslav 
republics, according to a statement released by officials 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some countries, notably Romania and Bulgaria, have said they are  
primarily interested in getting Western aid to offset trade losses 
that resulted from the 78-day NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, Albania wants help for a massive program to  
rebuild infrastructure as a payment for its support of NATO's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact could prepare the region for a new generation of  
leaders not tainted by the recent Balkan conflicts. Three leaders -- 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, Macedonian President Kiro 
Gligorov and Bosnia's Muslim co-President Alija Izetbegovic -- are 
over 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was not invited to the  
summit, although several Yugoslav opposition figures are expected 
to attend.

<HEADLINE> Meningitis Vaccine Is To Be Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A meningitis vaccine already used in South  
America could eventually become available in the United States and 
Europe under an agreement reached Thursday between SmithKline 
Beecham and Cuban researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline Beecham, a British company with U.S. headquarters in  
Philadelphia, obtained approval from the Clinton administration to 
test the vaccine against meningitis B, one strain of an infection 
of the fluid that envelopes the brain and spinal cord. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine, which was developed in 1989 by Havana's Carlos  
Finlay Institute, has been reported to be 83 percent effective by 
Cuban investigators. Cuba has sold the vaccine in Brazil, Argentina 
and Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Meningitis B is caused by bacteria and is more severe than viral  
meningitis. The disease particularly affects young children and is 
fatal in about one in 10 cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms include a high fever, headache and stiff neck, and can  
be spread by coughing or kissing. Between 1,000 and 2,000 people a 
year contract the disease in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement with the Finlay Institute, SmithKline has  
worldwide rights to market the vaccine outside Cuba. SmithKline 
will pay Finlay for each approval of the vaccine and will make 
royalty payments once sales commence. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement has drawn criticism from Cuban exiles who oppose  
any exceptions to the ban on trade with Cuba's communist 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline spokesman Richard Koenig said it will likely be  
several years before the meningitis B vaccine is available in the 
United States. Testing will take place at a laboratory in Belgium 
owned by SmithKline's U.S. subsidiary. 
</P>

	Atlanta Man Kills 9, Commits Suicide  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- An investor upset over stock trading losses  
opened fire today in two brokerage offices, killing nine people and 
wounding 12 before escaping, then killed himself when stopped by 
police. Earlier, the gunman's wife and two children were found 
beaten to death in their suburban home. Mayor Bill Campbell said 
the gunman, Mark O. Barton, 44, committed suicide after police 
cornered him in a van at a service station. Barton, a chemist, 
walked into a brokerage office, opened fire, then walked across the 
street and began shooting at another brokerage firm there, the 
mayor said. Four of the victims were killed in one building and 
five in the other, shot with 9 mm and .45-caliber handguns, he 
said.

	Clinton To Attend Balkans Summit  
</P>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- President Clinton will  
arrive here Friday for a 40-nation summit to promote a ``stability 
pact'' aimed at bolstering peace in the Balkans. Ahead of the 
summit, the European Union on Thursday offered the nations of the 
region a greater place in the West if they end differences that 
have fueled nearly a decade of ethnic war. Balkan delegations are 
eager for the international aid that comes with the pact but wary 
over some of the strings attached. The United States and its 
European allies also are dangling the carrot of reconstruction and 
development aid to the Balkans for their cooperation promoting 
democracy, human rights and disarmament.

	Hoffa: Union Will Police Itself  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teamsters President James P. Hoffa says the  
union will begin to police itself against organized crime in an 
attempt to end a decade of federal supervision. ``If there are 
vestiges of organized crime, we're going to find them and we're 
going to ferret them out,'' Hoffa said at a news conference today. 
Hoffa won the Teamsters' presidency and was sworn in in March after 
promising to root out corruption and seek an end to federal 
oversight that the union agreed to in 1989 to avoid racketeering 
charges brought by the Justice Department.

	Detroit's First Casino Opens  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit's first casino opened today in what was  
once an IRS building, bringing $225 million worth of Las 
Vegas-style glamour to the effort to revitalize the city's blighted 
downtown. The MGM Grand Detroit Casino is one of three temporary 
casinos planned, the last of which is expected to open by November. 
Within four years, three permanent casinos are to be built on 
Detroit's riverfront. People were lined up around the block at 
midday, long before the gaming floor opened at 4:30 p.m. The MGM 
Grand will bring 2,700 jobs and a projected 10,000 visitors a day.

	FTC Wants Online Pharmacies Watched  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission wants Congress to  
make Internet pharmacies to disclose information about the 
businesses selling the drugs and the doctors prescribing them 
online. Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer 
Protection was to testify tomorrow before the House Commerce 
subcommittee on oversight and investigations about the need for new 
laws covering Internet pharmacies. As consumers increasingly enjoy 
the convenience of buying medicine over the Internet, authorities 
have been frustrated in their attempts to enforce laws because many 
Web sites do contain adequate identifying information, according to 
the FTC.

	Study Refutes Miscarriage Treatment

	LONDON (AP) -- A controversial fertility treatment that involves  
injecting women with their partner's white blood cells to prevent 
miscarriage does not work, a new study indicates. Previous studies 
have reached conflicting conclusions about the treatment, sought by 
about 12,000 women a year worldwide who have had recurring 
miscarriages. Proponents of the therapy criticized the study, 
saying the immunizations were not done properly. Others praised it 
as confirming that the therapy offers false hope.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thirteen National League umpires lost their jobs  
today, bringing to nearly one-third the number of major league umps 
who will depart Sept. 2. Crew chiefs Frank Pulli and Terry Tata, 
who have each spent more than 25 years in the major leagues and 
worked four World Series apiece, will be forced to leave, 
management officials said. On July 14, most umpires resigned 
effective Sept. 2, thinking the tactic would force an early start 
to negotiations for a new labor contract. But the move backfired 
and baseball hired 25 replacements from Triple-A, effective Sept. 
1.

<HEADLINE> Online Cos. Join Parental Web Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a new and unusually broad Internet campaign  
urging parents to ``get Net wise,'' some of the Web's most popular 
sites will begin offering suggestions and information about 
software tools to keep children safe online. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers promised that the information -- including ways to  
help kids avoid pornography and explicit sites about drugs or 
alcohol -- will never be more than a mouse-click away because of the 
participation of the Web's largest sites, including those run by 
Yahoo!, America Online, Lycos Inc., The Walt Disney Co. and 
Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies in the campaign claimed that almost 95 percent of the  
Internet's traffic flows through their sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably going to be as ubiquitous as anything on the  
Internet,'' said Rick White, a former Republican congressman from 
Washington and co-founder of the Congressional Internet Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	The project's $1 million Web site, www.getnetwise.org, was  
unveiled today in Washington at a news conference with Vice 
President Al Gore and Commerce Secretary William Daley, along with 
industry executives. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is so much out there that's good on the Internet, it  
would be a pity for a parent to tell a child not to go on the 
Internet because they were afraid,'' said David Baker, a vice 
president at MindSpring Enterprises Inc., one of the largest 
Internet providers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The project's Web site includes details about more than 80  
commercial software programs parents can use to block Web sites 
inappropriate for children and monitor the time kids spend online. 
It also includes collections of recommended sites safe for children 
of different ages. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some companies that design Internet filtering software  
helped pay for the site, details are listed about all such 
technology tools. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not substituting for parents, but we're giving parents a  
leg up,'' said Jerry Berman, president of the Washington-based 
Internet Education Foundation and one of the project's principle 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Allen, chief executive officer for the National Center for  
Missing and Exploited Children, said organizers sought to design 
the Web site for parents anxious about what children might find 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an incredible resource, but it's scary,'' Allen said.  
``Your kids know more about it than you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Participation in the campaign was so broad that it brought  
together otherwise bitter rivals: Microsoft and AOL -- currently 
feuding over software that lets consumers send electronic ``instant 
messages'' -- as well as AT&AMP;T and the nation's Internet providers, 
who are in an angry fight over the future of high-speed Web access 
over cable-television lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Although hundreds of Web sites will simply offer parents a link  
to www.getnetwise.org, others will recompile the information and 
present it themselves. That's partly a concession to 
ultra-competitive high-tech companies, which struggle to keep 
consumers from spending time at Web sites not under their control. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, the world's largest Internet provider with more  
than 17 million customers, said it will offer the information 
within its ``parental controls'' section, one of the first areas a 
parent sees when signing onto AOL. It also will include a link on 
its popular AOL.com Web site.

<HEADLINE> 2 Still Missing in Canyoning Mishap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INTERLAKEN, Switzerland (AP) -- Using dogs and underwater  
cameras, rescuers searched today for two people missing after a 
flash flood smashed into a group of adventure tourists two days ago 
in an Alpine river, killing at least 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, criticism grew that organizers should have known of  
the flood dangers before taking out the group of 45 young people 
for a day of ``canyoning'' -- an adrenaline-pumping sport in which 
participants bodysurf though rapids and down waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	``This accident shouldn't have happened,'' local fire brigade  
chief Robert Seematter said. He told the Swiss newspaper Blick that 
authorities had given clear warnings of the risk of a sudden storm 
and flood Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	One local man, Martin Seematter, told Blick he had stopped  
another group of young people heading to the Saxeten brook, 
pointing out the dangers of the gathering storm clouds. 
</P>
<P>
	It only took a 15-minute downpour higher up in the mountains  
Tuesday to send a wall of water down the brook, carrying trees and 
boulders along the way before it slammed without warning into the 
tour group as the adventurers rode the rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, experts and police searched the waterway, walking  
upstream along its half-mile stretch and looking under boulders for 
the missing bodies, police said. Dogs searched the nearby forests 
in case any of the missing made it out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Downstream, canoes scoured the river into which the brook flows,  
and underwater cameras were used to search Lake Brienz, into which 
the river empties. Most of the dead were found floating in the 
lake, near the popular tourist resort of Interlaken. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss authorities said 14 Australians were among the dead and  
missing. The other victims were from New Zealand, Britain, South 
Africa and Switzerland. The tour group included Americans and 
Canadians, but none was killed or missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss officials said so far just two of the victims had been  
formally identified -- a 20-year-old Swiss woman and a British man 
working for Adventure World, the tour group that organized the 
trip. Names would be posted on the Swiss police Web site after 
notification of next of kin, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prof. Ulrich Zollinger, a forensic expert, said identification  
would likely be difficult as nobody had worn jewelry or personal 
effects and all authorities had to go by was their swimsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	In Australia, relatives were reeling from the sudden loss of  
their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please pray for my family,'' read a note on the closed door of  
the Morrow family's shop in Victoria state. Their daughter, Kylie 
Morrow, was one of the two missing and was presumed dead. She would 
have celebrated her 21st birthday Wednesday and was to marry in 
April, The Australian Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just lost. I'm in a void,'' said Paul Smith from the city  
of Adelaide after losing his 19-year-old daughter Briana. 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsies on ten of the victims all showed they drowned, but  
most had severe facial bruising and head injuries from the rocks 
and trees in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their protective helmets and rubber shoes were all missing,  
which showed the incredible force of the flood,'' forensic expert 
Zollinger told a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	There was speculation that trees felled by winter avalanches  
were swept into the water by the torrential rain and formed a dam, 
which subsequently broke. One of the survivors told her parents 
that she had the impression a dam had burst. 
</P>
<P>
	Interlaken-based Adventure World is well known for its extreme  
sports activities, such as bungee jumping and glacier climbing. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss tourist officials said most adventure tour organizers were  
suspending canyoning trips until the cause of the disaster was 
established. But they said they did not expect lasting damage to 
the vital tourist industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Extreme sports have brought a new breed of tourists to  
Switzerland in recent years -- younger and more willing to rough it 
than the traditional middle-aged visitors. An estimated 10,000 
people take part in canyoning in the Interlaken area each year.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Senator Urges Bus Seat Belts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A day after escaping serious injury in a  
bus-car collision that killed three people, retired U.S. Sen. Mark 
Hatfield said Thursday he will push for legislation to require seat 
belts on buses. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield and his wife, Antoinette, suffered minor injuries  
Wednesday after a car swerved into the path of the bus carrying 
them and 25 other people to a dinner in Astoria. All three people 
in the car were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus, which does not have seat belts, fell on its side.  
Hatfield said he hit the seat on the other side of the aisle, and 
then when the bus landed in a ditch ``we found ourselves bouncing 
around again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing to hang on to,'' Mrs. Hatfield said. ``There  
was no way I could brace myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five bus passengers, including the Hatfields, were treated at a  
hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield, a Republican who retired in 1997 after 30 years in the  
Senate, said he will try to use his influence to push for 
legislation requiring seat belts on buses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll talk to some friends in the Legislature and maybe we can  
start at the state level,'' he said. ``We're not going to take time 
to do a study.''

<HEADLINE> Bipartisan Tax-Cut Effort Fizzles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Efforts to craft a $500 billion bipartisan tax  
cut fizzled unceremoniously in the Senate on Thursday as political 
lines hardened and President Clinton reinforced his threat to veto 
a larger Republican tax relief package. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe America wants to be governed from the center, and  
America needs to be governed from the center,'' Sen. Arlen Specter, 
R-Pa., said of the bipartisan proposal, which roughly split the 
difference between the GOP's $792 billion tax cut and a smaller 
$290 billion version advanced by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. John Breaux, D-La., a leading architect of the  
proposal, conceded, ``Neither party at this time is supportive.'' 
After more than an hour of debate, Breaux withdrew the measure 
without so much as a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments came as the Senate marched methodically toward  
approval of the GOP-crafted bill, with tax breaks for individuals, 
families, education, retirement accounts and numerous other 
provisions. A final vote was set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	House-Senate talks are expected to begin this weekend, and GOP  
leaders harbor hopes of passing the resulting compromise through 
both houses next week. That would enable Republicans to spend 
Congress' August break touting the virtue of their measure, and set 
the stage for a fall confrontation with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Before boarding Air Force One for a flight to Europe, Clinton  
renewed his threat to veto the bill, saying it was too large and 
``risky'' for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's wrong with the American people sharing the surplus?  
After all, it belongs to them,'' rebutted Sen. Frank Murkowski, 
R-Alaska. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who shepherded a 
companion bill to passage last week, added, ``I don't think it's 
risky to have faith in the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's threatened veto, coupled with the Senate's arcane  
rules, turned the lengthy debate on the Senate floor into political 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, maneuvering for advantage, called for reducing the  
GOP tax measure to provide room for a new prescription drug benefit 
for Medicare recipients. But the vote came on a parliamentary 
motion rather than on any specific proposal to provide prescription 
drug benefits to the nation's elderly. And it gained the support of 
only 45 senators -- all but one of them Democrats -- far below the 60 
votes it needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This debate is about priorities. New tax breaks are a priority  
for the Republicans,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. 
``Prescription drugs for senior citizens are not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., countered that as chairman of the  
committee with jurisdiction over Medicare, the Senate Finance 
Committee, he intended to address ``this most important concern'' 
as soon as lawmakers return to Washington from their scheduled 
August break. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., sharply rebutted Democratic claims  
that the GOP tax bill wouldn't leave room for a new Medicare 
benefit. Instead, he sought to turn the political tables. 
</P>
<P>
	A veto by Clinton, he said, would wipe out provisions to make  
education more affordable and child care more accessible. ``Where 
does he get off running around the land saying he's for education 
and we're not?'' Domenici said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and other Republicans  
sought to substitute an across-the-board tax cut similar to the 
House measure for a portion of the bill pending in the Senate. That 
proposal, too, was rejected on a parliamentary motion after 
politically tinged debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats argued the change would make the measure more  
favorable to the wealthy at the expense of lower-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gramm said 50 percent of Americans pay only 4.3 percent of  
income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't get a tax cut because they don't pay income  
taxes,'' he said. ``Tax cuts are for taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each side also labored to show its backing for popular programs  
for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans pushed a ``lockbox'' amendment that they said would  
set aside surpluses generated by payroll tax revenue for Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered with a similar proposal that would have  
offered protection to Medicare, as well as Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Both approaches were rejected.  
</P>
<P>
	As written, the GOP proposal called for reducing the 15 percent  
income tax rate to 14 percent, effective in 2001. Beginning in 
2005, the new 14 percent tax rate would apply to some income that 
is now taxed at 28 percent. Together, those provisions account for 
nearly $300 billion of the $792 billion measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also includes relief from the so-called marriage  
penalty that forces some couples to pay more in taxes than they 
would if they were single. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also contains several provisions to assist taxpayers  
with retirement accounts, to provide tax breaks for education and 
long-term health care, and to reduce estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the doomed bipartisan proposal would have increased  
the standard deduction by $4,300 for joint tax filers, $2,150 for 
heads of households and $1,300 for single filers. Supporters said 
that change would have eliminated the marriage penalty for many 
taxpayers and simplified tax filing for millions of Americans.

<HEADLINE> No Case Built in Nailon Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOREST HILL, Texas (AP) -- Former Texas Christian basketball star  
Lee Nailon, arrested Saturday night on suspicion of drug possession 
and evading arrest, will not face criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Nailon, TCU running back LaDainian Tomlinson and a third man  
were arrested outside a Comfort Inn last weekend after officers 
smelled a strong odor of marijuana coming from one of the rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the three escaped through a back window of the  
motel, but were caught seconds later in the parking lot. Inside the 
vacant room, police said they found about 2 ounces of marijuana and 
hollowed-out cigars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't affirmatively tie any of the drugs to any of  
them,'' Police Chief Sam Hill said Wednesday. ``We had too many 
conflicting stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officers had come to the motel to investigate an unrelated armed  
robbery. Hill said officers were delayed in getting into the room, 
and that by the time they were given a pass key, it was empty. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the narcotics, there was nobody in the room when we  
got in there and nobody would claim it,'' Hill said. ``It would be 
futile to try and put it on anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nailon, a second-round draft pick of the Charlotte Hornets,  
couldn't be reached for comment. A Hornets spokeswoman said the 
team had no statement on the dropped case. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlinson said he felt ``a whole bunch of relief'' after the  
case was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had also been considering charges of evading  
arrest, but Hill said the case would not hold up in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Nailon was TCU's first basketball player to have two 700-point  
seasons. The standout forward led the nation in scoring two seasons 
ago.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Loses Again in Pan Am Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- World champion Cuba's expected dash to  
the baseball gold medal at the Pan American Games keeps bogging 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	One day after losing to the United States, the Cubans looked  
listless in an 8-1 loss to Canada on Thursday. Suddenly, the pride 
of the island nation has as many losses (2) as victories in these 
games, which the Cubans were supposed to dominate. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Canada beat Cuba in baseball was at the  
Intercontinental Cup in Edmonton in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``They looked like they didn't want to be here,'' said catcher  
Andy Stewart, who had three hits. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't count the talented, experienced Cubans out yet. They  
still made it to the quarterfinals and they can still win the gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cubans are a good team,'' cautioned Canadian manager Ernie  
Whitt. ``Don't let this victory fool you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada (4-0), which also beat the United States, won its pool  
and plays Guatemala in Saturday's quarterfinals. The Americans, 
also assured of making the quarterfinals, completed pool play 
against Brazil later Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two teams that make the gold medal game qualify for the  
Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canada-Cuba game was played against a backdrop of Cuban  
charges that its athletes were being encouraged by the Winnipeg 
media and others to defect, and tempers flared after a collision at 
home plate in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Aaron Guiel flattened Cuban catcher Ariel Pestano for  
the second time in the game and was ejected. Guiel made no attempt 
to slide and appeared to deliver a forearm shiver to Pestano. 
</P>
<P>
	Players from both teams converged at home plate, but Guiel and  
Pestano were separated and no punches were thrown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was angry,'' Guiel said. ``I decided I was going to try and  
take a guy out on the infield or the catcher. I had to show them we 
would stand up for ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the game was being played, Pan Ams officials announced they  
were cracking down on attempts to persuade Cuban athletes to 
defect. Security will be beefed up and some Cuban athletes will be 
moved to make them less accessible to agents who try to make their 
pitches from outside the fenced athletes villages, games president 
Don MacKenzie said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have all hours of the evening continually drove up and  
down the adjacent road, they have shone flashlights until 2 or 3 
o'clock in the evening into their windows to get their attention,'' 
MacKenzie said. ``The society is clamping down on security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, Cuba backed off on some of its harsh criticism of  
the environment at the games, during which four Cubans have sought 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want to poke the fire, but we want to express our  
viewpoints clearly and frankly,'' said Jose Fernandez, a 
high-ranking Cuban Olympic official and vice president of the 
country's council of ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	The world champion U.S. women's softball team was unchallenged  
by Colombia as Danielle Henderson threw a perfect game, striking 
out 16 in seven innings. Lisa Fernandez went 3-for-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans got gold and bronze in 3-meter springboard diving as  
Mark Ruiz came from third place on his last dive. Trailing by 13 
points, Ruiz executed a reverse 3 1/2-somersault with a half-twist 
from the tuck position to edge defending champion Fernando Platas 
of Mexico. American Troy Dumais took the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had a big dive in me,'' Ruiz said. ``I knew I could  
hit it. When I came off the board, I knew this was it. That put 
pressure on Fernando and he didn't hit it as well as he usually 
does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon sensation Alexandra Stevenson won her Pan Ams debut  
6-2, 6-0 over Miriam D'Agostini of Brazil. Teammate Lilia Osterloh 
advanced to the second round with a straight set victory over 
Cuba's Yoanny Montesnio. 
</P>
<P>
	The four players and two coaches ejected from Wednesday's  
Guatemala-Canada soccer match all received suspensions Thursday. 
Guatemalan coach Walter Clavieri and three players were suspended 
for the remainder of the games. Another Guatemalan player and 
Canadian coach Bruce Twamley each got one-game suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	The soccer disciplinary committee said the three players  
suspended for the rest of the competition punched or kicked referee 
Richard Grady. Police had to rush in to protect Grady when other 
Guatemalan players threatened him. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's 50-kilometer race walk took 5 1/2 hours to determine the  
medalists -- four hours for the race and another 90 minutes to sort 
things out. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's Joel Sanchez and Carlos Mercenario finished 1-2, though  
Mercenario at first was disqualified because officials claimed he 
was given assistance along the course. The Mexicans appealed and 
the disqualification was overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four of the seven walkers, including fourth-place Gary  
Morgan of the United States, finished the race in oppressive heat. 
Two dropped out and one was disqualified.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Sign Spellman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Alonzo Spellman lost his football  
career because he was having trouble handling his life. Now that 
he's got that under control, the Dallas Cowboys are bringing him 
back to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Spellman, who missed last season following a summer filled with  
bizarre behavior, signed a one-year contract Thursday for the 
veteran minimum of $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no signing bonus, but the defensive end can make  
another $450,000 in incentives based on playing time and number of 
sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in the prime of his career,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones  
said. ``If he has success for us, he can play a lot of years. 
That's part of the upside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spellman was a first-round pick by the Chicago Bears in 1992 and  
an anchor on their defensive line for several seasons before being 
limited by injuries in 1997. Then, from March to September 1998, he 
lost his job and his marriage as he struggled to control a mental 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Spellman suffers from bipolar disorder, a condition that is  
treatable by medication but can lead to manic behavior if he 
doesn't take his pills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys have been talking to Spellman since October. Jones  
said the team conducted an extensive background check and he 
personally did a lot of research before deciding to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident this will work,'' Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
	Spellman arrived in camp Thursday afternoon and was in a team  
meeting when Jones spoke to the media a few hours later. He was not 
available for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alonzo is very enthusiastic about the ability to play football  
again,'' said his agent, Leigh Steinberg. ``Dallas has been 
evaluating Alonzo for many, many weeks now. He has made great 
progress in his battle against emotional illness and they're 
satisfied he can be a productive player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones insisted he's not reneging on his policy of avoiding  
at-risk players, which was among the reasons why the Cowboys didn't 
draft Randy Moss last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said consultant Calvin Hill and staff are prepared to give  
Spellman whatever off-field help he may need. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill said Spellman may become an example of how to beat mental  
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a vital young man who can excite people on the field  
and he can be an important person for other people off the field,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones also denied that Spellman was brought in to fill a need,  
even though the Cowboys' best defensive lineman, Leon Lett, is 
suspended indefinitely and their top three ends are very 
inexperienced. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a question of going out and plugging in a free agent  
to help us fill a need,'' Jones said. ``It's an opportunity to get 
a top player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 292-pound Spellman left Ohio State after his  
junior year and was taken 22nd overall by the Bears. He made 32 
sacks in six seasons in Chicago with a high of 8 1/2 in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alonzo is very, very gifted physically, and when he wasn't in  
the bout of illness and depression, he's totally classy,'' 
Steinberg said. ``That's what was so sad about the way his behavior 
completely degenerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spellman was hospitalized following the incident at his  
publicist's house, but the next day he walked out of the building 
and into freezing weather without wearing a shirt or shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next six months, Spellman's problems included:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Detroit police using pepper spray to subdue him from attacking  
hotel security guards who were trying to break up a fight between 
two women who were with him. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Bears releasing him two years into a four-year, $11.6  
million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Getting pulled over for erratic driving, which led to his  
arrest for having a semiautomatic handgun in his car, a bullet in 
the gun case and a half-empty wine bottle. He was also driving with 
a revoked license. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Getting evicted from his home.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Police awakening him from a nap in his car in the fast lane on  
an interstate highway. Officers said that when they woke him, he 
didn't seem to know where he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Remnants of that ruinous period remain. He faces an Aug. 19  
court date in Michigan for a felony charge of carrying a concealed 
weapon and misdemeanor charges for having open alcohol in a vehicle 
and driving without a license. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison on the weapon  
charge and up to 90 days in jail on the misdemeanor charges.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Caught in Flap Over Flag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The flag is gone, but the flap is likely far  
from over. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arkansas state flag was lowered from atop City Hall in  
downtown New York City on Wednesday afternoon. It's presence had 
raised questions about racial insensitivity, the limits of power 
and the line between politics and city business. 
</P>
<P>
	The flap was unfurled Tuesday when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani  
traveled to Little Rock, Ark., to play up potential rival Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's vulnerability as a carpetbagger and to collect 
some campaign cash; neither has officially announced their U.S. 
Senate candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said he was so moved by the hospitality of a private  
hotel that was flying New York City's flag that he promised the 
Arkansas banner would be flown at City Hall. So up it went. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including former Mayor Ed Koch, called it an abuse of  
power. Others said the move was insulting to blacks because the 
flag bears a star commemorating the state's membership in the 
Confederacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani dismissed criticism as ``partisan Democratic  
politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, a Democrat, ordered the flag  
immediately taken down, citing a law he said gave the council the 
final word on City Hall flags. The mayor, citing the same law, 
ignored him. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani's move also generated criticism from the White House.  
Spokesman Joe Lockhart called the mayor's southern trip ``a little 
goofy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to see how traveling to ... Arkansas helps create  
jobs in New York, helps people who have health-care concerns, helps 
people who need a patient's bill of rights,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani responded: ``What's the White House doing commenting on  
this unless they are running somebody's campaign from the White 
House?''

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Y2K Expert Predicts Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer failures related to the Year 2000  
technology problem could extend well beyond New Year's Day, 
President Clinton's top Y2K expert said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although John Koskinen predicted a national ``sigh of relief''  
in the early hours of Jan. 1, he also anticipates scattered 
electronic failures over the first days, weeks and even months of 
the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000  
Conversion, said in an interview with The Associated Press that 
some failures may not become obvious until the end of January, the 
first time after the date rollover that consumers review their 
monthly bank statements, credit-card bills and other financial 
paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't evaporate until after that,'' Koskinen said.  
``Clearly, this is more than a January 1 problem.'' But he also 
slightly hedged his predictions: ``None of us are really going to 
know until after January 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unless repaired, some computers originally programmed to  
recognize only the last two digits of a year will not work properly 
beginning in 2000, when those machines will assume it is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Some computer systems may shut down quickly with obvious  
failures, and others may gradually experience subtle problems or 
degraded performance that may take weeks to notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more difficult problem will be where the system looks like  
it's doing it correctly but it's doing it all wrong,'' Koskinen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some failures won't be recognized until the work week starts  
Jan. 3, as employees return to their offices and turn on their 
computers for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Repaired computers also will need to recognize 2000 as a leap  
year, even though most years ending in ``00'' don't need to adjust 
for Feb. 29, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A new $40 million Information Coordination Center being  
organized down the street from the White House will operate until 
March, sharing information about failures with states, federal 
agencies, corporations and foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen urged people to prepare for possible trouble as they  
might for a winter storm or a hurricane: Buy flashlights and 
batteries, keep enough cash, food and water for several days and 
make copies of financial and medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also cautioned against stockpiling supplies, which could  
lead to local shortages, or draining bank accounts, which could 
strain the nation's financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get a couple hundred million Americans doing anything  
differently, we're going to create economic problems,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An AP poll this month found most Americans don't expect major  
problems, but nearly one-third plan to stock up on food, water and 
other supplies. About one-quarter of Americans planned to withdraw 
cash in case of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen predicted the most widespread problems will occur in  
developing nations that were slow to begin repair work. He named 
certain regions that recently suffered financial problems, 
including Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Russia. But he 
acknowledged that parts of Africa, Central America, South America 
and the Caribbean also were likely to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, some of the developing countries of the world are  
going to have some difficulties,'' he said, adding that only 25 to 
30 of the world's nations were well prepared. ``Many more countries 
are going to have problems than not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department will begin issuing travel advisories in  
September for U.S. citizens about which countries to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen also disclosed that the U.S. government will consider  
evacuating American citizens from countries with widespread 
failures. He said each U.S. ambassador will make that decision.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Dive; Dow Loses 180.78 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Thursday as a government  
report signaled that wages are rising faster than expected in a 
tight labor market, heightening inflation jitters and setting the 
stage for a possible increase in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 180.78 points to close at  
10,791.29, a loss of 1.6 percent. The index managed a modest 
rebound late in the session, recovering from a loss of as much as 
258.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Thursday's selloff, the biggest point drop since a  
191.55-point fall on July 20, the Dow still is up 17.5 percent so 
far this year, well above analysts' expectations when 1999 began. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also tumbled. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 24.37 to 1,341.03, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 65.83 
to 2,640.01. Technology and drug companies led the decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were battered Thursday after the Labor Department said  
its Employment Cost Index, considered the best measure of changes 
in wages and benefit costs, rose 1.1 percent in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the steepest rise in the eight years of the current  
economy's expansion, the longest peacetime growth in U.S. history. 
The bigger-than-expected jump followed a record low 0.4 percent 
increase during the first three months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest unemployment rate in 29 years has raised fears that  
employers scrambling for workers will have to raise wages, and 
therefore prices. Economists expect the Federal Reserve to use the 
data as evidence that it should raise interest rates again in an 
effort to stave off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed imposed one small interest-rate increase in June, and in  
the past week, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has indicated his 
willingness to raise rates again if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ECI really played into the biggest question on Wall  
Street: Will he or won't he?'' said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst 
at Prudential Securities. ``Every number that might convince the 
Fed to tighten rates is viewed as very dangerous to stocks and 
bonds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices fell steeply, pushing yields on 30-year Treasury  
bonds up to 6.07 percent from 6.00 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately Thursday, the Commerce Department's report on the  
gross domestic product showed the U.S. economy grew at a 
slower-than-expected pace in the second quarter. But investors 
chose to focus primarily on the employment cost index, which 
Greenspan had indicated he would monitor closely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any pleasure the Fed took from the GDP report was more than  
offset,'' by the wage report, said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist 
at Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of higher interest rates hit financial stocks  
hardest. J.P. Morgan, down 3 3/8 at 130 5/8, was the steepest decliner in 
the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares were mostly lower. Those stocks, which are  
often highly valued, become less appealing when interest rates are 
high and corporate profits may be hurt. IBM fell 3 to 215 3/8, and 
Microsoft dropped 3 to 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks were weaker across the board, led by Glaxo Wellcome,  
which said it will miss its 1999 target of double-digit earnings 
growth. Glaxo shares fell 4 1/8 to 51 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management tumbled 5 1/2 to 25 15/16 after saying its  
second-quarter earnings will miss estimates. The company's 
financial chief resigned, and Waste Management said all previous 
guidance on future earnings should be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's losses would have been much steeper without 3M and  
Procter &AMP; Gamble, which rose after posting strong earnings reports. 
Shares of 3M rose 1 11/16 to 90 13/16, and Procter &AMP; Gamble gained 
2 to 88 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-4 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 903.57 
million shares, compared with 837.78 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 9.59 to 630.81, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 5.01 to 784.59. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.09 to 441.58. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.65 percent.  
European indexes were sharply lower. Germany's DAX index lost 3.4 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 2.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 
fell 2.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> NASA Craft Comes Close to Asteroid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Roaring through space at 35,000 mph, a NASA  
spacecraft flew within 15 miles of an asteroid, the closest one has 
ever come to a solar system object without landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Space 1's flyby of the Asteroid Braille late Wednesday  
successfully capped a mission to prove the worthiness of new 
technology for future probes, according to initial results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our preliminary indication is that the encounter went  
extremely well,'' said Marc Rayman, the mission's deputy manager at 
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. ``With reasonable 
confidence we can say the distance was less than 15 miles, perhaps 
much less than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A computer aboard the barrel-shaped probe used star positions  
and images it took of the target to guide its approach. Normally, 
controllers on the ground send navigation commands to spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Images of the asteroid and science data were not expected to be  
available until late today or Friday, Rayman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The flyby more than 117 million miles from Earth comes near the  
end of Deep Space 1's primary mission that tested a dozen new 
technologies for future spacecraft. It is the first probe of NASA's 
New Millennium Program. 
</P>
<P>
	``No science mission could rely on using the technologies until  
they've been shown to work in space,'' Rayman said. ``Deep Space 1 
took the risk so other missions wouldn't have to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers hope instruments on the 1,071-pound spacecraft will  
reveal the asteroid's mass, density, makeup and whether it's a 
mile-diameter rock or a pile of rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The $152 million mission was launched Oct. 24.  
</P>
<P>
	Among the technologies tested was an engine that powered the  
spacecraft by sending out a stream of high-speed particles known as 
ions. Conventional probes typically burn fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ion engines are preferable t because they deliver 10 times more  
thrust than a conventional engine for a given amount of fuel. That 
means spacecraft can be smaller, lighter and less expensive to 
launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Space 1 also was given a mind of its own so it could find  
its way through space without much help from ground controllers. 
The asteroid flyby was the final test of the Autonomous Navigation 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It only seems appropriate that one of the last events of the  
(primary) mission turns out to be one of the most exciting,'' 
Rayman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Space 1 will remain functional when the prime mission ends  
Sept. 18 and, if an extended mission is funded, could fly by two 
comets in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Show New Stem Cell Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have shown that master cells from  
rodent embryos can be used to repair nerves in the spinal cord and 
brain, a step toward new treatment for nerve disorders such as 
Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	In laboratory studies, researchers guided the evolution of  
embryonic stem cells from mice into mature nerve cells that were 
transplanted into rats where they produced a nerve insulating 
material that the rats lacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have shown that you can make olgiodendrocytes and  
astrocytes (two types of nerve cells) from embryonic stem cells'', 
said Dr. Ronald D.G. McKay, a molecular biologist at the National 
Institutes of Health. ``This approach could be used for a number of 
diseases,'' including Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	McKay is a co-author of a study appearing Friday in the journal  
Science. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, the olgiodendrocytes and astrocytes grown from  
stem cells were put into rats with a genetic disease that blocks 
formation of the nerve insulating material called myelin. The rats' 
disorder is the rodent equivalent of a human myelin disorder called 
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found that the transplanted cells caused myelin  
to grow around the nerve fibers in the rats. McKay said that by 
starting with mouse embryonic stem cells, researchers had a 
biological marker that enabled them to prove that the new myelin 
growth in the rats originated from the transplanted mouse cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of myelin is a key part of several neurological  
diseases, particular multiple sclerosis. In MS, the body attacks 
and destroys myelin, causing a crippling loss of nerve function. 
</P>
<P>
	``A considerable amount of science has to be generated before it  
can be used in humans with multiple sclerosis, but this holds great 
promise,'' said Dr. Ian D. Duncan of the University of Wisconsin, a 
co-author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Reingold, a vice president for science at the National  
Multiple Sclerosis Society, said the study is ``intriguing and 
exciting'' because it showed stem cells could be used to grow new 
myelin. But he cautioned that the myelin disorder in the rats is 
different from multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to keep the perspective that these are not human cells  
they are playing with,'' Reingold said. ``One can hope that a 
similar (technique) will be applicable to human stem cells'', but 
that has yet to be proved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reingold also said that even though the researchers showed that  
the transplanted cells grew new myelin, it is not clear if this 
improved the function of the nerves themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	McKay said the most important element of the study is that it  
advances the fundamental understanding of how to cause embryonic 
stem cells to mature into specific types of cells that may then be 
useful in treating patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have shown that you can take embryonic stem cells and make  
them brain stem cells and that it is really quite simple,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Embryonic stem cells arise early after conception and are the  
ancestral cells for all of the body's tissue, such as muscle, bone, 
nerves, skin and blood. Experts believe if researchers can learn 
how to direct stem cells to make specific types of cells then it 
may be possible to replace diseased tissue with new growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new study, McKay and his colleagues demonstrated they can  
direct the stem cells to grow specific types of nerve cells and 
that these cells, in turn, will grow new nerve tissue when they are 
transplanted into rats.

	``This is the first study showing that embryonic stem cells can  
be used for brain and spinal cord repair in an animal model of a 
human neurological disease,'' Dr. Oliver Brustle, a University of 
Bonn researcher and first author of the paper, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next trick,'' said Duncan, ``will be to get human  
embryonic stem cells to do the same thing. If they do, then 
potentially those cells could be use for grafting into patients 
with myelin disease'' such as MS. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of human embryonic stem cells remains an unresolved  
ethical controversy. For now, federal funding of human embryo 
research is forbidden by law. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately funded researchers have grown a cell line that  
originated from human embryos and have made such cells and have 
made them available to other researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Harold Varmus, head of the National Institutes of Health,  
has announced that he believes these cells can be used in federal 
research. Varmus has been supported by the Clinton Administration, 
but many in Congress oppose human embryo research.

<HEADLINE>  Atlanta Gunman Kills Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- An investor upset over stock trading losses  
opened fire Thursday in two brokerage offices, killing nine people 
and wounding 12 before escaping, then killed himself when stopped 
by police. Earlier, the gunman's wife and two children were found 
beaten to death in their suburban home. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Bill Campbell said the gunman, Mark O. Barton, 44,  
committed suicide after police cornered him in a dark green van at 
a service station in Atlanta's northern suburbs about five hours 
after the office shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pulled over, and then killed himself,'' Campbell said.  
</P>
<P>
	Two weapons were found at the scene and notes were found with  
the family members' bodies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest in a grim wave of mass shootings at schools  
and workplaces and was among the worst office massacres ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said several witnesses at the office buildings  
recognized the gunman as Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	Roadblocks went up after the 3 p.m. shootings, and SWAT teams  
fanned through the complex of offices searching for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrible tragedy for our city,'' Campbell said. ``Our  
prayers go out to the victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, a chemist, walked into a brokerage office at Securities  
Center in the upscale Buckhead section north of downtown Atlanta 
about 3 p.m., opened fire, then walked across the street and began 
shooting at another brokerage firm there, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the victims were killed in one building and five in the  
other, shot with 9 mm and .45-caliber handguns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the injured were in critical condition at Atlanta  
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	A widespread search was launched for Barton, described as  
6-foot-4, white, with a receding hairline. 
</P>
<P>
	A previous wife and mother-in-law of Barton were bludgeoned to  
death in 1993 in Cedar Bluff, Ala. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the No. 1 suspect all the way through and still was,''  
said Richard Igou, district attorney at the time of the killings. 
Current District Attorney Mike O'Dell said there is a suspect in 
the case, but declined to say whether it was Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	Blunt-force trauma was the cause of death for Barton's wife and  
two children, who were found dead at an apartment in Stockbridge, 
the town 16 miles southeast of Atlanta where Barton lived, police 
said. The children's bodies were found in their bed and the wife's 
body found in a closet, said Jimmy Mercer, police chief in Henry 
County. 
</P>
<P>
	A handwritten note was left on each body and a  
computer-generated note was left in the living room explaining 
``why he did what he did,'' Mercer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer said the notes indicate that the wife may have been  
killed Tuesday and the children on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell quoted witnesses as saying Barton was upset about  
recent stock losses but said there were no accounts of any specific 
provocation on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who have identified Mr. Barton indicated he came in, had  
a normal conversation and then began shooting,'' Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 180.78 for the day,  
a drop of 1.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nell Jones said the gunman fired at her inside one of the  
brokerage offices, but the bullet missed and she was able to escape 
when he turned to shoot at others. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, an attorney who was at the office to do some day  
trading, said she looked into the gunman's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was someone who was very calm and determined, no  
feelings,'' she told WSB-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people were still hiding in offices four hours after the  
shooting. Campbell said police SWAT units went through every 
building in the area floor by floor, office by office, trying to 
find Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also searched the trunks of cars leaving the area.  
Roadblocks went up throughout Buckhead, and motorists heading home 
during the evening rush hour were stopped and rerouted. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said Vice President Al Gore had telephoned to offer  
condolences and federal assistance in coping with the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings began at All-Tech Investment, a day-trading  
company on the third floor of one of the office buildings, company 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jai Ramoutar, director of All-Tech, said Barton had not traded  
there in some time. 
</P>
<P>
	He came into the office, ``and after speaking with our branch  
manager suddenly stood up and for no reason opened fire on the 
manager and his secretary,'' Ramoutar said in a statement released 
from the company's headquarters in Montvale, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``This man then went into our main trading room and began  
indiscriminately shooting the customers,'' he said. ``The man then 
ran out of our office and continued shooting in another part of the 
office building.... 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know the reason, if any, for this horrible act of  
violence. All-Tech's customers trade their own accounts in our 
offices and this man was such a customer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey Houtkin, 50-year-old chairman of All-Tech, said from  
Montvale that his employees told him Barton hadn't traded since 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a former client.'' Houtkin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Day traders buy and sell stocks, bonds or other securities on a  
moment-to-moment basis, usually using computer terminals linked to 
vast trading networks. While this holds the promise of quick gains, 
it also makes it easy to lose money. 
</P>
<P>
	At All-Tech, each day trader puts up at least $50,000 in equity  
to open an account. To cope with the stress inherent in day 
trading, the company employs a corporate psychotherapist to help 
traders. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta was one of several cities to sue gun manufacturers,  
seeking to recoup the costs of gun-related violence. But the state 
legislature and the governor, heavily lobbied by the National Rifle 
Association, swiftly passed a law prohibiting such suits. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., is pushing legislation in Congress that  
would block all cities and states from suing the gun industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia law requires no state permit to buy or own a gun but  
does require a permit to carry a concealed weapon, according to the 
National Rifle Association Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month a psychiatrist in Michigan was killed by his former  
patient, who also gunned down a 45-year-old woman and injured four 
other people in the attack. He then fatally shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, a 71-year-old man raked the first floor of the Mormon  
Family History Library in Salt Lake City with .22-caliber handgun 
fire, killing two people and wounding four others before police 
shot him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, a woman walked into a downtown Salt Lake office  
building with a grocery sack of bullets and opened fire. One person 
died.

<P>
	OSHKOSH, Wis. (AP) -- A World War II-era warplane crashed and  
burst into flames Thursday after colliding with another plane on a 
runway at an air show. 
</P>
<P>
	One pilot was critically injured.  
</P>
<P>
	His plane, a Corsair, was taking off when it clipped the wing of  
a Bearcat plane still on the ground. The Corsair tilted, hit the 
ground and cartwheeled before it burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the Bearcat's wing was sheared off. The pilot escaped  
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash occurred at AirVenture Oshkosh, which runs through  
Tuesday and features between 10,000 and 12,000 airplanes, from 
antiques and home-built planes to jets. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nine Dead in Atlanta Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A gunman opened fire in an office building  
Thursday, killing at least nine people, Mayor Bill Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police hunted for the gunman and said he may have fled to the  
roof of a building across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Bill Campbell said the gunman was a day trader who had  
done business with a brokerage in the building 
</P>
<P>
	The man, identified as Mark O. Barton, 44, of suburban Morrow,  
``was concerned about financial losses,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some witnesses told WSB-TV the shootings were at All-Tech  
Investment Group, a day-trading company on the third floor of the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunfire was reported about 3 p.m. in Two Security Center,  
which houses a travel agency, the brokerage and other offices. It 
is in the wealthy and fashionable Buckhead section in northern 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of police officers swarmed the building, apparently in an  
attempt to find the gunman.Quigley said the gunman, described as 6 
feet 4 and white with a receding hairline, may have fled to another 
office building. 
</P>
<P>
	Office workers were asked to stay inside Two Security Center,  
but some were later escorted outside in small groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton walked into a brokerage office at Securities Center in  
the upscale Buckhead section north of Atlanta, then walked across 
the street and began shooting at another brokerage there, the mayor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the victims were killed in one building and five in the  
other, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no idea what caused Mr. Barton to begin shooting,''  
Campbell said. ``Those who have identified Mr. Barton indicated he 
came in, had a normal conversation and then began shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some people were still hiding in offices in the building nearly  
three hours after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said police SWAT units were going through every  
building in the area floor by floor, office by office, trying to 
find Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also searched the trunks of cars leaving the area.  
</P>
<P>
	Harvey Houtkin, 50 year old president and founder of All-Tech  
Investment Group, said from his office in Montvale, N.J., said his 
employees told him the suspect hadn't traded since April. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can tell you, I had one of my clients in that office  
called me after this happened. He (the gunman) was a former 
client.'' Houtkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Carter, who works for Allegiance Telecom on the third  
floor, said that as police escorted him out, he saw a man's body 
lying on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They weren't attending to him, which led me to believe he was  
dead,'' Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Belazi, who also works on the third floor of the building,  
said police told him a man walked into the building's leasing 
office on that floor and shot someone. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got us out of there,'' he said. ``We saw a bunch of blood  
in the leasing office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just last month a psychiatrist in Michigan was killed by his  
former patient, who also gunned down a 45-year-old woman and 
injured four other people in the attack. He then fatally shot 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, a 71-year-old man raked the first floor of the Mormon  
Family History Library in Salt Lake City with .22-caliber handgun 
fire, killing two people and wounding four others before police 
shot him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	The library shooting came just more than three months after a  
24-year-old man allegedly walked into a downtown Salt Lake office 
building with a grocery sack of bullets and opened fire. One person 
died and another suffered minor gunshot wounds in the Jan. 14 
shooting.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Dive; Dow Loses 180.78 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Thursday as a government  
report signaled that wages are rising faster than expected in a 
tight labor market, heightening inflation jitters and setting the 
stage for a possible increase in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 180.78 points to close at  
10,791.29, a loss of 1.6 percent. The index managed a modest 
rebound late in the session, recovering from a loss of as much as 
258.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Thursday's selloff, the biggest point drop since a  
191.55-point fall on July 20, the Dow still is up 17.5 percent so 
far this year, well above analysts' expectations when 1999 began. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also tumbled. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 24.37 to 1,341.03, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 65.83 
to 2,640.01. Technology and drug companies led the decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were battered Thursday after the Labor Department said  
its Employment Cost Index, considered the best measure of changes 
in wages and benefit costs, rose 1.1 percent in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the steepest rise in the eight years of the current  
economy's expansion, the longest peacetime growth in U.S. history. 
The bigger-than-expected jump followed a record low 0.4 percent 
increase during the first three months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest unemployment rate in 29 years has raised fears that  
employers scrambling for workers will have to raise wages, and 
therefore prices. Economists expect the Federal Reserve to use the 
data as evidence that it should raise interest rates again in an 
effort to stave off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed imposed one small interest-rate increase in June, and in  
the past week, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has indicated his 
willingness to raise rates again if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ECI really played into the biggest question on Wall  
Street: Will he or won't he?'' said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst 
at Prudential Securities. ``Every number that might convince the 
Fed to tighten rates is viewed as very dangerous to stocks and 
bonds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices fell steeply, pushing yields on 30-year Treasury  
bonds up to 6.07 percent from 6.00 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately Thursday, the Commerce Department's report on the  
gross domestic product showed the U.S. economy grew at a 
slower-than-expected pace in the second quarter. But investors 
chose to focus primarily on the employment cost index, which 
Greenspan had indicated he would monitor closely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any pleasure the Fed took from the GDP report was more than  
offset,'' by the wage report, said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist 
at Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of higher interest rates hit financial stocks  
hardest. J.P. Morgan, down 3 3/8 at 130 5/8, was the steepest decliner in 
the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares were mostly lower. Those stocks, which are  
often highly valued, become less appealing when interest rates are 
high and corporate profits may be hurt. IBM fell 3 to 215 3/8, and 
Microsoft dropped 3 to 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks were weaker across the board, led by Glaxo Wellcome,  
which said it will miss its 1999 target of double-digit earnings 
growth. Glaxo shares fell 4 1/8 to 51 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management tumbled 5 1/2 to 25 15/16 after saying its  
second-quarter earnings will miss estimates. The company's 
financial chief resigned, and Waste Management said all previous 
guidance on future earnings should be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's losses would have been much steeper without 3M and  
Procter &AMP; Gamble, which rose after posting strong earnings reports. 
Shares of 3M rose 1 11/16 to 90 13/16, and Procter &AMP; Gamble gained 
2 to 88 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-4 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 903.57 
million shares, compared with 837.78 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 9.59 to 630.81, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 5.01 to 784.59. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.09 to 441.58. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.65 percent.  
European indexes were sharply lower. Germany's DAX index lost 3.4 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 2.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 
fell 2.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> As Deadline Nears, Tribe GM On Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Indians general manager John Hart's July phone  
bill must be something to behold. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, one of baseball's busiest GMs any time of the year, has  
been calling teams from coast to coast this week trying to see if 
he can improve Cleveland's chances of winning a World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he hasn't made a connection.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've been doing our work, and seeing what's out there,'' he  
said. ``It's been an active week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the clock ticks down toward Saturday's midnight EDT trading  
deadline, Hart says the likelihood the Indians will pull off a big 
deal is small. But short of landing a No. 1 starter -- something the 
Indians have been unable to do the past three years -- Hart expects 
to make some kind of move. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at a lot of different things and a lot of it is  
going to come down to the price for the type of talent we need,'' 
Hart said. ``If that talent isn't there, then we won't make a 
trade. But I'd be surprised if we don't do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland doesn't need much. The Indians' fifth straight  
division title is a near certainty, and if they can get all their 
players healthy -- they haven't had their opening lineup together 
since April 22 -- Cleveland might not have to do anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, getting an ace starting pitcher like Curt Schilling, David  
Wells or Mike Mussina would be nice. But they aren't available, at 
least not for a reasonable price. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more likely is that Cleveland will get a second-tier  
starter, another reliever or a backup third baseman. Indians scouts 
have been watching Tampa Bay closer Roberto Hernandez and starter 
Rolando Arrojo very closely the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh third baseman Ed Sprague probably could be had for a  
minor leaguer, and the Tribe has reportedly asked about 
left-handers Terry Mulholland and Jeff Fassero. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the Indians' goal is win it all, then that means beating  
the New York Yankees. And to do so, the Indians may need a Yankee 
killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Finley is just that.  
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim's 36-year-old left-hander has a 16-9 career mark against  
New York, including two good outings against the Yankees this year. 
The Angels have been one of baseball's biggest disappointments, and 
Finley has made it known he would love to pitch for a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in his career he wants a chance to win a World  
Series,'' said Indians pitcher Mark Langston, a former teammate of 
Finley's and one of his closest friends. ``We've talked about it a 
lot and he's always said he'd love to come to Cleveland. This team 
has been playing with one goal in mind since the spring, and that's 
to win a World Series. He'd fit in nicely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he's just 5-9 this year with a 5.68 ERA, Finley, who is  
scheduled to start at home against Minnesota on Saturday night, 
makes sense for the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	He brings experience, and because he is eligible for free  
agency, Cleveland wouldn't assume much of a contract obligation. 
But the biggest plus is that he beats the Yankees, and in October 
there is nothing more important to the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether or not Hart can get Finley depends on what the Angels  
want in return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they're going to give me away for a bag of balls  
and some kitchen matches,'' Finley said Wednesday night in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Angels spokesman Tim Mead said Thursday night that no deal  
involving Finley or anyone else on the team was about to be made. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing imminent,'' Mead said. ``We continue to  
explore every opportunity to improve this ballclub for the present 
and the future. We've received several phone calls based on some 
rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of injuries to starters Sandy Alomar, Travis Fryman and  
Wil Cordero, the Indians have been forced to play some of their 
youngsters. Einar Diaz, Enrique Wilson and Richie Sexson have 
stepped in and done a nice job. But because they're playing so 
much, Hart isn't in a position to deal any of them. 
</P>
<P>
	But that hasn't stopped teams from asking, especially about  
Sexson. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first full major league season, the 6-foot-8 first  
baseman/outfielder is batting .243 with 19 homers and 62 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Richie has done a great job for us offensively,'' Hart said.  
``He's done a great job at first base and in the outfield. If I'm 
excited, I'm sure other people are looking. But I'm more excited 
because he's our player.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel OKs Meat Price Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a bid to give livestock producers more  
leverage with the nation's big meatpackers, a Senate committee 
approved a measure Thursday that would require the companies to 
begin reporting the prices they pay for cattle and hogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would preempt a flurry of new state laws aimed at  
soothing angry producers who think they are being squeezed by 
packers. Farmers and ranchers say they will be in a better 
bargaining position if the companies are required to make the daily 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department would collect and publish the data,  
and could start a similar program for sheep. Companies that process 
fewer than 125,000 cattle or 100,000 hogs would be exempt from 
disclosing their pricing. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation approved unanimously by the Senate Agriculture  
Committee would give producers ``the tools they need to make 
informed marketing decisions,'' said John McNutt, president of the 
National Pork Producers Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's top Democrat, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, added:  
``It's a great day for a lot of livestock producers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation is being prepared in the House.  
</P>
<P>
	The issue had languished for years because of strong opposition  
from the packing industry. But pork prices collapsed last winter 
and five states, led by South Dakota, passed their own reporting 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The price-reporting issue stems from a larger concern by many  
farmers and ranchers about a steady stream of agribusiness mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., cautioned that the reporting  
requirement could backfire on producers. The data will give packers 
a better idea of what their competitors are paying for livestock 
and the result could be lower, not higher, prices, Roberts said.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up Despite Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybeans futures prices rebounded  
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade despite favorable weather forecasts 
for Midwestern growing states next week. 
</P>
<P>
        The advances in corn and soybean prices ended days of sharp  
declines. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn futures prices got a boost from a continued heat wave  
across the Midwest that is expected to last into the weekend. The heat, 
reaching the high 90s in key states such as Illinois and Iowa, could 
bake parched crops and reduce yields. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybean futures prices were helped by a report Thursday from  
the U.S. Department of Agriculture showing better-than-expected weekly 
export sales. 
</P>
<P>
        But the gains were limited by extended weather forecasts calling  
for cooler, wetter weather to return to the Midwest by Sunday and continue 
for several days. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery rose 1/2 cent to $2.73 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn rose 4 1/4 cents to $2.11 1/4 a bushel; December oats 
rose 2 3/4 cent to $1.16 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 4 3/4 
cents to $4.33 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef and pork futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  
</P>
<P>
        August live cattle fell .85 cent to 64.32 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .77 cent to 76.70 cents a pound; August lean hogs 
fell 1.12 cents to 47.60 cents a pound; August pork bellies fell .13 
cent to 49.12 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> UCLA Players Apologize for Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nine UCLA football players will be suspended  
for two games after being accused of claiming fake disabilities to 
get handicapped parking permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of those players, along with two former players, pleaded  
no-contest Wednesday to illegally using the placards, and 
apologized as disabled activists booed. Five other players, 
including two current teammates, will be arraigned Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``This behavior is particularly insensitive because it was  
carried out by student athletes, for they are among the most 
able-bodied of all,'' Chancellor Albert Carnesale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bob Toledo told a campus news conference he was ``terribly  
disappointed in the players and what they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like your children,'' he said. ``I'm a surrogate father.  
I've got to scold them, I've got to discipline them, but I'm still 
going to love them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, this is going to be a pretty good chunk of our  
football team,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The players pleaded no-contest to illegally possessing  
state-issued handicapped placards. Each was placed on 24 months 
probation, must pay fines, penalties and restitution amounting to 
about $1,500, and complete 200 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not realize the seriousness of our actions,'' outside  
linebacker Ali Abdul Azziz said outside court after he and the 
others entered pleas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our faces have been posted on television and newspapers and we  
know we have embarrassed our school, our families and ourselves,'' 
he said. ``We realize we exercised bad judgment, and we're anxious 
to make amends for what we've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA officials said eligible players, including six starters,  
will be suspended for two games against Boise State and Ohio State. 
Those eligible players include seven players who entered pleas and 
two whose arraignments were postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the community service will be with the Special Olympics,  
which holds athletic games for the disabled. The other 100 hours 
were assigned to the city parks department or groups helping those 
with cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and other disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes also must spend a day meeting and talking with the  
disabled and their advocates, Assistant City Attorney Brian 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for their pleas, the prosecutor dropped a second  
count of giving false information to the California Department of 
Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The misdemeanor charges carried a maximum sentence of six months  
in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The punishment is fair and sends a ``strong signal,'' the  
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the players apply for a job and are asked if they ever have  
been arrested or convicted of a crime, they must say yes, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``That'll follow them the rest of their lives,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've been punished not only adequately, but more than the  
average citizen,'' said attorney Harland Braun, who represented 
several athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the players submitted bogus applications to the  
DMV for the placards, which allowed them to park at metered zones 
for free and in spots reserved for the disabled. The applications 
listed complaints ranging from knee injuries to Bell's palsy and 
included the signatures of nonexistent physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, the players were booed and harangued by about a  
dozen disabled activists in wheelchairs. Some held flyers with the 
Bruins football logo that read ``Park them on the bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They were treated with kid gloves,'' said Lillibeth Navarro of  
the California Foundation of Independent Living Centers. `I feel 
that they were given light sentences because they're athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafer Johnson, the 1960 Olympic decathlon champion and a Special  
Olympics board member, was at the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``These athletes made a mistake, and every one of them have told  
me that and have said that to everyone within hearing distance of 
them,'' Johnson said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
	Arraignment of five other current or former players was delayed  
to Aug. 25. One player, Craig Walendy, was away at the San 
Francisco 49ers training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA finished with a 10-2 record last season and went to the  
Rose Bowl. The team is considered a contender in the Pacific-10 
Conference this season.

<HEADLINE> Euro Exchanges Say Talks Still On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Deutsche Boerse AG and the London  
Stock Exchange on Thursday denied a newspaper report that said 
their talks toward a planned alliance had collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been no change of plans to create a European stock  
market together with six other European bourses,'' Deutsche Boerse, 
which runs the Frankfurt stock exchange, and the LSE said in a 
joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Handelsblatt reported in its Thursday editions that the talks  
for a joint venture between Deutsche Boerse and LSE announced a 
year ago to develop a common exchange for 300 European blue-chip 
stocks had fallen apart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Deutsche Boerse-LSE alliance is considered the core of a  
pan-European stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Handelsblatt reported that executives of both exchanges couldn't  
agree on the further harmonization of their stock markets and 
didn't want to proceed further. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing unidentified sources close to both exchanges,  
Handelsblatt said differences over future ownership of the common 
stock exchange, over which trading platform and which stock index 
to use were reasons for the deal's failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Deutsche Boerse and LSE reiterated they'll harmonize  
their trading hours Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from eight major European stock exchanges -  
Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Milan, Paris and 
Switzerland - signed a memorandum of understanding May 5 in Madrid 
to form a partnership to create a pan-European bourse. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-Frankfurt strategic alliance, announced in July 1998,  
was seen as the cornerstone of that project. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Boerse and LSE also said in their joint statement that  
they'll continue to publish results of their talks, but won't 
comment on the state of the meetings.

<HEADLINE> Gun Dealer Called ATF Before Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- A man who admits selling two handguns to  
spree killer Benjamin Smith says he called authorities when he 
recognized the man from a composite sketch -- but no one returned 
his call for two days. 
</P>
<P>
	The call was made only hours before an Indiana University  
student was slain in the two-state killing spree that targeted 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Fiessinger, 64, says he wanted to tell authorities what he  
knew about Smith, who had come to his apartment twice to buy cheap, 
low-caliber handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiessinger got an answering machine July 4 at the Bureau of  
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms office in Springfield, closed because 
it was a holiday weekend. He left what ATF spokesman Jerry Singer 
described Wednesday as a ``vague'' message. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours later, Smith is believed to have gunned down  
Won-Joon Yoon, a South Korean student, outside a church in 
Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials doubt whether Fiessinger's information would have  
saved Yoon's life. Knowing Smith's name wouldn't have brought 
police any closer to capturing Smith before he fired on Yoon, 
Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Fiessinger did call us saying he had some information,''  
Singer said. ``It was a pretty generic message saying he had 
something to pass on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fiessinger also decided not to call an emergency pager number on  
the answering machine that would have put him in contact with an 
ATF agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a white supremacist, shot himself to death as he  
struggled with police in southern Illinois the night of July 4. 
During his two-day shooting spree, Smith injured nine and killed 
both Yoon and former Northwestern University basketball coach Ricky 
Byrdsong. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiessinger had been accused three days earlier by ATF agents of  
selling handguns on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers for Fiessinger, who has pleaded innocent to a  
federal charge of selling firearms without a license, hope that 
Fiessinger's attempt to cooperate with authorities helps his case.

<HEADLINE> FBI Probes Florida Inmate's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The FBI has launched a civil rights  
investigation into the death of a condemned inmate who got into a 
violent confrontation with prison guards. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation will determine whether Frank Valdes' civil  
rights were violated by guards who allegedly beat him to death, FBI 
agent Bill Hurlburt said Thursday. State authorities are also 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine guards are suspended with pay while agents investigate  
whether Valdes, 36, died as a result of a July 17 beating on death 
row. Two more guards were suspended for refusing to cooperate with 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports filed by guards acknowledged a violent fight between  
Valdes and five guards trying to get him out of his cell. They said 
Valdes kicked and tried to bite the guards when they entered his 
cell after he refused to be handcuffed. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers said they responded with chemical sprays, a shield that  
delivers an electric shock and several punches to Valdes' face, 
arms and torso. They claim he was checked at the prison clinic 
after the incident and was fine. 
</P>
<P>
	He died hours later.

<HEADLINE> Teen Stows Away on Flight to London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A teen-ager who said he wanted to impress the  
Israeli intelligence agency sliced through a fence at Logan 
International Airport, settled into an empty seat aboard a British 
Airways jet and flew to London. 
</P>
<P>
	The airport, the airline and the boy, identified as 17-year-old  
Abraham Derman of Brookline, could be fined for the July 12 
escapade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating, and the  
airline is considering asking the teen to come up with the $3,300 
it would have charged a paying passenger who made his journey. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're treating it extremely seriously,'' British Airways  
spokesman John Lampl said Thursday. ``The safety and security of 
our passengers is paramount.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Massachusetts Port Authority, which operates  
the airport, said the breach of security was rare but extremely 
serious. They declined to comment further Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	People familiar with the investigation said the teen's journey  
as a stowaway began when he scaled a 10- to 12-foot fence, cut the 
barbed wire at the top and dropped onto the tarmac area north of 
the main terminals. 
</P>
<P>
	They said Derman walked about a quarter-mile to the  
international terminal, where he climbed a metal staircase leading 
to a jetway, the tunnel joining the terminal with the waiting 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	A jetway door, which is the airline's responsibility, is  
supposed to be locked. But the teen-ager apparently found it 
unlocked or open, and quickly boarded a Boeing 747 preparing for a 
trip to London. 
</P>
<P>
	Once on board Flight 214, Derman allegedly took a seat in the  
coach section, but had to move when the rightful ticket-holder 
arrived. He allegedly found an empty seat in the business section 
and settled in for the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	After landing at Heathrow Airport, the boy was confronted by  
officials after gaining access to a restricted area, according to 
the officials familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, British Airways flew Derman back to Boston in  
coach class. He was detained and questioned -- though not arrested -- 
by state police. He told investigators he had thought the stunt 
would impress Israel's Mossad intelligence agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Derman, accompanied by his father, also gave investigators a  
step-by-step account of how he penetrated security, including in a 
walking tour in which he traced his route to the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe reported Derman is 17, but that could not be  
verified. Calls made to a Brookline residence listed under the name 
Derman were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the FAA investigation is likely to focus on the security  
measures taken by the airline. Airlines usually hand-count 
passengers and compare the number with the tickets collected at the 
gate.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Clash With Calif. Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- After 16 years of Republicans in the  
governor's mansion, Democrats in the nation's most populous state 
were looking forward to one of their own making their wish lists 
come true. 
</P>
<P>
	But six months after taking office, Gov. Gray Davis and the  
Legislature controlled by his fellow Democrats are clashing just as 
bitterly as the days of divided state government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Davis dumps on Democrats!'' shouted a recent news release from  
the state GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	He dumped again on Wednesday when he vetoed a bill that declared  
outreach programs for minorities and women to be permissible under 
a voter-approved ban on affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 209 -- a 1996 ballot initiative that Davis opposed --  
bars preferential treatment based on race or gender in public 
education, employment and contracting. 
</P>
<P>
	Outreach programs should examine other factors, such as income,  
Davis said. But the American Civil Liberties Union condemned the 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be an understatement to say that we're  
disappointed,'' said Michelle Alexander of the California ACLU. ``I 
think it is an outrage that Davis has vetoed this incredibly 
moderate piece of legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, however, has reportedly reached a deal with civil rights  
groups that effectively guts a controversial ballot measure that 
sought to limit state aid to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	And today Davis spokesman spokesman Michael Bustamante said the  
governor had struck a deal with civil rights organizations, 
nullifying the major provisions of a controversial ballot measure 
that sought to limit services to illegal immigrants. Davis agreed 
not to appeal a federal court ruling that held much of the 
voter-approved initiative Proposition 187 to be unconstitutional, 
Bustamante said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' decisions reflect in miniature the kind of experience  
liberal lawmakers and interest groups have had since they drew up 
wish lists on health care, the environment, gun control and 
workers' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	While some items on those lists are now law, several others are  
likely to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis campaigned as a moderate and declared in his inaugural  
speech: ``It matters not whether an idea comes from a Republican or 
a Democrat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature, on the other hand, is led by lawmakers  
considerably more liberal than he is, and they are whipping their 
bills through the Senate and Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching a wave of legislation approach his desk, Davis has  
employed parliamentary tricks to bottle up health care and other 
bills, angering the Legislature's Democratic leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	After they exposed his maneuvers, Davis, a former lawmaker  
himself, lashed out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a totally different view of the world than I do,  
totally different,'' Davis said last week. ``Their job is to 
implement my vision. That is their job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are reluctant to go on the record with direct  
criticism of the governor, but there has been plenty of 
behind-the-scenes grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has strayed little from his promise to take a centrist  
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	He cut more from health and welfare programs in his budget  
vetoes than from any other area, although the budget he signed also 
includes a 2.3 percent increase for welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	He recently satisfied gun-control advocates by signing the  
toughest assault-weapons ban in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Davis stunned fellow Democrats earlier this year by  
proposing to spend $335 million to build a new prison, a decision 
that delighted Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Bustamante framed Davis' challenge this way: ``How does a  
moderate govern without moderates in the Legislature?''

<HEADLINE> Feds Take On High-Rate Lenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In need of some quick extra money to post bail  
for her son, 73-year-old Nellie Nicholson approached a lender about 
a $10,000 home-equity loan on her nearly paid off mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
	The lender promised her the payments wouldn't dig too deeply  
into her only income -- a $740 monthly Social Security check -- but 
they did. Her loan was refinanced with monthly charges covering 
only the interest, sticking her with a $43,500 balloon payment 
after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	She still couldn't afford it, and the lender threatened to  
foreclose on Nicholson's house. ``I didn't think people were so 
dirty they could do those things,'' said Nicholson, of Compton, 
Calif. ``It's just something that got the best of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission today announced the first wave of  
settlements against lenders accused of violating a 1994 federal law 
that tightens restrictions on pricey loans of the type Nicholson 
got. Seven lenders are involved in the settlements and more are 
being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Six companies have agreed to repay consumers $572,500. One of  
the lenders has gone out of business and cannot pay consumer 
redress. 
</P>
<P>
	Homeowners who may not qualify for conventional loans but want  
money for house repairs or emergencies have helped fuel the 
high-interest home-equity loan market. But this surge has come with 
an explosion of deceptive business practices that cost consumers 
who can least afford it thousands of dollars, say federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once some of those people get their hooks into you, it's very  
hard to get out or get out with your equity intact,'' said Robert 
Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, in an 
interview. He stressed there are legitimate lenders of high-rate 
loans. But, ``we see a lot of very abusive behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act requires  
lenders of high-cost loans to tell consumers that they could lose 
their homes if they fail to make payments. Lenders also must reveal 
the annual percentage rate, the regular payment amount and finance 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The law prohibits certain types of balloon -- or lump sum --  
payments and prevents lenders from making loans to people on the 
basis of their home equity rather than their ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The law also does not allow most prepayment penalties -- charges  
for refinancing the loan at a different rate. Consumers are 
entitled to a three-day cooling off period in which they can cancel 
the loans. 
</P>
<P>
	But the commission has found that some lenders fail to comply  
with federal law, leading consumers like Nicholson to face 
exorbitant costs. Nicholson ended up handing over $10,000 in fees 
just so she could refinance her $43,500 loan with another company. 
</P>
<P>
	They prey on ``vulnerable audiences who don't have anything in  
the world except that piece of property,'' Pitofksy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal advocates say certain groups are particularly susceptible  
to predatory lending practices and misleading brokers. Low-income 
residents who don't have a traditional banking institution in their 
neighborhood or elderly homeowners who might not think they can get 
a loan except through a broker are more likely to become prey, says 
Benjamin Diehl, an attorney with Bet Tzedek Legal Services in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``They become automatically more vulnerable,'' said Diehl.  
Lenders use flyers, door-to-door solicitations and ads to attract 
potential borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal disclosures are meant to wave a red flag at  
borrowers taking on high-rate loans. Those are defined as loans in 
which more than eight percent of the total loan amount is in fees 
or where the annual percentage rate exceeds by more than 10 
percentage points Treasury notes of comparable maturity. 
</P>
<P>
	In one FTC case, a consumer had taken on a loan with an interest  
rate of 122 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The extra disclosure is sort of like a warning notice,'' Diehl  
said. ``It's supposed to give another chance for consumers to 
decide whether to go through with the high-cost loans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitofksy says in some cases, consumers are seeking high-cost  
loans when they could really be obtaining conventional loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Stella Adams, executive director of the North Carolina Fair  
Housing Center, said she also has seen instances where brokers, who 
might be promised kickbacks by lenders, put consumers in loans with 
higher interest rates than their credit record warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	She also ticked off other practices aimed at trapping consumers.  
For example, Adams said, some loans come packaged with credit life 
insurance policies that are added as one lump sum of several 
thousands dollars on top of the loan. Consumers end up paying 
interest on the loan and the policy, sometimes forcing them to take 
out another loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like slash and burn economics,'' Adams said.  
</P>
<P>
	Some lenders also don't report the consumer's timely payments to  
help improve their credit record, which prevents them from getting 
a better rate to refinance their loan, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies included in today's FTC settlements are: Barry  
Cooper Properties, Encino, Calif.; Capitol Mortgage Corp., Provo, 
Utah; CLS Financial Services, Inc., Lynnwood, Wash.; Granite 
Mortgage LLC, Lexington, Ky.; Interstate Resource Corp., Newburgh, 
N.Y.; LAP Financial Services, Inc., Louisville, Ky.; and Wasatch 
Credit Corp., Salt Lake City.

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn of New Y2K Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two of the government's top computer security  
experts are warning that some programmers hired to fix Year 2000 
problems may be quietly installing malicious software code to 
sabotage companies or give themselves access to sensitive 
information after the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	The ominous warnings were part of testimony prepared for a  
hearing today about the so-called Y2K glitch and cyberterrorism 
before the Senate's Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology 
Problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Vatis, director of the FBI's National Infrastructure  
Protection Center, said experts hired by U.S. companies to fix 
their computers could secretly program ``trap doors'' -- ways to let 
them gain access later -- or add malicious code, such as a logic 
bomb or time-delayed virus that could disrupt systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``While systems have been and will continue to be extensively  
tested, the probability of finding malicious code is extremely 
small,'' agreed Richard Schaeffer, director of the Defense 
Department's Infrastructure and Information Assurance program. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither expert suggested the possible scope of the problem.  
</P>
<P>
	Schaeffer said problems are complicated by the New Year's  
rollover, when some computers programmed to recognize only the last 
two digits of a year may mistake 2000 for a full century earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be difficult to distinguish between a true Y2K event  
and some other anomaly caused by a perpetrator with malicious 
intent,'' Schaeffer wrote in prepared testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Both experts said the risks were exacerbated by the amount of  
software repaired by companies overseas. Vatis called the situation 
``a unique opportunity for foreign countries and companies to 
access, steal from or disrupt sensitive national and proprietary 
information systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Since any vulnerabilities that are implanted will persist as  
long as the software is in place, this is a problem that will last 
well beyond January 1, 2000,'' Vatis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vatis recommended that companies thoroughly check the  
backgrounds of companies they hire for software repairs. He also 
said they should test for the existence of trap doors after the 
repairs, possibly even hiring teams to try to electronically crack 
into their own networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest warnings come on the heels of new disclosures about  
White House plans to create a government-wide security network to 
protect the nation's most important computer systems from hackers, 
thieves, terrorists and hostile countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The 148-page proposal from the Clinton administration describes  
building an elaborate network of electronic obstacles, monitors and 
analyzers to prevent and watch for potentially suspicious activity 
on federal computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil liberties groups complain that the security tools also  
would make possible unprecedented electronic monitoring, especially 
because of the increasingly widespread use of computers by the 
government in almost every aspect of its citizens' daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House defended the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are very concerned about protecting privacy rights,'' said  
Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger. ``But there is 
also a privacy right in not having hostile entities attack systems. 
We're not only talking about 17-year-old kids in their basement. 
We're talking about governments that we know are developing systems 
to get access to our computer systems.''

	The first 500 intrusion monitors would be installed on  
nonmilitary government computers next year, according to a draft 
copy of the proposal obtained by The Associated Press. The full 
system would be completed by May 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also suggests ways to convince private companies to  
monitor their corporate computer networks and share information 
about threats. But it said explicitly that the government will not 
force companies to permit federal monitoring of their systems.

<HEADLINE> British Telecom Profit Up 6.8 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Telecommunications PLC reported Thursday  
that its first-quarter pretax profit rose 6.8 percent from a year 
ago, while its sales soared 17 percent over 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, however, said that its earnings growth was hampered  
by higher costs in its mobile phone operations and a greater call 
volume requiring bigger payments to British telephone operators. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in British Telecom fell in mid-day trading to 1,075 pence  
($17.20) per share, down 4.9 percent from Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	British Telecom earned 772 million pounds ($1.24 billion) in the  
quarter, up from 723 million pounds in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter ending June 30 were 4.99 billion pounds  
($7.98 billion), compared to 4.24 million pounds for the same 
period in 1998. Quarterly operating profit grew by 1.8 percent to 
835 million pounds ($1.34 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	Mobile communications generated some of the strongest growth in  
sales. BT Cellnet, British Telecom's mobile phone subsidiary, saw 
its customer base increase by 59 percent to more than 5 million 
during the 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretax profits were aided by a doubling of interest income to 46  
million pounds ($74 million) and a decline in interest expense of 
10 million pounds ($16 million). 
</P>
<P>
	The company said ``good progress'' has been made on the  
formation of its global joint venture with U.S. telecommunications 
giant AT&AMP;T Corp. and that it expected to receive final regulatory 
clearance for the project later in the year.

<HEADLINE> Spacecraft Camera Misses Asteroid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A NASA spacecraft that made the closest flyby  
ever of an asteroid apparently misaimed its camera and failed to 
get any close-ups of the giant orbiting rock, disappointing 
scientists Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Deep Space 1 probe flew within about 10 miles of the  
Asteroid Braille on Wednesday night, but the pictures it sent back 
back show only empty space, said Robert Nelson, project scientist 
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is analogous to mispointing a camera and getting a blank  
field of view,'' he said. ``It's not very exciting if this 
hypothesis holds out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The barrel-shaped, 8-foot spacecraft, launched in October and  
designed primarily to test new forms of technology for future 
deep-space flights, otherwise accomplished all of the objectives of 
the $152 million mission, NASA said. 
</P>
<P>
	And some science data still might be returned. An instrument  
that analyzes charged particles called ions appeared to be 
operating normally. Such data could help researchers figure out the 
rock's makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the tested technologies was a self-navigating system that  
lets the spacecraft set its own course. But the system lost sight 
of the asteroid with its camera about 20 minutes before the 35,000 
mph encounter at 9:46 p.m., NASA said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole asteroid encounter was pure bonus,'' said deputy  
mission manager Marc Rayman. ``The objectives of the mission had 
already been accomplished before the encounter -- that is to test 
high-risk technologies for future missions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the blank pictures are disappointing to scientists,  
especially because so little is known about the thousands of 
asteroids that irregularly orbit the sun and sometimes collide with 
the planets. An asteroid that hit Earth 65 million years ago is 
believed to be responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The flyby took place more than 117 million miles from Earth,  
between Earth and Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other futuristic technologies tested was an ion  
propulsion engine that moved the spacecraft by sending out a stream 
of high-speed ins. 
</P>
<P>
	Ion engines deliver 10 times more thrust than a conventional  
engine for a given amount of fuel. That means spacecraft can be 
smaller, lighter and less expensive to launch into space.

<HEADLINE> Ford Seeks To Boost Tire Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. wants to grab a share of  
the replacement tire business to make up for another source of 
dealer revenue that's gone flat. 
</P>
<P>
	A national radio and television advertising campaign that begins  
Monday will promote Ford and Lincoln-Mercury service shops as 
``America's newest tire store.'' It's part of Ford's larger effort 
to remake itself into a one-stop consumer company for virtually all 
automotive products and services. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this year, few Ford dealers offered tires -- even though  
they are one of the most common vehicle replacement parts. Stocking 
the many sizes available was costly and an individual dealer lacked 
the clout to get the kind of manufacturer discounts that large 
chain tire stores command. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, the world's No. 2 automaker, decided to use its corporate  
purchasing power to get competitive tire prices for its dealers. So 
far it has signed on about half of its 5,000 U.S. dealers, mostly 
in major urban areas, to offer a range of brand-name tires to fit 
Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Tire sales allow dealers to offset the decline in revenue from  
warranty service work, said Carl Bergman, customer service 
operations manager for Ford. As the quality of new cars and trucks 
has improved, warranty work has declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford and some of its dealers also are experimenting with  
stand-alone service shops, called AutoCare, and separate ``Quick 
Lane'' service bays at dealerships to compete with the 
proliferation of independent quick-lube shops that offer affordably 
priced routine maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also has simplified and lowered the prices of common  
replacement parts, Bergman said. By competing more directly with 
the independents on price and service, Ford is hoping that more 
customers will return to dealers for their service after their 
warranties expire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once they leave us, they don't come back,'' Bergman said.  
``Our Achilles' heel has been price and convenience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This month, Ford expects its dealers will sell between 115,000  
and 125,000 tires, compared with just 782 in July 1998. For the 
year, Ford's goal is to sell 1 million tires, Bergman said. That's 
still a fraction of the 232 million replacement tires sold annually 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Tires also are being offered at the AutoCare stores, as well as  
through Ford dealerships in Europe, Bergman said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Mortage Rates Move Higher / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages, which had edged down over the last three 
weeks, rose to 7.70 percent this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was up from 7.52 percent last week, according to a  
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the last three weeks, mortgages rates have been on an  
upward climb. So far this year, mortgage rates hit a low of 6.74 
percent set at the end of January and a high of 7.71 percent set 
the week ending July 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 7.29 percent this week, up from the average of 7.16 
percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.99 percent this week, also up from 5.97 
percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported Wednesday  
that mortgage loan applications fell 3.1 percent last week and were 
down 25.6 percent compared to the same week last year.

<HEADLINE> Non-Panama Presence Hurts Drug Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A retired Army general joined Thursday with  
House Republicans in warning that the phase-out of the U.S. 
military presence in Panama could be a boon to South American 
narcotraffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Panama is critical to counterdrug efforts,'' said retired Gen.  
George A. Joulwan, who once led all U.S. military operations in 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying before the House International Relations Committee,  
Joulwan said losing the U.S. military infrastructure in Panama will 
affect the U.S. ability to prosecute the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Panama Canal treaties, the United States has until the  
end of the year to terminate all military operations in Panama -- a 
process that is well under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., said the authors of  
the 1979 pact ``could not have foreseen neighboring Colombia's 
drug-fueled agony, nor the sophistication of the drug cartels' 
corrupting criminal reach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman said it was a mistake for the United States to have put  
itself in the position of closing Howard Air Force Base, from which 
15,000 military flights had taken off annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said Panama has no army, navy  
or air force with which to combat ``the well-armed narcoterrorist 
forces'' in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said the Panama Canal, instead of reverting to  
Panamanian control as prescribed under the treaties, ``is now in 
the hands of communist China,'' saying numerous entities with close 
ties to China's People's Liberation Army are very active in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
	With the closure of Howard AFB in May, the administration has  
been conducting counternarcotics surveillance flights from 
airfields in the Netherlands Antilles and also plans similar 
flights from Ecuador and a Central American country yet to be 
named. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said the addition of these new  
sites for surveillance of drug flights more than compensates for 
the loss of Panama. He said official analyses show the locations 
will be able to handle up to 120 percent of the traffic that Panama 
had been handling. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman called for approval of legislation he introduced last  
fall providing for the U.S.-Panamanian military partnership to 
continue in exchange for Panama's joining with Mexico and Canada in 
forging a ``new, mature, mutually beneficial relationship'' with 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ambassador Theodore McNamara recommended against such an  
effort, citing political conditions in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Panamanians need to see that we will fully implement the  
1979 treaties, that we will completely leave the country without 
any intention of returning,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNamara tried unsuccessfully to negotiate an agreement in  
Panama that would have permitted U.S. counternarcotics activities 
there to continue after the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	A large majority of the Panamanian people favored such action  
but were ignored by political elites who ``determine the outcome of 
important issues,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ballistic Report in Columbine Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Preliminary ballistics reports are complete in the  
Columbine school attack, though it could be weeks before 
investigators determine if a third gunman was involved, a sheriff's 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado Bureau of Investigation agents delivered volumes of  
data to the Jefferson County sheriff's office this week, said 
spokesman Steve Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen investigators are reviewing the data, a process that  
could take several weeks, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The key question is whether Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold,  
17, acted alone. Investigators have said repeatedly they do not 
believe there was a third gunman in the April 20 assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``From day one, the question has obviously been if there was a  
third gunman,'' Davis said. ``We know every weapon that was fired. 
If we find any bullet that doesn't match a weapon, we'll have to go 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold killed a dozen classmates and a teacher  
before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff John Stone, in Florida on Monday, reiterated his belief  
that the two teen-agers must have had help planting dozens of 
explosives around the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never thought it was just two because of the amount of  
stuff that was brought in,'' Stone said. ``But we don't have enough 
to charge anyone.''

<HEADLINE> Almost One-Third NL Umps Lose Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thirteen National League umpires lost their jobs  
Thursday, bringing to nearly one-third the number of major league 
umps who will depart Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe West, famous for slamming pitcher Dennis Cook to the ground  
in 1990, and Eric Gregg, criticized for a wide strike zone in the 
1997 playoffs, were among those let go, one management official 
said, speaking on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hallion, suspended for three games earlier this month for  
bumping a player and coach, will be forced to leave, too, and the 
resignations of crew chief Terry Tata was accepted along with those 
of Bob Davidson and Bill Hohn. The names of the others were not 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine AL umpires were told Monday that their resignations had  
been accepted. That means 22 of the 68 major league umpires, or 32 
percent, are departing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost 22 colleagues because of a flawed strategy,'' said AL  
ump Dale Scott, among the umpires who have broken with union head 
Richie Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really very sad,'' said AL ump Joe Brinkman, another  
Phillips foe. ``It's just a damn shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hallion, Hohn and Tata all declined comment after working the  
Phillies-Marlins game in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been waiting since 6:30 this morning (PDT), calling  
people and getting phone calls,'' NL ump Dana DeMuth said in Los 
Angeles before the Dodgers played Cincinnati. ``And from that time 
on, our hearts have been jumping. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're standing here with our heads in a guillotine, and the  
blade is right here,'' he said, holding his hand an inch from the 
back of his neck. ``It's very difficult, because you want to know 
if you're one of these guys that they don't consider to be major 
league umpires. It's like we're waiting for a page to turn today. 
It's very difficult sitting right here with friends and crew 
members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ability, diversity and experience were among the factors used to  
make the decisions, several management officials said, all speaking 
on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has pushed to increase minority hiring in recent years  
and didn't want to decrease the percentage of minority umpires. 
Baseball also had to be careful not to accept the resignations of 
too many of the union's leaders, because that would open the sport 
to a charge of illegal retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 14, the day following the All-Star game, most umpires  
resigned effective Sept. 2, thinking the tactic would force an 
early start to negotiations for a new labor contract. The current 
deal expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	But the move backfired when more than a dozen umpires refused to  
resign and baseball hired 25 replacements from Triple-A, effective 
Sept. 1. The umpires let go sent a letter Tuesday withdrawing the 
resignations, but baseball said it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, in anticipation of baseball's moves, umpires sued  
in federal court in Philadelphia. Their attempt to gain a 
restraining order was denied by U.S. District Judge Edmund V. 
Ludwig, but a hearing on the case will be scheduled after Aug. 12, 
Ludwig's office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the umpires who kept their jobs blamed the mess on the  
union leadership, headed by president Jerry Crawford and Richie 
Phillips, the umps' negotiator since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``The major league umpires have been seriously harmed because  
union leadership adopted a flawed strategy that was doomed to fail 
from the beginning,'' said the statement, agreed to by a group of 
14 umpires that included Brinkman, Scott, John Hirschbeck, Dave 
Phillips and Rocky Roe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The advice to quit jobs in order to keep them made no sense at  
all,'' said the statement, also signed by NL umpires Wally Bell, 
Mark Hirschbeck and Jeff Nelson, and AL umpires Gary Cederstrom, 
Tim Craft, Jim Joyce, Tim McClelland, Durwood Merrill and Tim 
Welke. 
</P>
<P>
	``It grieves us that more than 20 umpires will apparently lose  
their jobs as a result of this flawed and doomed strategy,'' the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other umpires were angered by the statement.  
</P>
<P>
	``(They) started this ball rolling against us -- to pursue and  
save their own jobs instead of staying strong in our union,'' 
DeMuth said. ``They are the ones who did not stand with the 
majority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NL umpires lay much of the blame on Sandy Alderson, the  
executive vice president of baseball operations in the 
commissioner's office. Commissioner Bud Selig wants to shift 
supervision of umpires from the league presidents to Alderson, 
Oakland's former general manager and team president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The final say is coming from Alderson,'' DeMuth said. ``And  
who is Alderson -- who's never has any umpire capabilities and 
doesn't know a thing about my job. How can he say that I must go? 
It doesn't make sense. But everything that he's done to this point 
doesn't make sense, anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Phillips and Crawford retained Cohen, Weiss and Simon  
``to take appropriate aggressive legal action against major league 
baseball.'' Cohen, Weiss and Simon has worked for the Airline 
Pilots Association and the Teamsters Union. 
</P>
<P>
	DeMuth said the defectors were the cause of the problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not totally Richie's fault that we're in this situation  
today. It's not all his fault,'' DeMuth said. ``He was 
backstabbed.''

<HEADLINE> Astronomer May Be Buried on Moon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Eugene Shoemaker may finally get his lifelong  
wish to go to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes as planned, a lipstick-sized vial carrying one ounce  
of the renowned astronomer-geologist's ashes will slam into the 
moon's south pole on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The vial will be aboard NASA's Lunar Prospector, a moon-orbiting  
craft scientists hope will teach them about lunar water reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunar Prospector is expected to hit the moon at 5:52 a.m. EDT  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be a fitting tribute for Shoemaker, 69, an authority on  
craters and the interplanetary collisions which cause them. The 
Arizona resident died in a 1997 car collision while crater-hunting 
in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Credited along with his wife for the discovery of about 20  
comets and 800 asteroids, Shoemaker gained worldwide fame as a 
co-discoverer of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 that slammed into Jupiter 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Porco, a University of Arizona professor and Shoemaker's  
colleague on NASA's Voyager expeditions, spearheaded the tribute 
effort and designed an epigraph that accompanies Shoemaker's ashes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the very first human inhabitant of earth to be laid to  
rest on another celestial body,'' she said. ``That's very 
significant because it says we have arrived at our place in the 
solar system, the solar system is our own and it's beckoning us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Morse, spokesman for NASA's Ames Research Center, called  
the memorial ``a special honor for a special human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The container that carries Shoemaker's remains was manufactured  
by Celestis Inc., a Houston company that has used commercial 
rockets to launch into space the cremated remains of 55 people, 
including Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and 1960s drug guru 
Timothy Leary. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA officials expect the vial to pulverize on impact.  
</P>
<P>
	``If all goes well, it may literally be buried,'' said Lisa  
Chu-Thielbar, Prospector outreach coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Shoemaker's ashes may rise in a cloud of soil and,  
perhaps, water vapor -- the focus of the Lunar Prospector's 
swan-song experiment. NASA will use the Hubble Space Telescope to 
try to detect water from lunar ice in the plume created by 
Prospector's impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoemaker, a geologist by training, applied to be an astronaut  
in the 1960s but was rejected because of a medical problem. He 
later worked on several U.S. space missions, including the Apollo 
missions to the moon. He taught Apollo astronauts about craters. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoemaker said shortly before his death the biggest  
disappointment in his life was ``not going to the moon and banging 
on it with my own hammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Grown men have told me they've been moved to tears when they  
heard this story, of the man who wanted so badly to go to the 
moon,'' Ms. Porco said. ``Through no fault of his own was taken out 
of the running. Thirty years later, he finally will get there.''

<HEADLINE> PETA Ad Links Beef to Impotence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- First, Oprah Winfrey fretted in front of millions  
of viewers about beef and mad cow disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Now cattlemen have to cope with a less subtle health message  
from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eating meat can cause impotence,'' says a PETA-sponsored ad,  
which shows an attractive woman in a stars-and-stripes swimsuit 
with a string of link sausages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vegetarians are not only generally slimmer and more sexually  
attractive than meat-eaters, they are also better lovers,'' claims 
Bruce Friedrich, a PETA spokesman in Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads are pure bull, says Texas Beef Council spokeswoman Lisa  
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zinc is an important nutrient for sexual function, and beef is  
one of the best sources of zinc in your diet,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `Runaway Bride' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Last year Julia Roberts was desperately seeking to sabotage her  
best friend's wedding. This summer she's walking out on her own 
nuptials -- four of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Runaway Bride'' offers that far-fetched but amusing premise,  
and a sterling group of actors play it to the hilt. Long a purveyor 
of sitcoms, director Garry Marshall knows how to make even the most 
trivial of scenes pay off in terms of laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall is reunited with Roberts and Richard Gere, his stars of  
the 1990 hit ``Pretty Woman,'' in which she played a Hollywood 
Boulevard hooker, and he was her wealthy customer. This time she 
runs a hardware store in a Maryland hamlet, and he writes a 
newspaper column so misogynistic that old ladies belt him on the 
streets of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuck for a column idea, Gere retires to his favorite bar where  
he regularly finds inspiration. A barfly tells him the tale of a 
Maryland lass who has made multiple escapes at the altar, once on 
horseback. Gere writes the column, with much embellishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Too much, it turns out. The hotshot reporter checked none of his  
facts and invented his own. That prompts his editor (Rita Wilson), 
who also happens to be his ex-wife, to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
	Gere wheedles a magazine assignment for a followup, and he sets  
out for Hale, Md., vengeance in his eye. ``Kazaam! I'm in 
Mayberry!'' he mutters to himself on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	He immerses himself in the small-town culture, much to the  
irritation of Roberts. (Rule No. 1 of romantic comedies: Boy and 
girl must be at odds until the final reel.) 
</P>
<P>
	Waiting for the final clinch can grow wearisome, but Marshall  
and the screenwriters (Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott) supply 
enough diversions to keep things lively. They never adequately 
explain the heroine's aversion to saying the words ``I do.'' (Rule 
No. 2: Do not seek logic in a romantic comedy.) 
</P>
<P>
	``Runaway Bride'' gives Julia Roberts a chance to test her  
unsuspected talent for knockabout comedy, and she has never been so 
lively. Gere uses his eye-blinking charm in a not altogether 
sympathetic role. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those playing the townspeople of Hale (actually Berlin,  
Md.), Joan Cusack stands out as the bride's buddy, along with Paul 
Dooley as her father, and Christopher Meloni as one of the rejected 
husbands. Wilson and Hector Elizondo hold their own on the New York 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Runaway Bride'' is a joint production of Paramount Pictures  
and Disney's Touchstone Pictures, which may help explain why seven 
people are listed as producers and executive producers. The rating 
is PG but it might as well be G. Running time: 116 minutes, which 
could have been trimmed of the anticlimactic ending.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Get Championship Rings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Six months after winning their first NFC  
title, the Atlanta Falcons received the spoils of victory Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves handed out championship rings to players and  
staff at a morning meeting before the first practice of training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The rings are gold with diamonds encircling the Falcons logo.  
``NFC Champions'' stretches across the bottom of the ring, while 
the Super Bowl emblem and ``16-3'' -- the team's record last season 
-- are engraved on the side. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to wear this one,'' said Reeves, who has been to  
nine Super Bowls as a player, assistant coach and head coach. 
``This is one of the better-looking rings I've seen. The only thing 
that would be better is a ring that says world champions rather 
than NFC champions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Buchanan showed off his ring for reporters after lunch.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real proud of it,'' the cornerback said. ``It's a real  
nice ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Keith Brooking, who made it to the Super Bowl in his  
rookie year, kept his ring in the box, carrying in under his arm 
along with two playbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need one that's just a little bit bigger,'' he said. ``I was  
fortunate to get a ring in my first year, but I want to use this as 
motivation to get a Super Bowl ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves handed out every ring except the one that goes to star  
running back Jamal Anderson, who is holding out in a contract 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	When some of the players asked Reeves about Anderson's ring, the  
coach joked, ``Jamal who?''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Bomb Iraqi Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. warplanes struck targets in northern and  
southern Iraq, continuing a long-running battle with antiaircraft 
batteries, the Pentagon said Thursday. Iraq said eight people were 
killed in one strike in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	In the northern no-fly zone being patrolled by U.S. and British  
warplanes flying out of Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, shots fired by 
an Iraqi antiaircraft artillery battery Thursday brought a 
retaliatory strike by U.S. planes using laser-guided bombs, said 
Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	In the southern no-fly zone, patrolled by U.S. and allied planes  
flying out of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other bases in the Persian 
Gulf, two Iraqi MiG-23 fighters darted into the zone earlier this 
week, seeking to draw U.S. planes into the range of a 
surface-to-air missile battery. The U.S. fighters did not take the 
bait, Quigley said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in a second incident in the south, Iraqi radar targeted  
or ``painted'' coalition aircraft, prompting a retaliatory strike 
by U.S. aircraft on an Iraqi air defense site. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq says the latest attack in the southern part of the country  
claimed eight lives, a figure U.S. officials could not confirm.

<HEADLINE> Florida Vouchers Target of Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A teachers union sued Gov. Jeb Bush on  
Thursday to overturn the nation's only statewide voucher program 
that allows parents to send their children to private or parochial 
schools at taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second legal challenge to Florida's voucher program  
since it took effect last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taking money for vouchers violates the constitution, which  
says the Legislature must adequately fund public schools and it's a 
paramount duty to do that,'' said Pat Tornillo, head of Florida 
Education Association/United. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and its parent organization, the American Federation  
of Teachers, filed suit in state court in Tallahassee, where a 
similar suit by other voucher opponents is already pending. The new 
lawsuit names Bush, his Cabinet and the state Board of Education as 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	``If these unions were just half as concerned about children as  
they claim, they would have invested the money they spent on these 
lawsuits on schools,'' Bush spokeswoman Lucia Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Federation of Teachers also sued Cleveland in  
federal court Thursday, challenging that city's voucher program, 
which is already the subject of another lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ohio and Florida should focus their resources on what works to  
improve the public schools that the vast majority of students 
attend,'' union president Sandra Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio case alleges that the city's voucher program, which  
started three years ago, violates the U.S. Constitution by breaking 
down the separation of church and state. The Ohio Supreme Court has 
ruled in another suit that the program does not violate the 
separation clause. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornillo predicted the FEA/United suit would be consolidated  
with the suit filed in June by parents and several groups, 
including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People and the American Civil Liberties Union.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The U.S. women's softball team got off  
to a perfect start in the Pan American Games on Thursday as 
Danielle Henderson of Commack, N.Y., pitched a perfect game, 
beating Colombia 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson had 16 strikeouts in only her second international  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking about hitting spots and staying ahead in the  
count,'' Henderson said. ``It just happens, especially when you 
have a defense behind you and a catcher calling a good game; the 
perfect game is a result of all that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States got off to a fast start and didn't look back.  
It was 2-0 through one inning, then the Americans scored three more 
in the third and another three in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't score again until the seventh and final inning,  
getting a run to make it 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans had 12 hits. Lisa Fernandez had a perfect game at  
the plate as she went 3-for-3, and Crystal Bustos had three hits 
with two RBIs. Leah O'Brien-Amico posted two hits and three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	In men's play, Steven King and Barry Kahlar homered in a 10-0  
victory over Guatemala that ended after five innings because of the 
mercy rule. 
</P>

Ams gold medal on Friday against the Netherlands Antilles. The men 
play Saturday vs. the Dominican Republic.

<HEADLINE> Montenegro Warns Anew of Secession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- The Yugoslav republic of  
Montenegro will begin steps toward secession from Yugoslavia unless 
sweeping legal changes are made in the next few weeks, the 
Montenegrin foreign minister said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Branko Perovic said  
Montenegro demanded sweeping changes in its relationship with 
Serbia during talks held in Belgrade July 14-15. 
</P>
<P>
	Perovic said Montenegro expected a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer from  
members of President Slobodan Milosevic's government. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will see what their reaction will be and we have given them  
a reasonable time-frame of six to eight weeks to give us an 
answer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what would happen if Belgrade refused, he said Montenegro  
would hold a referendum on independence from Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see that the trend among the Montenegrins for independence  
is growing,'' Perovic said. ``So we do have an answer to a `no.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States supports Montenegro's pro-Western president,  
Milo Djukanovic, but has urged him to avoid an open break to 
prevent further instability in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic is unlikely to accept any fundamental change in the  
relationship between the two remaining Yugoslav republics which 
would weaken his power. He rejected similar proposals from Slovenia 
and Croatia before they broke with Yugoslavia in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Djukanovic said in an interview that Montenegro has already  
taken major steps to become closer to Western Europe, including 
changes in its monetary policy, trade, taxes and security.

<HEADLINE> Georgius Retires From First Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- John Georgius, the No. 2 executive at  
First Union Corp., will retire at the end of the year, chairman Ed 
Crutchfield announced Thursday following a hastily-arranged board 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Replacing Georgius as president of the nation's sixth-largest  
bank will be Ken Thompson, who has headed up the bank's capital 
markets unit, Crutchfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgius, who began his banking career in 1963 and joined First  
Union in 1975, has been described as the mastermind behind the 
bank's ``Future Bank'' overhaul, which has been criticized by some 
customers as being impersonal. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union recently hired 2,000 new tellers when its customers  
said they wanted to deal with real people instead of telephones and 
ATMs. First Union's stock also is down 23 percent this year as the 
bank twice lowered earnings estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	A bank spokeswoman denied that Georgius, 54, was forced out.  
</P>
<P>
	``That would be unfair,'' said spokeswoman Laurie Hedrick.  
``Sure we've been very aggressive with the Future Bank and it 
didn't do as well as expected in some markets. But it's working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Georgius, she said: ``It's something he's been thinking  
about doing anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``John has contributed tirelessly to the growth and success of  
First Union over the past 24 years,'' Crutchfield said in a 
prepared statement. ``But he has expressed a desire to retire and 
pursue other interests at this point in his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 48, has been with the bank since 1976. He was elected  
to the board effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Crutchfield cited his experience as a leader in First Union's  
commercial bank as well as president of the bank's Florida 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``His leadership role in Capital Markets has been a key factor  
in advancing and increasing our business in a challenging global 
marketplace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union Corp.'s stock price rose 2.4 percent Thursday amid  
the swirling rumors about the purpose of the special board meeting. 
The board was not scheduled to meet again until August. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, First Union shares closed at  
$48, up $1.12 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union has been in a tailspin all year. The swoon in the  
company's stock price has prompted some analysts and investors to 
label the bank a takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
	But Peter Kuper, who follows the banking industry for Keefe  
Bruyette in New York, said that's unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, I feel it's unlikely the company is for sale because it  
would be such a huge animal to swallow,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union ran into problems as it absorbed several large  
acquisitions, particularly The Money Store and Philadelphia's 
CoreStates Financial, when those outlets did not produce as much 
revenue as anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank ran into customer complaints with its innovative  
``Future Bank'' branch overhaul, which encouraged customers to use 
telephones, automated teller machines and computers to do their 
banking. It wound up hiring 2,000 new tellers just months after 
about 5,800 workers were laid off in March under a cost-cutting 
effort to boost profits.

<HEADLINE>  China Seeks Arrest of Sect Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- China widened its attempt to crush the  
banned Falun Gong meditation group today, ordering the arrest of 
its U.S.-based founder. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, which has up to 70 million members, was outlawed last  
week by Chinese leaders who regard it as the most serious threat to 
communist rule since pro-democracy protests in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ministry of Public Security ordered police and border posts  
to find and arrest Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi, the official 
Xinhua News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry said Li ``spread superstition and malicious  
fallacies to deceive people, resulting in the deaths of many 
practitioners,'' Xinhua said. It claimed the group was to blame for 
743 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Li, a former government clerk who founded Falun Gong in 1992,  
has denied accusations that he has harmed people and that his group 
has political ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said China also will ask for unspecified cooperation  
from member nations of Interpol, the international police agency. 
It wasn't clear whether Beijing would ask the United States to 
extradite Li, who moved to New York last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Falun Gong spokeswoman Gail Rachlin said that she  
believed Li is safe in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a resident. He has a green card. He's protected as a  
resident,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	An Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman in New York  
did not immediately return a call for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has been critical of Beijing's crackdown on Falun  
Gong. When the group was banned last Thursday, State Department 
spokesman James P. Rubin said the United States was ``disturbed'' 
by the ban and by ``some heavy-handed tactics'' used against the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong is one of many schools of qigong, a practice popular  
for decades that tries to improve health through exercise, 
mediation and attempts to channel unseen forces. Its doctrines draw 
on martial arts, Buddhism and Taoism. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese government has been waging a major campaign to  
destroy Falun Gong books and materials. State media said today that 
1.5 million items have been confiscated and hundreds of thousands 
of them destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	In Shanghai, authorities fed 45,000 books into a pulping machine  
today at a ceremony led by city propaganda chief Jin Binghua, the 
newspaper Xinmin Evening News said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crackdown appears to have been prompted by a silent protest  
April 25 by more than 10,000 Falun Gong devotees outside the 
Beijing compound where President Jiang Zemin lives. The group said 
it was protesting official harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest order accuses Li of organizing demonstrations without  
required permits, Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is thus suspected of having committed the crime of  
disturbing public order,'' Xinhua quoted the order as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Li has denied organizing that gathering or other protests, and  
told reporters he didn't even know about them in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier reports in state media have blamed Falun Gong for at  
least 16 deaths, saying followers refused medication or committed 
murder or suicide. Li has denied any connection to deaths of 
members who he said might already have been ill or unstable. 
</P>
<P>
	State media have kept up a steady stream of attacks on Falun  
Gong. Former members are shown on television denouncing Li, and 
newspapers quote officials criticizing its doctrines. 
</P>
<P>
	National TV newscasts have been expanded to a full hour from  
their usual 30 minutes and are devoted almost completely to attacks 
on the sect. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist Party members, thousands of whom openly practiced  
Falun Gong before the crackdown, have been ordered to quit or be 
expelled from the party.

<HEADLINE> Nortel Shares Rise on Profit Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of Nortel Networks rose nearly 4 percent  
Wednesday after the telecommunications equipment maker posted 
strong quarterly results and announced a major new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian company topped Wall Street forecasts by a wide  
margin with late Tuesday's report on the second quarter, which 
showed a 30 percent gain in revenues and a 74 percent jump in 
operating profits. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Nortel announced a deal to provide transport and  
optical equipment to Level 3 Communications for an advanced 
communications network designed to carry data, voice and video 
signals using Internet Protocol technology. 
</P>
<P>
	IP technology can make a network faster and more efficient by  
breaking down those signals into packets of data rather than 
depending on the continuous streams of information used to carry 
most of today's phone calls and television programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Level 3's fiber-optic network currently reaches 21 U.S. cities  
and four European markets. The company plans to expand its own 
network to 50 U.S. cities and 21 markets in Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Nortel  
rose $3.12 1/2 per share to $89.83 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Nortel earned $368 million, or 55 cents per share, in the  
quarter, excluding acquisition-related costs and other one-time 
factors that left the company a net loss of $145 million, or 21 
cents per share, for the period. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same three months last year, Nortel's operating profit  
was $212 million, or 40 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues, meanwhile, totaled $5.41 billion for the second  
quarter, up from $4.16 billion a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Unwilling To Be Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore wants only to tango with George W.  
Bush, but after months of quietly shaking hands and raising money, 
Bill Bradley is ready to insist on cutting in. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, the vice president's only rival for the Democratic  
presidential nomination, is unwilling to be unknown any longer. His 
volunteers knocked on 80,000 doors in 22 New Hampshire towns this 
week and the candidate will begin canvassing the Sunday TV news 
shows this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator inaugurated his Iowa headquarters  
and is scheduled to beat Gore to Chicago next week for a meeting 
with Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition, a core group of Democratic 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
	He has assiduously courted labor union leaders and stoked their  
differences with Gore over trade. The AFL-CIO executive council, 
meeting in Chicago next week to discuss the once-inevitable 
endorsement of Gore, is likely to hold off any recommendation until 
at least October, one top union official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead to the early fall, Bradley is also polishing  
proposals on his priority issues: universal health insurance, child 
poverty, education, foreign policy and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike Al Gore, who has certainly achieved a level of  
familiarity with voters after being a loyal vice president to Bill 
Clinton for 6 1/2 years, Bill Bradley was relatively unknown,'' said 
senior Bradley adviser Anita Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spent the first half of this year raising money --  
banking $7 million to Gore's $9 million -- and making low-key visits 
with Iowa and New Hampshire voters. Bradley plans a splashier road 
show in early September, with a fall kickoff in his hometown of 
Crystal City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next hurdle we tackle is to raise the level of knowledge  
that people have about Bill Bradley and what he will do as 
president,'' Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the contest to dominate policy, Gore is focusing on Bush,  
the Texas governor and Republican frontrunner. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, aides said, the vice president will outline his  
proposals for targeted tax breaks to help middle-class Americans 
pay for long-term health care, adult education and retirement 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
	By arguing for narrow tax relief over the broader Republican tax  
cuts rolling through Congress this week, Gore hopes to lock himself 
into a debate with Bush without offering any plan so deviant from 
President Clinton's policies that it would alter the current course 
of economic prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president welcomes a compare-and-contrast with the  
Republicans, including the presidential candidates,'' said Gore 
spokesman Chris Lehane. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a  
Washington think tank allied with Clinton, said Gore's tax plan was 
designed to hold together the coalition that twice elected Clinton 
-- middle-class suburbanites plus the Democratic party's traditional 
urban base. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Gore campaign clearly wants to start setting the terms of  
the policy debate after several weeks of unflattering stories of 
disarray within the campaign,'' Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a chief architect of the 1986 tax overhaul, has a  
record of his own on lowering tax rates for middle America and 
closing corporate loopholes. It remains unclear whether Bradley 
will offer a new tax overhaul in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	But the centrist Bradley will come at Gore from the left with a  
plan for universal health insurance, three words that have been 
taboo in Washington since Hillary Clinton's plan failed in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton-Gore ``Patients Bill of Rights'' would only help  
people who already have insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 40 million Americans do not have health coverage.

<HEADLINE> Georgius Retires From First Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- John Georgius, who developed First Union's  
faltering ``Future Bank'' branch overhaul program, will retire as 
president of the bank at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Ed Crutchfield made announced Georgius's planned  
departure Thursday after a hastily arranged board meeting 
</P>
<P>
	Replacing Georgius as the No. 2 executive at the nation's  
sixth-largest bank will be Ken Thompson, who has headed up the 
bank's capital markets unit since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgius, 54, who began his banking career in 1963 and joined  
First Union in 1975, has been described as the creative force 
behind the bank's ``Future Bank'' overhaul, which has been 
criticized by some customers as being too impersonal. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank recently hired 2,000 new tellers when its customers  
said they wanted to deal with real people instead of telephones and 
ATMs. First Union's stock also has fallen 23 percent this year as 
the bank lowered earnings estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	A bank spokeswoman denied that Georgius was forced out.  
</P>
<P>
	``That would be unfair,'' said spokeswoman Laurie Hedrick.  
``Sure we've been very aggressive with the Future Bank and it 
didn't do as well as expected in some markets. But it's working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Georgius, she said: ``It's something he's been thinking  
about doing anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``John has contributed tirelessly to the growth and success of  
First Union over the past 24 years,'' Crutchfield said in a 
prepared statement. ``But he has expressed a desire to retire and 
pursue other interests at this point in his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 48, has been with the bank since 1976. He was elected  
to the board effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Crutchfield cited his experience as a leader in First Union's  
commercial bank as well as president of the bank's Florida 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``His leadership role in Capital Markets has been a key factor  
in advancing and increasing our business in a challenging global 
marketplace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union has been in a tailspin all year. The swoon in the  
company's stock price has prompted some analysts and investors to 
label the bank a takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
	But Peter Kuper, who follows the banking industry for Keefe  
Bruyette in New York, said that's unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, I feel it's unlikely the company is for sale because it  
would be such a huge animal to swallow,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union ran into problems as it absorbed several large  
acquisitions, particularly The Money Store and Philadelphia's 
CoreStates Financial, when those outlets did not produce as much 
revenue as anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank ran into customer complaints with its innovative  
``Future Bank'' branch overhaul, which encouraged customers to use 
telephones, automated teller machines and computers to do their 
banking. It wound up hiring 2,000 new tellers just months after 
about 5,800 workers were laid off in March under a cost-cutting 
effort to boost profits.

<HEADLINE> Maryland Declares Drought Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELDERSBURG, Md. (AP) -- For the first time ever, a statewide  
drought emergency has been declared in Maryland, yet another sign 
that the dry spell that has plagued the East coast is continuing to 
take a major toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect this drought to get worse before we see serious  
relief,'' Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening said Thursday at Liberty 
Reservoir, which is 24 feet below its average level. 
</P>
<P>
	It is one of three reservoirs that provides water for 1.8  
million people in the Baltimore area. The other two also are well 
below average levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendening asked residents to voluntarily conserve water by  
taking short showers, not watering lawns and not filling swimming 
pools. Mandatory conservation measures could be imposed next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, who deemed the drought the worst in 30 years, said  
he would seek federal financial help for Maryland's farmers and 
promised $3 million in state money so they can plant crop cover and 
buy hay. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore has only a 35-day supply of water, but it can take  
more out of the Susquehanna River. That river is down by two-thirds 
-- it flows into Chesapeake Bay from Pennsylvania, where the 
governor has also declared a drought emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	Farms in New Jersey are so weather-beaten that agricultural  
officials are planning to seek a federal disaster declaration that 
would bring farmers low-interest loans or grants. 
</P>
<P>
	Dairy cattle are dying, livestock feed crops are a near-total  
loss and many farmers will have to borrow money to buy food for 
their animals for the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, rain fell in Waynesburg, Pa., in time for the Rain Day  
celebration Thursday, dampening a July 29th for the 105th time in 
the past 126 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a drought going on, so it's weird,'' said borough  
manager Bruce Wermlinger. ``We don't have a theory -- no rain dances 
being performed that I know of.''

<HEADLINE> Life Expectance Climbs 30 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Americans can expect to live nearly 30 years  
longer than they did at the turn of the century because of 
antibiotics, clean drinking water and advances that have helped 
control infectious diseases, government researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1900, the overall death rate from diseases like pneumonia  
and tuberculosis has declined from 797 per 100,000 to 59 per 
100,000 in 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, life expectancy during that period increased from  
47.3 years to 76.1. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the conclusions might be that investments made in the  
tools that are needed to monitor, diagnose and treat and prevent 
infectious diseases pay dividends,'' said Dr. James Hughes, 
director of the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst U.S. epidemic of an infectious disease was in 1918,  
when the flu killed 500,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Pneumonia, TB and diarrhea/enteritis were the three leading  
causes of death in 1900. Today, the leading causes are heart 
disease, cancer and stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on, improvements in sanitation, hygiene and living  
conditions helped control outbreaks of cholera, TB and other 
diseases, the CDC said in the latest in a series of reports on 
health improvements in the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Chlorination contributed to the decrease of waterborne diseases,  
while improvements in housing to reduce crowding helped in the 
fight against TB, which in 1900 killed 194 of every 100,000 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvements had a profound effect on children under 5, who  
in 1900 accounted for 30.4 percent of all deaths. That dropped to 
just 1.4 in 1997, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1910s, serologic testing became a basic tool to diagnose  
many diseases like syphilis and gonorrhea. The development of cell 
cultures in the 1930s paved the way for large-scale production of 
live or heat-killed viral vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1940s ushered in use of antibiotics like penicillin, which  
was used to treat sick and wounded U.S. soldiers. And state and 
local health departments began instituting childhood vaccination 
programs, which helped virtually eliminate often-fatal diseases 
like smallpox and polio. 
</P>
<P>
	During the later part of the century, advances in molecular  
biology technology have further improved testing, diagnosing and 
monitoring disease, the CDC said. But the successes in reducing 
deaths led to some complacency, the health agency warned. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1980s saw the emergence of AIDS and other new diseases and  
the re-emergence of TB and pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're increasingly seeing problems with antibiotic resistance  
making some of the infections harder to treat,'' Hughes said. ``So 
these microbes that created these illnesses continue to evolve.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Take On High-Rate Lenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government announced settlements Thursday  
with seven companies accused of violating federal restrictions 
against exploiting people who take out high-rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlements will provide more than $572,000 in refunds to  
consumers, the Federal Trade Commission said. Others are being 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Homeowners who may not qualify for conventional loans but want  
money for house repairs or emergencies have helped fuel the 
high-interest home-equity loan market. But this surge has come with 
an explosion of deceptive business practices that cost consumers 
who can least afford it thousands of dollars, say federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once some of those people get their hooks into you, it's very  
hard to get out or get out with your equity intact,'' says FTC 
chairman Robert Pitofsky. He stressed there are legitimate lenders 
of high-rate loans. But ``we see a lot of very abusive behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act requires  
lenders to reveal the annual percentage rate, the regular payment 
amount and finance charges. The law prohibits lenders from 
concealing balloon -- or lump-sum -- payments and prevents lenders 
from making loans to people on the basis of their home equity 
rather than their ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The law also does not allow most prepayment penalties -- charges  
for refinancing the loan at a different rate. Consumers are 
entitled to a three-day cancellation period. 
</P>
<P>
	But the commission has found many lenders skirting the rules.  
</P>
<P>
	The settlements, which do not constitute an admission of  
wrongdoing, were with these companies: Barry Cooper Properties, 
Encino, Calif.; Capitol Mortgage Corp., Provo, Utah; CLS Financial 
Services, Inc., Lynnwood, Wash.; Granite Mortgage LLC, Lexington, 
Ky.; Interstate Resource Corp., Newburgh, N.Y.; LAP Financial 
Services, Inc., Louisville, Ky.; and Wasatch Credit Corp., Salt 
Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say their actions left consumers with huge debts.

	Nellie Nicholson, 73, in need of some extra money to post bail  
for a family member, approached a lender about a $10,000 
home-equity loan. The payments were too high for her $740 monthly 
Social Security check. Her loan was refinanced by Barry Cooper 
Properties with monthly charges covering only the interest, 
sticking her with a $43,500 balloon payment after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	She still couldn't afford it, and the lender threatened to  
foreclose on Nicholson's house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think people were so dirty they could do those  
things,'' said Nicholson, of Compton, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal advocates say certain groups are particularly susceptible.  
Low-income residents who don't have a traditional bank in their 
neighborhood or elderly homeowners who might not think they can get 
a loan except through a broker are more likely to become prey, says 
Benjamin Diehl, an attorney with Bet Tzedek Legal Services in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenders use fliers, door-to-door solicitations and ads to  
attract potential borrowers to high-cost loans. Those are defined 
as loans in which more than 8 percent of the total loan amount is 
in fees or in which the annual percentage rate exceeds by more than 
10 percentage points Treasury notes of comparable maturity. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitofsky says in some cases, consumers are seeking high-cost  
loans when they could really be obtaining conventional loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Stella Adams, executive director of the North Carolina Fair  
Housing Center, said she also has seen instances in which brokers, 
who might be promised kickbacks by lenders, put consumers in loans 
with higher interest rates than their credit record warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Collusion between home repair contractors -- who offer their  
services and then direct the homeowner to a specific lender -- is 
another problem. Juanita Swinney of Louisville, Ky., said she was 
pressured into taking out a bigger loan than she needed for her 
home repairs and at a 20 percent interest rate by LAP Financial 
Services. Attorneys now are trying to prevent her home from 
foreclosure.

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer Drug Understood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tamoxifen, a drug that fights breast cancer by  
blocking the action of the hormone estrogen, eventually loses its 
effectiveness and then actually may help the cancer grow, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study to be published Friday in the journal Science,  
scientists at Duke University Medical Center said they have found 
that the reaction of breast cells to tamoxifen changes over time 
until the drug starts to behave like the hormone it is supposed to 
block. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrogen has been shown to promote the growth of about half of  
breast cancers. Tamoxifen blocks this action by preventing estrogen 
from linking up to a receptor on the surface of cells. 
</P>
<P>
	But clinical experience has shown that after two to five years,  
the anti-estrogen effect of tamoxifen fades, often allowing 
estrogen-sensitive cancers to start growing again. Researchers have 
been puzzled about why this tamoxifen resistance occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now researchers at Duke may have the answer.  
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John D. Norris, first author of the study, said that an  
analysis of the tamoxifen action showed that, over time, the drug 
causes the estrogen receptor on cells to change and form a 
pocket-like structure that allows other proteins to bind there. The 
action of these proteins somehow changes the cell's reaction to 
tamoxifen. The drug converts from an anti-estrogen effect to a 
pro-estrogen effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cells learn how to recognize that new receptor shape as  
estrogen,'' said Norris. ``We're not sure why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said the research shows that tamoxifen resistance can be  
reversed using peptides that block the pocket-like structures on 
the cell receptor. This causes tamoxifen to once again have an 
anti-estrogen effect. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the new understanding could also help researchers find a  
new anti-estrogen drug that does not produce the cell receptor 
reshaping that is caused by tamoxifen. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrogen is a double-edged sword in the health of women. While  
its presence has been shown to promote breast and uterine cancer, 
the hormone also has been shown to be protective against 
osteoporosis and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamoxifen is a widely used drug for breast cancer because it  
blocks the cancer-promoting action of estrogen in breast tissue, 
while having a beneficial estrogen-like effect in the bones.

<HEADLINE> White Supremacist Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A white supremacist convicted of a  
hate crime for helping beat a man was cleared by an all-white jury 
of a more serious charge involving the victim's son. 
</P>
<P>
	Jules Fettu, former state director of the World Church of the  
Creator, was convicted Wednesday of battery as a hate crime against 
William Salas, a 42-year-old man of Cuban descent who lives in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-member jury found that Fettu, of West Palm Beach, was  
one of several skinheads who beat and kicked Salas when he tried to 
defend his 17-year-old son from the group outside a rock concert in 
August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury cleared Fettu, 26, of aggravated battery against  
Salas's son, Jesiah, the Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Two others have pleaded guilty to the attack on Salas.  
</P>
<P>
	All three have links to the World Church of the Creator, which  
advocates the deportation of Jews, blacks and other minorities. A 
former member, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, killed two people and 
wounded eight -- all minorities -- and then shot himself earlier this 
month in Illinois and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Fettu could get up to five years in prison when he is sentenced  
Sept. 3.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Pay Fine in Contempt Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Imposing an unprecedented penalty against a  
president, a federal judge today ordered President Clinton to pay a 
$90,686 sanction for false testimony about his relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money, which Clinton's legal defense fund could pay,  
will go to Paula Jones and the attorneys who represented the former 
Arkansas state worker in her sexual harassment lawsuit. Clinton's 
testimony in that case led to his impeachment by the House and 
eventual acquittal in a Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers, who had argued that he should pay no more  
than $33,737, accepted the ruling. One of Mrs. Jones' attorneys 
said he was considering an appeal to recover more money. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanction was less than one-fifth of the money sought by Mrs.  
Jones' side. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who issued a historic  
contempt ruling against Clinton last April, had said she would 
order him to pay for depositions and other costs that resulted from 
his ``false, misleading and evasive answers'' in his January 1998 
deposition for Mrs. Jones' lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sanctions are being imposed, not only to deter others who  
might consider emulating the president's misconduct, but to 
compensate the plaintiff by requiring that the president pay her 
any reasonable fees and expenses caused by his willful failure to 
obey this court's discovery orders,'' Wright wrote in her order 
filed in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the sanctions, the judge ordered Clinton to pay the  
court $1,202 for her trip to Washington at the president's request 
to preside over his deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We accept the judgment of the court and will comply with it,''  
said Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear how much of the sanction money Mrs. Jones would  
receive herself. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas law firm of Rader, Campbell, Fisher &AMP; Pike was  
awarded $79,999. The Rutherford Institute, a conservative public 
interest law firm on the defense team, will receive $9,484. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas firm submitted itemized bills for $437,825 and the  
Virginia-based Rutherford Institute asked for $53,333. 
</P>
<P>
	In her order, Wright said the lawyers' claims were ``excessive  
and must be reduced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Whitehead, of the Rutherford Institute, said he was pleased  
that the judge imposed a financial penalty but might appeal the 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied the president has finally been held accountable  
for his lying in the deposition of the Paula Jones case,'' he said. 
``The key thing is how history will view this. They're not going to 
look at the money but at the first sitting president that was ever 
held in contempt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said Jones' legal teams tried to justify their fee  
request by arguing that sanctions should be imposed to punish 
Clinton's misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sanctions are not imposed to punish ... but must be based upon  
evidence of actual loss,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright also rejected the lawyers' contention that they should be  
reimbursed for all the legal work they did after Clinton's 
deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the parties have already settled the case for $850,000,  
``it is appropriate to limit fees and expenses to those incurred'' 
as a result of his contempt of court, she said. The president 
admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said Jones was entitled only to fees and expenses for  
the period beginning Dec. 23, 1997, when Clinton first lied about 
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky by giving false written answers 
in the court case. She noted that about 20 percent of Clinton's 
Jan. 17, 1998 deposition dealt with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	In her ruling in April, Wright said there was ``clear and  
convincing evidence'' that during the deposition the president had 
given ``false, misleading and evasive answers that were designed to 
obstruct the judicial process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones alleged that Clinton, as Arkansas governor, made an  
unwanted sexual advance in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	At the deposition, Clinton was asked about his relationship with  
Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern. Clinton testified that 
``I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Months later, after the president's DNA was found on a dress  
belonging to Ms. Lewinsky, he acknowledged an ``inappropriate 
intimate relationship'' with her. He made the admission before a 
federal grand jury Aug. 17 and again in a nationally televised 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the relationship did not fall under the definition  
of ``sexual relations'' provided by Mrs. Jones' lawyers during his 
deposition, and that his testimony was legally accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge wrote in her contempt ruling, ``It is difficult to  
construe the president's sworn statements ... as anything other 
than a willful refusal to obey this court's discovery orders.''

<HEADLINE> GM Asks Judge to Overturn Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- General Motors Corp. asked a judge to  
overturn an unprecedented $4.9 billion product liability judgment 
for six people who were severely burned when their Chevrolet Malibu 
exploded in flames in a 1993 collision. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this award is not over the line, there is none. It cannot  
stand,'' the automaker said in legal papers filed Wednesday in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 9, a jury awarded Patricia Anderson, her four children  
and family friend Jo Tigner $107 million in compensatory damages 
and $4.8 billion in punitive damages for injuries they suffered 
during the 1993 Christmas Eve accident. They were badly burned when 
their car was rear-ended by a drunk driver and exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	GM contends that punitive damages should not have been allowed  
in the case. The judgment, according to GM, is some 200 times and 
nearly $4.8 billion greater than the highest award in a federal 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said in court papers that there was ``no evidence, much less  
clear and convincing evidence'' that the company put profits ahead 
of safety in designing the 1979 Chevrolet Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued in the trial that the gas  
tank was placed too close to the rear bumper and that better 
designs would have placed it over the axle or incorporated a 
shield. They also said a GM analysis showed the cost of settling 
lawsuits arising from crashes in which victims are fatally burned 
was less -- $2.40 a car -- than the cost -- $8.59 a car -- of fixing 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	In its motion to set aside the judgment, GM again argued that  
the placement of the tank behind the axle was safe and that 
placement of the tank over the axle could be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the GM court papers, the Malibu's ``excellent  
safety record,'' which the company said it was precluded from 
proving in court, and its ``state-of-the-art testing'' used in 
deciding on the fuel tank location shows GM's ``conscious regard, 
not disregard, for safety.''

<HEADLINE> Pittsburgh Agrees to Help Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The City Council has agreed to relieve the  
Pittsburgh Penguins of their responsibility to pay $1 million a 
year toward improvements to the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The move will help former team captain Mario Lemieux and his  
ownership group take over the bankrupt team. During negotiations, 
the Public Auditorium Authority agreed on behalf of the city and 
Allegheny County to take over the team's share of the payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The council's voice vote Wednesday was unanimous. County  
commissioners still must approve the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the Penguins will immediately pay $460,000 owed the  
city in amusement taxes and agree to stay in the arena through 
2007. Also, the team and landlord SMG will take over operating 
costs for the arena from the auditorium authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was paying the $1 million each year to help pay off a  
$12 million bond issue from 1994, which was part of $37.6 million 
owed for improvements to the arena, including new seats and a 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins, the auditorium authority, the city and the county  
have all been pitching in to pay off that debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The city and county have good reason to take on the Penguins  
share, which was among the team's largest debts, said auditorium 
authority Executive Director Stephen Leeper. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is a ``civic asset'' and provides economic benefits for  
the region, including producing $1.2 million a year in amusement 
taxes and more than $350,000 in parking taxes, Leeper said.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Nearly Triples Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc. nearly tripled its  
second-quarter profit, meeting Wall Street forecasts, as the 
nation's second-largest long-distance company benefited from 
cost-cutting and a 16 percent gain in communications revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom's profit in the three months ended June 30 was $857  
million, or 44 cents a share, excluding its acquisition of 
Embratel, the Brazilian long-distance phone company it bought last 
fall. That compared to earnings of $287 million, or 16 cents a 
share in the year-ago quarter. The year-ago results were 
recalculated as if MCI's merger with WorldCom last September 
already was completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit was in line with the 44 cents a share forecast by  
analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue, excluding Embratel, rose to $8.26 billion from $7.48  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, based in Clinton, Miss., said it benefited from a  
16 percent gain in revenue from its core communications business, 
to $8.1 billion from $7 billion, that was fueled by more phone 
calls, Internet service and corporate data transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, MCI's year-ago results were eroded by major  
investments to expand its local-phone business. The company was 
able to save money in the recent quarter as MCI's 
telecommunications traffic was switched to WorldCom's network, 
instead of paying to lease lines from other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the six months ended June 30, MCI WorldCom earned $1.6  
billion, or 82 cents a share, excluding Embratel. That was up from 
a profit of $456 million, or 25 cents a share, in the year-ago 
quarter. The year-ago results, which exclude one-time charges, were 
recalculated as if MCI's merger with WorldCom was already 
completed.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `Twin Falls Idaho' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	One bleak afternoon, a prostitute named Penny (Michele Hicks)  
arrives by taxi to turn a trick at a seedy hotel on a place called 
Idaho Avenue in a bleak American Anytown. For change, she is given 
a $2 bill. It is but a muted portent: From there, ``Twin Falls 
Idaho'' only gets weirder. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a tale like no other -- a contemplative, sensitively told  
story of two conjoined (``Siamese'') twins, attached at the torso 
since birth, trying to make their way in a world horrified and 
fascinated by what their existence represents. 
</P>
<P>
	Blake and Francis Falls (Mark and Michael Polish) have lived  
with each other every moment of their lives; the young men wake up 
together, go to the bathroom together, walk in tandem, fall asleep 
side by side. They look identical, but there exists a difference: 
Blake is the strong one. His heart, his strength keep Francis 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Penny, who is at first shocked, then intrigued, finally  
attracted by the unusual brothers. Temporarily homeless, she 
doesn't leave. When Francis falls ill after eating birthday cake, 
she calls a doctor she has, er, known. He comes by and helps. 
Blake, oddly, is unaffected by Francis' malady. 
</P>
<P>
	``How come you don't get sick?'' Penny asks.  
</P>
<P>
	``Who would take care of Francis?'' Blake responds quietly.  
</P>
<P>
	Quietly, actually, is how this film unfolds, and the muted tone  
serves it well. Any other approach would have been garish and 
unkind (``Hooker And Siamese Twins Cavort In Seedy Motel Room!''), 
and if told under other circumstances the movie would serve no 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	But, as conceived, written and executed by the Polish brothers,  
``Twin Falls Idaho'' is a memorably haunting little charmer, dark 
and optimistic at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is rich with olive greens and austere blues, which  
underscore its calm flavor. Many of the shots are symmetrical, in 
keeping with the theme. And the plot moves inexorably forward, 
never anything but linear, never anything but deliberate: Penny 
befriends the twins; they seek out the mother who abandoned them; 
Blake and Penny slowly fall in love; Francis' health deteriorates. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the plot carries the tale forward, it is the unspoken  
themes that elevate ``Twin Falls Idaho.'' This is a movie about 
loneliness: the loneliness of Penny, whose 
hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold character could have been cliche but 
for Hicks' ethereal kindness; the loneliness of Francine (Lesley 
Ann Warren), the twins' mother, trying to cope with having given up 
her children. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of all, it is about the unique brand of loneliness  
suffered by those who are never alone. Blake and Francis (and, to a 
lesser extent, identical twins like Mark and Michael Polish 
themselves) are condemned to a life of accompaniment, and each must 
figure out who he is from within, from the spirit, rather than 
relying on many of the usual external events that define each 
single human being. 
</P>
<P>
	``The minute I wake up and the minute I fall asleep -- those two  
minutes I get lonely,'' Blake says, answering Penny's question. ``I 
try to toss them before they get ahold of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They do get ahold of him, of course, and the rest of the film --  
as Francis' health deteriorates and Blake becomes ever more 
enamored of Penny -- explores this idea. ``Maybe I'll call you when 
I'm single,'' Blake jokes to Penny. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polish brothers hold this movie together, and not just  
because they wrote it. They clearly draw on some of their own 
experiences as twins to bring Blake and Francis to life. They 
whisper to each other in tones inaudible to anyone else, and a 
glance between them tells more than an entire soliloquy might 
elsewhere. Their Buster Keaton faces -- somber, saucer-eyed, somehow 
whimsical -- are the perfect tools to convey big emotions on small 
canvases and dispense wisdom with gravity rather than 
ridiculousness. 
</P>
<P>
	``In time, every sad ending becomes happy,'' Blake says. ``It's  
just a sad ending because the author stops telling the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Twin Falls Idaho'' has neither a sad nor a happy ending,  
in keeping with its deliberately diffuse identity. For this is a 
movie best defined by what it's not. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not a comedy. It's not a horror movie or a melodrama. It's  
not even a romance, really. It's an exploration into what it means 
to be one (not coincidentally is the heroine named ``Penny''), what 
it means to be forever two -- and, in the end, what it means to 
understand that you can be attached to another human being and 
never lose yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twin Falls Idaho,'' a Sony Pictures Classics release, is  
directed by Michael Polish from a script he co-wrote with his 
brother Mark. It is rated R.

<HEADLINE> Oxford Health Plans Beats Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Oxford Health Plans beat Wall Street's earnings  
estimates with narrower than expected second-quarter operating 
losses, even though its medical costs inched higher from last 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwalk, Conn.-based health maintenance organization said  
Thursday it had an operating loss of $13.4 million, or 16 cents a 
share, compared to an operating loss of $513.3 million or $6.41 per 
share in the same period a year ago. Results beat Wall Street 
estimates by 5 cents, according to First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $1.05 billion in the quarter, compared to $1.19  
billion in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical and administrative expenses increased since the first  
quarter. But compared to last year, Oxford's medical loss ratio -- 
the amount of each premium dollar spent to pay for medical expenses 
-- fell to 85.8 percent from 113.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford's had 1.67 million members at the end of the second  
quarter, down from 2 million in the year-ago period. The company 
has left several unprofitable markets in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of 1999, Oxford had $1.76 billion in  
revenues, down from $2.37 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had a net loss of $10.16 million, or 13 cents a  
share in the first half of 1999 compared to a loss of $558.6 
million, or $7.00 a share a year ago.

	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Sheryl Swoopes scored a game-high 28 points as  
the Houston Comets came back from a 13-point deficit to beat the 
Cleveland Rockers 71-65 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston was down 50-37 in the second half when the Comets turned  
the game around with a 28-8 run. 
</P>
<P>
	The Comets took their first lead with 7:30 remaining in the  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Cooper blocked the shot of Cleveland's Merlakia Jones,  
then sprinted down court and to take a lead pass from Swoopes and 
lay in the ball. That put Houston ahead 57-56 and the Comets never 
trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones led the Rockers with 15 points. Cooper had 16 points and  
seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland had a 34-26 lead at the half, sparked by a tight

<HEADLINE> Feds Take On High-Rate Lenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government announced settlements Thursday  
with seven companies accused of violating federal restrictions 
against exploiting people who take out high-rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlements will provide more than $572,000 in refunds to  
consumers, the Federal Trade Commission said. Others are being 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Homeowners who may not qualify for conventional loans but want  
money for house repairs or emergencies have helped fuel the 
high-interest home-equity loan market. But this surge has come with 
an explosion of deceptive business practices that cost consumers 
who can least afford it thousands of dollars, say federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once some of those people get their hooks into you, it's very  
hard to get out or get out with your equity intact,'' says FTC 
chairman Robert Pitofsky. He stressed there are legitimate lenders 
of high-rate loans. But ``we see a lot of very abusive behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act requires  
lenders to reveal the annual percentage rate, the regular payment 
amount and finance charges. The law prohibits lenders from 
concealing balloon -- or lump-sum -- payments and prevents lenders 
from making loans to people on the basis of their home equity 
rather than their ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The law also does not allow most prepayment penalties -- charges  
for refinancing the loan at a different rate. Consumers are 
entitled to a three-day cancellation period. 
</P>
<P>
	But the commission has found many lenders skirting the rules.  
</P>
<P>
	The settlements, which do not constitute an admission of  
wrongdoing, were with these companies: Barry Cooper Properties, 
Encino, Calif.; Capitol Mortgage Corp., Provo, Utah; CLS Financial 
Services, Inc., Lynnwood, Wash.; Granite Mortgage LLC, Lexington, 
Ky.; Interstate Resource Corp., Newburgh, N.Y.; LAP Financial 
Services, Inc., Louisville, Ky.; and Wasatch Credit Corp., Salt 
Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say their actions left consumers with huge debts.  
</P>
<P>
	Nellie Nicholson, 73, in need of some extra money to post bail  
for a family member, approached a lender about a $10,000 
home-equity loan. The payments were too high for her $740 monthly 
Social Security check. Her loan was refinanced by Barry Cooper 
Properties with monthly charges covering only the interest, 
sticking her with a $43,500 balloon payment after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	She still couldn't afford it, and the lender threatened to  
foreclose on Nicholson's house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think people were so dirty they could do those  
things,'' said Nicholson, of Compton, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal advocates say certain groups are particularly susceptible.  
Low-income residents who don't have a traditional bank in their 
neighborhood or elderly homeowners who might not think they can get 
a loan except through a broker are more likely to become prey, says 
Benjamin Diehl, an attorney with Bet Tzedek Legal Services in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenders use fliers, door-to-door solicitations and ads to  
attract potential borrowers to high-cost loans. Those are defined 
as loans in which more than 8 percent of the total loan amount is 
in fees or in which the annual percentage rate exceeds by more than 
10 percentage points Treasury notes of comparable maturity. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitofsky says in some cases, consumers are seeking high-cost  
loans when they could really be obtaining conventional loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Stella Adams, executive director of the North Carolina Fair  
Housing Center, said she also has seen instances in which brokers, 
who might be promised kickbacks by lenders, put consumers in loans 
with higher interest rates than their credit record warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Collusion between home repair contractors -- who offer their  
services and then direct the homeowner to a specific lender -- is 
another problem. Juanita Swinney of Louisville, Ky., said she was 
pressured into taking out a bigger loan than she needed for her 
home repairs and at a 20 percent interest rate by LAP Financial 
Services. Attorneys now are trying to prevent her home from 
foreclosure.

<HEADLINE> Hunter To Retire From Capitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying it was time to move on, longtime  
Washington Capitals center Dale Hunter announced his retirement 
Thursday and said he would take a front office position with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter played 19 years in the NHL, 12 with Washington before  
being traded to Colorado late last season. He'll turn 39 on 
Saturday, and Hunter said it takes him much longer physically to do 
things than in years past. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough thing to retire, but the body's not as good as it  
used to be,'' Hunter said. ``I'd like to thank my teammates through 
the years. They've always been behind me 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter had long been one of the team's leaders and most popular  
players. He came to the team from the then-Quebec Nordiques as a 
part of a five-player trade in June, 1987. Hunter was named captain 
at the start of the 1994-95 season and kept that job until the 
Colorado trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a manager, Dale was a manager's dream,'' Washington general  
manager George McPhee said. ``He was ... talented, smart, 
well-conditioned, committed and ... mean, mean, mean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New owner Ted Leonsis said Hunter was everything that was good  
for the Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dale Hunter is representative of everything we want the  
Capitals to be and aspire to in the future,'' Leonsis said. ``The 
fans and people of this city love Dale Hunter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter finished with 323 goals and 697 assists for 1,020 points  
and 3,565 penalty minutes in 1,407 games in his career. He had 181 
goals and 375 assists for 556 points in 872 Washington games. 
Hunter also racked up 2,003 penalty minutes. He holds a number of 
team records, and also leads the Capitals in most playoff 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter will now become the team's player development instructor.  
His main responsibilities will have to do with assisting the 
development of the franchise's prospects in the United States, 
Canada and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are delighted and very flattered that this man took the  
job,'' McPhee said. ``We have just made our organization 
stronger.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wages, Benefits Surge in 2nd Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' wages and benefits surged in the  
second quarter of the year by the largest amount since 1991, the 
government said Thursday -- good news for many workers but a fresh 
worry for Wall Street where the report rekindled concern about 
inflation and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was down 181 points late in the  
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index -- considered  
the best measure of changes in wages and benefit costs and closely 
watched by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan -- rose 1.1 
percent from April through June. That was the biggest quarterly 
change since the second-quarter of 1991, when compensation 
increased 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	With the nation's unemployment rate near a 29-year low,  
employers are scrambling to find workers and are wooing them with 
higher wages and benefits. The concern is whether those costs will 
drive up consumer prices. So far this year, however, consumer 
prices have remained stable. 
</P>
<P>
	In another much-awaited report, the country's economic growth  
slowed to a smaller-than-expected annual rate of 2.3 percent, 
following a 4.3 percent growth rate in the first three months of 
the year, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists said that could be a sign that the economy is  
not overheating even as the growth rate remains healthy, an 
indication that the Federal Reserve might not need to raise 
interest rates again this year to slow growth to a manageable 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	That news, however, was largely eclipsed by the compensation  
report, which some economists said would make it more likely the 
Fed would raise interest rates again, possibly as soon as next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chairman Greenspan has probably got the ammunition he needs to  
pull the trigger again at the Aug. 24 meeting,'' said Wells Fargo 
economist Sung Won Sohn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a red flag for the Fed and raises the odds for another  
rate hike fairly soon,'' said economist David Jones with Aubrey G. 
Lanston &AMP; Co., who predicted at least two more increases this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Other economists said the second-quarter increase in wage and  
benefit costs stands out because it follows a record low 0.4 
percent rise in the first three months of this year. And, for the 
year ending June 1999, compensation rose 3.2 percent, which 
suggests that wage inflation is still benign, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report ``provides some cover for another Fed tightening in  
August if Greenspan is itching to move,'' said Bill Cheney, an 
economist with John Hancock. ``Nevertheless, nothing in either of 
these reports suggest that such a move is necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Cynthia Latta with Standard and Poor's/DRI agreed:  
``There's nothing in either report to set off real alarm bells at 
the Fed. I think the Fed will view these reports as `Maybe we can 
sit on our hands for while.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said, ``Wage and salary growth  
remains consistent with the very strong growth in the productivity 
of our nation's economy.... Taken together, this implies low 
inflation and significant real wage growth for workers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said the gross domestic product, the  
nation's total output of goods and services, grew by $44 billion 
from April through June to an inflation-adjusted $7.8 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	New restraint by consumers, whose purchases account for  
two-thirds of the nation's economic activity and whose spending 
proclivity, contributed to the slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer spending grew by 4 percent from April through June,  
compared with a torrid 6.7 percent during the year's first three 
months. It was the slowest spending increase since the fourth 
quarter of 1997 but was still brisk, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are still out there buying but at a more subdued  
pace,'' said Robert G. Dederick, economic consultant with Northern 
Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists said the GDP moderation could be temporary,  
noting that slower-than-expected growth in business inventories and 
a drop in government spending helped hold back growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Business investment -- spending on new equipment and plants --  
meanwhile, picked up from April through June, growing by 10.8 
percent, compared with 8.5 percent in the first three months. But 
spending for new homes and apartments, feeling the pinch of rising 
mortgage rates, grew by 5.1 percent, much slower than the first 
quarter's 15.4 percent rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an inflation gauge tied to the GDP showed consumer  
prices rose more quickly during the spring, at an annual rate of 
2.1 percent, compared with 1.2 percent in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed, concerned that economic growth was too rapid and might  
spark inflation, raised interest rates by a quarter point on June 
30. Greenspan in his midyear report to Congress this week said the 
nation's central bankers have not ruled out another rate increase 
this year if inflation flares. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan told Congress that if economic data suggest that ``it  
is likely that the pace of cost and price increases will be picking 
up, the Federal Reserve will have to act promptly and forcefully.''

<HEADLINE> Total of BB Umps Let Go Rises to 22 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This time, it was the umpires who got ejected.  
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen National League umpires lost their jobs Thursday,  
bringing to nearly one-third the number of major league umps who 
will depart Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe West, famous for slamming pitcher Dennis Cook to the ground  
in 1990, and Eric Gregg, criticized for a wide strike zone in the 
1997 playoffs, were among those let go, management officials said, 
speaking on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hallion, suspended for three games earlier this month for  
bumping a player and coach, will be forced to leave, too, along 
with crew chiefs Frank Pulli and Terry Tata, who have each spent 
more than 25 years in the major leagues and worked four World 
Series apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are some of the finest umpires in the history of this  
game,'' union head Richie Phillips said. ``Terry Tata has worked 
many, many important games. What they're saying is that an umpire 
who has never even worked a spring training game in his life is 
more fit to umpire in the major leagues than Terry Tata. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the conduct of major league baseball is reprehensible  
and oppressive. What they've really done here is attempt to execute 
surrendered prisoners. I absolutely vow to fight to the death in 
this case, and I will never, ever rest until I right this wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine AL umpires were told Monday that their resignations had  
been accepted. That means 22 of the 68 major league umpires are 
departing. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulli, 64, has been a member of the NL staff since 1972. He was  
planning to retire after the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a slap in the face. This is what I deserve after 28  
years?'' Pulli said from Pittsburgh, where he was to work the 
Florida-Pirates game Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to go to war,'' he said. ``This is the biggest favor  
they ever did for this union. These guys will come together, I 
guarantee you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Rapuano, a member of Pulli's crew, was equally upset.  
</P>
<P>
	``They do this to a guy who's spent his whole life in baseball,  
making the game and other umpires better?'' he said. ``There are no 
words to describe how wrong this is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many NL umpires were angry with commissioner Bud Selig and Sandy  
Alderson, the vice president of baseball operations in the 
commissioner's office, saying the moves were made over the 
objection of NL president Len Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a plan by Bud Selig and Sandy Alderson to break the  
union,'' NL umpire Steve Rippley said, adding that the firings have 
made him consider retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've put 26 years of my life in the game,'' he said. ``I don't  
like what they've done to this group, and I don't like where 
baseball's headed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many umpires spent the day wondering if they'd be kept or let  
go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been waiting since 6:30 this morning (PDT), calling  
people and getting phone calls,'' NL ump Dana DeMuth said in Los 
Angeles before the Dodgers played Cincinnati. ``And from that time 
on, our hearts have been jumping. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're standing here with our heads in a guillotine, and the  
blade is right here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He survived, but also let go were Gary Darling, Bob Davidson,  
Bruce Dreckman, Bill Hohn, Sam Holbrook, Paul Nauert, Larry Poncino 
and Larry Vanover. 
</P>
<P>
	Ability, diversity and experience were among the factors used to  
make the decisions, several management officials said, all speaking 
on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has pushed to increase minority hiring in recent years  
and didn't want to decrease the percentage of minority umpires. 
Baseball also had to be careful not to accept the resignations of 
too many of the union's leaders, because that would open the sport 
to a charge of illegal retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips promised he will file a ``massive, massive unfair labor  
practice charge,'' and hoped to it by Monday. He cited a clause in 
the labor agreement barring ``discrimination or recrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NL umpire Jerry Crawford, the union president, said the actions  
were ``illegal, reprehensible and immoral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On July 14, the day following the All-Star game, most umpires  
resigned effective Sept. 2, thinking the tactic would force an 
early start to negotiations for a new labor contract. The current 
deal expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	But the move backfired when more than a dozen umpires refused to  
resign and baseball hired 25 replacements from Triple-A, effective 
Sept. 1. The umpires let go sent a letter Tuesday withdrawing the 
resignations, but baseball said it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, in anticipation of baseball's moves, umpires sued  
in federal court in Philadelphia. Their attempt to gain a 
restraining order was denied by U.S. District Judge Edmund V. 
Ludwig, but a hearing on the case will be scheduled after Aug. 12, 
Ludwig's office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the umpires who kept their jobs blamed the mess on the  
union leadership, headed by Crawford and Phillips, the umps' 
negotiator since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``The major league umpires have been seriously harmed because  
union leadership adopted a flawed strategy that was doomed to fail 
from the beginning,'' said the statement, agreed to by a group of 
14 umpires that included Joe Brinkman, Dale Scott and John 
Hirschbeck. 
</P>
<P>
	``(They) started this ball rolling against us -- to pursue and  
save their own jobs instead of staying strong in our union,'' 
DeMuth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires said Alderson, Oakland's former general manager and team  
president, had the final say on their future. Selig wants to shift 
supervision of umpires from the league presidents to Alderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is Alderson, who's never had any umpire capabilities and  
doesn't know a thing about my job?'' DeMuth said.

<HEADLINE>  Brooking Compared to Bennett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- When Keith Brooking lets a runner slip  
from his grasp, people will moan, ``Cornelius would have made that 
tackle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Brooking is beaten on a pass play, people will mutter,  
``I'll bet that wouldn't have happened to Bennett.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Let the inevitable comparisons begin.  
</P>
<P>
	Brooking, a second-year linebacker, is not just moving into the  
starting lineup for the NFC champion Atlanta Falcons. He's filling 
the spot occupied the last three years by Cornelius Bennett, the 
team's leading tackler on the way to the Super Bowl and one of the 
game's best defensive players over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt, there will be comparisons with Cornelius,''  
defensive end Lester Archambeau said Thursday. ``But I worked out 
with Keith during the whole offseason and, let me tell you, he's 
one intense dude. He likes competition. I think he'll take this 
challenge by the teeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooking, the Falcons' No. 1 pick in 1998, spent his rookie  
season apprenticing under Bennett. Now, the 23-year-old who grew up 
in the Atlanta suburbs and starred at Georgia Tech will get a 
chance to play a full-time role for his hometown NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I have the ability to play at this level,'' said  
Brooking, handed the starting job when Bennett was released. 
``Obviously, Cornelius was a great player. But there's no pressure 
on me to replace him. I'll just take what I learned from him last 
year and try to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooking wasted no time getting to work. Prior to the first  
practice of training camp, he strolled around the Furman University 
campus with two playbooks stuffed under his arm. He's also grown a 
goatee, adding a tinge of menace to his boyish face. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's got to get accustomed to prying himself loose from NFL  
blockers who are a lot more devious at hiding the tricks of the 
trade than their college counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The offensive linemen hold so much and they're able to get  
away with it,'' Brooking said, a bit of frustration in his voice. 
``They don't call it near as much as they did when I was in 
college. I've got to learn to get separation from those guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For one season, Brooking got a chance to learn from one of the  
best. Bennett led the Falcons with 121 tackles and was a prime 
reason the team had the second-best rushing defense in the NFL and 
ranked eighth overall in yards allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of weeks after the Super Bowl, Bennett was cut by the  
Falcons in a move that was more about age (soon-to-be-34) and cost 
(a cap figure of $3.7 million) than performance. He now plays for 
the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooking, who had 32 tackles during his rookie season, heard of  
Bennett's release during a trip to California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, my opportunity to start is better with him gone.  
But I'm not happy he's gone,'' Brooking said. ``I guess that's the 
nature of the business. It's going to happen to me one day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Safety Eugene Robinson, the eldest member of the Falcons  
defense, observes plenty of similarities between Brooking and 
Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of them are extremely fast. Both of them can cover a lot  
of ground,'' Robinson said. ``What I like about Brooks is he will 
flat-out fight you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He remembered a game last season in which Brooking took a robust  
blow to the face from an offensive guard. With blood trickling from 
his lip, the linebacker wasted no time extracting revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the next play, he smacked the guy right in the face and  
stared him down,'' Robinson said with admiration. ``You want a 
linebacker like that, a guy who is willing to eat nails.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Bennett is gone, Brooking still has a grizzled veteran  
he can rely on for advice. Jessie Tuggle, who's been starting at 
middle linebacker for the Falcons since 1989, is willing to pass on 
his wisdom to the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows exactly what he's supposed to do and he's eager to  
learn,'' Tuggle said. ``Unlike college, you can't just relay on 
your natural ability. You've got to prepare yourself mentally and 
physically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Let the inevitable learning begin.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big challenge for me,'' Brooking said. ``I've been  
stepping up to challenges my whole life. Hopefully, I can step up 
to this one.''

<HEADLINE> USA Networks Reports Net Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- USA Networks Inc., Barry Diller's cable, movie  
and direct commerce company, reported higher cash flow in the 
second quarter but still had a net loss due to spending on Internet 
startup operations and investment in new programming. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Networks had a net loss of $9.3 million compared to $12.4  
million in the same quarter a year ago. Revenues rose 13 percent to 
$804.5 million from $711.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company's cash flow, a measure widely used by investors  
that excludes taxes, interest and amortization expenses, rose a 
hefty 25 percent to $176.1 million from $141.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been investing heavily in its CitySearch  
service, a series of online guides for cities. USA expanded 
CitySearch with the acquisition announced last week of the Sidewalk 
online entertainment guide from Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	USA has also been ramping up production for its cable networks,  
including new shows for its Sci-Fi channel's Friday night lineup. 
USA also owns the Home Shopping Network, Ticketmaster, the Hotel 
Reservations Network and the Internet Shopping Network. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Diller announced the acquisition of several boutique  
film studios from Seagram Co., October Films, Gramercy Pictures and 
the remains of Polygram Filmed Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of USA rose 93 3/4 cents to $45.93 3/4 in trading on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth Slows in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. economic growth slowed abruptly to 2.3  
percent during the second quarter as consumers curtailed exuberant 
spending that had been the major force behind the recent economic 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that the gross domestic  
product, the nation's total output of goods and services, grew by 
$44 billion from April through June to an inflation-adjusted $7.8 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-quarter slowdown came after the economy surprised  
many analysts by growing at a bigger-than-expected 4.3 percent 
annual rate during the first three months of 1999. Economists have 
been predicting that slower growth would calm fears that the 
economy could overheat. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are still out there buying but at a more subdued pace,  
and if this is not just an aberration what it means is we're 
getting what was hoped for,'' said Robert G. Dederick, economic 
consultant with Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	New restraint by consumers, whose purchases account for  
two-thirds of the nation's economic activity and whose spending 
proclivity has helped the United States weather two years of global 
economic crisis, was largely responsible for putting on the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer spending grew by 4 percent from April through June,  
compared with a torrid 6.7 percent during the first three months of 
1999. It was the slowest spending increase since the fourth quarter 
of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	An inflation gauge tied to the GDP showed consumer prices rose  
more quickly during the spring, at an annual rate of 2.1 percent, 
compared to 1.2 percent in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report today, the Labor Department said its  
Employment Cost Index, considered the best measure of changes in 
wages and benefit costs, rose 1.1 percent in the second quarter. 
That's the biggest quarterly increase since 1991, but followed a 
record low 0.4 percent rise during the first three months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest unemployment rate in 29 years has raised fears that  
employers scrambling for workers will have to raise wages, and 
therefore prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Americans filing initial claims for unemployment  
benefits fell last week to the lowest level in two years, the Labor 
Department also reported, indicating the labor market continues to 
tighten. Jobless claims fell 40,000 to 275,000, lowering a 
four-week moving average of claims to 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned that economic growth is too rapid and might spark  
inflation, the Federal Reserve in June raised interest rates by a 
quarter of a point. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan in his midyear 
report to Congress this week said the nation's central bankers have 
not ruled out another rate increase this year if inflation flares. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street investors reacted with trepidation about inflation  
signals in today's economic reports, pulling the Dow Jones average 
of industrial stocks down 130 points within 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts said the numbers should not ring alarm bells,  
since wage and price increases are only moderate after an unusual 
lull. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a sense we're really having what Dr. Greenspan ordered and  
if that's the case I would suggest that he doesn't at least 
immediately need to do anything to help it along,'' Dederick said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the lingering international financial crisis, overseas  
markets for American products have dwindled and a flood of imports 
from troubled countries trying to unload their own goods here at 
discount prices has helped keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there has been some recent improvement in the trade  
picture as foreign economies have begun to recover. The record U.S. 
trade deficit shaved just 0.75 percent off total economic growth in 
the second quarter of 1999, compared to a 2.23 percent offset in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, investment by American businesses -- spending on new  
equipment and plants -- picked up from April through June, growing 
by 10.8 percent, compared to 8.5 percent in the first three months 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising mortgage rates, however, dampened the housing market,  
with spending on new homes and apartments growing by 5.1 percent, 
much slower than the 15.4 percent rate in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though consumers tempered their buying spree in the second  
quarter, they are still spending more than they earn. The personal 
savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable income, fell to 
a record low: negative 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Albanians Greet Albright in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright, greeted by ethnic Albanians as a liberator, pledged today 
that ``as long as you choose, Kosovo will remain your home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have been through a terrible ordeal this past year. ...  
Much as been lost and cannot be regained,'' Albright, the 
highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the Serbian province since 
the 78-day NATO air war, told a cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that today we may pledge that here in Kosovo never  
again will people with guns come in the night, never again will 
houses and villages be burned, and never again will there be 
massacres and mass graves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 Albanians, many chanting ``U.S.A.,'' turned out to  
greet Albright, whom they affectionately call ``Nona,'' or Mother. 
American, Albanian and British flags waved in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary of state came to Pristina for a firsthand look at  
postwar reconstruction. The crowd responded enthusiastically when 
she declared that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``should 
answer for his crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She is the best woman in the world,'' said Lirie Hana, 54,  
``She is the one who made it possible to breathe free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Ibrahim Hallaci, 44: ``I'm here to await and thank her for  
everything she did for us. As a simple citizen, I am very, very 
happy that I could come and chant her name in freedom for which she 
worked so hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Albright got a hostile reception when she visited a  
Serbian Orthodox monastery in Gracanica, just south of Pristina. 
About 150 people, mostly Serb men, chanted ``Serbia, Serbia'' and 
``Slobo, Slobo,'' referring to Milosevic. Some shouted obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
	When Albright's spokesman, James Rubin, alighted from his car he  
was greeted with a thumbs-down gesture and several shouted an 
obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright went first to the headquarters of the NATO peacekeeping  
force, known as KFOR, where she met with the NATO commander, 
British Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson, and the chief U.N. administrator in 
the province, Bernard Kouchner of France. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously there's a lot of work to be done, but there's also a  
tremendous amount of enthusiasm and willingness to work,'' Albright 
said after the briefings. ``I am very encouraged by the cooperation 
between KFOR and UNMIK,'' the U.N. Mission in Kosovo. ``They are 
working well together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the Serbs and what she would say to local Serb  
leaders in a meeting later, she said: ``I will tell them that the 
system is here to protect them. KFOR and UNMIK will cooperate for 
everybody's future. But don't forget that some disgusting things 
happened here. But we want them to stay if we want to build a 
multiethnic Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a tense moment earlier when a gunshot rang out as  
Hashim Thaci, head of the Kosovo Liberation Army and de facto 
leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, pulled up to the U.N. 
headquarters for a meeting with Albright. U.N. security agents 
rushed ran out of the building and Thaci's guards surrounded his 
car. Many bystanders dropped to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	British soldiers guarding the area said there was no indication  
where the shot came from or where it might have been aimed. 
Albright was inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving Rome for Pristina on Wednesday, Albright,  
referring to the pace of reconstruction, told reporters: ``Clearly 
one would wish that this were moving faster.'' But she decline to 
criticize the U.N. operation attempting to resettle hundreds of 
thousands who were displaced from Kosovo during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	As for destruction from Serb assaults on Kosovo Albanians and  
from NATO bombing, she said that, based on preliminary estimates, 
there ``has been less damage than initially feared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said $500 million the United States has pledged to help feed  
and house refugees returning to Kosovo was ``a good start,'' 
although she emphasized that Western allies will have to pick up 
the brunt of reconstruction costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, more than 60 nations and dozens of international aid  
agencies have pledged $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process of building up is proceeding more slowly than we  
had anticipated,'' Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said at a 
news conference with Albright on Wednesday after the two had a 
working lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright was to meet with U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo, plus  
officials of the Kosovo Liberation Army and political influence 
groups. She also was expected to fly over some areas where there is 
evidence of atrocities from the Serb offensive against the 
province, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the Kosovo visit, Albright will join President Clinton  
on Friday for a conference in Sarajevo with other world leaders on 
Balkans reconstruction. Milosevic will not be there. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said the  
conference would underscore the isolation of Milosevic and remind 
Serbs that ``he has brought them four wars and a ruined economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a good deal of disaffection (in Serbia) with Slobodan  
Milosevic, and I think that one of the most important elements of 
Friday will be the empty chair,'' Berger said Wednesday in 
Washington. ``Serbia will be the only country not there, (the) only 
country not part of an enterprise that means rebuilding and rebirth 
and growth and better lives for the people of the region.''

the province, Bernard Kouchner of France. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously there's a lot of work to be done, but there's also a  
tremendous amount of enthusiasm and willingness to work,'' Albright 
said after the briefings. ``I am very encouraged by the cooperation 
between KFOR and UNMIK,'' the U.N. Mission in Kosovo. ``They are 
working well together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the Serbs and what she would say to local Serb  
leaders in a meeting later, she said: ``I will tell them that the 
system is here to protect them. KFOR and UNMIK will cooperate for 
everybody's future. But don't forget that some disgusting things 
happened here. But we want them to stay if we want to build a 
multiethnic Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a tense moment earlier when a gunshot rang out as  
Hashim Thaci, head of the Kosovo Liberation Army and de facto 
leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, pulled up to the U.N. 
headquarters for a meeting with Albright. U.N. security agents 
rushed ran out of the building and Thaci's guards surrounded his 
car. Many bystanders dropped to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	British soldiers guarding the area said there was no indication  
where the shot came from or where it might have been aimed. 
Albright was inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving Rome for Pristina on Wednesday, Albright,  
referring to the pace of reconstruction, told reporters: ``Clearly 
one would wish that this were moving faster.'' But she decline to 
criticize the U.N. operation attempting to resettle hundreds of 
thousands who were displaced from Kosovo during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	As for destruction from Serb assaults on Kosovo Albanians and  
from NATO bombing, she said that, based on preliminary estimates, 
there ``has been less damage than initially feared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said $500 million the United States has pledged to help feed  
and house refugees returning to Kosovo was ``a good start,'' 
although she emphasized that Western allies will have to pick up 
the brunt of reconstruction costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, more than 60 nations and dozens of international aid  
agencies have pledged $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process of building up is proceeding more slowly than we  
had anticipated,'' Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said at a 
news conference with Albright on Wednesday after the two had a 
working lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright was to meet with U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo, plus  
officials of the Kosovo Liberation Army and political influence 
groups. She also was expected to fly over some areas where there is 
evidence of atrocities from the Serb offensive against the 
province, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the Kosovo visit, Albright will join President Clinton  
on Friday for a conference in Sarajevo with other world leaders on 
Balkans reconstruction. Milosevic will not be there. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said the  
conference would underscore the isolation of Milosevic and remind 
Serbs that ``he has brought them four wars and a ruined economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a good deal of disaffection (in Serbia) with Slobodan  
Milosevic, and I think that one of the most important elements of 
Friday will be the empty chair,'' Berger said Wednesday in 
Washington. ``Serbia will be the only country not there, (the) only 
country not part of an enterprise that means rebuilding and rebirth 
and growth and better lives for the people of the region.''

<HEADLINE> Andrea Doria Claims More Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- More than 40 years after the Andrea Doria went  
down, the ship is still claiming lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve divers have perished since 1981 while exploring the rusty  
wreck in the waters off Nantucket -- two of them in the past two 
weeks. Three divers died last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some ran out of air. Some were killed by problems with their  
scuba gear. Others got lost or tangled in the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like walking through someone's house laying on its side --  
stairwells that would be up and down now go sideways,'' said Dave 
Cangarl, 37, who has made nine dives to the 697-foot wreck. ``But 
there's dust and dirt and it's pitch black in the house. It's very 
disorienting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Andrea Doria, a floating palace that once crossed the ocean  
in style, was headed from Genoa, Italy, to New York when it 
collided with a Swedish ship on a foggy night in 1956, killing 51 
people. The Italian luxury liner lies at the bottom of the Atlantic 
in about 200 feet of water, about 50 miles southeast of Nantucket. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of its allure for divers is that the ship lies on its side  
relatively intact, and it's full of souvenirs -- especially pieces 
of china. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get to about 130, 140 feet, and the whole bottom opens up.  
You see a partial profile of the wreck. It's an awesome scene,'' 
said Steve Bielenda, owner of the Wahoo, a boat from New York's 
Long Island that takes divers to the Andrea Doria. 
</P>
<P>
	All five of the most recent victims had been diving from the  
same boat, the Seeker, which also sails out of Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest victim was 52-year-old Charles McGurr, an auto  
mechanic from Brick, N.J., who worked summers as a crewman on the 
Seeker. He failed to emerge from a dive with two companions 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he arrived down at the wreck, he indicated that he was  
not feeling well'' and swam to the surface, said Lt. Bill McGintee 
of the East Hampton, N.Y., police. Results of the autopsy were not 
available Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, technological improvements in divers' breathing  
equipment have made the Andrea Doria more accessible to 
recreational divers. Bielenda said he suspects the wreck has become 
too popular. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a certified diver, it doesn't make you qualified to  
dive the Andrea Doria,'' he said. ``It's like using Mount Everest 
for a training ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Christopher Murley, 44, of Cincinnati, died as he  
swam along the surface in preparation for a dive. An autopsy 
determined he had heart trouble and drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seeker's captain, Daniel Crowell, did not return a message  
left at the marina where the boat ties up. 
</P>
<P>
	Although all five of the most recent victims had been diving off  
the Seeker, diving consultant Robert Wass said the accidents could 
have happened from any boat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boat captain is pretty much of a taxi cab driver. These  
guys are supposed to know what they're doing,'' said Wass, who is 
examining McGurr's equipment on behalf of Long Island authorities.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom Meet Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. and MCI WorldCom Inc. posted strong  
second-quarter results Thursday, with both companies trumpeting 
their progress on the divergent paths they've chosen for melding 
telephone calls with the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's earnings for the April-June period rose 8.2 percent  
compared with the same operations a year earlier. The profit of 
$1.59 billion, or 49 cents per share, edged most Wall Street 
forecasts for what was AT&AMP;T's first full quarter since the purchase 
of Tele-Communications Inc. -- the opening move in an ambitious 
transition from phone wires to cable TV wires for communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from continuing operations totaled $15.82 billion, an  
increase of 6.7 percent from the combined $14.83 billion generated 
in last year's second quarter by AT&AMP;T, TCI's cable systems and an 
Internet business acquired from IBM. However, consumer services, 
including AT&AMP;T's core long-distance calling business, suffered a 
3.4 percent decline in quarterly revenues to $5.50 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, which has placed the greatest emphasis on  
fiber-optic and wireless networks to carry floods Internet data 
between businesses, tripled its second-quarter earnings to $857 
million, excluding the impact of the company's investment in 
Embratel in Brazil. The profit amounted to 44 cents per share, 
matching most analyst projections. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 16 percent to $8.14 billion, excluding Embratel  
and sales of $120 million from the SHL network services unit sold 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to their profits and revenues, both companies  
stressed their successes during the quarter in positioning 
themselves for the ongoing explosion of Internet traffic from data, 
phone calls and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's new Broadband and Internet Services unit, which includes  
the cable operations acquired with TCI, had second-quarter revenues 
of $1.42 billion, an increase of 7.6 percent from what those 
operations generated a year ago before the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The TCI deal and the pending acquisition of MediaOne Group, the  
nation's fourth-largest cable TV company, are the linchpins of 
AT&AMP;T's plan to bypass the local Bell monopolies for delivering 
local and long-distance telephone calls -- packaged with TV and 
high-speed Internet access over the same cable wire. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, the centerpiece of AT&AMP;T's cable foray has been a pilot  
program in Fremont, Calif. In the first extensive update on that 
trial, AT&AMP;T said Thursday it has about 1,000 cable-telephone 
customers in Fremont, more than half of whom had opted for multiple 
phone-line packages. 
</P>
<P>
	Most striking about Fremont, industry analysts and company  
executives said, was that the service was being marketed through a 
cold-calling campaign with a success rate of 18 percent to 20 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the annoying calls you get during dinner. Normally,  
only 4 percent of those will be result in a sale,'' said Mel 
Marten, an industry analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. The 
response so far in Fremont ``is an extremely high acceptance rate 
for that type of marketing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of high-speed Internet access over cable lines, there  
were 83,000 subscribers to AT&AMP;T's majority-owned Excite At Home 
service, which is currently available to 3 million homes, including 
1.4 million that buy AT&AMP;T cable service. 
</P>
<P>
	By year-end, about 5 million homes are expected to have the  
necessary digital access for Internet service, with the number of 
Excite At Home subscribers expected to reach 175,000 to 200,000, 
said Leo Hindery, the head of AT&AMP;T Broadband and Internet Services. 
</P>
<P>
	At MCI WorldCom, executives stressed how revenues from data and  
Internet traffic now account for about a third of the company's 
overall communications revenues. They also stressed the increasing 
savings -- $319 million in the second quarter -- generated by 
switching that traffic to company-owned ``backbones'' of 
fiber-optic cables from lines that were leased prior to the merger 
between WorldCom and MCI Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our communications services revenue growth is being driven by  
continued strong top line performance in data, Internet and 
international (services) -- three of the fastest growing and most 
profitable areas within communications,'' said Bernard J. Ebbers, 
president and chief executive of MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of both companies fell amid a broad downturn in trading  
Thursday. AT&AMP;T was off $1.43 3/4 to $53.50 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, while MCI WorldCom was down $2.56 1/4 to $84.12 1/2 on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Galaxy's Hermosillo Sidelined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Los Angeles Galaxy forward Carlos  
Hermosillo will miss Saturday's game at Chicago because of a 
strained lower back, the team announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermosillo was a late scratch from the starting lineup for  
Wednesday night's 1-0 loss at Colorado. He returned to Southern 
California for treatment Thursday instead of accompanying his 
teammates to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermasillo sustained the injury last week. It is uncertain when  
he will return to action. 
</P>
<P>
	The forward has scored four goals in six matches since joining  
the club on June 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermosillo will be one of three Galaxy starters to miss  
Saturday's game. Defender Robin Fraser and forward Cobi Jones are 
playing for the U.S. national team in the Confederations Cup in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles will regain the services of starting midfielder  
Danny Pena, who missed Wednesday night's match after accumulating 
an excessive amount of caution points.

<HEADLINE> Rams' Faulk Absent for Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -- Marshall Faulk's former team began a  
three-day practice with his new one Thursday, but neither Faulk nor 
his Indianapolis Colts successor were around to see it. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk, who was traded from the Colts to the St. Louis Rams just  
before the draft, has been holding out for a week over a contract 
dispute. Also holding out is Edgerrin James, the first-round draft 
pick the Colts chose to replace Faulk as their running back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later, he has to play football,'' Rams coach Dick  
Vermeil said of Faulk. ``He's not going to be a plastic surgeon, 
I'll tell you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis has upped its ante in the negotiations, increasing its  
seven-year offer from $38.5 million to $45 million. All of the 
additional money, however, is spread out over the final three years 
of the contract, meaning Faulk might never receive it. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil said Rams executive vice president Jay Zygmunt and  
Faulk's agent, Rocky Arcenaux, talked by telephone Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams knew that Faulk, who led the NFL in all-purpose yardage  
last season with 1,319 rushing yards and 908 receiving yards, 
wanted a new deal when they traded a second- and fifth-round pick 
in this spring's draft to acquire him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we would try to do what is right,'' Vermeil said.  
``Well get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Colts coach Jim Mora said there was no new word in  
the negotiations with James, the fourth overall player taken this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams will hold two practices Friday and then conclude the  
joint session with a scrimmage Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Energy Dept. Plans Training Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department is ordering an expansion  
in its campaign against espionage, moving the focus beyond the 
nuclear weapons labs and into the research and manufacturing 
centers that handle classified security-related information. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is ordering today a one-day  
suspension of operations at Energy Department research and 
defense-related sites next week for training on espionage 
prevention and other national security issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson accepted the recommendation of his newly installed  
security chief that a stand-down occur department-wide at 
defense-related work sites that have not yet had their 
counterespionage and information security systems reviewed. The 
main point of the stand-down, scheduled for Aug. 3, is to give 
employees an entire mandatory day of training on information 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every one of our workers must realize -- if they don't already  
-- that every job carries with it a security obligation,'' 
Richardson said in an Energy Department statement to be released 
today, a copy of which was obtained Wednesday by The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ordering this action to ensure that DOE is doing  
everything possible to protect America's secrets and sensitive 
technologies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The stand-down will be the third by the Energy Department. The  
first covered the nuclear weapons labs, including the sprawling 
facility at Los Alamos, N.M., the suspected target of a Chinese 
espionage effort. The second was a shutdown of the secure computer 
systems at the weapons labs after reports that a Los Alamos 
scientist suspected of spying for China had shifted sensitive 
weapons files from a secure computer system to one accessible to 
outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
	The weapons labs are not covered by the latest order.  
</P>
<P>
	The stand-down will cover sites that conduct classified work.  
Among them are the Savannah River site near Augusta, Ga.; the Y-12 
Plant at Oak Ridge, Tenn.; the Allied Signal plant in Kansas City, 
Mo.; Pantex in Amarillo, Texas; Idaho National Engineering and 
Environmental Lab near Idaho Falls; the Hanford site in Richland, 
Wash.; the Nevada test site north of Las Vegas; and the Rocky Flats 
site near Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The stand-down was ordered on the advice of DOE's new security  
chief, Eugene Habiger, former head of the U.S. Strategic Command. 
</P>
<P>
	Some additional sites that deal with research, academic  
exchanges and other nonclassified work will be shut before the end 
of August. 
</P>
<P>
	``Security must remain an inherent part of our day-to-day work  
ethic and culture,'' the retired general said. ``The stand-down is 
a vital next step to ensure that all of our facilities, regardless 
of their missions, are living up to that special trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Employees will attend seminars and conferences on terrorism,  
cyber-security, export regulations, computer hacking, problems 
surrounding disgruntled employees and errors. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Congress have complained Energy employees are  
not sufficiently aware of security needs.

<HEADLINE> Groups Wary of Cable-Web Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several major consumer groups and media policy  
organizations are urging federal regulators to make sure that cable 
companies offering high-speed Internet service don't control the 
content consumers receive. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent to the Federal Communications Commission today,  
the groups, including Consumers Union and the Center for Media 
Education, warned that under current policy, cable companies could 
discriminate against material from providers with whom they are not 
partnered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Federation of America and the Media Access Project  
also signed the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe, the current FCC policy, if unchanged, would strip  
the Internet of the very qualities that have made it one of the 
most powerful vehicles for expression and economic growth ever 
created,'' the organizations wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Although cable companies have provided assurances that they  
would allow access to all Internet content, the groups argued that 
there are several ways in which the companies could skew consumers 
toward certain material. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the companies could send material not from  
affiliated partners at slower transmission speeds or place 
restraints on the ability of users to upload or download certain 
kinds of data, they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Small businesses will be placed at a disadvantage to larger  
established companies who can afford to affiliate with a cable 
company, they added. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups called on the FCC to create guidelines for ensuring  
fair competition in the marketplace for high-speed cable Internet 
service, also known as broadband.

<HEADLINE> Noted Mare Fanfreluche Dies at 32 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- On the racetrack, Fanfreluche was a  
champion, finishing in the money in 20 of 21 starts as a 2- and 
3-year-old, and earning Canadian Horse of the Year honors in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	She was as much a success in the foaling barn, where she gave  
birth to 20 foals, five of whom went on to win stakes races. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, though, thoroughbred historians will remember  
Fanfreluche, who was euthanized last week at 32, as the target of a 
1977 ``horsenapping'' that was one of racing's most bizarre 
episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Stolen from a pasture at Claiborne Farm in Paris while she was  
in foal to Triple Crown winner Secretariat, Fanfreluche was found 
5 1/2 months later in the southwestern Kentucky town of Tompkinsville. 
Farmer Larry McPherson found the bedraggled mare walking a nearby 
road, took her home, renamed her Brandy and was using her as a 
riding horse. 
</P>
<P>
	A Paducah man, William Michael McCandless, was later convicted  
of stealing the mare, who had been valued at $500,000. However, 
those involved with the case said a motive has never been 
established. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a missing link in there: How and why did it happen to  
us?'' Claiborne manager John Sosby said Wednesday after learning 
Fanfreluche was euthanized at Big Sink Farm near Versailles, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Published reports listed the cause of death as the infirmities  
of old age. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 24, 1977, Fanfreluche was being boarded at Seth  
Hancock's Claiborne Farm after being bred to Secretariat when a 
thief, or thieves, cut through a series of fences and spirited her 
away from her pasture. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI quickly involved itself in the search for the missing  
mare, which eventually extended overseas, and theories abounded as 
to a motive. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believed the thieves were targeting Fanfreluche's owner,  
Canadian financier Jean-Louis Levesque. New York Times columnist 
Red Smith suggested the thieves had copied the plot of the Dick 
Francis novel ``Blood Sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Larry McPherson had found Fanfreluche the day after  
she was stolen, wandering on a nearby road with rope burns on her 
ears and neck and ankles. She had evidently broken loose from her 
captor. 
</P>
<P>
	When no one turned up to claim the horse his family named  
Brandy, McPherson kept her as a saddle horse. She lived in a tiny 
shed and a pasture that was an empty lot enclosed by a single 
strand of electric fence. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone calls from informants inspired by a $25,000 reward posted  
by Levesque and Hancock helped investigators track Fanfreluche to 
McPherson's farm in December. Just the week before, McPherson had 
turned down a $200 offer for her from a horse trader. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosby went with Hancock to get the mare.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to see her,'' he said. ``We thought we'd never see  
her again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, McCandless was indicted by federal authorities on  
charges that he tried to fix three races at Louisville's Churchill 
Downs in 1996 and 1997. McCandless allegedly stuffed small sponges 
into the nostrils of horses to limit their breathing and interfere 
with their speed. He remains a fugitive in that case. 
</P>
<P>
	Fanfreluche gave birth to her Secretariat foal in February 1978.  
Levesque named the colt Sain et Sauf -- French for ``safe and 
sound'' -- and he went on to win three races and $34,836. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great finish would have been if the colt had won the  
(Kentucky) Derby,'' Sosby said. ``That would have been the ending 
of a fairy-book story.''

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn of New Y2K Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two of the government's top computer security  
experts are warning that some programmers hired to fix Year 2000 
problems may be quietly installing malicious software code to 
sabotage companies or give themselves access to sensitive 
information after the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	The ominous warnings were part of testimony prepared for a  
hearing today about the so-called Y2K glitch and cyberterrorism 
before the Senate's Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology 
Problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Vatis, director of the FBI's National Infrastructure  
Protection Center, said experts hired by U.S. companies to fix 
their computers could secretly program ``trap doors'' -- ways to let 
them gain access later -- or add malicious code, such as a logic 
bomb or time-delayed virus that could disrupt systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``While systems have been and will continue to be extensively  
tested, the probability of finding malicious code is extremely 
small,'' agreed Richard Schaeffer, director of the Defense 
Department's Infrastructure and Information Assurance program. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither expert suggested the possible scope of the problem.  
</P>
<P>
	Schaeffer said problems are complicated by the New Year's  
rollover, when some computers programmed to recognize only the last 
two digits of a year may mistake 2000 for a full century earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be difficult to distinguish between a true Y2K event  
and some other anomaly caused by a perpetrator with malicious 
intent,'' Schaeffer wrote in prepared testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Both experts said the risks were exacerbated by the amount of  
software repaired by companies overseas. Vatis called the situation 
``a unique opportunity for foreign countries and companies to 
access, steal from or disrupt sensitive national and proprietary 
information systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Since any vulnerabilities that are implanted will persist as  
long as the software is in place, this is a problem that will last 
well beyond January 1, 2000,'' Vatis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vatis recommended that companies thoroughly check the  
backgrounds of companies they hire for software repairs. He also 
said they should test for the existence of trap doors after the 
repairs, possibly even hiring teams to try to electronically crack 
into their own networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest warnings come on the heels of new disclosures about  
White House plans to create a government-wide security network to 
protect the nation's most important computer systems from hackers, 
thieves, terrorists and hostile countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The 148-page proposal from the Clinton administration describes  
building an elaborate network of electronic obstacles, monitors and 
analyzers to prevent and watch for potentially suspicious activity 
on federal computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil liberties groups complain that the security tools also  
would make possible unprecedented electronic monitoring, especially 
because of the increasingly widespread use of computers by the 
government in almost every aspect of its citizens' daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House defended the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are very concerned about protecting privacy rights,'' said  
Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger. ``But there is 
also a privacy right in not having hostile entities attack systems. 
We're not only talking about 17-year-old kids in their basement. 
We're talking about governments that we know are developing systems 
to get access to our computer systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first 500 intrusion monitors would be installed on  
nonmilitary government computers next year, according to a draft 
copy of the proposal obtained by The Associated Press. The full 
system would be completed by May 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also suggests ways to convince private companies to  
monitor their corporate computer networks and share information 
about threats. But it said explicitly that the government will not 
force companies to permit federal monitoring of their systems.

<HEADLINE> Japan Penalizes Credit Suisse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese regulators are revoking the banking  
license of a unit of the Credit Suisse Group because it helped 
Japanese companies hide losses, they said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities may also seek charges against the company for  
allegedly trying to block their probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The punishment is severe because Credit Suisse Financial  
Products ``systematically tried to block the investigation,'' said 
Hakuo Yanagisawa, the head of Japan's Financial Reconstruction 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo branch of Credit Suisse Financial Products will lose  
its license on Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zurich, Switzerland-based Credit Suisse Group said Thursday  
that it will not challenge the punishment, although it considers it 
``disproportionate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse also said it will remain active in Japan through  
its other operations here. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements follow a seven-month probe into financial  
products that Credit Suisse allegedly sold to about 60 Japanese 
corporations to help them hide losses from regulators and investors 
by temporarily shifting them to other companies. Some of the latter 
existed only on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse itself discovered and reported a problem with a  
few employees delaying a probe, then apologized and dismissed eight 
people, it has said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Reconstruction Commission, which heads Japan's  
efforts to revive its debt-ridden financial system, held a meeting 
with senior officials of Credit Suisse before deciding what action 
to take, Yanagisawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The punishment was necessary because Credit Suisse disrupted  
Japanese financial markets, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Thursday, the head of another regulatory agency said the  
government might file criminal complaints against Credit Suisse 
Financial Products and another unit, Credit Suisse Trust and 
Banking Co., involving obstruction of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Masaharu Hino, who heads the Financial Supervisory Agency, a  
smaller agency in charge of monitoring financial markets, said the 
agency can offer supporting evidence to law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Hino also said his agency will impose additional punishments, as  
yet undecided, on local units of Credit Suisse.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Frank To Have Heart Bypass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, one of  
Congress' most outspoken liberal Democrats, is scheduled for heart 
bypass surgery Friday at the National Naval Medical Center in 
Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank, 59, a 10-term lawmaker with a family history of heart  
problems, is having the surgery to correct clogged arteries, he 
told reporters Thursday in his Capitol Hill office. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is to prevent something bad from happening,'' he said,  
noting that he has had only mild chest pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank suffered a mild heart attack in 1990. He had angioplasty  
treatment, in which a flexible tube with a tiny balloon at the tip 
is inserted into a blocked artery to clear the blockage. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is having the surgery in suburban Washington to  
minimize its impact on his work, and he will try to vote next week 
in the House. However, he has canceled speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	After Congress' summer recess begins Aug. 7, Frank said he will  
meet with constituents in his home district.

<HEADLINE> Firms Share $1.4B From Tobacco Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A dozen law firms that participated in Mississippi's successful  
battle with the tobacco industry have been awarded $1.4 billion in 
fees and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the level of risk that we undertook, which included the  
expenditure of millions of dollars of our own money, the attorneys' 
fees awarded in this case is entirely justified and consistent with 
precedent,'' Richard Scruggs, whose Pascagoula firm will get nearly 
$340 million, said after the award was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tobacco Fee Arbitration Panel's decision gives the firms an  
amount equal to about one-third of the state's $4.2 billion share 
of the $206 billion national tobacco settlement. The money for the 
lawyers will paid by cigarette makers and will not come out of the 
state's share. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the panel awarded five law firms that participated  
in Massachusetts' lawsuit $775 million in fees and expenses, which 
is equal to 9.3 percent of that state's $8.3 billion share of the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint statement from Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco  
Co. and Lorillard Tobacco Co., called the award excessive, saying 
the Massachusetts lawyers ``did not invest the same amount of 
effort as earlier states.''

<HEADLINE> Life Expectance Climbs 30 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Americans can expect to live nearly 30 years  
longer than they did around the turn of the century because of 
clean drinking water, antibiotics and other breakthroughs that have 
helped control infectious diseases, the government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1900, the overall death rate from diseases like pneumonia  
and tuberculosis has declined from 797 per 100,000 to 59 per 
100,000 in 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
said. As a result, life expectancy during that period increased 
from 47.3 years to 76.1. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the conclusions might be that investments made in the  
tools that are needed to monitor, diagnose and treat and prevent 
infectious diseases pay dividends,'' said Dr. James Hughes, 
director of the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst U.S. epidemic of an infectious disease was in 1918,  
when the flu killed 500,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Pneumonia, TB and diarrhea/enteritis were the three leading  
causes of death in 1900. Today, the leading causes are heart 
disease, cancer and stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on, improvements in sanitation, hygiene and living  
conditions helped control outbreaks of cholera, TB and other 
diseases, the CDC said in the latest in a series of reports on 
health improvements in the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Chlorination contributed to the decrease of waterborne diseases,  
while improvements in housing to reduce crowding helped in the 
fight against TB, which in 1900 killed 194 of every 100,000 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvements had a profound effect on children under 5, who  
in 1900 accounted for 30.4 percent of all deaths. That dropped to 
just 1.4 in 1997, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1910s, serologic testing became a basic tool to diagnose  
many diseases like syphilis and gonorrhea. The development of cell 
cultures in the 1930s paved the way for large-scale production of 
live or heat-killed viral vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1940s ushered in use of antibiotics like penicillin, which  
was used to treat sick and wounded U.S. soldiers. And state and 
local health departments began instituting childhood vaccination 
programs, which helped virtually eliminate often-fatal diseases 
like smallpox and polio. 
</P>
<P>
	During the later part of the century, advances in molecular  
biology technology have further improved testing, diagnosing and 
monitoring disease, the CDC said. But the successes in reducing 
deaths led to some complacency, the health agency warned. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1980s saw the emergence of AIDS and other new diseases and  
the re-emergence of TB and pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're increasingly seeing problems with antibiotic resistance  
making some of the infections harder to treat,'' Hughes said. ``So 
these microbes that created these illnesses continue to evolve.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Speeds Corn Ripening / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- This summer's scorching temperatures  
have caused corn and other vegetables to ripen faster, creating a 
glut that has caused prices to plunge for already struggling 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	One farmer left 70 acres of corn in the fields to wither in the  
sun after deciding he would lose more money by harvesting it, said 
Rod Parker, manager of the Northern Neck Farmers Market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heat has really compressed the season,'' Parker said this  
week. ``The boys who are doing sweet corn are going to take a great 
big loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The farmer's market, one of four in Virginia that process, wash  
and find buyers for produce, traditionally sells sweet corn 
wholesale to East Coast grocery chains for about $6.50 per crate, 
but the price has fallen to about $4.50, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, those prices are for farmers who have been able to  
irrigate their fields during the drought that has baked northern 
Virginia to a crisp. 
</P>
<P>
	The prices of cantaloupes, cucumbers and squash also are down  
for farmers because of the faster growing season, Parker said. The 
farmers market likes to sell cucumbers for $10 a crate but has been 
able to move them wholesale for about $7.50. Squash is down to 
$4.50, from $6.50. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is the same in Southampton County at the state's  
Southeast Farmers Market, where sweet corn is a smaller crop. Much 
of the 22 acres of sweet corn harvested and brought to market has 
not sold because of the glut, said Louis Gary, interim manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``We moved part of it, but that's all,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the glut, supermarkets have not dropped the price of  
sweet corn, agricultural officials said. And consumers face little 
danger of having no corn to buy later in the year, because New York 
and states to the north with later harvests will meet the demand, 
they added. 
</P>
<P>
	The pain to Virginia farmers has been exacerbated by the  
mountains of produce being sent to market from Georgia, North 
Carolina and as far away as Canada, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's simply too much produce on the market right now'' for  
farmers to make a profit, he said. ``You can't pick corn for $4'' 
per crate. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is the same at the Southwest Farmers Market in,  
although the big product there is tomatoes, which are selling for 
$8 to $11 per 25-pound box. Last year, tomatoes sold for $14 a box, 
manager Kevin Semones said. 
</P>

	ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- It's a lousy year for chili. Just ask farmers  
in New Mexico's chili heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	Samples from chili fields in Hatch, Rincon, Mesilla, Las Cruces  
and the Uvas Valley were tested this year and the testing has 
revealed an old enemy -- the beet curly top virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are sadly familiar with the virus, which caused major  
losses in New Mexico's 1995 chili crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Chili plants infected with curly top virus develop yellow,  
curled leaves and stiff, thickened stems that break with a snap. 
Diseased plants may produce a few dull, wrinkled peppers that ripen 
prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico might lose half its chili crop this year, farm  
experts have said. Last year's healthier crop was valued at $58 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than 98 percent of the samples came back infected with  
beet curly top,'' said Natalie Goldberg, a plant pathologist with 
the Cooperative Extension Service at New Mexico State University in 
Las Cruces. ``That was the only viral disease detected in those 
plants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An insect called the beet leafhopper spreads the curly top  
virus. Once it has been transmitted to the plants, there is no 
cure.

<HEADLINE> Committee Approves Fuel Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to capitalize on the phase-out of a  
fuel additive, a Senate committee voted Thursday to authorize $300 
million in research on new ways to make ethanol and other chemicals 
from crops, grass and trees. 
</P>
<P>
	The action by the Senate Agriculture Committee is intended to  
boost farm income and follows a decision this week by the 
Environmental Protection Agency to curtail use of methane-based 
MTBE because of evidence it contaminates groundwater. 
</P>
<P>
	MTBE's chief rival as a fuel additive is ethanol, which now is  
made from corn but theoretically can be processed from any plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethanol, already heavily subsidized by the government, costs  
more to make than MTBE and primarily is made in the Midwest, which 
makes it difficult now to get it to West Coast and Northeast 
markets. Researchers hope to find ways to make ethanol more 
cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
	Plastics also could be made from plant material, known as  
biomass. 
</P>
<P>
	``This research initiative holds the promise of meeting clean  
fuel demands by bringing to the market a competitively priced 
alternative fuel by 2005,'' said the committee's chairman, Sen. 
Dick Lugar, R-Ind.

<HEADLINE> GOP Unable To Produce HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican prospects for moving HMO  
legislation to the House floor next week looked increasingly dim 
Thursday as GOP leaders struggled to write a bill that could keep 
the fractured party together. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a 70-yard field goal,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert said  
Thursday after a closed-door meeting of House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP meeting was called to discuss health care, but with no  
plan to present to their members, leaders spent most of the meeting 
talking about spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	With a razor-thin majority in the House and Democrats united  
against them, Republicans need virtually every GOP vote to pass a 
bill imposing new regulations on health maintenance organizations 
and other managed care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a problem,'' among Republicans, acknowledged Rep.  
Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., who chairs one of the House's health 
subcommittees and was in meetings for hours this week looking for a 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans want a limited bill that gives patients new  
rights to appeal denials of care and some new power to see doctors 
-- without giving new rights to sue or removing a health plan's 
right to determine what care is medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	But a group led by Reps. Charlie Norwood of Georgia, Tom Coburn  
of Oklahoma and Greg Ganske of Iowa -- all health care providers 
before coming to Congress -- are pushing for a more sweeping 
legislation, similar to the Democrats' approach. Together with 
Republicans who are generally moderate on social issues, they say 
they have anywhere from 20 to 60 Republicans who will vote with 
them if the issue comes to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., was working with Bilirakis and other  
leaders on health on Wednesday and Thursday to try to write a bill, 
but they have failed to produce anything they believe could pass. 
Asked how he could write a bill accommodating his party's divergent 
views, he said: ``If I knew that, my day would be shorter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are determined to try and do a very good piece of  
legislation,'' Goss added. 
</P>
<P>
	But moderates didn't see much hope.  
</P>
<P>
	``They are between a rock and a hard place,'' said Rep. Marge  
Roukema, R-N.J., who is supporting a broader bill. They were trying 
to come up with something to satisfy her faction, she said, but 
``as I understand it, it was just impossible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some Republicans are talking to Democrats about  
joining in a bipartisan bill. Ganske said he met with Minority 
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., on Wednesday. And ``serious'' talks 
with other like-minded Republicans are continuing, said Sue Harvey, 
a Gepardt spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can find a way to get to a bipartisan bill that we can  
pass, we're going to try to pass it,'' Gephardt told reporters 
Thursday. It would take only a handful of Republicans to join 
united Democrats and pass a bill Democrats preferred. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's spokesman, John Feehrey, acknowledged that little  
progress among Republicans had been made and said the issue may 
have to wait until the House returns in September after an August 
break. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be very difficult. We always knew it would  
be,'' he said. ``If it was easy, we would have done it a long time 
ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a GOP working group -- coincidentally led by Hastert --  
came up with an HMO bill that narrowly passed the House. But when 
Hastert took over as speaker, he said he wanted the regular 
committees to write legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Norwood and others prevented Republicans on two separate  
committees from passing strict GOP legislation. Bipartisan 
discussions were under way in the Commerce Committee, but early 
this week, Hastert asked a small group to come up with a bill that 
could be brought directly to the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's backers said he simply wanted legislation on the floor  
before the August break, but Coburn, Ganske and others suspect that 
he just didn't like what Commerce was likely to produce. 
</P>
<P>
	``His cover for months and months was well, you know, we'll just  
let the committee process do its job,'' Ganske said. ``But when it 
became obvious that we had the votes to bring out a good bill, all 
of a sudden, man, that just goes by the wayside.''

<HEADLINE> Faulk May Get $45 Million From Rams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams have reportedly offered  
holdout running back Marshall Faulk a seven-year contract worth $45 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Thursday cited two sources  
familiar with negotiations in its report. Faulk was acquired from 
the Indianapolis Colts in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams are said to have offered $19 million over the first  
four years, with a $7 million signing bonus. Faulk could earn $26 
million over the final three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, as Faulk's agent sees it, is making sure the  
running back collects on those last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way we're trying to structure the deal, the final three  
years will void, and the Rams will have an option to buy the final 
three years back,'' agent Rocky Arceneaux said. 
</P>
<P>
	After four years, the Rams have the the option to ``buy back''  
the final three years by paying Faulk about $5 million. Faulk then 
would become a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Arceneaux does not want to agree to a seven-year deal unless  
the Rams guarantee that they won't slap a franchise or transition 
player tag on Faulk after four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk was the NFL's leading all-around back last season, rushing  
for 1,319 yards and catching 86 passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Arceneaux denied once again that Faulk is stalling merely to  
miss some of Dick Vermeil's training camp, which is known to be on 
the grueling side.

<HEADLINE>  Sanders Leaves While He's on Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Nobody is likely to miss Barry Sanders  
more than Detroit Lions quarterback Charlie Batch. The reason why 
is somewhat surprising. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a fan of his,'' Batch said. ``For the six years I've  
been in Michigan, I have enjoyed watching him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Batch, who won his job as a rookie last season, is just one of  
millions of NFL fans who are coming to grips with Sanders' 
retirement from football, a shocking decision that prevents him 
from becoming the NFL's career rushing leader this season. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Lions reported to training camp today at Saginaw Valley  
State, the dazzling one-man highlight film was somewhere in 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Wednesday, the game's most explosive  
running back said he was leaving because, ``My desire to exit the 
game is greater than my desire to remain in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The news stunned the Lions, who left the door open for him to  
return. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't appear likely, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ten years is a lot of football,'' the 31-year-old Sanders said  
at Gatwick Airport after arriving on a flight from Detroit to 
London. ``I'm just really not feeling like playing. It's not the 
same game. ... As I've gotten older, the game has changed in my 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thinking about doing other things,'' he added. ``It's  
still fun, but not as fun. It just felt like it was time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he might change his mind, he shook his head.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that's going to happen,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sanders becomes the fourth superstar to retire since January,  
joining John Elway, Wayne Gretzky and Michael Jordan. Unlike those 
three, Sanders leaves while at the top of his game, much the same 
as Jim Brown, who retired from the NFL in 1966 at age 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Why now, especially since he's only 1,458 yards shy of breaking  
Walter Payton's NFL career rushing record of 16,726 yards? 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders has never thought much of such records.  
</P>
<P>
	Payton, who suffers from a rare liver disease and is awaiting a  
transplant, said he understood Sanders' decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not about money,'' Payton said. ``It is not about  
statistics. It is about the romance kindled by playing the game the 
way it was supposed to be played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, who planned to spend about two weeks in Europe, said he  
was leaving football before he became ``old and gray and can't 
run'' and got ``kicked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lions general manager Chuck Schmidt said Sanders would be  
welcome back any time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's on the `Reserve: Did Not Report' list, not the `Reserve:  
Retired' list,'' Schmidt said. That means Sanders can be activated 
any time this season until Dec. 5. If he joins the team before 
then, he can play in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Schmidt said he intends to talk with Sanders' agents  
about repaying $7.3 million of the unearned signing bonus on the 
$36 million contract extension Sanders signed two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders retired without speaking to Detroit coach Bobby Ross or  
anyone else on the team. Yet he said he leaves ``on good terms with 
everyone in the organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, this doesn't come at the greatest time,'' Ross  
said. ``What we have to do is move on, and that's what we'll do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to speculate on why Sanders retired.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel Barry left because of me,'' Ross said. ``I don't  
feel that way at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was the popular wisdom, however, especially after Sanders'  
father, William, of Wichita, Kan., said a few weeks ago that his 
son was tired of the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of pulls the rug out from under everybody,'' wide  
receiver Johnnie Morton said. ``We've got to redo about a year's 
worth of work in only a few days now. We have to scramble all our 
plays now, and put in a whole new package tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Ross was trying to put on a brave face.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel we'll be competitive, even with this setback,'' Ross  
said. ``Other players have to pick it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That might be a heavy load.  
</P>
<P>
	During Sanders' 10 seasons in Detroit, the Lions had a 78-82  
regular-season record and made the playoffs five times, winning one 
playoff game. Recently, they've had two 5-11 seasons sandwiched 
around a 9-7 record in 1997 that earned a wild-card spot. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sanders said in London he wasn't especially concerned about  
not playing in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't happen,'' he said. ``I didn't play in the Super  
Bowl, but I can still sleep at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is probably more than Ross can say, since the loss of  
Sanders leaves the Lions virtually without a running back. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Rivers had 19 carries last year and Cory Schlesinger five.  
Sedrick Irvin, a rookie from Michigan State, was a fourth-round 
draft pick. Tom Lewand, the Lions' salary cap director, said the 
club would try to sign a running back in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was a training-camp holdout in 1989, 1991 and 1997, all  
related to contract negotiations. Yet he said salary wasn't a 
factor in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping he changes his mind,'' Batch said. ``Maybe somebody  
can change his mind and bring him back.''

<HEADLINE> D.C. Area Growth Problems Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The area in and around the nation's capital is  
``divided by race, income, jobs and opportunity,'' and a regionwide 
effort is needed to solve problems caused by its suburban sprawl 
and urban poverty, says a report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by the Brookings Institution, a think tank, finds that  
economic and population growth this decade has occurred primarily 
in mostly white suburbs west of Interstate 95 and in the area west 
of 16th Street in Northwest Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, much of the city and its inner suburbs suffer from  
poverty and a lack of economic opportunity, including a loss of 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years between 1990 and 1998, the district went from  
having a third of the metropolitan region's jobs to only a quarter. 
At the same time, there was an overall 12 percent increase in jobs 
regionwide. 
</P>
<P>
	There are downsides for both the haves and have-nots, according  
to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Families relocate from areas with poor, underfunded schools,  
causing overcrowding in the more prosperous communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Population booms are occurring in northern Virginia and southern  
Maryland due to new high-paying technology jobs and relatively 
inexpensive open land. That has led to traffic congestion and a 
need for better roads and mass transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We call it madness,'' said Scott York, who is on the Board of  
Supervisors of fast-growing Loudoun County. He said the influx of 
people ``is going to make it very difficult to deliver the very 
services these people came to Loudoun County for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brookings report warned that increasing regional divisions  
endanger the overall prosperity and livability of the Washington 
area. That sentiment was echoed by Michael Rogers, executive 
director of the Washington Council of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can the region continue to prosper if there are segments that  
are impaired or unable to participate?'' Rogers asked. ``The answer 
is no,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pittsburgh Agrees to Help Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The City Council has agreed to relieve the  
Pittsburgh Penguins of their responsibility to pay $1 million a 
year toward improvements to the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The move will help former team captain Mario Lemieux and his  
ownership group take over the bankrupt team. During negotiations, 
the Public Auditorium Authority agreed on behalf of the city and 
Allegheny County to take over the team's share of the payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The council's voice vote Wednesday was unanimous. County  
commissioners still must approve the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the Penguins will immediately pay $460,000 owed the  
city in amusement taxes and agree to stay in the arena through 
2007. Also, the team and landlord SMG will take over operating 
costs for the arena from the auditorium authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was paying the $1 million each year to help pay off a  
$12 million bond issue from 1994, which was part of $37.6 million 
owed for improvements to the arena, including new seats and a 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins, the auditorium authority, the city and the county  
have all been pitching in to pay off that debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The city and county have good reason to take on the Penguins  
share, which was among the team's largest debts, said auditorium 
authority Executive Director Stephen Leeper. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is a ``civic asset'' and provides economic benefits for  
the region, including producing $1.2 million a year in amusement 
taxes and more than $350,000 in parking taxes, Leeper said.

<HEADLINE> Neighbors Describe Gunman as Quiet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mark Barton, the 44-year-old day trader at the center of  
Thursday's bloody rampage, was described by neighbors in the 
Atlanta suburb of Morrow as a quiet, churchgoing man who worked all 
day on his computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, who had split up with his wife earlier this year, had  
been living with his two children from a previous marriage in the 
southern suburb. The three of them moved out over the July 4th 
weekend, and the children told neighbors they were moving to nearby 
Stockbridge to live with their stepmother, identified by a neighbor 
as Lee Ann Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Mrs. Barton and the children were found in Mrs.  
Barton's apartment after Barton went on the rampage at two 
brokerage offices, killing nine people. Barton later committed 
suicide when police closed in on him in his dark green van at a gas 
station in northern Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Henry County, where Stockbridge is located, said  
handwritten notes left on the bodies indicated that Mrs. Barton may 
have been killed Tuesday and the children on Wednesday. The 
children were in their beds and his wife was in a closet. Police 
said a typed note was found in the living room explaining his 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton had lived in Morrow for about a year, renting a neatly  
kept, two-story house in a modestly priced residential 
neighborhood, said Christine Johnson, 58, who lived two doors away. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, a chemist, seldom left his house and was always at work  
on his computer, Mrs. Johnson said. When he did leave the house, it 
was to walk around the neighborhood for exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept to himself,'' Mrs. Johnson said. ``If he drove by in  
his van he threw his hand up. But that was about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another acquaintance in Morrow, Marsha Jean DeFreese, said  
Barton went to church and was a Scout master of her grandson's 
troop. She said he took them out every Tuesday. ``He looked odd to 
me,'' she said. ``I thought something's weird about this man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the children, Michelle and Matthew, were ages 7 and  
12 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy Northcutt, 38, who lived on the same street as Barton in  
Morrow, said Barton ``always seemed preoccupied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He had other things on his mind,'' she said. ``He didn't seem  
friendly at all. He was making an effort to have something to do 
with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors in Morrow said Mrs. Barton was active in the Girl  
Scouts. On Wednesday, she was expected at an outing, but never 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Barton's first wife and mother-in-law were bludgeoned  
to death at a campground in northeast Alabama. Authorities said 
Barton was the prime suspect, but he was never charged. The couple 
had two children, who were in Barton's custody after the slayings.

<HEADLINE> American, Brit Airways Try New Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Transportation Department said Thursday it  
would dismiss a 3-year-old application by American Airlines and 
British Airways for special government permission to form an 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	In anticipation of the announcement, the two airlines issued a  
joint statement saying they planned to expand their existing 
marketing relationship in ways that would not require government 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse of the quasi-merger should not affect passengers.  
For example, the airlines' existing exchange of some frequent-flier 
benefits is not expected to dissolve. The airlines and their 
shareholders, though, may be upset at the missed chance to operate 
more efficiently under an alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are real advantages to (a formal alliance), but the fact  
they you do not have it is not a deal-breaker,'' said Darryl 
Jenkins, an airline specialist and head of the Institute of Tourism 
Studies at George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	The two carriers had applied to the Transportation Department  
for antitrust immunity. It would have allowed them to discuss 
pricing and seat inventory, and let them share revenues from 
passenger and cargo service. Such cooperation is prohibited without 
a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin Atlantic Airways, a British carrier, and various U.S.  
airlines contended the alliance would give two huge airlines a 
stranglehold on transatlantic travel -- especially into London's 
popular Heathrow Airport. It is a gateway to Europe, Africa and the 
Middle East and is frequented by high-paying business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. government official said the department planned to  
dismiss the application on Friday because British Airways had 
reached a stalemate with the United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trade 
over surrendering landing and takeoff slots at Heathrow. 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways long has fought to retain its hundreds of  
takeoff or landing spots at the airport, contending it would suffer 
as a result of increased competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a lack of progress on the underlying issues and  
it is in the best interests of all that the petition be dismissed 
without prejudice,'' the Transportation Department official said. 
``This will allow the airlines to resubmit the petition should 
progress be made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their joint statement, the airlines said the disapproval of a  
more formal arrangement ``will clearly be a matter of regret,'' but 
it would not lessen their commitment to their existing marketing 
partnership, known as ``oneworld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not accede to demands that do not make sense for  
either company,'' said Bob Ayling, chief executive of British 
Airways. ``It would be better to develop activities that don't 
require antitrust immunity rather than to accept conditions which 
would be a dereliction of our duty to shareholders' interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Don Carty, chairman of American Airlines: ``While our  
alliance may now evolve somewhat differently than originally 
proposed, it will still be a beneficial one for our customers, 
shareholders and employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins, the airline analyst, said the carriers may have to be  
content with a less intimate arrangement, limited to sharing 
airport space, buying supplies jointly and advertising their 
oneworld program. 
</P>
<P>
	Access to Heathrow also has been a sticking point in  
U.S.-British negotiations over a new aviation agreement. The 
current treaty allows only two U.S. carriers -- now American and 
United Airlines -- access to Heathrow. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials want more access for other carriers with the aim  
of reducing airfares. The United States already has 30 such ``open 
skies'' agreements around the world. British officials have balked; 
they have sought, in exchange, a drop in current prohibitions 
against foreigners owning U.S. airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Transportation Department has firmly stated that it

<HEADLINE> Cheever Rates Dover As Tough Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Eddie Cheever can tell anyone in three  
languages just how difficult a race track can be, and he considers 
Dover Downs International Speedway as demanding as any in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is furiously fast and extremely unforgiving,'' the 1998  
Indianapolis 500 champion said of the high-banked oval known as The 
Monster Mile. ``It is the most physically demanding, equaled only 
by the F1 circuit in Monte Carlo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he should know. The 41-year-old American who went to high  
school in Rome and is fluent in both Italian and French, has been 
driving all over the globe for the last quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get no rest on this track,'' said Cheever, who races on it  
Sunday in the Indy Racing League's MBNA Mid-Atlantic 200. ``The 
24-degree banking will make for a highly intense race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He learned just how intense last season, in the first Indy-car  
event at Dover in 29 years. Midway through the race, the banking 
bit him, and he crashed with Greg Ray, sending both back in the 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolute concentration will be needed, as so many cars will be  
able to go quick here with everyone running inches from each other 
-- constantly,'' Cheever said. ``It can be catastrophic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Formula One and CART driver needs to avoid another  
day like his last on the tight and narrow concrete surface. Both he 
and teammate Robby Unser totaled their cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two months removed from his improbable victory at Indy  
-- barely enough time to count the $1.4 million he earned -- 
owner-driver Cheever had to make a large withdrawal from his bank 
account. Still, he takes a stab at humor as he looks back on his 
Dover experience of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had just come from the big prize money win at Indy and  
proceeded to leave Dover with $800,000 less on my balance sheet,'' 
Cheever said. ``It was the fastest dissipation of assets in my life 
-- with the exception of my divorce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defending race champion Scott Sharp hasn't competed on many  
continents, but he has no reason to doubt Cheever's Dover 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is by far the most demanding track both mentally and  
physically on a driver,'' said Sharp, who won two weekends ago at 
Atlanta Motor Speedway. ``We will need to be survivors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's confident he has the setup in his Aurora-powered Dallara to  
give Kelley Racing a good chance for consecutive Dover victories. 
With a fifth career victory Sharp would move ahead of the retired 
Arie Luyendyk and reigning Indy 500 champion Kenny Brack for the 
most in the 4-year-old IRL. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp insisted that concentration -- especially difficult over  
200 laps in searing heat -- will be a driver's most important asset. 
</P>
<P>
	IRL points leader Scott Goodyear said the heat wave that has  
engulfed the East Coast this month -- often approaching and, in some 
cases, surpassing 100 degrees in Dover -- will be a factor in the 
race. He thinks he might be ready for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came out in early July and spent two very productive days  
testing,'' said Goodyear, the only two-time winner this year on the 
circuit. ``We were fast and ran great even though temperatures were 
well into the 100's, so that should make this trip back a little 
easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Goodyear said it was so hot when he tested at Dover  
that it made the heat of Atlanta easier to tolerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Most drivers agree the greatest danger is being caught in  
traffic, so there's no great mystery about strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Qualifying up front is a must at this track,'' said Jeff Ward,  
third in the points behind Goodyear and Sharp but still seeking his 
first career victory. ``It's going to be hard to pass because Dover 
is not really a two-groove track.''

<HEADLINE> Firms Share $1.4B From Tobacco Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A dozen law firms that participated in Mississippi's successful  
battle with the tobacco industry were formally awarded $1.4 billion 
in fees and expenses Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the level of risk that we undertook, which included the  
expenditure of millions of dollars of our own money, the attorneys' 
fees awarded in this case is entirely justified and consistent with 
precedent,'' said Richard Scruggs of Pascagoula, whose law firm 
will get nearly $340 million under the payment plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Scruggs at the top of the payment list, is the firm of  
Ronald Motley of Charleston, S.C., which will get $304 million. 
Eleven of the 12 law firms are in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tobacco Fee Arbitration Panel's decision gives the firms an  
amount equal to about one-third of the state's $4.2 billion share 
of the multistate tobacco settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the panel awarded five law firms that participated  
in the Massachusetts lawsuit $775 million in fees and expenses, 
which is equal to 9.3 percent of that state's $8.3 billion share of 
the $206 billion, 46-state tobacco settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The fees will be paid by the tobacco industry in installments  
over as many as 25 years or more. The awards are separate from the 
money the states will receive. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry, in a joint statement from Philip Morris  
Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Lorillard Tobacco Co., called 
the award ``excessive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While the state of Massachusetts was an early participant in  
litigation against the industry, its attorneys did not invest the 
same amount of effort as earlier states. We are hopeful, that this 
award will mark the conclusion of excessive fee awards to 
attorneys,'' read the statement in part. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown Rudnick, the lead counsel for Massachusetts, said in a  
statement that its team of lawyers spent millions of dollars and 
tens of thousands of hours working on the case with no guarantees 
of payment. 
</P>
<P>
	The five firms had sought about $2 billion or 25 percent of the  
Massachusetts settlement, while the tobacco industry had suggested 
they receive a total of $26.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it's a lot of money, it's a third of what the state had  
agreed to pay them,'' said Richard Daynard, a Northeastern law 
professor and chairman of the Tobacco Products Liability Project, 
an advocacy group that encourages lawsuits against the tobacco 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least in Massachusetts, they did a lot of work and achieved  
a very good result. All told, I think it's pretty fair,'' Daynard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said it did not award the lawyers the 25 percent they  
had sought in part because Massachusetts benefited greatly from the 
experience of other states and because it dropped out of the 
multistate negotiations in advance of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The firms sharing in the Massachusetts award are: Brown Rudnick  
Freed &AMP; Gesmer; Schneider Reilly Zabin &AMP; Costello, and Thornton 
Early &AMP; Naumes, both of Boston; Ness Motley Loadholt Richardson &AMP; 
Poole of Charleston, S.C.; and Lieff Cabrasser Heimann &AMP; Bernstein 
of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Scruggs and Motley, the law firms sharing the  
Mississippi award are: Paul Minor, Benton, McCormick, Rhoden, all 
of Biloxi; Crymes Pittman, of Jackson; Barrett, Clark, McTeer, all 
of Lexington; Michael Lewis, of Clarksdale; and Robert Oswald of 
Pascagoula.

<HEADLINE> Collins Urges Wider Space Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- She is the first woman to command a U.S. space  
flight and, with the successful end of the shuttle Columbia's 
mission, the first to land a spacecraft. For all of that, Eileen 
Collins is very humble. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said nothing of her achievements at a welcome-home  
ceremony Wednesday, using her time at the microphone to thank 
ground support crews and plug the space program. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's really ... a lot of interest out there and we need to  
tap into it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore was more effusive, calling the  
42-year-old Air Force colonel a bigger hero than pioneer aviator 
Amelia Earhart. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has not only equaled but surpassed Amelia Earhart in the  
history of flight,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1995, Collins became the first woman to pilot a  
shuttle on what was her first shuttle mission. 
</P>
<P>
	She took with her a scarf worn by Earhart, who vanished over the  
Pacific in 1937 while attempting to become the first woman to fly 
around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	As Collins' 3-year-old daughter Bridget, clad in a jumper  
bearing the Stars and Stripes, sat in front row of the audience, 
her mother grinned graciously as Gore congratulated her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, Bridget, your mommy stands here as a hero to all girls  
and boys, women and men, Americans and people all over the world,'' 
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time a president or vice president personally welcomed  
returning astronauts was in September 1996, when President Clinton 
greeted Shannon Lucid after her record-setting 188-day stay aboard 
the Russian space station Mir.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Teacher Faces Other Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	APPLING, Ga. (AP) -- A former high school teacher suspected of  
embezzling more than $83,000 from her students and leaving them 
stranded in Europe has been indicted in another case. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury Tuesday accused Vanessa Velez-Cruz of writing  
$52,500 in checks on the account of a nonprofit organization 
designed to help migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Ms. Velez-Cruz wrote six bad checks in June to  
herself and signed them from an official of the organization, where 
she had worked as a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, 28 of Ms. Velez-Cruz's students at Aquinas High were  
stranded in Paris for several days after learning that more than 
$83,000 they gave their Spanish teacher had not been applied to the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Danny Craig said Ms. Velez-Cruz deposited the  
checks from the migrant workers' group into her account so that 
when the travel agent called to inquire about her credit, it would 
appear that she had sufficient funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Velez-Cruz is being held on felony charges in connection  
with a 1989 theft from an Augusta business. Craig said she is being 
investigated in connection with several alleged scams, including 
the high school trip.

<HEADLINE> Mutual Fund Assets Fall by $1.22B / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds fell by $1.22 billion in the latest week to $872.14 
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category fell  
by $943.4 million to $722.46 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets fell by $278.6 million to $149.69 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds fell by $2.95 billion  
to $585.50 billion for the same period. Among institutional funds, 
taxable money market fund assets fell by $1.49 billion to $537.13 
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds fell by $1.46 billion to $48.36 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.458 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.462 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.47 percent from 4.45 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield rose to 4.44 percent from 4.40 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.57 percent from 4.55  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 
4.53 percent from 4.50 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
58 days, down from 59 days, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts rose to 2.04 percent as of 
Wednesday from 2.03 percent a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts was 0.85 percent, unchanged from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.23 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.20 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.56 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.55 
percent; 4.83 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 4.81 percent; and 
5.00 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 4.97 percent.

<HEADLINE> Japan Penalizes Credit Suisse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese regulators are revoking the banking  
license of a unit of the Credit Suisse Group because it helped 
Japanese companies hide losses, they said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities may also seek charges against the company for  
allegedly trying to block their probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The punishment is severe because Credit Suisse Financial  
Products ``systematically tried to block the investigation,'' said 
Hakuo Yanagisawa, the head of Japan's Financial Reconstruction 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo branch of Credit Suisse Financial Products will lose  
its license on Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zurich, Switzerland-based Credit Suisse Group said Thursday  
that it will not challenge the punishment, although it considers it 
``disproportionate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse also said it will remain active in Japan through  
its other operations here. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements follow a seven-month probe into financial  
products that Credit Suisse allegedly sold to about 60 Japanese 
corporations to help them hide losses from regulators and investors 
by temporarily shifting them to other companies. Some of the latter 
existed only on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse itself discovered and reported a problem with a  
few employees delaying a probe, then apologized and dismissed eight 
people, it has said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Reconstruction Commission, which heads Japan's  
efforts to revive its debt-ridden financial system, held a meeting 
with senior officials of Credit Suisse before deciding what action 
to take, Yanagisawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The punishment was necessary because Credit Suisse disrupted  
Japanese financial markets, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Thursday, the head of another regulatory agency said the  
government might file criminal complaints against Credit Suisse 
Financial Products and another unit, Credit Suisse Trust and 
Banking Co., involving obstruction of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Masaharu Hino, who heads the Financial Supervisory Agency, a  
smaller agency in charge of monitoring financial markets, said the 
agency can offer supporting evidence to law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Hino also said his agency will impose additional punishments, as  
yet undecided, on local units of Credit Suisse.

<HEADLINE> Brothers Accused of Killing Gays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDDING, Calif. (AP) -- Two brothers suspected of shooting a gay  
couple to death and setting fire to synagogues pleaded innocent to 
murder charges Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, and James Tyler Williams, 29,  
have been held without bail since their arrest July 7. Prosecutors 
have not decided whether to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers are accused of shooting Gary Matson, 50, and  
Winfield Scott Mowder, 40, who were found in their bed July 1 in 
rural Happy Valley, about 165 miles north of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence found in the brothers' homes also links them to June  
arson fires that caused $1 million in damage at three 
Sacramento-area synagogues. No charges have been filed in the 
fires.

<HEADLINE> NBC Overhauling Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- In a bid to remain the top-rated  
network, NBC is adding four characters to crown jewel ``ER'' this 
fall and overhauling other shows, including ``Suddenly Susan'' and 
``Veronica's Closet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network also is joining the ethnic diversity bandwagon: NBC  
executives Thursday announced development deals for black sitcoms 
with Keenen Ivory Wayans and producer Yvette Lee Bowser. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the NAACP condemned the absence of minority  
characters on TV and said it was considering a boycott or other 
action. On Tuesday, a Hispanic coalition also demanded more 
minority representation. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC West Coast President Scott Sassa acknowledged Thursday that  
the criticism led to the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be totally disingenuous to stand up here and say we  
did this totally on our own,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, ABC executives said at least five of their shows  
would add minorities but said the changes had been in the works 
since May. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the cast additions on NBC involve ethnic actors:  
Sherri Shepherd on ``Suddenly Susan''; Jesse L. Martin on ``Law &AMP; 
Order'' and Michelle Hurd on its spinoff, ``Law &AMP; Order: Special 
Victims Unit''; Darryl Theirse on ``Jesse'' and Michael Michele and 
Ming-Na on ``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Michele (``Homicide: Life on the Street'') will play a  
second-year resident, while Ming-Na is reprising her role from the 
medical drama's first season as Dr. Deb Chen. Joining them will be 
Maura Tierney (``NewsRadio'') and Goran Visnjic. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Alda and Rebecca DeMornay will guest star in several ``ER''  
episodes, and recurring character Dr. Romano (Paul McCrane) is 
becoming a regular. The series returns Thursday, Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly Susan'' is gaining a quartet of characters: Besides  
Ms. Shepherd, Eric Idle (``Monty Python''), Rob Estes (``Melrose 
Place'') and Currie Graham will be added as the show makes a plot 
change: The characters are working for a revamped Gate magazine, 
now a sports publication. 
</P>
<P>
	``Veronica's Closet'' is losing Ron Silver and bringing aboard a  
new adversary for Veronica (Kirstie Alley): the Silver character's 
young widow. The series, which has failed to capitalize on its 
Thursday slot behind top-rated ``ER,'' is moving to Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``West Wing,'' a new series set in the White House and  
criticized for being unrealistically all white in its characters, 
will add a black actor in a recurring role, said NBC Entertainment 
President Garth Ancier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa said the network is aware ``we should have done a better  
job'' in creating racially diverse shows. Diversity is good 
business for the network, he said, because NBC-owned stations in 
big cities draw more ethnic viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC hopes to rush the new shows from Ms. Bowser (``Living  
Single'') and Wayans on the air this season. Wayans' show was 
described as ``Not the Bradys,'' a comedy featuring a merged family 
with an interracial marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa also said the network is trying to develop more  
family-oriented sitcoms and ensure that bawdiness in other shows is 
not excessive. Sex has got to be ``germane to the story line, not 
just gratuitous,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's new schedule will debut the week of Sept. 20. The network  
finished last season as No. 1, but has seen its post-''Seinfeld'' 
ratings slip and CBS make significant gains.

<HEADLINE> Gore Goes to Bush's Backyard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's Spanish may not be quite  
as fluent as that of Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	But just by showing up at the National Council of La Raza on  
Wednesday -- a meeting Bush skipped -- and telling Latinos he intends 
to fight for their issues if he becomes president, Gore seemed to 
score points with listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hit on all the right issues like education and the  
economy,'' said Kathryn Diaz Garcia, a Houston attorney. ``I'm glad 
he showed the respect to show up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wooing a constituency that could have a big role in picking the  
next president in 2000 and mocking Bush's slogan of ``compassionate 
conservatism,'' Gore said Americans shouldn't have to settle for 
``crumbs of compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the annual conference of La Raza, the nation's largest  
Hispanic advocacy group, Gore was warmly applauded by many in the 
crowd of 2,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Though invited, the vacationing Bush did not attend and that  
snub upset some activists who warned that the governor should not 
take the Hispanic vote -- usually Democratic in any event -- for 
granted. Bush drew strong support from Texas Hispanics in his 
reelection as governor, getting about half of their vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore never mentioned Bush by name but underscored some of the  
social problems in Texas and took a glancing swipe at the 
Republican presidential candidate's description of his beliefs as 
``compassionate conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do things the right way,'' he said. ``Not letting  
people fend for themselves or hope for crumbs of compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was in English, but Gore sprinkled phrases and sentences in  
Spanish throughout his address. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly not satisfied when over 10 percent of all  
uninsured children in America live in the state of Texas,'' he 
said, then used a phrase that became a refrain: ``Nuestras familias 
merecen lo mejor (Our families deserve the best).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speech was labeled ``official business'' as opposed to a  
campaign address, and was paid for with public money. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore tailored the administration's argument against the  
Republican tax-cut plan to fit his audience, saying that the tax 
cuts proposed in Washington would endanger Medicare, upon which 
elderly and disabled Hispanics are disproportionately reliant. 
</P>
<P>
	He also focused on education issues, among the most critical for  
the 31 million Hispanics making up America's fastest growing 
minority group. Just 62 percent of Hispanic adults age 25-29 
completed high school compared with 87 percent of blacks and 93 
percent of whites, according to federal figures. 
</P>
<P>
	As well, high school dropout rates are far higher.  
</P>
<P>
	``How can we expect to break down the barriers of opportunity if  
the Hispanic dropout rate remains an unacceptable 75 percent higher 
than that for blacks and whites?'' Gore asked. ``The time for quick 
fixes has passed. Its time for a renewed commitment to our public 
schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not satisfied when even one Latino is left out of our  
prosperity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In introducing Gore, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, the  
highest ranking Hispanic in the Clinton administration, called next 
year's elections ``The most important year in the history of Latino 
political development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Latinos are seeking to turn sheer numbers into political muscle  
that can select mayors, governors and strongly influence the 2000 
presidential election. Gore is seeking the Democratic nomination 
and Bush the Republican one. 
</P>
<P>
	With Hispanics heavily concentrated in key electoral states like  
New York, California, Texas, Florida and Illinois, the Latino 
influence could be huge there, said Carmen Joge, a La Raza policy 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have numbers but it hasn't translated to political power  
just yet,'' Joge said. ``But we recognize that we have to keep 
educating our young people to vote so when they become eligible, 
they know the issues and are ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the number of Hispanic registered voters rose to 5.4  
million in 1996 from 4.2 million in 1992 and has continued to 
surge, over a third of the Hispanic population is under 18. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Gore joked that since his first grandchild was  
born on the Fourth of July earlier this year, a future one might be 
born on Cinco de Mayo, a national Mexican holiday on May 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Examples of the newfound voting clout can be found primarily in  
Western states with the election of California Lt. Gov. Cruz 
Bustamante in November to statewide office and the election of Ken 
Salazar as Colorado's first Latino attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton won 72 percent of Latino voters in 1996 but  
Hispanic leaders say it's important for Latinos not to became 
captive of one party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its great to be on both sides,'' Joge said. ``We know that  
candidates have to talk issues. They can't just talk about their 
party,''

<HEADLINE> CNN Waits To Go With Shooting News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CNN waited to air reports of a gunman opening  
fire in its home city Thursday until well after its two rival 
all-news networks went with the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based CNN said it had conflicting reports about the  
office building shootings and held out in the interest of accuracy. 
Early reports from MSNBC and Fox News Channel proved accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3:43 p.m. EDT, MSNBC broke the story of the shooting, which  
began shortly after 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, at 3:47 p.m., MSNBC cut to a helicopter view of the  
building, located in Atlanta's Buckhead section, courtesy of its 
local affiliate WXIA-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox News Channel followed at 3:50 p.m. Eight minutes later, it  
began airing chopper video from affiliate WAGA-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was 3:57 p.m. before CNN, whose worldwide headquarters is  
a few miles away in downtown Atlanta, gave viewers word of the 
shooting and cut to aerial video from WXIA-TV. CNN is affiliated 
with four Atlanta stations whose live feeds it has permission to 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN spokesman David Bittler said the network had been monitoring  
what he termed ``conflicting reports'' from local stations before 
it chose to go with the story. He said there were ``differing 
accounts of the event from our four affiliates,'' including 
different reports about the number of wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our editorial decision was to be accurate with what we went  
with, rather than be concerned with being first,'' Bittler said. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than an hour, viewers saw a succession of ambulances  
pull to a building's entrance, load victims on stretchers into the 
vehicles, then pull away. 
</P>
<P>
	At other times, the building's occupants were seen being  
evacuated.

<HEADLINE> Florida Vouchers Target of Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A teachers union has sued Gov. Jeb  
Bush, seeking to overturn the only statewide voucher program that 
allows parents to send their children to private or parochial 
schools at taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second legal challenge to Florida's voucher program  
since it took effect last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taking money for vouchers violates the constitution, which  
says the Legislature must adequately fund public schools and it's a 
paramount duty to do that,'' said Pat Tornillo, head of Florida 
Education Association/United. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and its parent organization, the American Federation  
of Teachers, filed suit Tuesday in state court in Tallahassee, 
where a similar suit by other voucher opponents is already pending. 
The new lawsuit names Bush, his Cabinet and the state Board of 
Education as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	``If these unions were just half as concerned about children as  
they claim, they would have invested the money they spent on these 
lawsuits on schools,'' Bush spokeswoman Lucia Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Federation of Teachers also sued Cleveland in  
federal court Thursday, challenging that city's voucher program, 
which is already the subject of another lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ohio and Florida should focus their resources on what works to  
improve the public schools that the vast majority of students 
attend,'' union president Sandra Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio case alleges that the city's voucher program, which  
started three years ago, violates the U.S. Constitution by breaking 
down the separation of church and state. The Ohio Supreme Court has 
ruled in another suit that the program does not violate the 
separation clause. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornillo predicted the FEA/United suit would be consolidated  
with the suit filed in June by parents and several groups, 
including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People and the American Civil Liberties Union.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On a hot afternoon, a group of men and women  
wearing name tags trudged up Seventh Street in MacArthur Park, a 
run-down neighborhood. They passed a row of faded storefronts and a 
bedraggled man pushing a shopping cart. 
</P>
<P>
	The visitors were Catholics in town to talk about social  
activism at Jubilee Justice, a national convention held earlier 
this month. Their guide was Philip Lance, an activist Episcopal 
priest who had good news and bad for the Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news came as Lance led a tour of Pueblo Nuevo, one of  
several sites showcasing Catholic-funded anti-poverty efforts 
during Jubilee Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	For five years, Lance has managed Pueblo Nuevo, a thrift store  
and janitorial cooperative employing poor Hispanic men who have few 
skills. Employees can eventually opt for part-ownership of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The enterprise expects to turn its first profit this year, about  
$25,000. Lance says a dividend of running the venture is watching 
the employees warm to the concept of owning the business, as in a 
recent meeting to learn about balance sheets. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people were nodding their heads because they were  
getting it,'' Lance said. ``You could really see the veils of 
mystery starting to fall away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While expressing gratitude for seed money and support from the  
Catholic Church's Campaign for Human Development, which helped get 
Pueblo Nuevo started, Lance took the opportunity to speak out 
against church policies he considers unjust. 
</P>
<P>
	He faulted Catholic hospitals for their response to unionizing  
efforts by employees, and Lance, who is gay, criticized church 
attitudes toward homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to offend some people here,'' he said sheepishly.  
``But hopefully we can start a dialogue ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, there was little real discussion among the 25 Catholic  
lay people and clergy on his tour. Some said much work remains on 
the issues Lance raised, and they congratulated him for speaking 
his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Jubilee Justice was set to begin, the Catholic Church  
disciplined a priest and nun in Baltimore who had started a 
nationwide ministry for gays and lesbians. Many convention 
participants expressed dismay. 
</P>
<P>
	``The church is saying that gay people are disordered,'' Lance  
said. ``That is something we find very difficult to deal with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Catholic bishops recently published a document called ``Always  
Our Children'' that urged treating homosexuals with dignity and 
deplored anti-gay violence. Nonetheless, the church teaches that 
homosexual practice is sinful. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at the conference were union organizers eager to take the  
church to task for what they say are union-busting efforts at 
Catholic Healthcare West, a group of California hospitals founded 
by Catholic nuns. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, hospital administrators have met one-on-one  
with workers targeted in the unionizing efforts, a practice that 
union activists said goes against traditionally church teachings 
about workers' rights and economic justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials said they were simply trying to give workers  
their side of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance told the group members that controversy could temporarily  
hamper expansion efforts for Pueblo Nuevo. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Pueblo Nuevo had considered applying for a loan through  
a fund sponsored by the hospital group. But Pueblo Nuevo board 
members backed out when they learned of the union troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Summarizing his critique after the tour, Lance said, ``It did  
give me a chance to get up there and say, 'You guys are really 
off-base on certain issues.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a confrontation that Catholics don't often face from this  
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	For almost 30 years, the church's Campaign for Human Development  
has been funding anti-poverty programs organized by both secular 
and denominational groups. 
</P>
<P>
	It started operations in 1969 with a $10 million donation from  
the pews. This year, it expects to disburse that much in grants for 
projects as diverse as a crime hot-spot campaign in Springfield, 
Mass., and a literacy program for ex-convicts in South Central Los 
Angeles, said Douglas Lawson, the campaign's associate director for 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign often works with churches that disagree with  
Catholics on theological points. Most of the time, the divide 
remains out of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been a friend beyond our wildest expectations,'' said  
the Rev. Eugene Williams of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Churches, 
an activist group of South Central black Protestant churches 
working with the campaign. ``For some Protestants, particularly 
with Baptists and independents, that may be surprising. But we have 
had just a wonderful relationship and hope that it continues.''

<HEADLINE> USA Networks Loses $9.3 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- USA Networks Inc., Barry Diller's cable, movie  
and direct commerce company, reported higher cash flow in the 
second quarter but still had a net loss due to spending on Internet 
startup operations and investment in new programming. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Networks had a net loss of $9.3 million compared to $12.4  
million in the same quarter a year ago. Revenues rose 13 percent to 
$804.5 million from $711.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company's cash flow, a measure widely used by investors  
that excludes taxes, interest and amortization expenses, rose a 
hefty 25 percent to $176.1 million from $141.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been investing heavily in its CitySearch  
service, a series of online guides for cities. USA expanded 
CitySearch with the acquisition announced last week of the Sidewalk 
online entertainment guide from Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	USA has also been ramping up production for its cable networks,  
including new shows for its Sci-Fi channel's Friday night lineup. 
USA also owns the Home Shopping Network, Ticketmaster, the Hotel 
Reservations Network and the Internet Shopping Network. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Diller announced the acquisition of several boutique  
film studios from Seagram Co., October Films, Gramercy Pictures and 
the remains of Polygram Filmed Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of USA were down 50 cents to $44.50 on the Nasdaq Stock  
Market.

<HEADLINE> All But Bryant Aboard at Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars reported for  
training camp Thursday and, as expected, first-round draft pick 
Fernando Bryant was not present. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless there's a miraculous change, we're at an impasse,''  
senior vice president Michael Huyghue said. ``It looks like we're 
in a holdout situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookies and newcomers underwent conditioning tests on the first  
day of camp. Two-a-day practices begin Friday. That's when the 
clock really starts ticking for the cornerback out of Alabama, 
whose chances of competing for a starting job diminish with each 
workout missed. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the weekend, he'll be well behind,'' coach Tom Coughlin  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	How many practices can he miss before being too far behind?  
</P>
<P>
	``One,'' Coughlin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year's starters, Dave Thomas and Aaron Beasley, are again  
listed as the starters to begin this year's camp. With Deon 
Figures, Cordell Taylor and two lower-round draft picks, cornerback 
figures to be the most interesting position to watch during this 
year's camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are plenty of opportunities to use talented secondary  
players, whether it's in a regular secondary situation or nickel 
and dime,'' Coughlin said. ``But you can't accomplish any of it if 
you're not here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is Bryant's demand for a four-year deal and the  
Jaguars' insistence that he sign a five-year contract. The dollar 
figures are more or less set, with about $840,000 to be paid in the 
first year along with a signing bonus of about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Several teams are in the practice of offering a voidable year,  
allowing the player to cancel out the final season of the deal and 
negotiate a new contract. The Jaguars don't offer voidable years 
and Huyghue said they don't intend on starting now. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be careful of the precedents you create,'' he  
said. ``It wouldn't be good business to start doing that now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's first-round draft pick, Fred Taylor, suggested  
Bryant set aside the contract squabble and report to camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four, five years, it shouldn't matter,'' Taylor said. ``If  
he's a player, he plays good, helps the team out and makes plays, 
of course they're going to offer him a good extension after so many 
years. That's the way it works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant's agent, Jimmy Sexton, did not return telephone messages  
left at his office by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin said he has to set aside his desire as a coach to get  
Bryant into camp and recognize the business aspect of the 
negotiation. Huyghue says no amount of carping from Coughlin would 
make him change his bargaining stance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom works on personnel decisions, I work on figuring what we  
pay them,'' Huyghue said. ``That way, we have a good system of 
checks and balances. So, he could say, `We have to get him into 
camp.' And I understand that's what he wants. But I have to find a 
way to do it within the structure we've created.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thus began the first rookie holdout in the Jaguars' five-year  
history. Coughlin says it isn't necessarily destined to come down 
to an ugly ending. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to get into one of those deals where we say  
something that causes someone to look as if they have to back down 
to get it done,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Criticizes Smithsonian Exhibits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of a Senate committee that  
oversees the Smithsonian Institution said Wednesday he was 
disturbed by ``political correctness'' at the National Museum of 
American History. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell, during a hearing on the Smithsonian's  
budget, said he objected particularly to references to capitalism, 
immigration and Christianity in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to express again my concern is about the drift to  
political correctness,'' said McConnell, chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Rules and Administration. ``I know it's going on in 
every campus and it's not surprising to find remnants of it at the 
museum ... I do think it's a disturbing trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The term ``political correctness'' began as a description by  
Communists of conformity to the party line. Now it is used to 
described statements framed to be inoffensive, particularly to 
political minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell said that ``much of what I saw, frankly, I didn't  
like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J. Michael Heyman, secretary of the Smithsonian, did not respond  
directly to McConnell's criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	But Heyman explained after the hearing that the museum strives  
for a balanced historical view and that exhibits are temporary. He 
also said that under new procedures, museum directors will have 
final say in approving exhibit contents. Previously, curators made 
that decision themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	In a New Mexico pueblo exhibit, McConnell, R-Ky., objected to a  
reference to ``invasive forms of Christianity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The characterization seems more apt for ... a plague rather  
than as a means of describing the evolution of Christianity in this 
country,'' McConnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The label in the exhibit reads:  
</P>
<P>
	``Both pueblos and Hispanics have been subject to invasive forms  
of Christianity. Pueblo peoples faced Spanish attempts to suppress 
their native religions ... In turn Hispanic Catholics experienced 
Anglo-American attempts to convert them to Protestantism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit received financial support from New Mexico's  
government. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell referred to ``the exhibit on industrialization, where  
the focus seemed to be on the dark side of capitalism.'' The 
immigration exhibit too often cited luck ``to explain success 
rather than sheer hard work and perseverance which typifies the 
arrivals in our nation,'' McConnell complained. 
</P>
<P>
	One label in the exhibit says:  
</P>
<P>
	``Immigrant experience varied. Prejudice, education, skills,  
money, initiative and plain luck meant the difference between 
success and failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell noted the federal government provides a large share of  
the funding for the Smithsonian Institution, which includes the 
museum and 16 other sites. McConnell did not suggest reducing funds 
for the institution, which has asked for $447.4 million for the 
year beginning Oct. 1.

<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Baseball commissioner Bud Selig testified  
Thursday in a deposition before lawyers for ESPN as part of the 
sport's lawsuit against the cable network. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN wants to switch three late-season games to ESPN2 due to a  
conflict with NFL contests, but baseball disagreed, claiming its 
contract specifies the games must be on the primary network. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN wants to make the switch in order to accommodate its $4.8  
billion deal with the NFL. The network is available to about 76.2 
million homes, while ESPN2 is available in 64.5 million. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA, Ind. (AP) -- Francis Beck, a farm seed pioneer who with  
his father turned experiments with hybrid corn seed into a company 
that now serves four states, died Tuesday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck's Hybrids provides seed to customers in Indiana, Ohio,  
Michigan and Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The company began in 1937 when Beck and his father, Lawrence,  
applied to Purdue University for six acres of experimental hybrid 
seed corn. They planted the crop with a two-row, horse-drawn 
planter and harvested it by hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The hybrid corn allowed horses to run close to the row because  
stalks weren't tangled. Shucking the corn was easier, too. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, Beck received the Master Farmer Award by Prairie Farmer  
magazine. Last year, the Indiana Cattlemen's Association presented 
him with their highest award.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marguerite Cullman, who learned to pick Broadway  
winners as a writer for Stage magazine and helped finance the 
original productions of ``Oklahoma!'' ``South Pacific,'' ``Death of 
a Salesman'' and ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' died Sunday. She was 
94. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Mrs. Cullman's earliest jobs in the theater was to attend  
vaudeville performances to see if any jokes had been stolen from 
the gag writers who employed her. 
</P>
<P>
	She later worked as a copy editor for the McNaught newspaper  
syndicate and wrote for The New York Times magazine and The New 
Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
	At Stage magazine, she chose the monthly's covers.  
</P>

	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Faidon Gizikis, president of Greece during  
a military dictatorship in the early 1970s, died Monday. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	A former general in the Greek army, Gizikis became president in  
November 1973, after Col. George Papadopoulos was toppled by his 
military police chief, Brig. Dimitris Ioannides. 
</P>
<P>
	Gizikis played a key role in returning the country to democracy,  
and in July 1974, he swore in Constantine Caramanlis as the first 
post-dictatorship premier. In return, he was never prosecuted for 
his role in the junta, while others were convicted of treason and 
imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Gizikis held his post until December 1974, when he resigned and  
retired from the army. He was a second lieutenant during the 
1940-41 Greek-Italian war, where he received two gold honors for 
bravery. He also received 13 medals and military decorations 
between 1944 and 1949.

<HEADLINE> Mosh Pits Are Roiling and Dangerous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mosh pits can be a roiling, fearsome place to be during a rock  
concert. But the biggest danger has usually been broken bones, not 
sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	New York State police are investigating allegations of at least  
four rapes at Woodstock '99. One woman claims she was assaulted in 
the mosh pit as a band played. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosh pits are a place where concertgoers, usually boys and young  
men, hurl their bodies against each other in a release of 
aggression that's usually accompanied by intense, angry music. 
</P>
<P>
	Moshing used to be known as slam dancing when it began with the  
punk rock movement in the late 1970s. It turned darker as the music 
turned darker in the 1980s, and was popular at concerts by Southern 
California bands like Fear and Black Flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a sexual frisson as well as a human need for physical  
release,'' said Will Hermes, senior editor at Spin magazine. 
``People do it because it's fun. The danger makes it more exciting 
for people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mosh pits became larger when alternative rock bands like Nirvana  
and Pearl Jam became popular in the early 1990s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people were introduced to the practice by the huge, muddy  
mosh pit at Woodstock '94. Moshing was accompanied by its close 
cousins: stage diving, in which musicians and fans literally dive 
into an audience as if it were a pool, and crowd surfing, in which 
fans are passed along over audiences by the hands of people below 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some mosh pits are chaos with etiquette -- they look worse than  
they are,'' said Paul Wertheimer, president of Crowd Management 
Strategies, a company that specializes in rock concert security. 
``Then they have these sprawling, reckless pits where people can 
truly get hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Women who go crowd surfing are often groped by men. But most  
people who crowd surf do so voluntarily and are not dragged into 
the action. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries from mosh pit activity have been the trigger for  
lawsuits across the country. Some communities and universities have 
sought to ban or restrict the practice, Wertheimer said. Many rock 
clubs also ban moshing and stage diving. 
</P>
<P>
	Moshing has become even more frenetic as the music has increased  
in speed and intensity during the late 1990s, Hermes said. It is 
often seen at concerts by bands like Rage Against the Machine and 
Korn, both of whom performed at Woodstock '99.

<HEADLINE> Drug Company Settles With 37 States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The maker of Synthroid will pay 37 states $41.8  
million to settle charges that it made deceptive statements about 
the synthetic thyroid hormone drug, consumer authorities announced 
Thursday 
</P>
<P>
	Knoll Pharmaceuticals Company agreed to the terms of the  
settlement, which include ``assurances that any misleading or 
deceptive claims about its product will cease,'' the Maryland 
Attorney General's office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoll, a subsidiary of BASF Corp. based in Mount Olive, N.J.,  
admitted no wrongdoing or violation of any state or federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although there has been no finding of wrongdoing, Knoll agreed  
to settle to avoid the burden and expense of litigation,'' said 
company spokeswoman Linda Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys general from Maryland and other states alleged that  
Knoll violated consumer protection laws by claiming that Synthroid 
was unique or superior to competing brands. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys general also alleged that Knoll attempted to  
prevent the publication of a study which showed that Synthroid was 
no more effective than some generic thyroid drugs. The other drugs 
are two to three times less expensive than Synthroid. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mayer said the findings of that study have been disputed.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a class action suit involving consumers is still  
pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The other states in the settlement announced Thursday were:  
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware,  
Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, 
Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New 
Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, 
Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, 
Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Pickens Is Still Not Playing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Carl Pickens is going through with his threat  
to retire rather than play another down for the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Bengals prepared to open training camp in Georgetown,  
Ky., the all-time leading receiver in franchise history was back in 
Atlanta, working out and hoping for a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	If none materializes, Pickens will sit out rather than play for  
the Bengals, his agent reiterated Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's living in Atlanta, working out every day, staying ready,  
waiting for something to happen,'' agent Steve Zucker said. ``If it 
doesn't, he's prepared to retire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens, 29, made it clear last season that he wanted to leave  
as a free agent after seven seasons in Cincinnati. The Bengals have 
not had a winning record since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Bengals designated him their franchise player in  
February. Pickens said he would retire rather than play for the 
Bengals again. 
</P>
<P>
	When defensive end Dan Wilkinson objected to being labeled the  
franchise player after the 1997 season, the Bengals found a way out 
by trading him to Washington for first- and third-round draft 
picks. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been willing to offer the same package of draft picks  
for Pickens, leaving the receiver and the team at a standoff as 
training camp opens Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't blame Mike for wanting to get good value for Carl.  
He's a heck of a player,'' Zucker said. ``I think that whoever he's 
talking to, both sides are going to have to have a little 
give-and-take here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown thinks that if no trade is worked out, Pickens will  
eventually give in and report. Pickens would lose out on $3.5 
million in salary if he retires. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had one guy a year hold out under this system, but I  
don't think it made any sense for them to hold out,'' Brown said 
recently. ``I would like to think that at some point, he would come 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is different, Zucker said. Pickens isn't trying to hold out  
to get a better contract from the Bengals; he doesn't want to play 
for them, period. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing this for a lot of years. This is a unique  
situation,'' Zucker said. ``It's not posturing to get a big 
contract. We're not negotiating with the Bengals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the opening of training camp, the Bengals also had  
failed to reach contract agreements with their top two draft picks 
-- quarterback Akili Smith and cornerback Charles Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a quarterback from Oregon who was the third overall  
choice in the draft, was back in San Diego working out. The Bengals 
are offering an incentive-laden contract, while Smith is looking 
for a contract structured more along the lines of the one that 
quarterback Tim Couch -- the No. 1 overall pick -- got from 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, there's been no progress made since draft day,''  
agent Leigh Steinberg said Thursday. ``In recent years, we've had a 
very positive negotiating relationship, so this has been a real 
surprise.''

<HEADLINE> Study Impacts Muscular Dystrophy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Animal studies raise the possibility that a common antibiotic  
might be an effective treatment for about 15 percent of victims of 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose disease results from a certain 
genetic error. 
</P>
<P>
	The studies, conducted in mice, suggest that the drug might  
restore the production of a critical missing protein. Doctors from 
Ohio State University plan to start a small study soon to see if 
the approach works in people. 
</P>
<P>
	Clues about the possible treatment emerge from research  
conducted by Dr. H. Lee Sweeney and colleagues at the University of 
Pennsylvania. A report on their experiments is being published in 
the Aug. 15 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	They worked with mice that have a genetic error known as a  
misplaced stop codon, which cuts off protein production. Illness in 
these animals closely mimics the form of the disease in the 
minority of Duchenne's victims whose disease also results a 
premature stop codon. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the genetic error, the body stops production of a  
protein called dystrophin before it reaches its proper size. As a 
result, the dystrophin fails to work properly. The disease slowly 
destroys the muscles, and victims usually die in their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	Gentamicin appears to suppress stop codons. The researchers  
found that when the mice were given gentamicin injections, they 
started making dystrophin, reversing their disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether this will work in people is unknown. Sweeney noted that  
the antibiotic can cause hearing loss and kidney damage. He 
cautioned against using it routinely until human studies are 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said that if gentamicin helps those with  
muscular dystrophy, it might also be effective against other 
inherited diseases that can result from premature stop codons, such 
as cystic fibrosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs almost exclusively in boys  
and affects about one of every 3,500 newborn males. Most cases of 
the disease result from deletions within the dystrophin gene rather 
than a misplaced stop codon.

<HEADLINE> FBI Said Needs Outside Watchdog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department inspector general, who  
forced major changes in the FBI crime lab, believes the bureau 
needs a permanent outside watchdog rather than investigate its own 
misdeeds and missteps. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important that there be an external oversight body  
that has full and unlimited jurisdiction to conduct whatever 
investigations it thinks appropriate,'' Inspector General Michael 
R. Bromwich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bearded and bespectacled 45-year-old lawyer spoke in an  
interview this week as he leaves office after five occasionally 
stormy years. Under Bromwich, the office for the first time took on 
systematic problems in large special investigations, such as the 
lab and the FBI's handling of secrets about Chinese spying. 
</P>
<P>
	Bromwich's 400 investigators have unlimited authority to probe  
other Justice agencies, like the Marshals Service, Bureau of 
Prisons, Immigration and Naturalization Service and department 
lawyers for conduct other than legal work. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration have  
internal investigative arms with primary authority to investigate 
their agents. Only in large public controversies has Attorney 
General Janet Reno ordered Bromwich into FBI or DEA probes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the FBI's enormous power and support, particularly  
in Congress, the issue of expanding oversight of the FBI has never 
gotten any traction,'' Bromwich said. ``People get interested in it 
on specific issues,'' such as the lab; Richard Jewell, the Atlanta 
security guard wrongly suspected of the Olympic bombing; or the 
Ruby Ridge, Idaho, siege where an FBI sniper killed an unarmed 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``But eventually the bureau, because of their continuing clout,  
gets restored to their favored position,'' Bromwich said. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesmen did not respond to questions regarding Bromwich's  
remarks. In recent years, FBI Director Louis Freeh enlarged and 
strengthened the bureau's internal investigations office, and even 
Bromwich concedes its has become more professional under Freeh. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said, ``Our doing an investigation has a greater  
deterrent effect, and it has more credibility with the public than 
the FBI and DEA policing themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And one outside watchdog would be fairer, he said. Currently, an  
immigration officer and an FBI agent face ``potentially different 
standards, different outcomes for the same misbehavior and a 
difference in the objectivity of the result,'' Bromwich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bromwich's intervention made a dramatic difference in the  
handling of years of complaints about the crime lab from FBI 
chemist Frederic Whitehurst. Virtually all of his complaints had 
been dismissed by several internal FBI reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	But the inspector general, aided by private forensic experts he  
recruited, discovered flawed scientific work and inaccurate 
testimony biased in favor of the prosecution in major cases, 
including the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	At the inspector general's recommendation, the lab has revised  
procedures and training, finally obtained its first accreditation 
by outside experts, and is now headed for the first time by a 
scientist, Assistant FBI Director Donald Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had not done the review, they'd have another agent in  
that job -- nobody like Donald Kerr, a top-ranked scientist,'' 
Bromwich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some department officials viewed Bromwich as prickly, because he  
fought regularly over jurisdiction with Michael Shaheen, who headed 
another Justice watchdog agency. Reno restricted Shaheen to 
monitoring the legal ethics of Justice lawyers, and Bromwich said 
problems subsided when Shaheen retired in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Bromwich took another dispute all the way to Reno, forcing her  
to exercise for the first time her authority to block publication 
of an inspector general report. Justice officials felt his report 
might incidentally jeopardize an ongoing drug case. Released months 
later after that risk passed, the report found no evidence of a CIA 
role in the crack cocaine epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reno understands, but other officials have to get used to the  
fact that an inspector general is not part of the team in the 
regular sense,'' Bromwich said. ``An IG has an independent mandate 
under the law and can't be a straight subordinate.''

<HEADLINE> Owner Sells Part of Hornets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Michael Jordan's disinterest turned into  
the opportunity of a lifetime for Ray Wooldridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitalizing on Jordan's decision to abandon attempts to buy a  
share of the Charlotte Hornets, Wooldridge on Thursday became a 
minority owner of the NBA franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal calls for George Shinn, formerly the sole owner of the  
team, to remain the managing partner. Wooldridge has the right to 
buy up to 50 percent of the team within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Shinn nor Wooldridge would reveal financial terms of the  
deal. But team officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, 
said it was worth between $75 million and $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
	While that represents a significant profit for Shinn, who  
brought the Hornets into the NBA in 1988 for an expansion fee of 
$32.5 million, Wooldridge had no complaints. Less than three months 
ago, he figured there was no chance of buying any part of the 
Hornets, regardless of price. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Shinn was locked in negotiations to sell a  
portion of the team to Jordan. But the retired NBA superstar broke 
off talks in early May after Shinn refused to sell more than a 
minority share or give Jordan a say in key business decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not willing to give up 100 percent control for half the  
price,'' Shinn said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's withdrawal opened the door for Wooldridge, an Atlanta  
businessman who chuckled when asked how quickly he called Shinn 
after learning of Jordan's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was within the hour,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wooldridge, 55, admittedly won't create the fanfare that someone  
like Jordan would. Wooldridge hasn't played basketball since high 
school and said that other than coaching youth teams, his main 
attachment to the game is as a fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the thrills of my life,'' said Wooldridge, who  
recently sold Space Master International Inc., an Atlanta-based 
modular office construction business, for about $270 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Wooldridge said he contacted commissioner David Stern several  
years ago to express an interest in purchasing a share of a team. 
Wooldridge said Stern introduced him to Shinn. 
</P>
<P>
	Wooldridge becomes a part owner of a team that has never  
advanced past the second round of the playoffs and failed to 
qualify for the postseason this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn has had trouble getting support for his claim that the  
Hornets need a new arena to replace the 23,799-seat Charlotte 
Coliseum, where attendance has dipped in recent years. Shinn said a 
new facility with more luxury suites would allow him to raise more 
money to pay the salaries needed to attract the most talented free 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets used to sell out every game at the Charlotte  
Coliseum, but attendance fell to an all-time low average of 19,232 
last season. The Hornets failed to sell out a single home game. 
</P>
<P>
	Wooldridge said his main responsibility will be to spearhead the  
drive for a new arena in downtown Charlotte.

<HEADLINE> Peru Paroles 2 U.S. Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DANVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- Denny Davis never objected to his  
daughter's prison sentence for trying to smuggle cocaine out of 
Peru. 
</P>
<P>
	But the former prison guard did object to the conditions  
Jennifer Davis and a friend had to endure behind bars: disease, 
insect infestation and inadequate food and health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my daughter was fed properly down there, if she were  
getting proper medical treatment down there ... I would not have 
had a beef. I would not have said a word,'' her father said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	After a campaign by her family and U.S. lawmakers, Ms. Davis and  
Krista Barnes were paroled Tuesday night from a Peruvian prison, 
where they were jailed for almost three years. 
</P>
<P>
	They could be home by the end of the year, as the United States  
and Peru work out details of the transfer. The women will serve out 
the rest of their six-year prison sentence in the United States on 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Davis, 22, was an aspiring model when she and Barnes were  
jailed in September 1996 on charges they were paid $5,000 to 
smuggle eight pounds of cocaine out of Peru. 
</P>
<P>
	During Ms. Davis' absence, her family placed three yellow  
ribbons around trees in their yard in rural Danville. While they 
will remove two once the women return home, Davis says they will 
not remove the third ribbon until conditions improve for the 
Americans who ``are treated like animals'' in foreign jails. 
</P>
<P>
	The Davises initially tried to get their daughter's prison  
sentenced transferred to a U.S. facility, to no avail. Davis 
described their daughter's ordeal as a ``nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As parents, we think `What did we do wrong?' We think, `Are we  
going to get our daughter back alive?''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ms. Davis was overjoyed when she talked to her family on  
the phone after being released, her mother said she also regretted 
leaving behind friends in the Chorrillos women's prison near Lima. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been her family for the last three years. She's happy  
to get out and wants to get home, but at the same time she has the 
emotions of leaving her family, the one inside the prison,'' Claire 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once their daughter is home, the Davises said they will continue  
to work for better conditions for Americans held in foreign jails. 
Ms. Davis intends to speak to students about the dangers of drugs 
and smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wants to try to save somebody else,'' Mrs. Davis said.

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn of New Y2K Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some programmers hired to fix Year 2000  
problems may be quietly installing malicious software codes to 
sabotage companies or gain access to sensitive information after 
the new year, two top government computer security experts warned 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Vatis, director of the FBI's National Infrastructure  
Protection Center, said experts hired by U.S. companies to fix 
their computers can secretly install ``trap doors'' -- ways to let 
them gain access later -- or add malicious codes, such as a logic 
bomb or time-delayed virus that could disrupt systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``While systems have been and will continue to be extensively  
tested, the probability of finding malicious code is extremely 
small,'' agreed Richard Schaeffer, director of the Defense 
Department's Infrastructure and Information Assurance program. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither expert suggested the possible scope of the problem.  
</P>
<P>
	They raised the alarms at hearing Thursday on the Y2K glitch and  
cyberterrorism before the Senate Committee on the Year 2000 
Technology Problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of these (rogue programmers) have no security clearance,  
do not work for the government, and yet they have access to 
critical systems that if sabotaged could wreak havoc to our 
financial institutions and our economy,'' said Sen. Christopher 
Dodd, D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000  
Conversion, said security breaches may be difficult to recognize 
because it's unlikely they'll be triggered on New Year's Day, when 
systems will face heavy scrutiny. Problems, if any, probably will 
appear weeks or months later. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have violent intent, the last time in the world you  
want to set it to go off is January 1 or 2,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent report from the Gartner Group, a consulting company,  
predicted electronic thefts worth at least $1 billion, noting that 
the computer networks of financial institutions, corporations and 
governments handle transactions worth $11 trillion annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``With so many people involved and all the code being looked at,  
it's such an unprecedented risk if we don't have good audit 
procedures,'' said Bob Mack, a Gartner analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	A New York bank that hired contractors in India to repair its  
software discovered in 1996 that one of the programmers had added 
code to transfer money to his own account, said Allen Burgess of 
Data Integrity Inc., a Y2K consultant later hired by the same bank. 
Burgess declined to identify the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaeffer said problems are complicated by the New Year's  
rollover, when some computers programmed to recognize only the last 
two digits of a year may mistake 2000 for a full century earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Both experts said the risks were exacerbated by the amount of  
software repaired by companies overseas. Vatis called the situation 
``a unique opportunity for foreign countries and companies to 
access, steal from or disrupt sensitive national and proprietary 
information systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vatis recommended that companies thoroughly check the  
backgrounds of companies they hire for software repairs. He also 
said they should test for the existence of trap doors after the 
repairs, possibly even hiring teams to try to electronically crack 
into their own networks.

<HEADLINE> Harrelson Testifies in Drug Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Woody Harrelson has come to the  
defense of a California man who is trying to fight federal drug 
charges by using the state's new medical marijuana law. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, an advocate for the legalization of hemp, testified  
Thursday as a character witness for his friend B.E. Smith, who was 
convicted of felony charges of possession and cultivation of 
marijuana in May. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces up to five years in prison at his sentencing next week.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith has said that he grew pot to help sick people. Such a  
defense could offer him immunity in a state court because 
Proposition 215, approved by voters in 1996, allows for the growth 
and consumption of marijuana for medical use. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we living in a democracy when the federal government and a  
puppet judge blatantly disregard a law created by the people?'' 
Harrelson asked in court. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Harrelson, frustrated at not being able to talk  
about medical marijuana, clashed with the judge and accused him of 
``keeping the truth from the jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. warned Harrelson that  
he might find himself behind bars if he continued to defy the 
court.

<HEADLINE> California Shows Abortion Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Abortions dipped slightly in California in 1996,  
but the state still had the highest rate in the nation and Wyoming 
still had the lowest, the government reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	California has had the nation's highest abortion rate since  
1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released  
state-by-state statistics showing California recorded 280,180 
abortions, or 39 for every 1,000 women ages 15 to 44, in 1996. A 
year earlier, California reported 289,987 abortions, a rate of 40 
per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyoming's total increased from 182 in 1995 to 208 in 1996, the  
latest year for which statistics are available. The rate stayed at 
2 per 1,000 women. 
</P>
<P>
	New York had the second highest rate in 1996, at 37 per 1,000  
women. Florida was third at 27, followed by Delaware at 26 and 
Rhode Island at 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC previously reported that the nationwide abortion rate  
held steady in 1996 at 20 per 1,000 women. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences in the state-by-state rates can be attributed in  
part to the age and racial makeup of the female population, the 
rate of contraceptive use and socioeconomic factors, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It also has to do with the proportion of pregnancies that are  
planned verses unplanned,'' said Lisa Koonin of the CDC's Division 
of Reproductive Health. ``The number of abortions are directly 
related to the number of unintended pregnancies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the women who had abortions in 1996 were white and  
unmarried, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	States reported 1,221,585 abortions in 1996, an increase of less  
than 1 percent from the year before. It was the first time 
abortions had failed to decline since 1990, when the total was more 
than 1.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Aleutian Canada Geese Make Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government Friday will propose removing  
the Aleutian Canada geese from the threatened species list Friday, 
citing a remarkable recovery after foxes introduced by fur farmers 
pushed the birds to the brink of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	The migratory geese, found on remote islands off the Alaska  
coast and in Oregon and California during winters, were among the 
first animals to be listed under the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The birds with the distinctive white neck bands numbered just  
790 in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	But removing foxes from the birds' nesting islands, protecting  
their migration habitat and relocating geese to more islands helped 
bring their numbers to about 32,000 today, the Fish and Wildlife 
Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Humans nearly drove the Aleutian Canada goose to extinction,  
and humans through the Endangered Species Act saved this 
magnificent bird,'' Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The geese were defenseless when fur farmers and trappers  
introduced foxes to more than 190 islands in the birds' nesting 
range off Alaska as early as 1750. The fox introductions at the 
previously mammal-free islands hit their peak from 1915 to 1936, 
when fur demand was high. 
</P>
<P>
	Biologists found no Aleutian Canada geese from 1938 through  
1962, but then discovered a remaining population on the rugged, 
remote Buldir Island in the western Aleutian Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	The geese were declared an endangered species in 1967 under the  
Endangered Species Protection Act of 1966, a law that preceded the 
Endangered Species Act by seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	The birds' status was upgraded from endangered to threatened in  
1990 after geese populations reached 6,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the government proposal, the geese could be taken off the  
threatened species list in about a year, following a final comment 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese Ambassador Kunihiko Saito, Russian Ambassador Yuriy  
Ushakov and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott were expected 
to join Babbitt for Friday's delisting announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, Russia and Japan have a joint project to  
revive geese populations in the Kuril Islands off the coast of 
Russia. Eighty-six birds have been released at the islands so far 
and more releases are planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's announcement marks the Fish and Wildlife Service's  
seventh proposed delisting this year. Only 27 species have been 
delisted since the Endangered Species Act was passed in 1973, and 
16 of those disappeared or had been listed by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	There are still 1,181 species listed under the Endangered  
Species Act, and 60 percent of those are plants.

<HEADLINE> Sanders Was Never Ordinary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Barry Sanders went into the final game of his rookie season in  
1989, knowing just what he needed to win the NFL rushing title -- 
1,480 yards, the total reached earlier in the day by Christian 
Okoye of Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he took himself out of the game at the start of the fourth  
quarter, 10 yards short of Okoye, and resisted every effort to go 
back in and win the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry just doesn't care about those things like records,''  
Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy said Wednesday, the day Sanders 
announced he would retire from football after 10 years despite 
needing just 1,458 yards to eclipse Walter Payton's career rushing 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was an assistant with the Chiefs when he let Christian take  
the title, and we were all aware of what he was doing. He doesn't 
care about the spotlight and he doesn't care about records.''. 
</P>
<P>
	The conventional wisdom in a lot of places is that Sanders'  
announcement is a ploy either to force a trade or get more money 
from the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sanders never adhered to conventional wisdom, either on the  
field or off it. That's why his retirement announcement should be 
taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was astounded when I heard he was retiring with the record  
so close,'' former Buffalo coach Marv Levy said. ``But when you 
think about it, he's never been a guy who postures. There's nothing 
phony about him, so if he says he's retired, maybe he's retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No, Barry Sanders doesn't like posturing.  
</P>
<P>
	Go back to training camp in 1992, after Detroit lost 41-10 to  
Washington in the NFC title game, the closest Sanders ever got to a 
Super Bowl in 10 years with the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Side-by-side were two lockers, shrines to offensive linemen Mike  
Utley, paralyzed on the field the year before, and Eric Andolsek, 
killed in an offseason accident. That's the way Wayne Fontes, the 
team's emotional coach, thought was the best way to pay tribute to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders didn't agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I like that,'' Sanders said, looking at the  
lockers. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys weren't gods. They were real people. They have  
families, and those families have feelings. No, I don't like it. 
Mike's still very much alive and I think we should be reminded of 
Eric's positive contributions, not his death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the field, there was no one like Sanders, either.  
</P>
<P>
	He regularly led the league in yards for losses -- his style was  
zigzag, not straight ahead, and when he zigged for a hole that 
wasn't there, he'd get trapped -- yards behind the line of 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	But a play or two later, he'd break for 30 or more, sometimes  
bending his body at a 45-degree angle from the ground, then 
bouncing up to dart through a small hole. At 5-foot-8, 200 pounds, 
he had the flexibility of a gymnast, the ability to twist and turn 
in ways an Emmitt Smith or a Terrell Davis, the best of his 
contemporaries, wouldn't even attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry did things I wouldn't try to do,'' said Davis, who ran  
for 2,008 yards for Denver last season and is now the game's 
pre-eminent running back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a running back. He's a great athlete. If he were a  
lineman, he'd be the best lineman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why did he retire? Sanders said it was the culmination of a  
thought process that began after last season. And his father 
suggested in May that his son was upset by the mediocrity of the 
Lions and the inability of Detroit to trade him because of the 
multimillion-dollar salary cap hit they would take. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sanders' 10 years, his team was 78-82 in regular-season play  
and 1-5 in the five years they made the playoffs. In the Fontes 
era, which covered Sanders' first eight seasons, the Lions were 
constantly changing coordinators and systems -- from the 
run-and-shoot, to a one-back system with no blocker, to a more 
conventional pro set. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd gain his 1,500 or 1,700 or 1,800 yards regardless and got  
2,058 in Bobby Ross' first year, 1997, carrying Detroit to the 
playoffs in a brilliant final regular-season game. Naturally, they 
lost their first postseason game, 20-10 in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Lions finished 5-11 last season, Sanders apparently  
had enough. He'd had an ``off'' year, 1,491 yards, and there were 
no Super Bowl rings in sight. So he stayed silent until he shocked 
the football world on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I think he's serious,'' Dungy said. ``If he'd  
announced it after last season or last spring, he'd have had 
everyone in Detroit calling him to coax him back.''

<HEADLINE> Procter &AMP; Gamble's Earnings Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Fourth-quarter net earnings at Procter &AMP;  
Gamble Co. decreased 40 percent, primarily as the result of a $385 
million after-tax charge for the costs of a reorganization 
announced in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $414 million, or 29  
cents per share, compared with $686 million or 47 cents per share, 
in the same period ending June 30 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G president and chief executive Durk Jager said the new  
Organization 2005 program announced in June is in place and the 
Cincinnati-based company anticipates significant benefits for the 
coming fiscal year and beyond. The multiyear initiative is designed 
to accelerate sales and earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the charge from Organization 2005, the company said  
its core earnings reflected a 16 percent increase in the fourth 
quarter to $799 million, or 55 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call were expecting earnings of 53  
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter ending June 30 increased 2 percent to  
$9.45 billion, compared with $9.27 billion in 1998. Sales for the 
year increased 3 percent from $37.1 billion in 1998 to $38.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, P&AMP;G said net earnings were down less than 1  
percent, from $3.78 billion in 1998 to $3.76 billion in 1999. Per 
share earnings for 1999 were $2.59, compared with $2.56 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has said that the Organization 2005 program is  
expected to cost $1.9 billion after taxes over the six-year period 
and will affect 15,000 positions worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sells about 300 product brands in more than 140  
countries. These brands include Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, 
Pantene Pro-V shampoo, Pringles snack chips and Pampers disposable 
diapers. P&AMP;G employs more than 110,000 employees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of P&AMP;G rose $2 to $88.12 1/2 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Game Honors Killed Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers will dedicate Friday's  
game at County Stadium to the memory of three workers killed during 
the construction of Miller Park. 
</P>
<P>
	For every ticket sold for the contest against the Montreal  
Expos, $3 will be donated to the Miller Park Memorial Fund, which 
benefits the families of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers were killed when a giant construction crane  
collapsed on July 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a hard time for these people right now, and that's why we  
would like to encourage everyone to come out and contribute to this 
great event,'' said Frank Busalacchi, chairman of the stadium 
board's construction committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 22,000 tickets for the game had been sold by Thursday  
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're already at their average and climbing,'' said Michael  
R. Duckett, the executive director for the board overseeing Miller 
Park's construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner and former Brewers owner Bud Selig paid  
for 1,000 tickets and distributed them to Miller Park construction 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miller Park Memorial Fund will also receive proceeds from a  
$25 per person tailgate event before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	County Stadium's bleachers, which had been closed since the  
accident because of their proximity to the accident site, will be 
reopened for the game. Police had wanted them empty to protect the 
scene and prevent gawkers from climbing to the top to see the 
accident site. 
</P>
<P>
	The contest will include a moment of silence for the victims,  
followed by an announcement of how much money was raised for the 
memorial fund.

<HEADLINE> Hopes High at Saints Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) -- Call them confident, call them cocky,  
call them crazy. The New Orleans Saints swaggered onto the practice 
field for the first time Thursday convinced they will finish the 
season strutting into the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, if I had told you the Falcons would be in the Super  
Bowl, you would have laughed,'' general manager Bill Kuharich said. 
``This year, we're the team that will make believers of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints' dedication to proving Kuharich right could be seen  
in their offseason workouts, which were the best in the history of 
the franchise with 98 percent of the players participating. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys understand that our chance is now, not three years  
from now,'' coach Mike Ditka said. ``The bottom line in this 
business is winning. The bottom line for me is winning. I didn't 
win my first two years. If I don't win this year, I shouldn't be 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans, which has not had a winning record in seven years,  
was 6-10 in each of Ditka's first two seasons. Yet when Ditka 
introduced Ricky Williams to a crowd of fans following the draft 
and pronounced his team playoff bound, nobody snickered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe everything he says,'' said Williams, who predicted  
at least a trip to the playoffs. ``This is a good team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Heisman Trophy winner isn't able to carry the offense, he  
should at least give it a big boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka, who still dreams of the days when Walter Payton was  
carrying the football for him at Chicago, believes Williams is from 
the same mold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this kid is the real thing,'' Ditka said. ``I don't  
think anything bothers him except not doing his job and not 
winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is to get the football to Williams at least 20 times a  
game -- something the Saints have not done for other running backs 
the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamar Smith, last year's leading rusher, had only 138 carries --  
an average of just over eight a game -- and 457 yards. The Saints 
have not had a 1,000-yard rusher in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
                            *Cardinals    	
</P>
<P>
	Arizona will probably be missing two starters and its top three  
draft picks when it opens training camp Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Rob Moore and defensive tackle Mark Smith are  
likely to be no-shows because of contract squabbles, and 
first-round picks David Boston and L.J. Shelton and second-rounder 
Johnny Rutledge are also unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Cowboys    	
</P>
<P>
	In need of help on the defensive line, the Cowboys agreed to a  
contract with troubled veteran Alonzo Spellman, according to his 
agent, Leigh Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The team didn't immediately confirm the deal.  
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said Spellman, out of football since the Chicago Bears  
released him in June 1998 following several bizarre episodes, 
accepted a one-year contract for the veteran minimum of $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Bengals    	
</P>
<P>
	Carl Pickens is going through with his threat to retire rather  
than play another down for Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Bengals prepared to open training camp in Georgetown,  
Ky., the leading receiver in franchise history was back in Atlanta, 
working out and hoping for a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	If none materializes, Pickens will sit out rather than play for  
the Bengals, agent Steve Zucker said. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Panthers    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Robert Daniel will miss the season after an examination  
revealed a fractured disc in his neck, the team announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery to fuse the two vertebrae between the disc will be  
performed next week after swelling goes down, the Panthers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recovery is expected within three or four months for the  
sixth-round draft choice from Northwestern (La.) State. He should 
be able to play next season, according to the team. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Colts    	
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Mike Peterson, the Colts' second-round draft pick,  
ended his holdout and joined the team in Champaign, Ill., for its 
morning practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts didn't announce terms of the agreement, but on  
Wednesday his agent said Peterson had agreed to a four-year 
contract that could make him the highest paid of this year's 
second-round draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Packers    	
</P>
<P>
	The Packers announced the signing of former Kansas City Chiefs  
outside linebacker Anthony Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was the Chiefs' leading tackler over the last four  
seasons. He started every game last season and had 117 tackles and 
a career-high 4 1/2 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis informally agreed to the terms several days ago, but  
didn't sign until he reported to camp. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Jaguars    	
</P>
<P>
	When the Jaguars reported for training camp, first-round draft  
pick Fernando Bryant was not present, as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless there's a miraculous change, we're at an impasse,''  
senior vice president Michael Huyghue said. ``It looks like we're 
in a holdout situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cornerback out of Alabama has demanded a four-year deal,  
while the Jaguars have insisted that he sign a five-year contract.

<HEADLINE> Waste Management's Stock Swoons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Waste Management Inc.'s battered stock plunged an  
additional 17.5 percent Thursday as the nation's largest 
trash-hauling company further lowered its earnings estimate and 
disclosed the resignations of two top executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management had already surprised traders earlier this  
month with word that revenues fell $250 million short of 
projections in June. It said Thursday its revised earnings estimate 
of 67 cents to 70 cents a share was still about 9 cents too high. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, Earl E. DeFrates resigned as chief financial  
officer, although the company said he would remain in another 
capacity. General counsel Gregory T. Sangalis also stepped down. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management's stock tumbled $5.50 to close at $25.93 3/4 a  
share. The company's share value has shrunk in half since its 
initial July 6 warning. 
</P>
<P>
	In the selloff Thursday, more than 38 million shares changed  
hands, making it the most active issue on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Ford, an analyst for PaineWebber, said some investors  
will remain cautious about the company until they're confident 
executives have a firm grasp on finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, they had to reset everyone's expectations lower  
today, but ultimately they're making long-term decisions for the 
shareholder,'' Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts polled by First Call Corp. had adjusted their  
second-quarter per-share estimate to 67 cents after the first 
earnings warning, down from an original estimate of 78 cents. 
Official results, expected to be between 58 cents and 60 cents, are 
due Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shortfall against expectations in the second quarter are  
largely related to not having (reasonable) expectations,'' Waste 
Management spokeswoman Cherie Rice said. ``The expectations were 
too aggressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's announcement blamed 6 cents a share of the latest  
downward adjustment on expected cost savings on accounting changes 
that were never made. The other 3 cents are attributed to interest 
charges and poor operating results. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh F. Holman, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens,  
said the unrealized accounting savings initially were thought to 
have a minimal effect on the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	``They thought these accounting changes would be less than a  
penny in terms of positive impact, and now they're telling us 6 
cents a share,'' said Holman, who said the dearth of accurate 
information could damage investor confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also have blamed the downturn partly on Waste  
Management's inability to swiftly reorganize after Houston-based 
USA Waste Services and Oak Brook, Ill.-based Waste Management 
closed a $13.5 billion merger a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company retained the Waste Management name, although USA  
Waste effectively bought its slumping former competitor. Later in 
1998, Waste Management purchased Mt. Laurel, N.J.-based Eastern 
Environmental Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management's far-flung nature -- it operates more than  
1,300 waste facilities in the United States and 15 other countries 
-- makes it difficult to quickly pin down companywide figures, Ms. 
Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to gather information to get a sense of the  
size of this, and trying to do so in a short period of time,'' she 
said, adding that officials are trying to streamline intracompany 
communication.

<HEADLINE> Alexandra Stevenson Talks Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The first woman to reach the  
semifinals of Wimbledon as a qualifier has been described as a 
cross between Andre Agassi and a Valley Girl. It's easy to see why. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennis star Alexandra Stevenson loves to talk -- about boys,  
black cocktail dresses, Julia Roberts, dancing and her high school 
prom. Things aren't good, they are ``awesome.'' She is only 18, 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some subjects, though, that aren't discussed, most  
notably the attention that surrounded the revelation she was the 
out-of-wedlock daughter of Hall of Fame basketball player Julius 
Erving. 
</P>
<P>
	The news broke in the midst of her Wimbledon success and trailed  
her to the Pan American Games, her first tournament since then. 
``It's all old news,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The games are sort of a debutante ball for the teen-ager who is  
now ranked No. 37 in the world, a way to glide back into tennis 
before the overwhelming scrutiny she will face from the U.S. media 
when she appears at the U.S. Open in New York later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Safely in Canada, Stevenson can be herself and not just the  
daughter of someone famous. It's a different sort of tournament 
than the pros normally take on. The prize is a gold medal, no cash 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	For Stevenson, it also provides a chance to move on. Her first  
news conference here in Winnipeg showed off the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The questions, given the subject, were polite. She easily  
deflected hapless efforts to dig out a response to the ``Dr. J.'' 
question with an almost cheerful ``No comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A teen-ager clearly unafraid of attention instead pointed out to  
reporters that it wasn't fair her teammates were being ignored. She 
gushed about how much fun she was having on the Canadian prairie in 
a big international event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very excited to be here, to represent my country is a  
great honor,'' she said. ``I can't wait to start playing and hope 
to see you there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson's presence should direct attention to the U.S. team,  
which otherwise lacks stars. That's good for everyone, says U.S. 
coach Lynne Rolley -- even if Stevenson gets most of the attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the Olympics for us,'' Rolley said. ``We're here to  
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. coach, who has known Stevenson for years, sees her  
coming into her own, taking her game to a new level. Wimbledon was 
only the first step. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone in sports is building for that moment when they make  
a breakthrough, and everyone recognizes that,'' Rolley said. ``It 
feels good. That's why we're in sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the day before her 6-2, 6-0 victory against Miriam  
D'Agostini, the No. 2 ranked player in Brazil, Stevenson and 
teammate Lilia Osterloh of Canal Winchester, Ohio, got busy getting 
into the spirit of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	After practice, the two athletes sped off to a beauty salon to  
have their nails done in red, white and blue. Stevenson's toes 
still had Wimbledon's chipped shades of green and purple and it was 
definitely coming off. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very serious,'' she told Osterloh while laughing.  
</P>
<P>
	As a somewhat stunned manicurist took on a pair of famous feet,  
Stevenson talked about plans to equal the accomplishments of heroes 
like Margaret Court while becoming a crowd-pleaser like Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tennis is entertainment. You buy a ticket, right? Andre  
realizes that,'' she said, pointing out he and other showmen Jimmy 
Connors and John McEnroe have an affinity to play to a crowd. 
``That's what I want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While she became a sensation at Wimbledon, she was disappointed,  
because her goal was to win. She paid no attention to the fury set 
off when a newspaper retrieved her birth certificate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in my own bubble,'' she said. ``I ignored everyone.''  
</P>
<P>
	Though she also eventually wants to act, dance and sing,  
Stevenson is working right now on being No. 1 in tennis. In the Pan 
Ams, she's focusing on winning a gold medal, having a ``blast,'' 
and dismissing the dad issue. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, he's her dad. So what?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still the same,'' she said. ``Nothing has changed.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Wins Pan Am Games Walk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- A woozy Joel Sanchez and a fortunate  
Carlos Mercenario gave Mexico a 1-2 finish in race walking at the 
Pan American Games on Thursday, when Philip Dunn produced the 
United States' first medal in the 50-kilometer event in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexicans also finished 1-2 in both the men's and women's 20K  
walks Monday in Assiniboine Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the 50K race were in doubt for nearly 1 1/2 hours.  
At first, officials disqualifed Mercenario, claiming he was given 
assistance along the course. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexicans appealed the decision, and the officials overturned  
their original decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Mexicans, along with Dunn and American Gary Morgan, were  
the only ones from the field of seven to finish the 31.2-mile race 
in oppressive heat. Another walker was disqualified and two others 
dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez's first major international victory, in 4 hours, 6  
minutes, 31 seconds, was the sixth straight by a Mexican in the 50K 
walk. They have not lost since 1979, also finishing second in each 
of those races. The event was not held in 1975, and the last 
non-Mexican winner was Larry Young in 1971, when Americans went 
1-3. Marco Evoniuk was the last American to medal, getting the 
bronze in '79. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercenario finished in 4:09:48 and Dunn in 4:13:45.  
</P>
<P>
	When Sanchez finished, he appeared dazed. After answering a  
couple of questions, he began to wobble and was escorted into the 
medical tent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very tired in the final laps,'' he said, after taking 25  
minutes to recover. ``I began to feel the temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt lost at the end of the race. My muscles were fatigued  
because your body just needs to relax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez and Tim Berrett of Canada were locked in a tight duel  
for the lead through 35 kilometers. Then the weary Berrett dropped 
out and Sanchez had the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Canadian was looking strong, but when he went out, it was  
all over,'' Sanchez, the silver medalist in the 1991 20K walk, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his exhaustion and a whopping lead over Mercenario,  
Sanchez lunged for the tape at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was like a track race,'' he said, laughing. ``I  
thought I had to lean across the finish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mercenario, the 20K champion in 1987, was seeking his third  
consecutive 50K title. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very long course, especially in this weather,'' he  
said. ``The combination of the temperature and the distance was 
very tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn was proud of how he fared against topnotch competition.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a challenge today,'' he said. ``There were some of the  
best race walkers in the world here. The Mexicans proved that. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of those days, hot and humid, when you just try to  
survive, let alone medal.''

<HEADLINE> Teen Convicted of Killing Classmate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A former high school honor student  
was convicted Thursday of murdering a classmate in a jealous rage 
last year and was sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacob Davis, 19, was convicted of shooting 18-year-old Nicholas  
Creson to death with a hunting rifle in the Lincoln County High 
School parking lot on May 19, 1998 -- three days before they were to 
graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also was found guilty of reckless endangerment and  
carrying a weapon on school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers admitted he killed Creson, but said Davis was  
distraught that his ex-girlfriend had been in a sexual relationship 
with Creson. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is teen-age tragedy,'' defense attorney Ray Fraley said  
in his closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Davis knew exactly what he was doing. They read  
excerpts from a letter Davis wrote two months before the shooting 
in which he said he wanted to ``put a three-inch diameter hole'' in 
Creson's chest. Davis wrote two letters expressing similar 
sentiments on the day of the shooting.

<HEADLINE> More Spending Urged in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan needs to put together a second supplementary  
budget for the current fiscal year to help spur the economy towards 
recovery, the country's economic chief said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending package is expected to be as large as $86.9 billion  
(10 trillion yen) and follows a first extra budget approved earlier 
this month worth around $4.72 billion to create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The necessity for the government to pump more spending into the  
troubled economy is ``high,'' said Taichi Sakaiya, head of Japan's 
Economic Planning Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakaiya, however, said the size and timing of the package will  
be decided after the government sees the official economic growth 
data for the April-June quarter, which is due out in early 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	That data might not be encouraging. The Japan Center for  
Economic Research said Friday it estimates gross domestic product 
dropped 0.1 percent in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese economy is stuck in its toughest downturn in  
decades. The government announced Friday that unemployment in June 
hit a record high of 4.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has gone on a massive spending campaign to keep  
the economy moving and get people to consume more. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures are considered the main force behind the economy's  
surprising 1.9 percent growth in the first three months of the 
year. Authorities, however, now worry that the economy will slip 
back into recession when those pump-priming measures run out. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, the Cabinet set guidelines for the budget for the  
next fiscal year, which starts April 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	General expenditures to finance policy programs are set at just  
above $413 billion, up from the $407.8 billion allocated in the 
initial budget for fiscal 1999 through March 31, 2000, Kyodo News 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cabinet set aside $81.7 billion for public works spending,  
the same amount as for fiscal 1999, and a special spending quota of 
$4.35 billion to regenerate the economy, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton Campaigning Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton returned to the  
Senate campaign trail Thursday, blasting a Republican tax cut and 
facing more questions about running for office in a state where she 
doesn't live. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks to about 60 factory workers, Mrs. Clinton said the  
$792 billion tax cut pushed by Republicans in Washington would 
``damage most New Yorkers'' and ``very well might undo the economic 
progress that we've made in the last 6 1/2 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about residency came from both inside and outside the  
Hilliard Corp. plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, plant employee David Caton asked Mrs. Clinton whether  
she would favor legislation imposing a residency requirement for 
Senate candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be a state decision. That's in the state  
constitution and it's state law. So the people of New York would 
have to make whatever changes they would make through their state 
Legislature.'' she said. But, she added with a smile, ``I kind of 
like it the way it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only requirement now on the books is that a candidate live  
in the state by election day. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the plant, Jim Davis, a manager for Corning Natural Gas,  
asked how she planned to deal with the carpetbagger issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling that ``a very fair question,'' Mrs. Clinton said that  
``if I do this, I'll do it with my whole heart .... Ultimately it 
will be up to the people of New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Clinton resumed her ``listening tour,'' a new poll  
showed voters remain divided in a theoretical race between her and 
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, her strongest potential 
Republican rival. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, from the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute showed  
each candidate supported by 45 percent of registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Like poll respondents, those who saw Mrs. Clinton on the  
campaign trail Thursday, were divided over the prospects of her 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a disgrace. She's not a New Yorker,'' said Linda Stearns,  
a Republican. ``She's got a name and money and she thinks she can 
run for the Senate from our state. We don't need her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She isn't fond of Giuliani either, saying she might vote for him  
as ``the lesser of two evils.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The University of Southern California's  
School of Medicine has received one of the largest donations ever 
given to a medical school -- a $110 million gift from the W.M. Keck 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	To receive the full grant, USC must raise $330 million in  
matching funds. USC officials said Thursday the money would be used 
to help build research labs, hire faculty and fund research. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gift will enable us to enhance USC's entire health  
sciences program and the quality of health care throughout our 
community,'' said USC President Steven Sample. 
</P>
<P>
	In recognition of the gift, the university will rename its

<HEADLINE> Laura Bush Campaigns for Husband </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Laura Bush opened her first solo campaign  
swing on her husband's behalf with a not-so-subtle dig at President 
Clinton, saying George W. Bush would not embarrass America if he 
made it to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Americans want somebody who they do trust, someone who  
they feel like won't embarrass them but instead will make them 
proud,'' Mrs. Bush said on the first of two days of campaigning in 
the state. Iowa will have a crucial Republican straw poll next 
month and the first caucus of the election season early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bush didn't mention the president by name but said  
character would be the central issue of her visit. The former 
teacher flew in from a family vacation in Maine to talk about her 
husband, to urge activists to participate in the Aug. 14 straw poll 
and to read to second-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush has represented Texas with dignity and honor,''  
she said. ``I'd love to see him do the same thing for our nation in 
its highest office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added that she felt ``blessed'' to be married to ``a man of  
strong conviction and strong faith who keeps his word and loves his 
family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Mrs. Bush said that  
while she enjoys campaigning, she would push for ``the opportunity 
to have private family life,'' especially when it comes to the 
Bushes' 17-year-old twin daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidate and his wife have both said their daughters are  
off-limits to reporters, in much the same way that the Clintons 
have shielded daughter Chelsea from the media for much of their 
time in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bush received a generally warm reception during her first  
stops. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to be the first lady,'' predicted Jerry Litzel,  
who showed up to hear her speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like what I heard,'' added Teresa Garman of Ames, who  
hastened to add she hadn't decided which candidate to support. ``I 
like what I've heard from some of the others, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bush was cautious throughout the day. In addressing party  
activists about the importance of the upcoming straw poll in Ames, 
she read directly from a prepared text and she declined to take 
questions. Later, in a handful of interviews with reporters, she 
appeared reluctant to go beyond her prepared message about her 
husband and continued to focus on what she called ``our 
partnership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Marrying him was apparently the smartest political move that I  
ever made,'' she said. ``Not bad for somebody who didn't know 
anything about politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bushes have been married for 21 years.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bush said she would return to Iowa for the straw poll,  
which will offer the first test of strength for candidates seeking 
the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad the first trip is to Ames, Iowa, because I hear  
there's a fairly important event on the horizon here,'' she joked 
in her address to about 75 supporters. ``Something about a straw 
poll.''

<HEADLINE> Diaz Wins 1,500 Meters in Barcelona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Andres Diaz of Spain warmed up for next  
month's world championships in Seville, Spain, by winning the 1,500 
meters Thursday at the Barcelona international track meet. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Diaz ran a personal-best 3 minutes, 31.97  
seconds to finish a good 15 meters ahead of Spanish rival Reyes 
Estevez at Montjuic Stadium, site of the 1992 Summer Olympics. 
Diaz's personal best had been 3:32.17, which he ran last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Estevez was clocked in 3:34.37, while Isaac Viciosa completed  
the Spanish sweep, taking third place in 3:34.89. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenyans dominated the 800 meters, the other big race of the  
night. William Yampoy won in 1:44.39, followed by David Kiptoo in 
1:44.99 and Luka Kipkoech in 1:45.65. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 200 meters, Troy Douglas of Bermuda was timed in 20.56 as  
he beat out Serguey Ossovitch of Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Davis of the United States ran a 48.97 to defeat Angelo  
Taylor in the 400-meter hurdles, with Tibor Bedi of Hungary 
finishing third. 
</P>
<P>
	In women's events, Carla Sacramento of Portugal ran the fastest  
time of the year in the 1,500 meters, clocking 4:01.93, and Sandra 
Stals of Belgium won the 800 in 2:00.88.

<HEADLINE> Big Tax Cut Facing Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate Republican plan to give Americans  
$792 billion in tax cuts overcame one challenge today from a rival 
GOP proposal, but it faced another from a bipartisan package that 
would reduce the cut by about $300 billion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, with the backing of Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, introduced an alternative that would have moved 
the bill closer to the earlier House-passed version by reducing 
income tax rates by an eventual 10 percent and repealing estate 
taxes. It was defeated 54-46 on a procedural vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Finance Committee, under pressure from Democrats, had  
rejected that approach because it confers a larger percentage of 
the benefits from the tax cut on the well-off. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also rejected by 55-45 an amendment offered by Sen.  
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., to return the bill to the Finance 
Committee so it could add money to provide prescription drug 
benefits to those on Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is also taking up a proposal, backed by Republican  
and Democratic moderates, that would cap the tax cut at $500 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said again today that he will veto the ``large  
and risky tax cut,'' which he asserted could carry America back 
``to the dark old days of huge deficits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So I say to Congress, if you send me a tax cut that  
shortchanges America's priorities and our children's future I will 
veto it,'' Clinton said before leaving the White House for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders are shunting aside a much smaller Democratic  
alternative and ignoring Clinton's earlier veto pledges. 
</P>
<P>
	Determined to show they could both cut taxes and save Social  
Security, Republicans pushed a ``lockbox'' amendment that would bar 
future Congresses from using Social Security surpluses for 
non-Social Security purposes. The GOP failed, on a 54-46 vote 
today, to get the 60 votes needed to advance such a measure. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic alternative, which would have protected both Social  
Security and a portion of any Medicare surpluses, got 42 votes, 
with 58 opposing. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of the 10-year tax cut were confident, despite  
misgivings among several Republicans about its size, of winning 
passage by the end of the week and moving quickly to work out 
differences with a similar House-passed bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans ``are rightful heirs to the wealth they're creating,''  
Sen. William Roth, R-Del., the Finance Committee chairman and the 
bill's chief author, said in opening the debate Wednesday. ``After 
paying for the government programs for which Congress has planned 
and budgeted, the change must now be returned to the taxpayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was what to do with a projected budget surplus  
estimated to total $1 trillion over the next decade, or nearly $3 
trillion if the revenues from Social Security are included. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans insisted that their tax relief wouldn't affect  
efforts to restore fiscal integrity to Social Security and Medicare 
and would leave funds to bring down the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and most Democrats said a tax cut should come  
only after the Social Security and Medicare issues are dealt with, 
and that it should be kept modest -- under $300 billion -- so funds 
would be available to strengthen education and defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me be clear again,'' Clinton said in his brief Rose Garden  
address. ``I do strongly support tax cuts, but not if they are so 
large they undermine our strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This debate is not about tax cuts, it's about how big they  
should be, and what else this country wants to do,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP plan, envisioning the biggest tax cut since Ronald  
Reagan's in 1981, would reduce the 15 percent income tax rate to 14 
percent, effective in 2001. Beginning in 2005, the new 14 percent 
tax rate would apply to some income that is currently taxed at 28 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It also offers relief from the so-called marriage penalty,  
allows larger contributions to IRA retirement plans, cuts estate 
taxes and provides tax breaks for employer-provided health care, 
interest on student loans and long-term care insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate defeated, on a 60-39 vote, a $290 billion Democratic  
alternative centered on raising the standard deductions for married 
couples, removing more low-income families from the tax rolls, and 
providing tax credits for the care of children and the elderly and 
for education. Six Democrats voted against their party's 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said there should  
be no tax cut until the surpluses predicted by economic forecasts, 
which have been unreliable in the past, become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
	An amendment offered by Sens. Bob Graham, D-Fla., and Charles  
Robb, D-Va., that would have put off the tax cut until the solvency 
of Social Security and Medicare is ensured went down, 54-46. 
</P>
<P>
	Mistrust of economic projections was also expressed by a  
bipartisan group of senators, led by Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who 
proposed a $500 billion compromise bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Their plan, said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, errs on the side  
of economic caution. People from Maine know, she said, that ``just 
because the calendar says it's spring doesn't mean that you should 
put away the shovel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who testified before  
the Senate Banking Committee Wednesday, was quoted by both sides in 
defending their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats referred to his statement that the nation ``probably  
would be better off holding off on a tax cut'' because the surplus, 
left alone, was healthy for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans countered that Greenspan also made the point that he  
was strongly against using the surplus for new government spending. 
``If that appears to be coming, I would favor tax cuts even in the 
short term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1429.

<HEADLINE> NASA Probe Heads To Asteroid Flyby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A NASA spacecraft flew within 15 miles of an  
asteroid between the orbits of Mars and Earth late Wednesday, 
according to preliminary results from a mission designed to test 
new technology for future probes. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Space 1's flyby of Asteroid Braille was the closest a  
spacecraft has come to a solar system object without landing, said 
Marc Rayman, the mission's deputy manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our preliminary indication is that the encounter went  
extremely well,'' he said. ``With reasonable confidence we can say 
the distance was less than 15 miles, perhaps much less than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pictures of the asteroid and science data were not expected to  
be available until Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Space 1, a barrel-shaped, 8-foot probe launched from Cape  
Canaveral, Fla., last October, flew by the asteroid at a relative 
speed of 35,000 mph some 117 million miles from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The success was especially gratifying to mission controllers  
because a software problem caused onboard computers to unexpectedly 
shut down earlier Wednesday. The problem was fixed within two 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The flyby comes near the end of Deep Space 1's primary mission  
that tested a dozen new technologies that can now be used aboard 
future spacecraft. It is the first probe of NASA's New Millennium 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
	``No science mission could rely on using them until they've been  
shown to work in space,'' Rayman said. ``Deep Space 1 took the risk 
so other missions wouldn't have to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flyby was considered risky. Deep Space 1, which uses  
technology that enables it to decide its own course, could have 
crashed into the asteroid or missed it altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers hope its instruments will return information on the  
asteroid's mass, density and makeup and whether it's a single rock 
or pile of rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the futuristic technologies tested was an ion propulsion  
engine that moved the spacecraft by sending out a stream of 
high-speed particles called ions. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Space 1 also was given a mind of its own so that it could  
find its way through space without much help from ground 
controllers. The craft will remain functional when the prime 
mission ends Sept. 18 and, if an extended mission is funded, could 
fly by two comets in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Vote Bans Aid for Abortion Advocacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Risking another clash with the Clinton  
administration over abortion and U.S. spending abroad, the House 
opened debate late Thursday on a $12.6 billion foreign aid bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation pushed by Republican appropriators had the  
tentative support of Democrats, despite their loud complaints about 
$1.9 billion in slashes from President Clinton's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	But major battles were expected to take place after House  
passage when the bill goes to a House-Senate conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
	One would be over funding levels and another over an amendment,  
approved 228-200 Thursday, to prohibit U.S. aid to organizations 
that use privately raised funds to lobby in favor of liberalized 
abortion laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate last month passed a $12.7 billion bill that does not  
include the anti-abortion provision. Democrats hope in final budget 
negotiations to find more money for foreign aid. Both bills would 
cut foreign spending by more than $600 million from last year's 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to live within budget constraints,'' said Rep. Sonny  
Callahan, R-Ala., chairman of the foreign operations appropriations 
subcommittee that crafted the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A Clinton administration statement said senior advisers would  
recommend a veto if foreign operations funding is not increased 
above both bills' appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Funding at this level would seriously impair the president's  
ability to conduct an effective foreign policy,'' the statement 
said. It said the bill would cut funding to international lending 
institutions by $493 million from amounts needed to meet U.S. 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	A veto also is promised if the provision prohibiting abortion  
advocacy ends up in the final bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In dual votes that sent a mixed message, the House first passed  
the now-familiar anti-abortion amendment sponsored by Rep. Chris 
Smith, R-N.J. Then, it also approved, 221-208, another measure 
echoing claims that family planning reduces abortions and allowing 
funds to any group that can show it works to reduce the number of 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith described it as a deceitful attempt to lure away foes of  
abortion from his hard-line position. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., predicted that Smith's more restrictive  
language would be taken out in negotiations to avoid a presidential 
veto. But Smith said he has guarantees from Republican leaders that 
no United Nations arrearage payments will be appropriated if the 
anti-abortion language is removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, the House passed, 412-8, an $8.4 billion  
measure financing next year's military construction projects. The 
bill would provide $76 million less than last year but $3 billion 
more that Clinton requested. Senate passage, which could occur next 
week, would make it the first of the 13 annual spending bills for 
the 2000 to be sent to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Major provisions of the foreign operations bill include:  
</P>
<P>
	--$2.88 billion for Israel, representing a $120 million reduction  
in economic and a $60 million increase in military aid. 
</P>
<P>
	--$2 billion for Egypt, a $40 million reduction in economic aid  
but no change in military aid. 
</P>
<P>
	--$725 million for former Soviet states, $307 million below  
Clinton's request. It would withhold 50 percent of aid to Russia 
unless it ends missile cooperation with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	--$680 million for child survival programs.  
</P>
<P>
	--$410 million for family planning activities, including $25  
million for the United Nations Population Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	--$240 million for the Peace Corps, equal to this year's level  
but $30 million below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	--$285 million for international narcotics control.  
</P>
<P>
	--$181.6 million to combat terrorism and the spread of nuclear  
weapons and for removal of landmines.

<HEADLINE>  Sabres' Hasek May Retire After 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Is next season the last for Dominik Hasek?  
</P>
<P>
	The Buffalo Sabres goalie, known as the Dominator, plans to  
retire after the 1999-00 season, according to reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek won the NHL's most valuable player award in 1997 and 1998,  
helped the Sabres reach the Stanley Cup finals this year and led 
the Czech Republic to an Olympic gold medal in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old goalie scheduled a news conference for today in  
Prague, and was expected to say he'd retire after next season 
rather than play out the remaining two years of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	WKBW-TV and WGR radio both said Hasek decided to play one more  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL said in a statement that Hasek and the Sabres planned a  
news conference in the Czech Republic capital ``to discuss the 
future of Hasek's hockey career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, a five-time choice as the NHL's best goalie, struggled  
much of last season with a groin injury. Despite that, he helped 
the Sabres reach the Stanley Cup finals, losing to Dallas in six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Press said that Rich Winter of Edmonton, Hasek's  
agent, was en route to Prague and unavailable for comment. Sabres 
general manager Darcy Regier wasn't scheduled to be present in 
Prague, CP said.

<P>
	Hasek, known for flopping to the ice to block shots and even  
releasing his stick so as to have two hands to grab the puck, was 
paid $7 million last season. Only Patrick Roy of the Colorado 
Avalanche, who made $7.5 million, had a higher salary among 
goalies. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of his NHL accolades, however, Hasek's career highlight  
came not in the playoffs but in the 1998 Winter Olympics, when he 
helped his native Czech Republic win the gold medal at Nagano, 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo acquired Hasek in 1992 in a trade from Chicago, where he  
was a backup to Ed Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour was in goal for Dallas when the Stars beat the Sabres on  
a controversial triple-overtime goal by Brett Hull in Game 6. 
Hull's skate was in the crease, but the goal was allowed.

<HEADLINE> Minority Interest in Hornets Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Spurned by Michael Jordan, George Shinn  
has turned to a Georgia businessman to buy a share of the Charlotte 
Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials called a news conference for this afternoon to  
announce that Shinn, who brought the Hornets into the NBA in 1988 
for an expansion fee of $32.5 million, is selling a minority share 
of the team to Ray Wooldridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials refused to confirm a report in today's Charlotte  
Observer that Wooldridge is buying up to a 49 percent share of the 
Hornets for an estimated $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Wooldridge recently sold Space Master International Inc., an  
Atlanta-based modular office construction business, for about $270 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn, the Hornets' sole owner, turned to Wooldridge after  
negotiating earlier this year with Jordan. The retired NBA 
superstar broke off talks in May after Shinn was unwilling to sell 
more than a minority share or give Jordan at least an equal say in 
key business decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale comes at a time of mounting legal problems for Shinn.  
He has been accused of sexual misconduct by several former 
cheerleaders for the Hornets, and one woman has filed a civil suit 
against him. Shinn's wife recently divorced him, and he has moved 
from the Charlotte area to a home in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn, who used to be a fixture in the stands at the Hornets'  
games, rarely showed up at the Charlotte Coliseum, where the team's 
attendance dipped to an all-time low last season.

<HEADLINE> Faulk May Get $45 Million From Rams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams have reportedly offered  
holdout running back Marshall Faulk a seven-year contract worth $45 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Thursday cited two sources  
familiar with negotiations in its report. Faulk was acquired from 
the Indianapolis Colts in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams are said to have offered $19 million over the first  
four years, with a $7 million signing bonus. Faulk could earn $26 
million over the final three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, as Faulk's agent sees it, is making sure the  
running back collects on those last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way we're trying to structure the deal, the final three  
years will void, and the Rams will have an option to buy the final 
three years back,'' agent Rocky Arceneaux said. 
</P>
<P>
	After four years, the Rams have the the option to ``buy back''  
the final three years by paying Faulk about $5 million. Faulk then 
would become a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Arceneaux does not want to agree to a seven-year deal unless  
the Rams guarantee that they won't slap a franchise or transition 
player tag on Faulk after four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk was the NFL's leading all-around back last season, rushing  
for 1,319 yards and catching 86 passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Arceneaux denied once again that Faulk is stalling merely to  
miss some of Dick Vermeil's training camp, which is known to be on 
the grueling side.

<HEADLINE> ABC Adding Minorities to TV Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- TV producer Kevin Williamson said he  
felt enlightened, not pressured, by protests over the lack of 
minority characters in new fall series. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson, whose new ABC series ``Wasteland'' featured an  
all-white cast in its pilot, decided to move up the introduction of 
a black character, a New York prosecutor played by Jeffrey D. Sams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like my eyes have been opened a little bit wider,'' he  
said. ``It's not pressure, it's `Kevin, wake up.' I'm a minority, I 
get it,'' said Williamson, who is gay. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the NAACP condemned the absence of minority  
characters on broadcast television and said it was considering a 
boycott or other action. On Tuesday, a coalition of Hispanic also 
demanded more minority representation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Zwick, co-creator of the new ABC drama ``Once and Again,''  
said it wasn't demands from the network or outside groups that led 
to the addition of black actress Rachel True. 
</P>
<P>
	``The part was written about three months ago. The NAACP  
announced its boycott about three weeks ago,'' Zwick said 
Wednesday. ``This is something we had planned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zwick was exasperated that the ``Once and Again'' cast change  
was announced by ABC as part of several planned for its series, 
saying it gave the wrong impression. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not how we work,'' Zwick said. ``We don't cast according  
to any kind of perceived pressure or agenda. We cast according to 
what is appropriate to the part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While attempting to seem responsive to the NAACP and other  
groups, the networks are also trying to avoid the impression that 
they've been ignoring the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Moonves, CBS Television president and chief executive  
officer, and ABC Television Network President Patricia Fili-Krushel 
said their networks are actively seeking a meeting with the NAACP. 
But they said strides already are being made. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, ABC executives said at least five of their shows  
would add minorities -- a change in the works since May, said Jamie 
Tarses, ABC Entertainment president.

<HEADLINE> Backup 49ers QB Faces Legal Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTIANBURG, Va. (AP) -- San Francisco 49ers backup quarterback  
Jim Druckenmiller, acquitted of a rape charge last week, faces new 
legal difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men who accused Druckenmiller of participating in an assault  
outside a Blacksburg bar in 1996 claim the former Virginia Tech 
star and three others ignored a lawsuit in which they are seeking 
damages for their injuries. A hearing is set Aug. 5 on the 
plaintiffs' motion filed in Montgomery County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges were dismissed against Druckenmiller and three other  
Tech students, but Jessie Phillips and Sean David Elko filed a 
$500,000 lawsuit against the four. The plaintiffs contend that the 
four were served with the lawsuit in March and failed to file a 
response within 21 days, as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
	A Montgomery County Circuit Court jury last week acquitted  
Druckenmiller of a charge that he raped a Tech student during a 
visit to his alma mater in March. Druckenmiller said he had 
consensual sex with the woman.

<HEADLINE> Glaxo Missing Earnings Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Glaxo Wellcome PLC, the world's second largest  
drugmaker, said Thursday that weak sales of its migraine and 
anti-smoking drug will result in the company falling short of its 
1999 target of double-digit earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits rose 1.33 billion pounds ($2.13 billion) from 1.24  
billion pounds for the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaxo said its growth in annual earnings will probably  
correspond broadly with sales, which rose 4 percent on the basis of 
constant exchange rates. Half-year sales were 4.11 billion pounds 
($6.58 billion), up from 3.87 billion pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it expects sales to strengthen during the  
second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaxo said its performance was more sluggish than expected due  
to weak sales of its migraine medicine Imitrex and anti-smoking 
treatment Zyban. Weak sales in Asia and South America also hurt the 
company's profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Glaxo's three main product lines boosted sales at  
double-digit rates -- 13 percent for anti-viral drugs and 12 percent 
for respiratory drugs. But medicines affecting the central nervous 
system managed a gain of only 5 percent, due largely to a 4 percent 
drop in sales of migraine products.

<HEADLINE>  Sabres' Hasek May Retire After 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Is next season the last for Dominik Hasek?  
</P>
<P>
	The Buffalo Sabres goalie, known as the Dominator, plans to  
retire after the 1999-00 season, according to reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek won the NHL's most valuable player award in 1997 and 1998,  
helped the Sabres reach the Stanley Cup finals this year and led 
the Czech Republic to an Olympic gold medal in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old goalie scheduled a news conference for today in  
Prague, and was expected to say he'd retire after next season 
rather than play out the remaining two years of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	WKBW-TV and WGR radio both said Hasek decided to play one more  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL said in a statement that Hasek and the Sabres planned a  
news conference in the Czech Republic capital ``to discuss the 
future of Hasek's hockey career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, a five-time choice as the NHL's best goalie, struggled  
much of last season with a groin injury. Despite that, he helped 
the Sabres reach the Stanley Cup finals, losing to Dallas in six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Press said that Rich Winter of Edmonton, Hasek's  
agent, was en route to Prague and unavailable for comment. Sabres 
general manager Darcy Regier wasn't scheduled to be present in 
Prague, CP said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, known for flopping to the ice to block shots and even  
releasing his stick so as to have two hands to grab the puck, was 
paid $7 million last season. Only Patrick Roy of the Colorado 
Avalanche, who made $7.5 million, had a higher salary among 
goalies. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of his NHL accolades, however, Hasek's career highlight  
came not in the playoffs but in the 1998 Winter Olympics, when he 
helped his native Czech Republic win the gold medal at Nagano, 
Japan.

was a backup to Ed Belfour.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Earns $1.59 Billion in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. earned $1.59 billion from April to  
June, edging most Wall Street forecasts for the first full quarter 
that reflects the telephone company's ambitious foray into cable TV 
with the acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-quarter profit, which amounted to 49 cents per share,  
compares with an operating profit $1.47 billion, or 54 cents per 
share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter revenues from continuing operations totaled  
$15.82 billion. That's an increase of 6.7 percent from the combined 
$14.83 billion generated in last year's second quarter by AT&AMP;T and 
the not-yet-acquired operations of TCI and IBM's Internet services 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected a profit of 48 cents per share in the  
latest quarter, according to a survey by the research firm First 
Call Corp. In morning trading following today's report, AT&AMP;T's 
stock was down $1.18 3/4 at $53.75 per share in a broad decline on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The year-ago profit figures exclude gains from the sale of some  
operations and costs related to AT&AMP;T's work force reductions. 
Combined with other one-time factors, AT&AMP;T had a net profit of 
$1.13 billion or 48 cents per share, in the second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's revenue gains in the latest quarter were highlighted by a  
6.7 percent increase to 6.28 billion in sales from business 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Wireless services revenues grew 42.4 percent compared with a  
year earlier, with AT&AMP;T's subscriber tally growing by 473,000 to 
more than 11 million during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But overall, consumer services including AT&AMP;T's core  
long-distance calling business suffered a 3.4 percent decline in 
quarterly revenues to $5.50 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts and company executives explained that the  
losses in long-distance revenue is at least partly the result of 
the strength in wireless calling. The company had previously 
cautioned that consumer services revenues would decline in 1999 by 
2 percent to 4 percent, and executives stood by that forecast 
during a conference call with analysts after today's report. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's new Broadband and Internet Services unit, which includes  
the cable operations acquired with TCI, had second quarter revenues 
of $1.42 billion, an increase of 7.6 percent from what those 
operations generated a year ago before the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The TCI deal and the pending acquisition of MediaOne Group, the  
nation's fourth largest cable TV company, are the linchpins of 
AT&AMP;T's plan to bypass the local Bell monopolies for delivering 
local and long-distance telephone calls -- packaged with TV and 
high-speed Internet access over the same cable wire. 
</P>
<P>
	Between acquisitions and spending to upgrade cable equipment for  
two-way communications, AT&AMP;T is expected to spend more than $150 
billion on the initiative, which began earlier this year with a 
trial in Fremont, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``AT&AMP;T's strong second-quarter earnings reflect steady progress  
in executing our strategy,'' said AT&AMP;T chairman and chief executive 
C. Michael Armstrong. ``We met investor expectations by delivering 
revenue and earnings growth for the sixth quarter in a row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some technological stumbles in Fremont, Armstrong said  
the early indications were better than expected. In particular, 
Armstrong stressed that 18 percent to 20 percent of the homes 
offered telephone and Internet access via cable are trying the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	More surprisingly, said Broadband and Internet Services chief  
Leo Hindery, roughly half of those customers have opted for 
multiple phone line packages. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T hasn't released an official tally of homes taking part in  
the Fremont program, but the customer count is believed to number a 
few thousand. A second pilot program is just beginning in Chicago, 
with eight more planned by year-end.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Loses Again in Pan Am Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- World champion Cuba's expected dash to  
the baseball gold medal at the Pan American Games keeps bogging 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	One day after losing to the United States, the Cubans looked  
listless in an 8-1 loss to Canada on Thursday. Suddenly, the pride 
of the island nation has as many losses (2) as victories in these 
games, which the Cubans were supposed to dominate. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Canada beat Cuba in baseball was at the  
Intercontinental Cup in Edmonton in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``They looked like they didn't want to be here,'' said catcher  
Andy Stewart, who had three hits. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't count the talented, experienced Cubans out yet. They  
still made it to the quarterfinals and they can still win the gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cubans are a good team,'' cautioned Canadian manager Ernie  
Whitt. ``Don't let this victory fool you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans finished 3-1 in the preliminary round by edging  
winless Brazil 3-2. Canada (4-0), which also beat the United 
States, won its pool and plays Guatemala in Saturday's 
quarterfinals. The Americans will face Panama. 
</P>
<P>
	The two teams that make the gold medal game qualify for the  
Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Already owning the second seed in Pool A, the Americans came out  
flat offensively against Brazil, winning behind the pitching of 
Ryan Anderson and Bobby Seay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans scored the go-ahead run in the fifth on a  
bases-loaded fielder's choice by Mike Neill. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 Anderson, known as the ``Little Unit,'' struck out  
nine in six innings. Seay came on in the eighth with runners at 
second and third and struck out pinch-hitter T.N. Kussano, then 
fanned two of three in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Hardtke homered for the U.S. team, which managed just five  
hits after getting 19 against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``We basically threw our hats out there today,'' Seay said. ``We  
were flat and we knew it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canada-Cuba game was played against a backdrop of Cuban  
charges that its athletes were being encouraged by the Winnipeg 
media and others to defect, and tempers flared after a collision at 
home plate in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Aaron Guiel flattened Cuban catcher Ariel Pestano for  
the second time in the game and was ejected. Guiel made no attempt 
to slide and appeared to deliver a forearm shiver to Pestano. 
</P>
<P>
	Players from both teams converged at home plate, but Guiel and  
Pestano were separated and no punches were thrown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was angry,'' Guiel said. ``I decided I was going to try and  
take a guy out on the infield or the catcher. I had to show them we 
would stand up for ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the game was being played, Pan Ams officials announced they  
were cracking down on attempts to persuade Cuban athletes to 
defect. Security will be beefed up and some Cuban athletes will be 
moved to make them less accessible to agents who try to make their 
pitches from outside the fenced athletes villages, games president 
Don MacKenzie said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have all hours of the evening continually drove up and  
down the adjacent road, they have shone flashlights until 2 or 3 
o'clock in the evening into their windows to get their attention,'' 
MacKenzie said. ``The society is clamping down on security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, Cuba backed off on some of its harsh criticism of  
the environment at the games, during which four Cubans have sought 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want to poke the fire, but we want to express our  
viewpoints clearly and frankly,'' said Jose Fernandez, a 
high-ranking Cuban Olympic official and vice president of the 
country's council of ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States remained atop the medals table with 47 golds,  
43 silvers and 31 bronzes for 121 overall. Canada has 77, with 23 
golds, and Cuba has 69, with 27 golds. 
</P>
<P>
	The world champion U.S. women's softball team was unchallenged  
by Colombia as Danielle Henderson threw a perfect game, striking 
out 16 in seven innings. Lisa Fernandez went 3-for-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans got gold and bronze in 3-meter springboard diving as  
Mark Ruiz came from third place on his last dive. Trailing by 13 
points, Ruiz executed a reverse 3 1/2-somersault with a half-twist 
from the tuck position to edge defending champion Fernando Platas 
of Mexico. American Troy Du ``I knew I had a big dive in me,'' Ruiz 
said. ``I knew I could hit it. When I came off the board, I knew 
this was it. That put pressure on Fernando and he didn't hit it as 
well as he usually does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women were shut out as Canada's Emilie Heymans and  
Blythe Hartley wound up 1-2 off the platform. 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon sensation Alexandra Stevenson won her Pan Ams debut  
6-2, 6-0 over Miriam D'Agostini of Brazil. Teammate Lilia Osterloh 
advanced to the second round with a straight set victory over 
Cuba's Yoanny Montesnio. 
</P>
<P>
	The four players and two coaches ejected from Wednesday's  
Guatemala-Canada soccer match all received suspensions Thursday. 
Guatemalan coach Walter Clavieri and three players were suspended 
for the remainder of the games. Another Guatemalan player and 
Canadian coach Bruce Twamley each got one-game suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	The soccer disciplinary committee said the three players  
suspended for the rest of the competition punched or kicked referee 
Richard Grady. Police had to rush in to protect Grady when other 
Guatemalan players threatened him. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's 50-kilometer race walk took 5 1/2 hours to determine the  
medalists -- four hours for the race and another 90 minutes to sort 
things out. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's Joel Sanchez and Carlos Mercenario finished 1-2, though  
Mercenario at first was disqualified because officials claimed he 
was given assistance along the course. The Mexicans appealed and 
the disqualification was overturned.

<HEADLINE> No Dream Teamers on Pan Am Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Basketball in the Pan American Games  
has no Dream Teamers, only dreamers. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA stars who carried the U.S. men to victory in the Olympic  
qualifying tournament have gone their separate ways. Twelve players 
from the Continental Basketball Association are representing the 
United States in Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor are the top U.S. women's players in town. They're all with  
their WNBA teams. The American team is comprised of two college 
players and 10 who didn't make WNBA rosters or were left without a 
job when the American Basketball League folded last December. 
</P>
<P>
	But what they lack in name recognition they make up for in  
ambition. They're happy to get some competition, glad to be 
representing their country, and if they play well enough along the 
way to get some attention, so much the better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think more than likely, with the WNBA expanding to four more  
teams, the players from this team will be the players distributed 
on those teams,'' said Sylvia Crawley, the most experienced 
international player on the U.S. team, which has been together two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst case scenario is with coaches from all over the  
country and the European professional leagues that are here 
watching, you could potentially pick up a contract that pays three 
times what the WNBA pays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And talk about happy to be here, check out Kermit Holmes, who  
has spent his entire seven-year pro career in the CBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the high points in my career,'' said Holmes who  
plays for the Quad City Thunder. ``I've been playing professional 
basketball for a long time and playing in the NBA has always been a 
high goal in my life and in my career. This is right up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crawley, a finalist for the 1996 Olympic team, also is happy to  
be in Winnipeg. She was chosen for the 1995 Pan Am Games, but the 
women's basketball competition was canceled because there weren't 
enough teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went through two-a-days, ran a mile in six minutes and then  
the games were canceled,'' Crawley said. ``I actually get to 
compete for a medal this time. That means a lot to me to be captain 
of this team and lead it to the gold medal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Marciniak, who played on a national championship team  
at Tennessee, brings additional experience to the team, which also 
has former ABL players Dana Wynne, Katryna Gaither and Danielle 
McCulley. The college players, both impressive in training camp and 
scrimmages, are Edwina Brown of Texas and Lynn Pride of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's raising my game many notches,'' Brown said. ``I  
knew I had it inside of me, but the world didn't know. It's 
different in college, because you're restricted. You can only do so 
much. Here you're more free and able to show different things you 
can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few of the men have international experience. One who does is  
Carl Thomas of the Fort Wayne Fury, a veteran of the 1995 Pan Ams 
team, which also had CBA players and won the silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so excited right now that I want to get the gold,'' Thomas  
said. ``I have a silver medal at home and I let my kids play with 
that. But when I get the gold medal, I can put that up and they're 
not going to play with that one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most recognizable player on the men's team probably is Damon  
Bailey, the Indiana high school phenom who later played at Indiana 
University and is now at Fort Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
	Another former Indiana player, 7-foot Todd Lindeman, is on the  
team. So are former college stars Byron Houston (Oklahoma State), 
Doug Smith (Missouri) and Matt Steigenga (Michigan State), all of 
whom have NBA experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The women open Friday against Argentina and the men on Saturday  
against Cuba. The United States last won the gold medal in men's 
basketball at the Pan Am Games in 1983, when the team had Sam 
Perkins, Wayman Tisdale and a guy named Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Sign Rutledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals signed  
second-round draft pick Johnny Rutledge to a four-year contract for 
just over $2 million Thursday night, but the team's top pick, David 
Boston, was frustrated in his attempts to reach a deal in time to 
join the team when training camp workouts begin Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals' other first-round pick, L.J. Shelton, also  
remained unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's sister, Alicia, a Dallas lawyer who is acting as one of  
his agents, seemed exasperated with the Arizona organization, 
saying that her brother has repeatedly compromised while the 
Cardinals haven't given an inch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're extremely disappointed that we have been unable to reach  
a compromise with the organization,'' Alicia Boston said Thursday 
night. ``We have been extremely creative. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have tried to study the other deals in the first round and  
come up with proposals that we believe were reasonable with what 
was going on in draft spots around David, and they have rejected 
each and every one in its entirety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said more talks were scheduled Friday morning ``but it does  
not look good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston, the No. 8 pick overall who broke 11 school records in  
three seasons as a wide receiver at Ohio State, reportedly was 
seeking a four-year contract while the Cardinals preferred five 
years, but his sister didn't want to get into the specifics of the 
disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals were staying mum on the situation. General manager  
Bob Ferguson had no comment. Shelton was believed to be nowhere 
near an agreement. His agent, Lamont Smith, did not return 
telephone messages left on his phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge, a Florida linebacker who was the 51st pick overall,  
signed a $2.0185 million contract that includes a $825,000 signing 
bonus. His first-year salary will be $217,000. If NFL contract 
minimums increase as projected, the deal will grow to $2.1775 
million over the four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was important to come here and push and try to  
get a deal done on time for Johnny's development,'' said Rutledge's 
agent, Leigh Steinberg, who flew to Phoenix to wrap up 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge drew national attention in recent months when he and  
two other former Florida players admitted taking money from agent 
William ``Tank'' Black while still in college. Rutledge was the 
first to go public with the admission. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL Players Association has proposed stripping Black of his  
license for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	All three of the Cardinals' top picks figure prominently in the  
team's plans this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge, 6-foot-2 and 246 pounds, is considered a candidate for  
significant playing time with the departure of Jamir Miller to free 
agency. Boston figures to be the team's third wide receiver and do 
punt or kick return duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Still left to be resolved is the status of Moore and defensive  
tackle Mark Smith, who both are holding out in contract squabbles. 
Moore, miffed at being declared the Cardinals' franchise player and 
thereby limiting his income and options, wants a long-term 
contract. He has, however, picked up a Cardinals' playbook, an 
indication that he may not be too far from an agreement. Smith 
reportedly is demanding $1.2 to $1.3 million for the coming season. 
The Cardinals have offered about one-third that amount.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth Slows in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. economic growth slowed abruptly to 2.3  
percent during the second quarter as consumers curtailed exuberant 
spending that had been the major force behind the recent economic 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that the gross domestic  
product, the nation's total output of goods and services, grew by 
$44 billion from April through June to an inflation-adjusted $7.8 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-quarter slowdown came after the economy had surprised  
many analysts by growing at a bigger-than-expected 4.3 percent 
annual rate during the first three months of 1999. Many analysts 
had expected the moderation to be a bit more gradual. 
</P>
<P>
	New restraint by consumers, whose purchases account for  
two-thirds of the nation's economic activity and whose spending 
proclivity has helped the United States weather two years of global 
economic crisis, was largely responsible for putting on the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer spending grew by 4 percent from April through June,  
compared with a torrid 6.7 percent during the first three months of 
1999. It was the slowest spending increase since the fourth quarter 
of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	An inflation gauge tied to the GDP showed consumer prices rose  
more quickly during the spring, at an annual rate of 2.1 percent, 
compared to 1.2 percent in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned that economic growth was too rapid and might spark  
inflation, the Federal Reserve in June raised interest rates by a 
quarter of a point. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan in his midyear 
report to Congress this week said the nation's central bankers have 
not ruled out another rate increase this year if inflation flares.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Begin Camp Without McNabb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- Philadelphia Eagles coach Andy Reid stood  
deep in the secondary, barking orders and challenging his players 
to push themselves a little harder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do it again!'' Reid bellowed. ``Hustle all the way back! Do it  
the right way!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia, coming off a terrible 3-13 season, officially  
began its first training camp with Reid at the helm Thursday. 
Structure, hustle and haste were emphasized -- all terms that Reid 
would like to see applied to Donovan McNabb's contract 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day, every practice, every rep he is missing, you can't  
get those back,'' Reid said. ``There's no price that you can put on 
those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the Eagles finished their first full-squad workout late  
Thursday afternoon, there was still no news on the McNabb front. 
His agent, Fletcher Smith, and Eagles executive vice president Joe 
Banner spoke by telephone Wednesday and were planning to talk again 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is how McNabb will be paid in the final years of a  
seven-year deal that is believed to be worth at least $50 million. 
Smith wants voidable years and a buy-back clause, so McNabb can get 
another signing bonus after three or four seasons. The Eagles don't 
want McNabb's progress influenced by the structure of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Donovan knows he needs to be here, and we want him here,''  
Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the dark cloud known as McNabb continued to hang over  
Eagles camp at Lehigh University, Reid was obviously pleased with 
his first real day on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a certain crispness to the 90-minute workout, a sense  
of optimism and fortitude that had been absent from these Eagles 
since early in Ray Rhodes' tenure in the mid '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia was by far the worst offensive team in the NFL last  
season, and the defense didn't do much until pride kicked in during 
the closing weeks of the nightmare of '98. 
</P>
<P>
	There are many changes, from the coaching staff to those players  
likely to toil on the practice squad. Nothing quite compares to the 
glint of hope seen in the eyes of players on the first real day of 
training camp, no matter how bad they were last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're definitely headed in the right direction,'' cornerback  
Troy Vincent said. ``All the camps we've had prior to this were 
great camps. I got a lot out of them. If we can just continue that, 
there's no reason why we can't have success this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, who learned from Mike Holmgren in Green Bay, proved to be  
a vocal, commanding presence on the practice field for the first 
time as a head coach. He stomped around in the secondary, ordering 
players to run -- not walk -- back to the huddle. He didn't miss many 
chances to chide a player as he ran back to the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time you get off this field, you should be exhausted  
from running around,'' Reid said. ``It makes a two-hour practice or 
an hour-and-a-half practice go fast. And it's alive.''

	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Jay Heaps' goal in the seventh  
shootout round gave the Miami Fusion a 3-2 victory over the Tampa 
Bay Mutiny in Major League Soccer Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	After Tampa Bay's Eric Quill and Miami's Welton converted in the  
first five rounds of the regulation shootout rounds, the Mutiny's 
Josh Keller and the Fusion's Tyrone Marshall scored in the 
following elimination round. 
</P>
<P>
	When a shot by Tampa Bay's Chad McCarty sailed over the Fusion  
goal, Heaps capitalized on his shot, beating Tampa Bay goalkeeper 
Andy Kirk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion erased a 2-0 first-half deficit on Welton's third  
goal of the season at the 76th minute. Welton headed in a shot past 
Kirk after a crossing pass from Tim Sahaydak. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's first goal in the opening minute of the second half was  
an own goal, when Mutiny defender Steve Trittschuh deflected a pass 
from Marshall into his own goal.

	The Mutiny stunned the Fusion with a two-goal outburst within a  
13-minute period of the first half.

season in the 13th minute, when the Mutiny forward capitalized on a

<HEADLINE> Waste Management's Stock Swoons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Waste Management Inc. disclosed the resignations  
of two top executives as the company warned it would fall further 
far short of expected second-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest trash-hauling company already had surprised  
traders earlier this month with word that revenues fell $250 
million short of projections in June. It said Thursday its revised 
earnings estimate of 67 cents to 70 cents a share was still about 9 
cents too high. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, Earl E. DeFrates resigned as chief financial  
officer, although the company said he would remain in another 
capacity. General counsel Gregory T. Sangalis also stepped down. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management's share value has shrunk by half since its  
initial July 6 warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Ford, an analyst for PaineWebber, said some investors  
will remain cautious about the company until they're confident 
executives have a firm grasp on finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, they had to reset everyone's expectations lower  
today, but ultimately they're making long-term decisions for the 
shareholder,'' Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts polled by First Call Corp. had adjusted their  
second-quarter per-share estimate to 67 cents after the first 
earnings warning, down from an original estimate of 78 cents. 
Official results, expected to be between 58 cents and 60 cents, are 
due Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shortfall against expectations in the second quarter are  
largely related to not having (reasonable) expectations,'' Waste 
Management spokeswoman Cherie Rice said. ``The expectations were 
too aggressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's announcement blamed 6 cents a share of the latest  
downward adjustment on expected cost savings on accounting changes 
that were never made. The other 3 cents are attributed to interest 
charges and poor operating results. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh F. Holman, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens,  
said the unrealized accounting savings initially were thought to 
have a minimal effect on the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	``They thought these accounting changes would be less than a  
penny in terms of positive impact, and now they're telling us 6 
cents a share,'' said Holman, who said the dearth of accurate 
information could damage investor confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also have blamed the downturn partly on Waste  
Management's inability to swiftly reorganize after Houston-based 
USA Waste Services and Oak Brook, Ill.-based Waste Management 
closed a $13.5 billion merger a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company retained the Waste Management name, although USA  
Waste effectively bought its slumping former competitor. Later in 
1998, Waste Management purchased Mt. Laurel, N.J.-based Eastern 
Environmental Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management operates more than 1,300 waste facilities in  
the United States and 15 other countries.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 220.36; Nasdaq Down 66.66 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today as a government report  
signaled that wages are rising faster than expected in a tight 
labor market, heightening inflation jitters and setting the stage 
for a possible increase in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 220.36 at 10,751.71. At one point this afternoon, the Dow was 
down as much as 258.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also tumbling. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 28.13 at 1,337.27, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 66.66 at 2,639.18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today its Employment Cost Index,  
considered the best measure of changes in wages and benefit costs, 
rose 1.1 percent in the second quarter. The bigger-than-expected 
jump followed a record low 0.4 percent increase during the first 
three months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest unemployment rate in 29 years has raised fears that  
employers scrambling for workers will have to raise wages, and 
therefore prices. Economists expect the Federal Reserve to use the 
data as evidence that it should raise interest rates again in an 
effort to stave off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed imposed one small interest-rate increase in June, and in  
the past week, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has indicated his 
willingness to raise rates again if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every number that might convince the Fed to tighten rates is  
viewed as very dangerous to stocks and bonds,'' said Larry Wachtel, 
a market analyst at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices fell steeply, pushing yields on 30-year Treasury  
bonds up to 6.07 percent from 6.00 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately today, the Commerce Department's report on the gross  
domestic product showed the U.S. economy grew at a 
slower-than-expected pace in the second quarter. But investors 
chose to focus primarily on the employment cost index, which 
Greenspan had indicated he would monitor closely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any pleasure the Fed took from the GDP report was more than  
offset,'' by the wage report, said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist 
at Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of higher interest rates hit financial stocks  
hardest. American Express fell 5 1/2 to 135 3/4, and J.P. Morgan fell 3 5/8 
to 130 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management tumbled 5 5/16 to 26 1/8 after saying its  
second-quarter earnings will miss estimates. The company's 
financial chief resigned, and Waste Management said all previous 
guidance on future earnings should be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Dow components, 3M rose 1 5/8 to 90 3/4 after announcing that it  
earned $1.03 per share in the second quarter. Analysts surveyed by 
First Call Corp. had projected earnings of $1 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble was up 1 3/4 at 87 7/8 after its own strong earnings  
report. Without 3M and Procter &AMP; Gamble, the Dow's losses would 
have been much steeper.

	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-3 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 620.76 million 
shares at late afternoon, ahead of Wednesday's pace.

<HEADLINE> For-Profit Nasdaq, NYSE Raise Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As the Nasdaq Stock Market moved closer to  
for-profit status Thursday and the New York Stock Exchange also 
considers going public, concern is growing that it will be hard for 
both markets to separate their regulatory obligations from their 
desire to make money. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of the National Association of Securities Dealers  
approved a series of steps Thursday designed to spin off its Nasdaq 
electronic market into a for-profit organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The steps, which included authorizing NASD staff to begin the  
paperwork needed for Securities and Exchange Commission approval, 
could ultimately lead to an initial public offering of stock in the 
Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
	The board's actions were expected in the wake of last week's  
announcement by the NYSE that the Big Board is mulling a initial 
public offering, or IPO, as early as this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The dramatic shift in how the stock markets propose to conduct  
their business has some securities industry watchdogs questioning 
whether the Nasdaq and NYSE can fulfill their duties as so-called 
self-regulated organizations, while still responding to the demands 
of shareholders seeking profits on their investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Both markets will need to resolve that potential conflict of  
interest if they are to maintain investor confidence, said Philip 
Rutledge, deputy chief counsel for the Pennsylvania Securities 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge said he's concerned that both the Nasdaq and NYSE  
regulatory operations will fade into the background once market 
officials become accountable to shareholders. In other words, the 
need to turn a profit could ultimately supercede the responsibility 
to provide adequate market oversight. ``We have to worry about a 
vacuum on the regulatory side with all the focus on the survial 
side,'' Rutledge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pennsylvania official was echoing comments made earlier this  
week by SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt in a letter to top officials at 
both the Nasdaq and the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	In an apparent response to such concerns, NASD officials argued  
in a statement released after Thursday's meeting that the money 
raised through a shift to public ownership would provide additional 
funding for the NASD's regulatory arm and allow for increased 
market oversite. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq and NYSE officials have also argued that a shift to a  
for-profit structure through public ownership is needed in order to 
keep up with expensive technology and provide a currency -- publicly 
traded stock -- for possible acquisitions to remain competitive with 
the growing number of upstart, electronic stock trading systems. 
</P>
<P>
	NASD Chairman Frank Zarb said in a statement Thursday, ``We need  
to change our governance to make decisions more quickly in an 
increasing competitive environment that values speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many market analysts believe the trend toward publicly  
owned, for-profit stock markets is inevitable. Exchanges in Canada, 
Europe and Australia have already made the shift. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the shift for-profitstatus will help stock markets to  
move forward quickly with technological innovations that will lower 
trading costs and ultimately benefit investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The competition on a global level has become so tough that the  
exchanges need the extra capital to invest in technology and to be 
able to introduce new products quickly,'' said Reena Aggarwal, a 
business professor at Georgetown University who specializes in 
equity markets and IPOs. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leading U.S. stock markets are currently financed by  
their members. But that financing method pales in comparison to the 
money that could be raised through an initial public offering, 
Aggarwal said, especially since investor interest in IPOs has been 
remarkably strong in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Aggarwal noted that the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq  
Stock Market are two of the most widely recognized brand names in 
the financial services industry, and that investors could be 
expected to scramble for shares of the entities. 
</P>
<P>
	In the long run, investors will likely benefit from the shift to  
public ownership, Aggarwal added, because the new structure will 
allow the markets flexibility not currently afforded by their 
current bulky, bureauratic membership structures. ``The way they're 
structured now, the exchanges are extremely bureaucratic and it's 
hard to make quick decisions,'' she said.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Ford Motor Company's truck plant in Sao  
Paulo remained idle Thursday as workers completed a weeklong strike 
to pressure the company to give them job stability guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
	The factory's nearly 1,500 workers went on strike after a local  
newspaper reported that Ford would shutdown its Sao Paulo 
truck-making facilities and transfer them to the northeastern state 
of Bahia. 
</P>
<P>
	The stoppage has paralyzed daily production of 120 trucks in  
Ipiranga, a densely populated working class district in the city of 
Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has denied it was planning to move the plant to Bahia, but  
acknowledged it was studying the possibility of moving it to 
another factory on the outskirts of the Sao Paulo.

	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto  
Pinochet, who is fighting a Spanish extradition effort, suffers 
from stress and other serious medical problems that leave him 
incapable of enduring prolonged captivity or a long trial, local 
media reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a report by the Chilean foreign ministry, daily La  
Tercera said the 83-year-old Pinochet is suffering from emotional 
strain which is also hampering his recovery from back surgery and 
worsening his diabetes. Pinochet is under house arrest near London. 
</P>
<P>
	Chilean officials have repeatedly sought Pinochet's release  
through a series of judicial and political channels, claiming 
foreign judges have no authority over the ailing general. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was arrested last October on a Spanish warrant alleging  
he ordered his security services to commit gross human rights 
abuses during his 17-year regime. His extradition trial is expected 
to begin Sept. 27.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- In an unusual effort to curb police  
corruption, Mexico City's police chief announced Wednesday he's 
taking ticket books away from most of the city's 900 traffic cops 
and designating 22 all-female patrol cars to hand out fines to 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic patrols are a source of frustration for Mexico City  
residents, as officers sometimes stop drivers for minor infractions 
to extract small bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22 specialized patrols appear few for a city of more than 9  
million residents, but police chief Alejandro Gertz said more units 
would be added later. Each patrol car will have two policewomen -- 
widely seen in Mexican culture as less prone to corruption -- and 
will be under greater supervision by their superiors and citizens' 
groups, Gertz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Regular police who witness traffic violations may still pull  
over motorists.

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Diego Maradona would be welcome  
in the Falkland Islands if he is among the first group of Argentine 
travelers to the South Atlantic archipelago next month, an official 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Jarvis, a Falkland Islands government secretary, denied  
Argentine reports that Maradona would be barred from visiting the 
British territory because of his involvement with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no problem,'' Jarvis told local news agency Diario y  
Noticias. ``He can enter the Falklands like any other tourist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maradona has reportedly made several reservations on a flight  
from Chile to the Falklands next month. The flights, the only 
originating in South America, are set to resume after being 
suspended in April following Britain's refusal to free former 
Chilean dicatator Gen. Augusto Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
	If the 39-year-old Maradona decides to go, he would be among the  
first Argentines allowed to travel to the Falkland Islands under a 
new agreement signed this month by Argentina and England, who went 
to war over the windswept islands in 1982.

<HEADLINE> Study Impacts Muscular Dystrophy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A set of mice studies raise the possibility that an antibiotic  
might be an effective treatment for about 15 percent of victims of 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy whose disease results from a genetic 
error. 
</P>
<P>
	The studies suggest that the drug might restore the production  
of a critical missing protein. Doctors from Ohio State University 
plan to start a small study soon to see if the approach works in 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Clues about the possible treatment emerge from research  
conducted by Dr. H. Lee Sweeney and colleagues at the University of 
Pennsylvania. A report on their experiments is being published in 
the Aug. 15 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	They worked with mice that have a genetic error known as a  
misplaced stop codon, which cuts off protein production. Illness in 
these animals closely mimics the form of the disease in the 
minority of Duchenne's victims whose disease also results a 
premature stop codon. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the genetic error, the body stops production of a  
protein called dystrophin before it reaches its proper size. As a 
result, the dystrophin fails to work properly. The disease slowly 
destroys the muscles, and victims usually die in their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	Gentamicin appears to suppress stop codons. The researchers  
found that when the mice were given gentamicin injections, they 
started making dystrophin, reversing their disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether this will work in people is unknown. Sweeney noted that  
the antibiotic can cause hearing loss and kidney damage. He 
cautioned against using it routinely until human studies are 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said that if gentamicin helps those with  
muscular dystrophy, it might also be effective against other 
inherited diseases that can result from premature stop codons, such 
as cystic fibrosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs almost exclusively in boys  
and affects about one of every 3,500 newborn males. Most cases of 
the disease result from deletions within the dystrophin gene rather 
than a misplaced stop codon.

<HEADLINE> House Passes $4.65 Billion for D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved a $4.65 billion budget  
Thursday for the nation's capital after defeating attempts to 
legalize medical marijuana and allow the city to spend its money to 
sue for voting rights in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget for fiscal 2000 contains $453 million in federal  
spending, and is about a 3 percent larger than the current fiscal 
year's $4.52 billion budget. The vote was 333-92. 
</P>
<P>
	A version passed by the Senate on July 1 does not contain  
several controversial measures in the House bill. The differing 
versions must be reconciled in a conference between the two 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would prohibit the city government from enacting  
medical marijuana legislation and forbid the use of district funds 
to lobby Congress for full voting rights there. District funds also 
could not be used to support a needle-sharing program to combat 
AIDS among drug-users. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla., chairman of the District of  
Columbia subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, said 
the bill received ``strong bipartisan support.'' He criticized the 
Clinton Administration for threatening a possible veto over the 
needle-exchange issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Anthony Williams said he was disappointed with some  
amendments but called the rejection of one that would prohibit 
adoptions by unmarried couples a ``silver lining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the House passed an amendment by Rep. Bob Barr,  
R-Ga., that prohibits terminally ill patients from using marijuana 
to ease their pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., called the initiative ``a backdoor way  
to legalize marijuana'' and said it would be an ``abomination'' to 
legalize marijuana in the nation's capital. Supporters accused 
members of interfering with the district's democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
	A provision Barr added to last year's budget prohibits votes  
from a Nov. 3 referendum on a medical marijuana initiative from 
being counted. They can be counted at the end of the fiscal year, 
but the new amendment prohibits the use of medical marijuana no 
matter which way the count goes. 
</P>
<P>
	An amendment by D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton to permit  
the district to use its own funds to sue for the right to be 
represented in congressional voting failed in a 214-214 vote for a 
lack of majority.

<HEADLINE> Packers' Free Safety Starts Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Darren Sharper technically didn't have to  
be sweating in pads under the hot sun at the Green Bay Packers 
training camp this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Packers' starting free safety wanted the chance for a  
fresh and early start on the new season. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Sharper struggled last year with a left shoulder injury  
that needed offseason surgery, the third-year pro was allowed to 
report to training camp early. His fellow veterans don't have to 
report to workouts until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just saw this as a chance to get a jump on things,'' Sharper  
said. ``After the season this team and the secondary in particular 
had last year, I wanted to work harder to make things go 
smoothly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharper was shuttled between cornerback and safety last year,  
mainly because of injuries in the secondary. He received mixed 
reviews at both positions, and there was talk of making him 
exclusively a cornerback this year. 
</P>
<P>
	That changed when the team decided first-round draft pick Antuan  
Edwards, a safety at Clemson, would be a cornerback behind starters 
Tyrone Williams and Craig Newsome. Coaches Ray Rhodes and Emmitt 
Thomas decided they would rather use Sharper as a team leader and 
the signal-caller on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharper is still trying to fill the shoes of Eugene Robinson,  
the Packers' starting safety on their Super Bowl-winning team of 
three seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's growing into the role you expect a free safety to fill on  
your team,'' said defensive coordinator Thomas. ``He's learning a 
lot of new things every day, and that's why it's good he's here 
every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharper has been excited with what he's seen in the first few  
days of workouts. Edwards and fellow rookie cornerbacks Fred Vinson 
and Mike McKenzie all have impressed Sharper, though all three have 
been limited somewhat with lingering injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year we didn't have the depth that I can see this year,''  
Sharper said. ``It's really going to show up as the season goes 
on.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Pay Fine in Contempt Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Imposing an unprecedented penalty against a  
president, a federal judge today ordered President Clinton to pay a 
$90,686 sanction for false testimony about his relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money, which Clinton's legal defense fund can pay,  
will go to Paula Jones and the attorneys who reprsented her in her 
sexual harassment lawsuit. Clinton's testimony in that case led to 
his impeachment by the House and eventual acquittal in a Senate 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who issued a historic  
contempt ruling against Clinton last April, had said she would 
order him to pay for depositions and other costs that resulted from 
his January 1998 deposition for Mrs. Jones' lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sanctions are being imposed, not only to deter others who  
might consider emulating the president's misconduct, but to 
compensate the plaintiff by requiring that the president pay her 
any reasonable fees and expenses caused by his willful failure to 
obey this court's discovery orders,'' Wright wrote in her order 
filed in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the sanctions, she ordered Clinton to pay the court  
$1,202 for her trip to Washington at the president's request to 
preside over the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas law firm that represented the former Arkansas state  
worker submitted itemized bills for $437,825 and the Virginia-based 
Rutherford Institute, which assisted in the case, asked for 
$53,333. The money will be divided among the lawyers and Mrs. 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	In her order, Wright said the lawyers' claims were ``excessive  
and must be reduced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said Jones' legal teams seemed to justify their fees by  
arguing that sanctions should be imposed to punish Clinton's 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sanctions are not imposed to punish ... but must be based upon  
evidence of actual loss,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright also rejected the lawyers' contention that they should be  
reimbursed for all the legal work they did after Clinton's 
deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that because the parties have already settled the case  
for $850,000, ``it is appropriate to limit fees and expenses to 
those incurred'' as a result of his contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers had argued that he should pay them no more  
than $33,737. In settling the suit, the president never admitted 
any wrongdoing alleged by Mrs. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	In her ruling in April, Wright said there was ``clear and  
convincing evidence'' that during the deposition the president had 
given ``false, misleading and evasive answers that were designed to 
obstruct the judicial process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones alleged that Clinton, as Arkansas governor, made an  
unwanted sexual advance in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	At the deposition, Clinton was asked about his relationship with  
Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern. Clinton testified that 
``I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Months later, after the president's DNA was found on a dress  
belonging to Ms. Lewinsky, he acknowledged an ``inappropriate 
intimate relationship'' with her. He made the admission before a 
federal grand jury Aug. 17 and again in a nationally televised 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the relationship did not fall under the definition  
of ``sexual relations'' provided by Mrs. Jones' lawyers during his 
deposition, and that his testimony was legally accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge wrote in her contempt ruling, ``It is difficult to  
construe the president's sworn statements ... as anything other 
than a willful refusal to obey this court's discovery orders.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler's Earnings Flat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG's disappointed investors  
Thursday with flat operating earnings in the second quarter as 
currency losses and problems in Latin America offset strong sales 
of cars and trucks in North America and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The German-American automaker earned $1.53 billion, or $1.53 a  
share, in the April-June period, excluding one-time charges and 
gains. In the second quarter last year, DaimlerChrysler earned 
$1.534 billion, or $1.64 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts had expected the company to earn $2 a share  
in the most recent quarter, and were surprised by the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``You basically have U.S. vehicle sales completely off the  
charts, couldn't get any better, when you're reporting flat results 
-- it doesn't send a good signal,'' said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an 
analyst for Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned investors and pushed DaimlerChrysler's U.S. shares  
down $7.43 3/4, or by almost 9 percent, to $77.56 1/4 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler executives also said that U.S. consumers, who  
have been snapping up cars and trucks at a torrid rate, would slow 
their purchases in the second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've exhausted the pent-up demand out there,'' said Robert  
Eaton, co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler, which was created last year 
by the merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still expecting slight softening in the second half,''  
Eaton added. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter totaled $38.5 billion, up 10 percent  
from $34.9 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	To lure U.S. consumers into dealerships, DaimlerChrysler offered  
rebates and other incentives averaging about $1,345 in the second 
quarter. Eaton said he expects that to rise to $1,470 in the third 
quarter as the company winds down the model year. That will hurt 
profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
	While profits from Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Plymouth cars and  
trucks were basically flat in the quarter, sales of the 
Mercedes-Benz division were hurt by losses on the ``Smart'' small 
cars, which are sold in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The loss in Smart is significant,'' said Manfred Gentz, chief  
financial officer of DaimlerChrysler. ``The losses will be 
significant for the total year (but will be) offset by stronger 
earnings out of the passenger car division of Mercedes-Benz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler also blamed its troubles on the sudden strength  
in the dollar, changes in German tax law and economic woes in 
Brazil and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it bought currency contracts to hedge against  
the rise of the dollar against the euro, and said it will equalize 
throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the longer run, it will be balanced completely,'' Gentz  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic troubles in Latin America have plagued the entire auto  
industry. DaimlerChrysler did not break out its losses in those 
countries, but Eaton sees the region recovering by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do see financial stability returning to the area sooner  
than we first thought,'' Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company has aimed to save $1.4 billion a year by  
combining the operations. The company identified 1,200 cost-savings 
projects. So far, 31 percent of the projects have been completed, 
and he expects 80 percent finished by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers from the two companies, for example, studied  
manufacturing techniques of building the Chrysler 300M, and 
transferred some of them to the production of the Mercedes E-class 
luxury cars and saved 3 hours in assembly time. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have also identified $47 million in savings from  
unifying their travel policies and purchasing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The savings come in small chunks, and fortunately, also in  
large chunks,'' Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest part, however, remains integrating the cultures of  
the two companies, which have headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich. 
and Stuttgart, Germany. ``We are working on one, common business 
culture -- that will take the longest,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger was hailed last year for uniting Europe's leading  
luxury carmaker with the U.S. company known worldwide for Jeeps and 
minivans. Yet the combined company has proved a challenge, 
especially for long-term U.S. investors. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, DaimlerChrysler's U.S. shares are off 19  
percent, while General Motors Corp.'s are up 8 percent and Ford 
Motor Co.'s are off 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton said the euro's weakness, which has fallen about 10  
percent this year relative to the dollar, hurt the company's 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. investors, which once owned 43 percent of the combined  
company, today own about 27 percent. Part of the selloff, however, 
has been blamed on DaimlerChrysler's exclusion from the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 stock index because of its base in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are continuing to work to build (U.S. ownership levels),  
but there is no change in strategy,'' Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler executives, however, released company earnings  
in New York Thursday, unlike the first quarter, when the company 
released its results in Germany at about 2 a.m. Eastern time. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the year, DaimlerChrysler earned $3.2  
billion, or $3.21 a share, up 11 percent from $2.9 billion, or 
$3.11 a share, for the year-ago period. Revenues totaled $74.6 
billion, up 10 percent from $67.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures are based on the exchange rate for the euro in  
effect on June 30. Earnings were adjusted for the effects of 
changes in German tax law and for the appreciation of the dollar 
against the euro in 1999.

	U.S. Wages, Benefits Surge in 2nd Q  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wages and benefits in the United States surged  
in the second quarter of the year by the largest amount since 1991, 
the government said today. It was good news for many workers but a 
fresh worry for Wall Street where the report rekindled concern 
about inflation and interest rates. The Labor Department said its 
Employment Cost Index -- considered the best measure of changes in 
wages and benefit costs and closely watched by Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan -- rose 1.1 percent from April through June, 
the biggest quarterly change since the second-quarter of 1991, when 
compensation increased 1.2 percent. Meanwhile, another much-awaited 
report showed the country's economic growth slowed to a 
smaller-than-expected annual rate of 2.3 percent. The fall followed 
a 4.3 percent growth rate in the first three months of the year, 
the Commerce Department said.

U.S newspapers fell in June to the lowest level in two years, the 
Conference Board reported today. The private business research 
group said its monthly help-wanted advertising index dropped to 84 
in June from 89 in May. It was also 89 in June 1998. The last time 
it was lower was in May 1997 when the advertising index reached 82. 
The index is used as a private gauge of changes in local, regional 
and national job supply.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer failures related to the Year 2000

President Clinton's top Y2K expert said. Although John Koskinen 
predicted a national ``sigh of relief'' in the early hours of Jan. 
1, he also anticipates scattered electronic failures over the first 
days, weeks and even months of the new year. Koskinen, chairman of 
the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, said in an

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two of the government's top computer security  
experts said today that some programmers hired to fix Year 2000 
problems may be quietly installing malicious software codes to 
sabotage companies or gain access to sensitive information after 
the new year. The alarms were sounded at a hearing before the 
Senate Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem. ``Many of 
these (rogue programmers) have no security clearance, do not work 
for the government, and yet they have access to critical systems 
that if sabotaged could wreak havoc to our financial institutions 
and our economy,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the 
committee's vice chairman.

	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- Second-quarter earnings at Kellogg  
Co. jumped 7.7 percent, beating Wall Street expectations. Kellogg 
earned $154.2 million, or 38 cents per share, compared to $143.2 
million, or 35 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. 
Revenues totaled $1.8 billion, up 4 percent from $1.7 billion. For 
the first half of 1999, Kellogg made $273 million, a decrease of 13 
percent from the $314 million in the first six months of 1998. The 
results were slightly higher than analysts' expectations. Kellogg 
shares were at 35 3/4, up 1 15/16.

million, or 29 cents per share, compared with $686 million or 47 
cents per share, in the same period ending June 30 1998. P&AMP;G 
president and chief executive Durk Jager said the new Organization

	LONDON (AP) -- Glaxo Wellcome PLC, the world's second largest  
drugmaker, said today that weak sales of its migraine and 
anti-smoking drug will result in the company falling short of its 
1999 target of double-digit earnings growth. Profits rose 1.33 
billion pounds ($2.13 billion) from 1.24 billion pounds for the 
first half of 1999. Glaxo said its growth in annual earnings will 
probably correspond broadly with sales, which rose 4 percent on the 
basis of constant exchange rates. Half-year sales were 4.11 billion 
pounds ($6.58 billion), up from 3.87 billion pounds. The company 
said it expects sales to strengthen during the second half of the 
year. Glaxo shares were at 51 3/16, down 1/8.

<HEADLINE> Telescope May Show Saturn Moon Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAIMEA, Hawaii (AP) -- A telescope atop Mauna Kea has detected  
what could be the only seas in the solar system other than the ones 
on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Keck telescope may have found frozen seas of hydrocarbons on  
Titan, Saturn's largest moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and  
the University of California at Los Angeles and Berkeley speculate 
that the dark regions detected by the telescope could be seas of 
liquid hydrocarbons like methane and ethane. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronomers' findings will appear in this month's issue of  
the planetary science journal Icarus. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would make, besides the Earth, the first known object in  
our solar system that actually has a liquid lake, pond, puddle or 
what not,'' Keck spokesman Andrew Perala said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists say the dark areas also might be solid fields of  
organic matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Titan is the only object in the solar system with a  
nitrogen-rich atmosphere like Earth's. But its distance from the 
sun keeps surface temperature at minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA and the European Space Agency are planning to land a probe  
on Titan in 2004.

<HEADLINE> Heat Death Toll Climbs to 55 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With temperatures in the 90s and humidity levels making it feel  
as hot as 110 degrees, it was a lonely day to be a furrier in 
Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	Business wasn't exactly booming at Heather Ray's Christian Nobel  
Furs, despite an air-conditioned store and furs for up to 75 
percent off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even give them away,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Like much of the country, Omaha sweltered through another day of  
scorching temperatures Wednesday as a heat wave that has killed 
people in nine states rolled on with little relief forecast until 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The hot weather has been blamed for at least 55 deaths since  
July 19. Hardest hit have been Missouri and Illinois, each with 18 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures were in the 90s from the Plains to the East Coast  
again Wednesday, with the heat index -- a measure of temperature and 
humidity -- hitting triple digits in many areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whew,'' said Antoine Dean, wiping beads of sweat from his brow  
as he worked at his food cart in downtown St. Louis. ``Most days 
people want the snow cones, but today they're taking the big 
cups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman said she planned to issue a  
drought warning so that water can be transferred from wetter areas 
to drier ones. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bismarck, N.D., temperatures reached 100 degrees for the  
first time in eight years. The nation's high Wednesday was 111 in 
Pierre, S.D. Little Rock, Ark., had the highest heat index at 118 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of showers helped cool some parts of Missouri but much  
of the state topped 90 degrees for the 14th straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	In St. Louis, two men in their 80s were found dead Wednesday in  
their homes with air conditioners turned off and the windows 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see these same things over and over again. Air conditioning  
wasn't a part of their lives while they were growing up, and a lot 
of them feel they don't need it now,'' said Jacqualine Hutchinson, 
spokeswoman for Operation Weather Survival, which provides 
education and relief during extreme heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you talk to the elderly, they will tell you how they used  
to sleep out on the porch or with nothing but the windows open,'' 
she added. ``But they can't do that any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, utility companies braced for more heavy demand as  
millions kept their air conditioners cranked up. 
</P>
<P>
	Some areas have set records for electrical usage. Mike Jones, a  
spokesman with the Omaha Public Power District, said the record for 
peak usage was broken three times over the last eight days. 
</P>
<P>
	People haven't been the only ones affected by the heat.  
</P>
<P>
	In Nebraska, more than 3,000 cattle have died since the heat  
wave began July 18, according to a Farm Service Agency survey. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Iowa, hundreds of fish have been killed in increasingly  
warm waters. State biologists say algae die in the water and 
release carbon dioxide, robbing the fish of oxygen. A million fish 
died in Maryland for the same reason a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all regions were dealing with severe heat.  
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rain slammed into Southern California and Arizona on  
Wednesday, swamping streets and stranding drivers. In Ohio, high 
winds knocked down trees and caused scattered power outages. 
Lightning struck the Promised Land Baptist Church in Elyria 
Township, sparking a fire that caused $225,500 in damage, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly, though, it was the heat that gripped much of the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	One man who expects to remain busy until the heat wave breaks is  
Rod Challburg, the manager of Snell Services in Sidney, Neb., which 
repairs air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do about eight estimates a day, and when we get back,  
there's 12 more calls for estimates,'' Challburg said. ``If there's 
any refrigeration technicians out there, tell them we're looking 
for good people. We just can't get caught up.''

<HEADLINE> Mustang Owners Warned About Brakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency is warning owners of  
Ford SVT Mustang Cobras that their brake hoses could fail, leading 
to increased stopping distances, if they use high-performance brake 
pads and drive their cars at very high speeds on race tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ricardo Martinez, head of the National Highway Traffic  
Safety Administration, said Wednesday there have been 21 brake hose 
failures on 15 of the sports cars, leading to two crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning, aimed at amateur race drivers, applies only to a  
subset of the 40,079 owners of Mustang Cobras from model years 1994 
through 1998 that have put high-performance, metallic brake linings 
on their cars, Ford officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The after-market, metallic brake linings build up more heat and  
can melt a brake hose, leading to brake fluid leaks or, in most 
cases, separation of the rubber brake hose from the metal fitting 
at the brake caliper. That can result in a loss of about 70 percent 
of the car's braking ability and longer stopping distances, NHTSA 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hose separations either happened at the race track or on  
private roads shortly after the Mustangs were used at the race 
track, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners with the high-performance brake pads should also get  
high-performance brake hoses which use steel to better dissipate 
the heat, Ford officials said. Those types of hoses are available 
from Ford dealers.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- At least nine people were killed today when a day  
trader opened fire in two brokerage offices, Mayor Bill Campbell 
said. Three relatives of the suspect were found shot to death in 
their suburban home. The man, whom Campbell identified as Mark O. 
Barton, 44, ``was concerned about financial losses,'' he said. 
Stock indexes had declined today. Police hunted in neighboring 
buildings in search of the gunman. Barton walked into a brokerage 
office, then walked across the street and began shooting at another 
brokerage there, the mayor said. Four of the victims were killed in 
one building and five in the other, he said.

	Bipartisan Tax-Cut Effort Fizzles

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Efforts to craft a $500 billion bipartisan tax  
cut fizzled unceremoniously in the Senate today as political lines 
hardened and President Clinton reinforced his threatened veto of a 
larger Republican tax relief package. The proposal roughly split 
the difference between the GOP's $792 billion tax cut and a smaller 
$290 billion version advanced by Democrats. The developments came 
as the Senate marched methodically toward approval of the 
GOP-crafted bill, with tax breaks for individuals, families, 
education, retirement accounts and numerous other provisions. A

an unprecedented action aimed at penalizing him for false testimony 
and deterring others ``who might consider emulating the president's 
misconduct.'' The money, which is in addition to $850,000 paid to 
Mrs. Jones to settle her sexual harassment lawsuit, is to 
compensate for legal costs related to Clinton's denial that he had 
a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Clinton's testimony in

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball accepted the resignations of 13 more  
National League umpires today, meaning nearly one-third of major 
league umps will depart Sept. 2. After most umpires announced their 
resignations July 14, baseball hired 25 replacements from Triple-A, 
effective Sept. 1. Nine AL umpires were told Monday that their 
resignations had been accepted.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Straw Poll Flap Leads to Lies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The head of the Christian Coalition in  
Iowa said Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes tried to 
hire temporary workers from her agency to vote for him in next 
month's Iowa Straw Poll, but she later retracted her charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The flap, which underscores the intense competition to do well  
in the straw poll, began earlier this week, when rival campaigns 
shared the allegations with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobbie Gobel, owner of the Metro-Temp employment agency, said in  
interviews that an aide to Forbes had approached her and tried to 
hire an unspecified number of part-time workers to cast ballots for 
him at the Aug. 14 straw poll. She even identified the Forbes 
staffer for The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the Forbes campaign denied the allegations and called  
her a liar, Gobel said ``the statements that have been attributed 
to me are false.'' Her statement, on the religious group's 
stationery, said the Christian Coalition of Iowa ``has never 
engaged in any inappropriate activities or discussions with any 
presidential campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gobel has been openly critical of Forbes in the past, calling  
him ``a wolf in sheep's clothing'' and saying she she was 
suspicious of the sharply conservative views the publisher is 
offering this election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	She has also hosted Marilyn Quayle in her home and has referred  
to former Vice President Dan Quayle as ``godly'' in discussions 
with reporters.

<HEADLINE> Talk Magazine Basks in Media Buzz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Talk magazine has this media-obsessed city in a  
tizzy -- and it's not even on the newsstands yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations are high that Talk's formula of punchy stories and  
provocative photos will attract readers across the country. It's 
got a celebrity editor, backing from the Miramax movie studio and a 
partnership with the Hearst magazine publishing empire. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Talk has set a tough goal in reaching out to a  
general readership at a time when most successful magazines focus 
on specific audiences such as investors, sports fans or food 
lovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahead of its launch next week, Talk has generated a massive tide  
of buzz, the most sought-after currency in New York's magazine 
business. It's had a well-publicized fight with the mayor, received 
breathless coverage in local tabloid papers, and it's even spawned 
a parody Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this is surprising given who's in charge. Talk's editor  
Tina Brown made plenty of waves in her tenures as editor of Vanity 
Fair and The New Yorker, both of which are part of the Conde Nast 
magazine family. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said in an interview that she wants readers to ``take away  
a sense of freshness and intimacy and the feeling of having spoken 
to an entertaining friend. Magazines need to be exciting, but they 
also need to be places where people can picnic intellectually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The monthly magazine will have an initial circulation of  
500,000, and will be printed on large, thin paper that can be 
easily rolled up and carried around. Brown said the portable format 
of the magazine, which is more common in European newsweeklies, was 
an important part of the magazine's feel. 
</P>
<P>
	``In today's busy, oversubscribed market, we need something that  
can be carried around, rolled up in a gym bag. The magazine is very 
intimate and conversational, and I wanted the format to reflect 
that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk magazine hopes to speak to a hip, well-educated audience  
across the nation, but the excitement level seems highest in New 
York, where the inner workings of magazines make up some of the 
hottest gossip at dinner parties and in newspaper columns. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from its cover price of $2.95, Talk has kept many details  
about the first issue under tight wraps ahead of its release on 
newsstands on Tuesday. Consequently, New York's tabloids have been 
filled with speculation about who will be on the cover, which 
stories made the deadline and which writers will appear in its 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the planning of the magazine's launch party on Monday --  
already the talk of New York's media world -- has become a news 
event. Talk had to move the party to the Statue of Liberty after 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani denied magazine permission to use the 
city-owned Brooklyn Navy Yard, reportedly after discovering that 
his potential Senate rival Hillary Rodham Clinton might be on the 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
	One local columnist touted an exclusive story about how rival  
Vanity Fair was able to rip out its cover for a story on John F. 
Kennedy Jr. and Talk couldn't because its deadline had passed. 
``Tina's Talk Trumped,'' gloated the headline. Brown later said, 
however, that she was able to get a story about Kennedy into the 
first issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Many media pundits are bullish about Talk, and it's easy to see  
why. Miramax, which is on a roll with its two Oscar-grabbers ``Life 
is Beautiful'' and ``Shakespeare in Love,'' will supply deep 
pockets, promotional backing and a steady stream of Hollywood 
luminaries for story subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst, the magazine powerhouse that puts out Cosmopolitan and  
Esquire, owns half of the venture and will provide a national 
distribution network and management expertise. ``We think we've got 
a home run here,'' says Hearst Magazines president Cathleen Black. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk also has a highly respected publisher at the helm, Ron  
Galotti. Brown lured him to the post from Conde Nast's Vogue 
magazine. Galotti has already pulled of a feat by getting 
advertisers to sign on for the first four issues, an unusually long 
commitment for a startup. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fact remains that launching a general interest magazine  
is tough since there's no special-interest hook to lure in readers 
and establish a set base of advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is, I think, an extraordinary task they have set out for  
themselves,'' said Roberta Garfinkle, director of print media for 
McCann-Erickson, a media-buying firm. ``The bottom line is that 
they still have to produce a magazine that people will want to 
read. It all hinges on the editorial product, and we really don't 
know about that yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin S. Walker, chairman of Walker Communications, a magazine  
consulting firm in New York, cautions that not all successful 
magazine launches turn into long-term success stories. He pointed 
to George magazine, which has seen circulation stall after a 
much-hyped launch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given all that hype and buzz, and with rather deep pockets  
from Hearst and Miramax, Talk will certainly get off the ground,'' 
Walker said. ``But we're a year away from knowing whether or not it 
will have staying power. Certainly the talent is there.''

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telekom Said Eyeing Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom AG, Germany's biggest  
telecommunications company, has reportedly offered to pay $12 
billion for the British cellular firm One2One. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal could be completed by the end of the week, the Wall  
Street Journal reported, citing people close to the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	One2One, the smallest of Britain's four mobile phone businesses,  
is owned jointly by Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC of London and MediaOne 
Group, based in Englewood, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable &AMP; Wireless and Deutsche Telekom both refused to comment  
Thursday on the story, a version of which also appeared in The New 
York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	One2One's owners put it up for sale in the spring, but their  
original asking price, believed to be about $17 billion, apparently 
discouraged all bidders except for Deutsche Telekom. If the 
reported deal sticks at its new, lower price, Deutsche Telekom will 
gain a foothold in one of Europe's biggest mobile phone markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The German company has been the focus for days of rumors about  
possible plans it has to expand into foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom's management has often expressed an interest in  
such expansion, particularly in the United States, and the 
company's ill-fated effort earlier this year to merge with an 
Italian counterpart, Telecom Italia, has fed speculation about its 
ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to that speculation is the large quantity of cash -- $10.7  
billion -- that Deutsche Telekom amassed last month by selling 250 
million new shares of stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The German newspaper Handelsblatt reported Wednesday that  
Deutsche Telekom has held exclusive talks about acquiring U.S. 
telecommunications companies Sprint Corp. and Qwest Communications 
International Inc., in addition to One2One. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing an unidentified senior Deutsche Telekom source, the  
German-language newspaper also said that the company is in talks 
with other firms, including America Online Inc. and Microsoft 
Corp., about unspecified deals. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times, citing people close to the matter, said  
Deutsche Telekom has talked with France Telecom and Sprint about 
possibly dissolving Global One, the joint venture backed by all 
three companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom has also reportedly examined a possible merger  
with Spain's Telefonica SA.

<HEADLINE> Group Asks EPA To Ban Weed Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tap water across the Midwest is contaminated  
by dangerously high levels of weed killer that pose a cancer risk 
to bottle-fed babies, an environmental group said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's president urged the Environmental Protection Agency  
to ban atrazine and noted that water utilities are spending 
millions to clean chemical from drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shouldn't be in our water to begin with,'' said Ken Cook of  
the Environmental Working Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Atrazine, a chemical sprayed on corn, was found in tap water in  
796 towns and cities in the nation's Corn Belt, according to the 
group's report. Atrazine, in high doses, has been linked to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA is studying exposure to atrazine as part of a pesticide  
review program and is set to complete its work by next summer, the 
agency said in a statement. The results will help determine whether 
tighter drinking water standards are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on schedule to meet all deadlines for reviewing  
pesticides under the new law,'' the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook's organization placed a full-page ad in The New York Times  
asking Vice President Gore's help in banning the pesticide. The 
group also said the EPA has not abided by a new food quality law 
that required the agency to keep children in mind when setting new 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said babies consume an average of three 8-ounce  
bottles each day. A mother would have to drink 33 8-ounce glasses 
of water to get the same dose of atrazine, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	In cities and towns with the worst contamination, said the  
group's senior analyst Jane Houlihan, infants fed formula made with 
contaminated tap water receive a lifetime dose in the first four 
months of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Atrazine's manufacturer, Switzerland-based Novartis AG, said the  
study misrepresented facts in an attempt to panic American parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The company pointed out that in all seven states cited, it works  
with farmers, regulators, agriculture and conservation officials to 
protect water supplies through projects such as buffer strips, 
grass waterways and conservation tillage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is that levels of atrazine cited in the report do not  
put infants, children or adults at risk,'' said Dave Whitacre, 
senior vice president of science for Novartis' U.S. operations. 
``Parents have no reason to fear the safety of the drinking water 
in their communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal safety standards, the company said, a 22-pound  
toddler could drink 3,000 gallons of water each day of his life 
without any risk to his health 
</P>
<P>
	Corn farmers say that atrazine, one of many widely used,  
low-cost herbicides, is used safely. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can tell the study was done more with promotion and public  
relations and scare in mind than with facts and science and the 
real risks, or none, associated with any of these products,'' said 
Bruce Knight, vice president of public policy for the National Corn 
Growers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmental group analyzed more than 127,000 tap water  
sample test results over the past five years in seven states: Ohio, 
Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois had the most communities, 210, with atrazine in tap  
water, the study said, while Kansas had 197, Iowa 111, Nebraska 87, 
Missouri 71, Ohio 70 and Indiana 50.

<HEADLINE> Beenie Man Faces Marijuana Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Reggae artist Beenie Man and three  
fellow musicians face marijuana possession charges after 
investigators found a small amount of the drug in their motel 
rooms, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were arrested early Wednesday when police acted on a tip  
about a marijuana smell around the band's tour bus. Police seized a 
small quantity of marijuana and $22,000 but later returned the 
money, which the band said was earnings from a show Tuesday night 
at a club. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Taylor, an attorney for the men, said the search was  
illegal because police did not get a warrant. Police said the men 
consented to the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Beenie Man, whose real name is Moses Davis, is from Jamaica. The  
25-year-old Grammy-nominated star is on a nationwide tour.

<HEADLINE> Deputies Free Teens From Cave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELBERTA, Utah (AP) -- Two teens exploring a popular underground  
cave were trapped for at least 10 hours after they got stuck in one 
of its narrow passages. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Hale was freed about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday from Nutty Putty  
Cave, located 120 feet below ground. His friend, Chris Marrow, was 
brought out a couple hours later, sheriff's Lt. Ron Fernstedt said. 
Both 17-year-olds only suffered minor abrasions. 
</P>
<P>
	The youths had camped in the area Tuesday night and entered the  
cave at about 9 a.m. They got stuck about 90 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	The youths had taken lights and were well prepared, said  
Fernstedt. 
</P>
<P>
	The youths became stuck in a portion called the Birth Canal,  
where hikers have to suck in their stomachs to get through. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the popularity of the cave and the narrowness of the  
passages, Fernstedt and rescuers could not remember having to 
rescue anyone before. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were just too big for the area they tried to go  
through,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cave is 12 miles northwest of Elberta, which is 55 miles  
south of Salt Lake City.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Brown Still Sidelined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York Giants starting halfback Gary Brown  
will be sidelined indefinitely because of a buttocks injury 
sustained a month ago when he was involved in a hit-and-run 
accident on his motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
	While Brown looks OK, the 1,063-yard rusher of a year ago is  
still bothered by a painful hematoma on the left side of his 
buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I do take a hit directly on it now, it could turn to a  
blood clot and be dangerous,'' Brown said. ``It's something we are 
going to have to take day by day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown hopes to be ready for the Giants' third preseason game,  
against the Jets on Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Fassel wasn't that optimistic. He just hopes his pudgy  
halfback will be ready for the season opener at Tampa Bay on Sept. 
12. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing has gone a lot slower than anticipated,'' Fassel  
said. ``I really don't have a feel,'' he said, adding that he 
didn't know if trainer Ronnie Barnes or doctors have an idea, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown doesn't remember much about the accident, which occurred  
June 26 in Williamsport, Pa. He was riding with a friend on 
separate motorcycles around 10:30 p.m. when a car allegedly made a 
rolling stop at a stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
	After the car missed his friend, it clipped Brown's front wheel,  
causing it to lock. The bike ended up 100 feet from the site of the 
accident. Brown was 35 feet from it. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I remember is riding and waking up in the hospital,''  
Brown said. ``I got a concussion. I don't know if I slid on it, 
bounced on it. All I know is it's swollen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The car drove off and Brown's friend was unable to see its  
license plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown needed about nine stitches near his rectum to close a gash  
caused by the incident. He wasn't able to sleep or eat much over 
the next week and he said was unable to go to the bathroom for four 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have been dead or paralyzed, or broken bones,'' said  
Brown, who was hospitalized for 2 1/2 weeks afterwards. ``I'm just 
happy to be alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown had a beachball-sized hematoma for a couple of weeks.  
Massage, ice, electrical stimulation and stretching have reduced 
the size of it, but it's still grapefruit-sized and hard, covered 
by scar tissue, and sensitive to touch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have come a long ways since I got hit, so I can't see myself  
sitting out very long,'' said the 30-year-old Brown, whose only 
other 1,000-yard season was in 1993 with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The one certainty is Brown's motorcycle riding days are over.  
</P>
<P>
	``My mom already sold it,'' said Brown, who signed a four-year,  
$5 million contract in December. ``I mean she already has a buyer 
as soon as it gets out of the shop. It was pretty wrecked up.''

<HEADLINE>  Megawati Declares Win in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- In an emotional address, presidential  
frontrunner Megawati Sukarnoputri today pronounced herself the 
winner of last month's historic general elections, and outlined 
blueprints for a new ``clean and trusted'' government. 
</P>
<P>
	The current administration should get ready to step down and  
refrain from significant political initiatives, Megawati said in 
her first major policy speech since the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the results of the ballot still have not been released  
due to bureaucratic bungling and allegations of irregularities, 
unofficial tallies give Megawati's party a convincing win with 34 
percent of the votes. The ruling Golkar Party placed second with 22 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	An electoral college is due to meet in November to pick the new  
head of state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current government must be replaced by a government that  
is clean and trusted and wanted by the people,'' said Megawati, the 
daughter of the nation's founding president, Sukarno, who like many 
Indonesians used only one name. ``The people trust me to lead the 
nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promising to rid Indonesia of nepotism and rampant corruption,  
Megawati said former President Suharto should be prosecuted for 
abusing his power during his 32-year authoritarian rule. Moreover, 
she pledged to investigate the dealings of all senior government 
officials, including incumbent President B. J. Habibie, her main 
rival for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie succeeded his mentor, Suharto, when the longtime  
autocratic leader of Indonesia was ousted last year amid massive 
riots and pro-democracy protests. Since then Indonesia has been 
mired in poverty and political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The election constituted a motion of no confidence in  
(Habibie's) government,'' Megawati said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Habibie's Golkar party is trailing Megawati's  
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle in the elections, it hopes 
to cobble together an alliance with regional parties and Muslim 
groups opposed to the idea of a woman president. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati called on the politically powerful armed forces to play  
a positive role in the transition to democracy, and said the 
military had lost the respect of the people under Suharto. ``This 
is very dangerous for the stability of the country,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati indicated that her government would respect the outcome  
of a U.N.-supervised independence referendum in East Timor. But she 
criticized Habibie for setting up the ballot in the former 
Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the referendum, scheduled for Aug. 30, was set up  
against the wishes of the Indonesian people, and that the same 
formula should not be used to settle other bloody separatist 
struggles in provinces such as Aceh and Irian Jaya.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Training Without Anderson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- After their first trip to the Super  
Bowl, the Atlanta Falcons had a difficult offseason. Now, it has 
stretched into the first day of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, star running back Jamal Anderson failed to report  
to Furman University, holding out for a contract extension and 
casting a pall over today's opening practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who rushed for a team-record 1,846 yards and set an  
NFL record with 410 carries last year, faces fines of up to $5,000 
per day. He still has a year left on his current contract, which 
provides $2.6 million in salary and bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get the job done somehow,'' said coach Dan Reeves, who  
will turn to Byron Hanspard and Ken Oxendine in the backfield while 
Anderson holds out. ``Certainly, it is a distraction. That's not 
what you like to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cantankerous negotiations with Anderson are only one problem  
encountered by the Falcons after they reached the Super Bowl for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading tackler Cornelius Bennett was released in a cost-cutting  
move. Speedy receiver Tony Martin was let go after being indicted 
on federal money laundering charges. Safety Eugene Robinson had to 
settle a soliciting charge stemming from his arrest by an 
undercover police officer the night before the Super Bowl in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations on a new five-year contract for Anderson broke down  
Wednesday when a noon deadline passed without him accepting the 
team's latest offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be more focus on why Jamal isn't here, what's  
happening on his contract, talking about all those type of things 
rather than talking about preparing ourselves ready for (the season 
opener against) Minnesota,'' Reeves conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides downplayed the passing deadline, saying they were  
still willing to negotiate. Still, Anderson's future with the team 
is a top priority for his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big thing we need to do is get Jamal in here as soon as  
possible,'' said linebacker Jessie Tuggle, the senior member of the 
team. ``He's definitely the key part of our football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons offered a $7 million signing bonus in their latest  
proposal, an increase of $1 million, but still short of the $8 
million that Anderson wants. Also, the two sides also are at least 
$1 million apart on the first three years of the proposed new 
contract, according to the player's agent, James Sims of Oakland, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're staying firm where they are and we're staying firm  
where we are,'' he said. ``I guess you could say we're at an 
impasse, a standoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sims raised the possibility of a trade, saying that may be the  
best option if negotiations become more heated. But the agent also 
said Anderson would be willing to report to camp without a new deal 
if he was convinced that negotiations were moving in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons general manager Harold Richardson said the noon deadline  
was ``not ironclad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The offer is off the table, but you have to do that to protect  
yourself,'' he said. ``What if he shows up three weeks into the 
season and says, `Yeah, I'll take the offer.' We didn't say we 
wouldn't negotiate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Anderson, offensive guard Gene Williams skipped minicamp  
earlier this month while trying to negotiate a new contract. He 
doesn't have a new deal but told the team he would report before 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons face the difficult task of following up the greatest  
season in their 34-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there will be more pressure, more a sense of  
urgency,'' receiver Terance Mathis said. ``I've been there through 
some of the bad years and I don't want to go back. Once you get a 
taste of success, you want to keep that taste.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	O.J. McDuffie, who led the NFL last year with 90 receptions,  
signed a six-year, $20 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	McDuffie's old contract had two years remaining and would have  
paid him $1.3 million this year. The new deal averages $3.3 million 
per season through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want O.J. to be a Dolphin forever,'' coach Jimmy Johnson  
said. ``He's a great team player. He helps you win.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *Packers    	
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Freeman continues to make progress in his contract  
negotiations with the Packers, who are expected to make him the 
game's highest-paid wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, who made $1.153 million last season, is reportedly  
seeking a deal worth more than $6 million annually. The two sides 
have agreed on some major issues, but are still apart on others. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman made 84 catches for a league-best 1,424 yards last  
season. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Colts    	
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis' list of holdouts was cut in half when linebacker  
Mike Peterson agreed to a four-year contract worth more than $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Steve Weinberg said the second-round pick will get a  
signing bonus of more than $1 million and a reporting bonus of 
about $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The only remaining Colts holdout is first-round draft pick  
Edgerrin James. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Patriots    	
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Faulk, a second-round draft pick from LSU who could emerge  
as the Patriots' starting running back, signed with New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk could replace Robert Edwards, who suffered a potential  
career-ending leg injury during a beach football game in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots also signed defensive back Tony George, a  
third-round pick from Florida, and offensive lineman Derrick 
Fletcher, a fifth-rounder from Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Steelers    	
</P>
<P>
	First-round pick Troy Edwards signed a contract worth a reported  
$6.3 million for five years, making him the highest-paid rookie in 
Steelers history. The deal includes a $4 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	At Louisiana Tech, Edwards set an NCAA Division I-A record with  
50 touchdown catches in three seasons.

<HEADLINE>  Megawati Declares Win in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- In an emotional address, presidential  
frontrunner Megawati Sukarnoputri today pronounced herself the 
winner of last month's historic general elections, and outlined 
blueprints for a new ``clean and trusted'' government. 
</P>
<P>
	The current administration should get ready to step down and  
refrain from significant political initiatives, Megawati said in 
her first major policy speech since the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the results of the ballot still have not been released  
due to bureaucratic bungling and allegations of irregularities, 
unofficial tallies give Megawati's party a convincing win with 34 
percent of the votes. The ruling Golkar Party placed second with 22 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	An electoral college is due to meet in November to pick the new  
head of state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current government must be replaced by a government that  
is clean and trusted and wanted by the people,'' said Megawati, the 
daughter of the nation's founding president, Sukarno, who like many 
Indonesians used only one name. ``The people trust me to lead the 
nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promising to rid Indonesia of nepotism and rampant corruption,  
Megawati said former President Suharto should be prosecuted for 
abusing his power during his 32-year authoritarian rule. Moreover, 
she pledged to investigate the dealings of all senior government 
officials, including incumbent President B. J. Habibie, her main 
rival for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie succeeded his mentor, Suharto, when the longtime  
autocratic leader of Indonesia was ousted last year amid massive 
riots and pro-democracy protests. Since then Indonesia has been 
mired in poverty and political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The election constituted a motion of no confidence in  
(Habibie's) government,'' Megawati said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Habibie's Golkar party is trailing Megawati's  
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle in the elections, it hopes 
to cobble together an alliance with regional parties and Muslim 
groups opposed to the idea of a woman president. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati called on the politically powerful armed forces to play  
a positive role in the transition to democracy, and said the 
military had lost the respect of the people under Suharto. ``This 
is very dangerous for the stability of the country,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati indicated that her government would respect the outcome  
of a U.N.-supervised independence referendum in East Timor. But she 
criticized Habibie for setting up the ballot in the former 
Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the referendum, scheduled for Aug. 30, was set up  
against the wishes of the Indonesian people, and that the same 
formula should not be used to settle other bloody separatist 
struggles in provinces such as Aceh and Irian Jaya.

<HEADLINE> UCLA Players Apologize for Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nine UCLA football players will be suspended  
for two games after being accused of claiming fake disabilities to 
get handicapped parking permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of those players, along with two former players, pleaded  
no-contest Wednesday to illegally using the placards, and 
apologized as disabled activists booed. Five other players, 
including two current teammates, will be arraigned Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``This behavior is particularly insensitive because it was  
carried out by student athletes, for they are among the most 
able-bodied of all,'' Chancellor Albert Carnesale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bob Toledo told a campus news conference he was ``terribly  
disappointed in the players and what they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like your children,'' he said. ``I'm a surrogate father.  
I've got to scold them, I've got to discipline them, but I'm still 
going to love them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, this is going to be a pretty good chunk of our  
football team,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The players pleaded no-contest to illegally possessing  
state-issued handicapped placards. Each was placed on 24 months 
probation, must pay fines, penalties and restitution amounting to 
about $1,500, and complete 200 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not realize the seriousness of our actions,'' outside  
linebacker Ali Abdul Azziz said outside court after he and the 
others entered pleas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our faces have been posted on television and newspapers and we  
know we have embarrassed our school, our families and ourselves,'' 
he said. ``We realize we exercised bad judgment, and we're anxious 
to make amends for what we've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA officials said eligible players, including six starters,  
will be suspended for two games against Boise State and Ohio State. 
Those eligible players include seven players who entered pleas and 
two whose arraignments were postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the community service will be with the Special Olympics,  
which holds athletic games for the disabled. The other 100 hours 
were assigned to the city parks department or groups helping those 
with cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and other disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes also must spend a day meeting and talking with the  
disabled and their advocates, Assistant City Attorney Brian 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for their pleas, the prosecutor dropped a second  
count of giving false information to the California Department of 
Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The misdemeanor charges carried a maximum sentence of six months  
in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The punishment is fair and sends a ``strong signal,'' the  
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the players apply for a job and are asked if they ever have  
been arrested or convicted of a crime, they must say yes, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``That'll follow them the rest of their lives,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've been punished not only adequately, but more than the  
average citizen,'' said attorney Harland Braun, who represented 
several athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the players submitted bogus applications to the  
DMV for the placards, which allowed them to park at metered zones 
for free and in spots reserved for the disabled. The applications 
listed complaints ranging from knee injuries to Bell's palsy and 
included the signatures of nonexistent physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, the players were booed and harangued by about a  
dozen disabled activists in wheelchairs. Some held flyers with the 
Bruins football logo that read ``Park them on the bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They were treated with kid gloves,'' said Lillibeth Navarro of  
the California Foundation of Independent Living Centers. `I feel 
that they were given light sentences because they're athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafer Johnson, the 1960 Olympic decathlon champion and a Special  
Olympics board member, was at the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``These athletes made a mistake, and every one of them have told  
me that and have said that to everyone within hearing distance of 
them,'' Johnson said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
	Arraignment of five other current or former players was delayed  
to Aug. 25. One player, Craig Walendy, was away at the San 
Francisco 49ers training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA finished with a 10-2 record last season and went to the  
Rose Bowl. The team is considered a contender in the Pacific-10 
Conference this season.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Nearly Triples Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc. nearly tripled its  
second-quarter profit, meeting Wall Street forecasts, as the 
nation's second-largest long-distance company benefited from 
cost-cutting and a 16 percent gain in communications revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom reported today that its profit in the three months  
ended June 30 was $857 million, or 44 cents a share, excluding its 
acquisition of Embratel, the Brazilian long-distance phone company 
it bought last fall. That compared to earnings of $287 million, or 
16 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. The year-ago results were 
recalculated as if MCI's merger with WorldCom last September 
already was completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit was in line with the 44 cents a share forecast by  
analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. MCI WorldCom's stock price 
lost 2 percent in morning trading amid a broad retreat on Wall 
Street. Its stock was down $1.37 1/2 at $85.31 1/4, on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue, excluding Embratel, rose to $8.26 billion from $7.48  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, based in Clinton, Miss., said it benefited from a  
16 percent gain in revenue from its core communications business, 
to $8.1 billion from $7 billion, that was fueled by more phone 
calls, Internet service and corporate data transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, MCI's year-ago results were eroded by major  
investments to expand its local-phone business. The company was 
able to save money in the recent quarter as MCI's 
telecommunications traffic was switched to WorldCom's network, 
instead of paying to lease lines from other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the six months ended June 30, MCI WorldCom earned $1.6  
billion, or 82 cents a share, excluding Embratel. That was up from 
a profit of $456 million, or 25 cents a share, in the year-ago 
quarter. The year-ago results, which exclude one-time charges, were 
recalculated as if MCI's merger with WorldCom was already 
completed.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Tours Big Apple After Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lance Armstrong has barely paused since his  
inspiring victory in the Tour de France. On Thursday, when he saw 
the size of the crowds welcoming him home, he finally was stopped 
in his tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	A clearly startled Armstrong was greeted by raucous, cheering  
New Yorkers four days after winning the grueling race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea how much America, how much the communities  
around America were following the Tour de France,'' he said. ``To 
see the turnout and the response in the sports world and in the 
media, it makes my day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who overcame an advanced form of testicular cancer  
two years ago before winning cycling's most prestigious race, spent 
the day being interviewed on talk shows, touring the New York Stock 
Exchange and making a promotional visit to Nike's Manhattan store. 
</P>
<P>
	Since winning the Tour, Armstrong has ridden in races in Europe  
on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Then he flew to New York for 
Thursday's round of appearances at the ``Today'' show, ``Good 
Morning America,'' the stock exchange, the Nike store and a taping 
of ``The Late Show with David Letterman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani proclaimed July 29 ``Lance  
Armstrong Day'' in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	And the impact of his victory still hasn't sunk in.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to try and do this every year,'' Armstrong said. ``I  
still can hardly believe I won the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his interviews with NBC and ABC, Armstrong, accompanied by  
his wife Kristin, talked about the cancer that nearly took his life 
in 1996 when it spread to his abdomen, lungs and brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm able now to look a year out, two years out, 10 years out,  
20 years out, whereas in the first couple of months of my illness I 
was only able to look a day away, and in the first year I was able 
to look a week away or a month away,'' Armstrong said on NBC. ``But 
now we feel confident in my health and feel confident as a couple 
and as a family and we want to have a child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kristin, whom Armstrong met toward the end of his chemotherapy,  
is expecting the couple's first child in October. 
</P>
<P>
	On ``Good Morning America,'' Armstrong received a congratulatory  
phone call from Olympic skater Scott Hamilton, also a survivor of 
testicular cancer, and spoke to Kelly Davidson, an 11-year-old 
cancer patient in Fort Worth, Texas. Armstrong, a native of Plano, 
Texas, developed a friendship with Davidson after meeting her 
during a promotion in Austin in 1997, and he had wished her well on 
camera while riding in the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson, her head bald from chemotherapy, wore a ring on a  
chain around her neck given to her by Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me really, really happy that he won,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong presented Davidson with a mountain bike on the air,  
and Davidson showed Armstrong a stuffed animal she had bought as a 
gift for his baby. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the three weeks (of the race) I thought about Kelly  
and people like Kelly and the entire cancer community,'' Armstrong 
said. ``I get so much of my own motivation and inspiration from 
them, that extended family. They're so special to me and to Kristin 
and to the whole team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, 27, was found to be cancer-free in 1997, and his  
chances of a recurrence are estimated at 2 percent by his doctors. 
But Armstrong, who started the Lance Armstrong Foundation during 
his recovery to raise funds to help people manage and survive 
cancer, feels the need to share what he has learned in his battle 
with cancer with others suffering from the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to believe,'' he said. ``You have to want to live.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a responsibility to tell my story, to encourage people  
to fight.''

<HEADLINE> All-Tech a Large Day-Trading Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	All-Tech Investment Group Inc., based in Montvale, N.J., is one  
of the nation's largest day-trading firms, with 22 offices in 15 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	All-Tech, which now has 1,500 active trading accounts, was  
formed from an earlier company in 1988 as day trading was in its 
infancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey Houtkin, who joined All-Tech in 1991 and has been the  
chairman and chief executive since 1993, calls himself ``father of 
electronic day trading'' and spreads his message through books and 
seminars. 
</P>
<P>
	Day traders buy and sell stocks, bonds or other securities on a  
moment-to-moment basis, usually using computer terminals linked to 
vast trading networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike most investors who hold stocks for the long term, day  
traders try to capitalize on the daily ups and downs of the market, 
using rapid-fire buying and selling. 
</P>
<P>
	At All-Tech, each day trader puts up at least $50,000 in equity  
to open an account, and most paid $5,000 to attend All-Tech's 
30-day training course. 
</P>
<P>
	They trade with their own money and all pay a commission of  
about $25 per 1,000-share trade, or $50 to buy or sell the same 
shares. For instance, someone who buys 1,000 shares for $141.50, 
then sells them at $141.75, would net $200 after commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's also easy to lose money as a day trader. All-Tech  
employs a corporate psychotherapist to help traders deal with the 
daily stresses. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the company agreed to pay $278,000 to the Massachusetts  
Investor Protection Fund and investors to settle claims that it 
used deceptive advertising and made unauthorized transfers of 
customers' funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Securities Dealers, the parent  
company of the Nasdaq Stock Market, approved a rule Thursday 
requiring firms that promote day-trading strategies to disclose to 
customers -- before they open accounts -- the risks associated with 
that type of trading. The risks include the loss of their entire 
investment. Those using borrowed money to trade could lose that as 
well, the ruling said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site for All-Tech carries this statement: ``Warning:  
Active electronic stock trading is risky. Participants should be 
aware of, and capable of assuming the inherent risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a document filed in November with the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, All-Tech said it had 114 employees as of last August. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's president and chief operating officer is Mark D.  
Shefts, the general counsel is Linda Lerner and the senior vice 
president-operations is Harry M. Lefkowitz, according to the SEC 
document.

<HEADLINE> Suspect's Relatives Killed in 1993 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR BLUFF, Ala. (AP) -- The wife and mother-in-law of Atlanta  
shooting suspect Mark O. Barton were bludgeoned to death in 1993 in 
a camper that had no signs of forced entry. Barton was described by 
authorities as the ``No. 1 suspect'' but was never charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The two women were found beaten to death at Riverside Campground  
on Weiss Lake in northeast Alabama, where they had been staying in 
a camper without Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the No. 1 suspect all the way through and still was,''  
said Richard Igou, district attorney at the time of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Current District Attorney Mike O'Dell said there is currently a  
suspect in the case, but said he ``can't confirm or deny that it 
might be this same guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dell, who was the deputy district attorney at the time, added  
that investigators made sure they kept up with Barton's 
whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Deborah Spivey Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise  
Powell Spivey, 59, both of Lithia Springs, Ga., were found in the 
camper by neighboring campers on Sept. 5 while spending Labor Day 
weekend at the lake. 
</P>
<P>
	The camper had no signs of forced entry. Police said the killer  
dumped the older woman's purse and took two rings, but ignored 
other jewelry and an envelope containing $600. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dell said he learned that Barton was a suspect in the killings  
of at least nine people in a shooting rampage in two Atlanta office 
buildings when he turned on his television Thursday. Police said 
three of Barton's relatives were found shot to death at an 
apartment in Atlanta's southern suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members of the Spiveys were referring all phone calls  
Thursday to investigators. A few months after the slayings Mrs. 
Spivey's husband told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that ``until 
the murders, Mark was the perfect son-in-law.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Ordered To Restrict Co. Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Medications sold by drug companies often have  
potential uses to treat numerous diseases. Traditionally, though, 
drugmakers could only promote their products for treatments 
specifically approved by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, that restriction is being eased.  
</P>
<P>
	A ruling by U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth on Wednesday  
allows drugmakers to give doctors copies of published medical 
studies that highlight the use of their drugs for treatment of 
diseases not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA 
had sought to severely restrict drug companies from doing that for 
fear the firms would only tell doctors the benefits of their drugs, 
while leaving out the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major victory for drug companies,'' said Hemant  
Shah, an analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. in Warren, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug companies traditionally have been limited in what they can  
say about their medicines, beyond the specific uses approved by the 
FDA. 
</P>
<P>
	However, doctors can prescribe FDA-approved drugs for any use  
they deem proper. As a result, drug companies can still make money 
from patients taking drugs for unapproved uses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth ruled that the Food and Drug Modernization Act  
illegally restricts the free speech of drug companies. He termed 
government arguments defending the limits ``preposterous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pharmaceutical industry praised the judge's ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would appear the judge's ruling is consistent with the  
constitutional protection of the right to commercial speech,'' said 
Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and 
Manufacturers of America, which represents drug companies. ``The 
judge has outlined a workable approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the judge's ruling, the studies the companies provide to  
doctors cannot be false or misleading, and drug company salesmen 
must disclose any association between the company and researcher. 
Further, the company must disclose whether the treatments detailed 
in the studies are FDA approved. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA wanted the authority to review published studies before  
companies could give them to doctors. Regulators also wanted the 
power to require drugmakers to give doctors additional studies on 
the drug. And, the FDA wanted companies to only distribute studies 
of drugs when the firms were already in the federal review process 
for the additional uses. 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy Dotzel, FDA acting associate commissioner for policy, said  
the agency was studying the ruling in order to prepare an 
appropriate response. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug industry will still have an incentive to seek FDA  
approval for new uses for already approved drugs because it will be 
necessary for any advertising claims, Trewhitt said. ``That is a 
big incentive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drug companies still must be careful about what they say about  
their products, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a federal judge ordered Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. to stop  
promoting its osteoporosis drug Evista as a breast-cancer 
prevention drug. The company has done studies on Evista's use in 
preventing breast cancer, but that use has not been FDA-approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Gunnarson of the Washington Legal Foundation, a  
conservative group that had challenged the law, was pleased with 
the ruling. ``It makes it very clear that the First Amendment is 
alive and well.''

<HEADLINE> HIV-Positive Worker Loses Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A federal appeals court has  
overturned a jury's award of $382,000 to a man who sued his 
employers on the grounds that he was discriminated against because 
he is HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger P. Kwiatek Jr., who worked in the support services office  
at the West Palm Beach branch of AT&AMP;T Wireless, said he was 
reprimanded and harassed soon after telling his bosses in 1993 that 
he has the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, a jury decided he should receive $1.3 million.  
Circuit Judge Kenneth A. Marra then reduced the award to $382,000. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the 4th District Court of Appeal ruled that the  
case should never have gotten to the jury and that Marra should 
have ruled Kwiatek never proved his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwiatek, 40, had no comment. His attorney, Scott Warfman, said  
he is considering an appeal to the state supreme court. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven M. Katzman, an attorney for AT&AMP;T Wireless said that while  
the company is sympathetic to Kwiatek, ``there is nothing AT&AMP;T 
Wireless did which is even remotely discriminatory.''

<HEADLINE> Woodstock Rape Reports Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- State police are investigating four alleged  
rapes at Woodstock '99, including one in which a woman says she was 
pulled into the ``mosh pit'' in front of the stage and attacked as 
the group Limp Bizkit played. 
</P>
<P>
	The three other assaults occurred in the festival's camping  
area, state police Capt. John Wood said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-day festival ended Sunday night in a fiery riot.  
</P>
<P>
	The entire concert was broadcast live on pay-per-view  
television. Wood said investigators will review the tape. However, 
he conceded it may difficult to make any arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have scattered to all parts of the country,'' Wood  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 32-year-old Ohio woman told police she was raped in the  
campground by a man on Saturday night, about the same time a 
20-year-old Buffalo woman said she was assaulted. A 20-year-old 
woman from Virginia told troopers she was raped Sunday afternoon in 
the campgrounds by two or three men. 
</P>
<P>
	A 24-year-old Pittsburgh woman told police she was  
``crowdsurfing'' -- in which fans are passed from hand to hand over 
the audience members' heads -- during Limp Bizkit's set Saturday 
night when she was pulled into the mosh pit, the crowded area in 
front of the stage where concertgoers dance and thrash into one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman said she was fondled by two men and then raped by one  
of them before she was able to crowdsurf away, Wood said. The woman 
reported the rape to medical personnel about 90 minutes later, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Due to the congestion of the crowd, she felt that if she  
yelled for help or fought, she feared she was going to be beaten,'' 
state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical workers said they witnessed many more sexual assaults  
during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, indeed, these reports are true, it is despicable,'' said  
Ilene Marder, a spokeswoman for Woodstock promoters Michael Lang 
and John Scher. She said organizers are cooperating with 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Marder added that the attack in the mosh pit was ``more  
incredulous, although I'm not saying it didn't happen. There were 
cameras on the mosh pit the entire time and a whole security team 
overlooking it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood said investigators were unaware of a posting on the  
official Woodstock web site by a father who said his daughter got 
separated from her three girlfriends early Monday morning and was 
pulled into a tent by a college-age man who allegedly raped her. 
</P>
<P>
	The father said he was offering a $10,000 reward for help  
leading to the attacker's arrest and conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Lattimore, emergency services director of the Rome office  
of the American Red Cross, said she had treated several victims of 
sexual assaults that had taken place in the mosh pit. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's Washington Post, David Schneider, a rehabilitation  
counselor from Jessup, Md., who was working as a volunteer at 
Woodstock, said he saw at least five women being pulled into the 
pit, stripped of their clothes and assaulted and raped by men in 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Schneider said the density of the crowd prevented security  
guards or others from intervening.

<HEADLINE> Group Decries Bank Rate Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth, a former high school teacher  
working in an office in Rockville, Md., has organized her debts in 
a credit counseling program and is working to pare the more than 
$4,000 she owes. 
</P>
<P>
	She pays 12 percent interest on her credit card balances with  
NationsBank and nearly 22 percent to Sears -- levels she considers 
too high. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the monthly payment goes to the interest,'' she  
complained in an interview Wednesday. Still, the 29-year-old said, 
``It's a much better option than bankruptcy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth, who didn't want to give her last name, is one of a  
growing number of people trying to avoid bankruptcy with the help 
of credit counselors. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1.4 million Americans sought help last year from  
credit counseling agencies that are members of the National 
Foundation for Consumer Credit. Some 504,000 of them, with total 
debts of $2.3 billion, got into formal debt management or 
``workout'' programs, up from 254,000 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Federation of America said Wednesday that some big  
banks have raised the credit card interest rates they charge these 
deeply indebted consumers who are trying to get out of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	But a banking industry group maintained that some consumers have  
been abusing the services of credit counseling agencies to get 
reduced interest rates when they can afford to pay more. 
</P>
<P>
	And a spokesman for a major bank disputed the consumer group's  
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Federation said the increases in interest come as  
major banks, which own the biggest credit card networks, have cut 
their funding for credit counseling agencies. The agencies were 
created by banks about 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That has created a double-whammy for people trying to work their  
way out of debt and avoid filing for bankruptcy, officials of the 
consumer group told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks ``are trying to pull the rug out from underneath the  
last best stop before bankruptcy,'' said Travis Plunkett, the 
group's legislative director. The federation is a consortium of 
more than 250 consumer groups around the country that claim a total 
of 50 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry has defended the funding cuts as necessary  
belt-tightening and as a way to force the credit counseling 
industry to become more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry is doing more than ever to educate consumers  
about using credit responsibly,'' said Patricia Boerger, a 
spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	She said some consumers have been abusing the credit counseling  
process to get lower interest rates when they can afford to repay 
their debts in full. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Federation figures show that four of the 10 largest  
companies that issue credit cards -- Citibank, First USABank One, 
MBNA and Household Credit Services -- have substantially increased 
recently the interest rate they charge consumers who are in debt 
management programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Dalphon, a spokesman for MBNA, disputed the group's  
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We work with each customer's account individually'' and charge  
interest ranging from zero to 15.9 percent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its data, Consumer Federation noted that MBNA does consider  
reducing interest rates based on an individual's circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The group cited an increase by Citibank from 8 percent to 9.9  
percent, by First USABank One from zero percent to 6 percent and by 
Household Credit Services from 6 percent to 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	David Webster, a spokesman for First USABank One, called the new  
6 percent rate ``completely fair and appropriate'' and said it is 
intended to help cover the rising costs of debt management 
programs. He noted that the rate is substantially lower than most 
standard rates charged on credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the other two companies did not return telephone  
calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Other credit card issuers have become ``increasingly unwilling''  
to reduce interest rates for consumers in debt management programs, 
reversing a long-standing industry practice, said Plunkett and 
Stephen Brobeck, Consumer Federation's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's survey found that among credit card issuers, Sears  
charged the highest interest, 21.9 percent, for consumers in debt 
workout programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still other card issuers -- Bank of America, First North American  
National Bank, Mellon Bank and US Bancorp -- charge consumers in 
debt-workout programs no interest on their credit cards, according 
to the Consumer Federation data. 
</P>
<P>
	In debt management programs, counselors work with consumers and  
their creditors to come up with a repayment plan. Consumers agree 
to tear up their credit cards and make a monthly payment to the 
counseling agency, which distributes it to creditors.

<HEADLINE> Mass Graves May Be Found in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- Government authorities in central Angola  
say they have uncovered three mass graves containing about 100 
bodies, state-controlled media reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Local officials in the highland province of Bie accused UNITA  
rebels of killing the people found in the graves, located 20 miles 
from Kuito, the provincial capital, the daily Jornal de Angola 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a senior rebel official denied UNITA was responsible, saying  
the area where they were found, Chipeta, was part of their 
strongholds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to kill our people,'' the group's  
secretary-general, Paulo Lukamba Gato, said by satellite telephone 
from the rebels' headquarters at the central highland town of 
Bailundo. 
</P>
<P>
	The report comes less than two weeks after independent radio  
Ecclesia said villagers in the same area had uncovered two other 
mass graves containing about 90 bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no independent verification of either report.  
</P>
<P>
	Angola's two-decade civil war resumed in December after four  
years of relative peace. Since then, the rebels have been driving 
villagers out of rural areas at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of displaced people now face hunger and  
disease in overcrowded and besieged government-held cities, where 
humanitarian aid has stopped arriving because of the fighting and 
road ambushes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gato denied reports that the rebels were burning entire villages  
to force people to seek shelter in cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need the population (to support the guerrilla),'' he said.  
``We're not going to push them into the government's hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,  
has fought the government since the country in southwest Africa won 
independence from Portugal in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	A peace agreement reached in 1991 collapsed the following year  
when UNITA rejected its defeat in the country's first democratic 
elections. The United Nations brokered another peace accord in 
1994, but full-scale war resumed late last year.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper To Publish Online Only </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OREM, Utah (AP) -- Nine months after printing its first paper,  
The Orem Daily Journal has announced it will stop distributing a 
print edition and will publish exclusively online. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper planned to distribute its final print edition  
today and resume publication online Aug. 5, publisher Levor Oldham 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Oldham said some employees -- particularly those involved in  
distribution -- are being laid off. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, only the newspaper's classified advertisements have  
been available on the Internet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal may be the first daily paper in the nation to move  
its publication exclusively online, said Larry Pryor, executive 
editor of Online Journalism Review and a journalism professor at 
the University of Southern California. ``Weekly publications have 
moved online, but I am unaware of any dailies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oldham said common sense drove the move. ``Clearly, the future  
of newspapers is on the Web.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orem Daily Journal is one of three Utah County newspapers  
published by Springville-based Journal Publications, which also 
designs and markets software for newspapers. It began publishing 
7,500 copies in late October, positioning itself as a competitor to 
The Daily Herald in Provo, which has a circulation of about 33,000.

	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- When Loretta Lynn heard of the death of an  
Omaha police officer, she understood the family's grief all too 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	The country music legend agreed to perform in Omaha on Thursday  
night in a benefit for the Jimmy Wilson Jr. Foundation, which was 
established after Wilson, 24, was gunned down in 1995 during a 
traffic stop. 
</P>

	``I lost a son, too, so I can relate,'' Ms. Lynn said. Her son,  
Jack, died in 1984 at 34 after falling from his horse into a 
rain-swollen river. 
</P>
<P>
	The money raised by the concert will be used to buy video  
surveillance cameras for Omaha-area schools, said Wilson's father, 
a retired police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``His son was so young,'' Ms. Lynn said. ``We need to make sure

<HEADLINE> Sugar Ray Robinson Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The man was delighted when he got a signed note for his son from  
Jake LaMotta. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the son is only 16, he is well of aware of Jake LaMotta  
and not just because of Roberto DeNiro's portrayal of the former 
middleweight champion in film ``Raging Bull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager's name is Ray Robinson III, and he is the grandson  
of Sugar Ray, who fought LaMotta six times in a 202-bout career in 
which he was world welterweight and five-time world middleweight 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the best fighter who ever lived, and I should know,''  
said LaMotta, who with Robinson's 49-year-old son, Ray II, attended 
a news luncheon for the screening of an ESPN show in which Robinson 
will be honored by the network as the 24th greatest North American 
athlete of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be televised at 10:30 p.m. EDT on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	LaMotta was the first man to beat Robinson (174-19-6, 109  
knockouts), on a 10-round decision in their second fight Feb. 5, 
1943. Robinson won the other five fights, but each was tough, and 
the last one, in which Robinson became middleweight champion by 
stopping LaMotta in the 13th round Feb. 14, 1951, was a classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't fight six times unless it's close,'' the 77-year-old  
LaMotta said. ``I think I won a couple of them. 
</P>
<P>
	In their title fight, LaMotta had Robinson pinned in a corner in  
the 11th round and was raining punches on him, but Robinson 
escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran out of gas,'' said LaMotta (83-19-4, 30 knockouts). ``It  
was my last barrage. I couldn't raise my arms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who died April 12, 1989, at age 67, was the complete  
package, who could outbox a slugger and outpunch a boxer. He could 
take a shot and throw punches in a blur. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could throw a left hook, a right and another left hook that  
was so fast it was like one punch,'' LaMotta said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Robinson's great wins was a fifth-round knockout of  
rugged Gene Fullmer with a left hook that made Robinson 
middleweight champion for the fourth time May 1, 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hit me with this left hook that I never seen, heard or  
felt,'' Fullmer says in Friday night's show. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson made his debut by stopping Joe Echevarria in the second  
round of preliminary bout Oct. 4, 1940, in Madison Square Garden. 
He ended it by losing a 10-round decision to Joey Archer on Nov. 
10, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	On hand Wednesday was Don Elbaum, who promoted that Pittsburgh  
bout and who promoted a Robinson win about six weeks previously at 
Johnstown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Since that fight was one day past 25 years since Robinson's  
debut, Elbaum recalled, he had a big cake at a press luncheon that 
was inscribed, ``Congratulations: 25 Glorious Years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elbaum also gave Robinson a pair of battered boxing gloves and  
told him, ``Ray, I've done something no one is going to believe. 
Ray these are the gloves you turned pro with. 
</P>
<P>
	``He takes the gloves and looks at them like a newborn baby,''  
Elbaum said. ``I swear his eyes teared up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Elbaum recalled, someone shouted, ```Ray put the gloves  
on.' All of sudden I see something. I kick him under the table and 
say, `Ray don't do it.' He sees what I saw and says, `I can't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both gloves were for the left hand.

<HEADLINE> 6 Airports To Get New Search Gear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six major airports soon will get new high-tech  
scanning machines that will let U.S. Customs Service inspectors see 
whether a passenger may be concealing illegal drugs or other 
smuggled materials, the agency said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The BodySearch systems uses the same safe X-ray technology as  
systems that scan baggage and cargo, Customs said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspectors can use the machines rather than performing strip  
searches or body cavity searches. The machines also offer an 
alternative to sending people to a hospital for an X-ray. 
</P>
<P>
	``This technology will allow Customs to offer passengers an  
alternative, nonintrusive search method,'' said the agency's 
commissioner, Raymond Kelly. ``This is an important step in our 
efforts to improve our personal search process for passengers and 
inspectors alike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said the machines proved effective during testing at JFK  
International Airport in New York, one of the airports getting the 
equipment over the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The other airports are Los Angeles International Airport;  
Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta; Newark International 
Airport in New Jersey; Houston Intercontinental Airport; and 
Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs did not say how much the machines will cost.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Nine Dead in Atlanta Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A man in shorts, described as irate over stock  
trading losses, opened fire Thursday in two brokerage offices, 
killing nine people and wounding 12 before escaping. Earlier, three 
relatives of the suspect were found shot to death in their suburban 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest in a grim wave of mass shootings at schools  
and workplaces and was among the worst office massacres ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell said several witnesses recognized  
the gunman, identified as Mark O. Barton, 44. Roadblocks went up, 
and SWAT teams fanned through the complex of offices, but Campbell 
said police were not sure whether Barton was still in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrible tragedy for our city,'' Campbell said. ``Our  
prayers go out to the victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, a chemist, walked into a brokerage office at Securities  
Center in the upscale Buckhead section north of downtown Atlanta 
about 3 p.m., opened fire, then walked across the street and began 
shooting at another brokerage firm there, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the victims were killed in one building and five in the  
other, shot with 9 mm and .45-caliber handguns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the injured were in critical condition at Atlanta  
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	A widespread search was launched for Barton, described as  
6-foot-4, white, with a receding hairline. 
</P>
<P>
	A previous wife and mother-in-law of Barton were bludgeoned to  
death in 1993 in Cedar Bluff, Ala. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the No. 1 suspect all the way through and still was,''  
said Richard Igou, district attorney at the time of the killings. 
Current District Attorney Mike O'Dell said there is currently a 
suspect in the case, but declined to say whether it was Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell quoted witnesses as saying Barton was upset about  
recent stock losses, but said there were no accounts of any 
specific provocation on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who have identified Mr. Barton indicated he came in, had  
a normal conversation and then began shooting,'' Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 180.78 for the day,  
a drop of 1.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nell Jones said the gunman fired at her inside one of the  
brokerage offices, but the bullet missed and she was able to escape 
when he turned to shoot at others. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, an attorney who was at the office to do some day  
trading, said she looked into the gunman's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was someone who was very calm and determined, no  
feelings,'' she told WSB-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people were still hiding in offices four hours after the  
shooting. Campbell said police SWAT units were going through every 
building in the area floor by floor, office by office, trying to 
find Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also searched the trunks of cars leaving the area.  
Roadblocks went up throughout Buckhead, and motorists heading home 
during the evening rush hour were stopped and rerouted. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton was believed to be driving a dark Green 1992 Ford  
Aerostar van with Georgia license plate number 101GCD, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also said Barton may have had access to a private plane,  
so they were checking to see if he had purchased any airplane fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Three relatives of Barton were found dead at an apartment in  
Stockbridge in Henry County, the town 16 miles southeast of Atlanta 
where Barton lived, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	They would not identify the three or give any other details, but  
Campbell said they may have been Barton's current wife and two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Roger Stubbs of Henry County said the three deaths were  
reported just 30 minutes after the Atlanta shootings, indicating 
they must have happened earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said Vice President Al Gore had telephoned to offer  
condolences and federal assistance in coping with the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings began at All-Tech Investment, a day-trading  
company on the third floor of one of the office buildings, company 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jai Ramoutar, director of All-Tech, said Barton had not traded  
there in some time. 
</P>
<P>
	He came into the office, ``and after speaking with our branch  
manager suddenly stood up and for no reason opened fire on the 
manager and his secretary,'' Ramoutar said in a statement released 
from the company's headquarters in Montvale, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``This man then went into our main trading room and began  
indiscriminately shooting the customers,'' he said. ``The man then 
ran out of our office and continued shooting in another part of the 
office building.... 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know the reason, if any, for this horrible act of  
violence. All-Tech's customers trade their own accounts in our 
offices and this man was such a customer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey Houtkin, 50-year-old chairman of All-Tech, said from  
Montvale that his employees told him Barton hadn't traded since 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a former client.'' Houtkin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Day traders buy and sell stocks, bonds or other securities on a  
moment-to-moment basis, usually using computer terminals linked to 
vast trading networks. While this holds the promise of quick gains, 
it also makes it easy to lose money. 
</P>
<P>
	At All-Tech, each day trader puts up at least $50,000 in equity  
to open an account. To cope with the stress inherent in day 
trading, the company employs a corporate psychotherapist to help 
traders. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta was one of several cities to sue gun manufacturers,  
seeking to recoup the costs of gun-related violence. But the state 
legislature and the governor, heavily lobbied by the National Rifle 
Association, swiftly passed a law prohibiting such suits. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., is pushing legislation in Congress that  
would block all cities and states from suing the gun industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia law requires no state permit to buy or own a gun but  
does require a permit to carry a concealed weapon, according to the 
National Rifle Association Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month a psychiatrist in Michigan was killed by his former  
patient, who also gunned down a 45-year-old woman and injured four 
other people in the attack. He then fatally shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, a 71-year-old man raked the first floor of the Mormon  
Family History Library in Salt Lake City with .22-caliber handgun 
fire, killing two people and wounding four others before police 
shot him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, a woman walked into a downtown Salt Lake office  
building with a grocery sack of bullets and opened fire. One person 
died.

<HEADLINE> `Swift Kick' Needs More Sting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``A Good Swift Kick'' could use a taste of its  
own title -- an occasional jolt to shake off the obviousness that 
often undermines the musical revue's entertainment value. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kick'' is an amiable show, maybe too amiable for its own good.  
The production, now on view at off-Broadway's Variety Arts Theater, 
needs a bit more sting, a sharpening of the darts it throws at such 
subjects as gays in the military, political action committees, fast 
food, Euro-Disney and New York City mega-road builder Robert Moses. 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly targets that haven't been tweaked before, but  
creator John Forster, who wrote the words and music, occasionally 
has a sassy way with a song, particularly in his lyric-writing. He 
also has the benefit of a talented five-person cast that gives his 
numbers a fine showcase. 
</P>
<P>
	The mating of material and performer produces several blissful  
moments that make one believe the musical revue isn't as lost an 
art as it seems to be. 
</P>
<P>
	It's fun watching Wanda Houston sashay her way through a  
postmodern blues number called ``Codependent With You,'' a 
my-man-done-left-me ditty that should be sung on a psychiatrist's 
couch. 
</P>
<P>
	Listen to Forster's wacky yet deadly accurate send-up of fusion,  
particularly in Jim Newman's deliciously demented vignette as a 
true believer in this most peculiar style of music. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a lethally funny hymn to the practice of playing it  
safe -- ``Nothing Ventured, Nothing Lost'' -- sung by a quintet of 
deer, who end up, of course, trapped in the headlights of an 
oncoming vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The revue also ends on an up note, a hilarious celebration by  
the descendants of Thomas Jefferson that they can pass for white -- 
and black. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, too often, the musical numbers mark time and waste the  
actors. Several songs verge on the unfunny -- an addiction to 
helium, for example -- or the silly, such as a calypso-tinged 
fast-food fandango called ``The Big Mac Tree'' that ill serves its 
talented singer, D'Monroe. David Naughton, an ingratiating, 
low-keyed guy and Elisa Surmont, a petite woman with a big voice 
(particularly in a hilarious Wagner-inspired aria about the ``new'' 
Germany) complete the cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe the show would seem more fun in a club or cabaret room,  
particularly after the audience has passed the two-drink minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	As it is, ``A Good Swift Kick,'' at a brisk 90 minutes, offers  
modest musical rewards -- and the chance to discover five young 
performers who most certainly will be heard from again.

	Economic Growth Slows in 2nd Quarter  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. economic growth slowed abruptly to 2.3  
percent during the second quarter as consumers curtailed exuberant 
spending that had been the major force behind the recent economic 
boom. The Commerce Department reported today that the gross 
domestic product, the nation's total output of goods and services, 
grew by $44 billion from April through June to an 
inflation-adjusted $7.8 trillion. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan in 
his midyear report to Congress this week said the nation's central 
bankers have not ruled out a second interest rate increase this 
year if inflation flares.

	Severe Storm Pounds Western Pa.  
</P>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A severe thunderstorm swept through  
drought-weary southwestern Pennsylvania, leaving thousands of 
people without power this morning. The 3.43 inches of rain at 
Pittsburgh International Airport yesterday set a record for any day 
in July and was the third-most rain recorded on any day since 
record-keeping began in 1870. Another storm system that moved 
through the city overnight added nearly an inch more at the 
airport, with flash flood watches issued early this morning for 
much of the region. Some 55,000 customers remain without power this 
morning.

	Clinton Vows Veto on GOP Tax Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton warned anew today that he  
will veto a ``large and risky tax cut'' championed by congressional 
Republicans, and he predicted that the $792 billion cut could carry 
America back ``to the dark old days of huge deficits.'' ``So I say 
to Congress, if you send me a tax cut that shortchanges America's 
priorities and our children's future I will veto it,'' Clinton 
said. Republican leaders are steering their $792 billion tax cut 
bill through the Senate, shunting aside a much smaller Democratic 
alternative and ignoring Clinton's earlier veto pledges.

	China Seeks Arrest of Sect Leader

	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- China widened its attempt to crush the  
banned Falun Gong meditation group today, ordering the arrest of 
its U.S.-based founder. The group, which has up to 70 million 
members, was outlawed last week by Chinese leaders who regard it as 
the most serious threat to communist rule since pro-democracy 
protests in 1989. The Ministry of Public Security ordered police 
and border posts to find and arrest Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi, 
the official Xinhua News Agency said. In Washington, Falun Gong 
spokeswoman Gail Rachlin said that she believed Li is safe in the 
United States.

have been through a terrible ordeal this past year,'' Albright, the 
highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the Serbian province since 
the 78-day NATO air war, told a cheering crowd. Albright will join 
President Clinton tomorrow for a conference in Sarajevo with other

city with casino gambling. The five-story, $225 million casino has 
two floors packed with more than 2,300 slot machines or video poker 
games and 83 table games. The casino will stay open around the

1988 for an expansion fee of $32.5 million, is selling a minority 
share of the team to Ray Wooldridge. The sale comes at a time of 
mounting legal problems for Shinn. He has been accused of sexual

	4 Hurt in Atlanta Office Shooting  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A gunman opened fire in an office building today,  
critically wounding at least four people. Police hunted for the 
gunman and said he may have fled to the roof of a building across 
the street. Police spokesman John Quigley said there were 
``multiple'' shooting victims, but he could not say how many. Grady 
Memorial Hospital said it was treating four victims in critical

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Imposing an unprecedented penalty against a  
president, a federal judge today ordered President Clinton to pay a 
$90,686 sanction for false testimony about his relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky. Most of the money, which Clinton's legal defense 
fund could pay, will go to Paula Jones and the attorneys who 
represented the former Arkansas state worker in her sexual 
harassment lawsuit. Clinton's testimony in that case led to his 
impeachment by the House and eventual acquittal in a Senate trial. 
Clinton's lawyers accepted the ruling.

for a possible increase in interest rates. At the close of trading 
on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 180.78 
points at 10,791.29. The index fell as mich as 258.04 earlier in

	Big Tax Cut Facing Opposition

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate Republican plan to give Americans  
$792 billion in tax cuts overcame one challenge today from a rival 
GOP proposal, but it faced another from a bipartisan package that 
reduces the cut by several billion dollars. Sen. Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas, with the backing of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
introduced an alternative that would have moved the bill closer to 
the earlier House-passed version. It was defeated 54-46 on a 
procedural vote. The Senate is also taking up a proposal, backed by 
Republican and Democratic moderates, that would cap the tax cut at 
$500 billion. President Clinton said again today that he will veto 
the ``large and risky tax cut.''

President Clinton, who arrives later today, and leaders from about 
40 nations are expected to endorse a ``stability pact'' to promote

Balkan delegations began arriving today, Bosnian authorities closed 
major streets in the capital as heavily armed international

today said its Employment Cost Index rose 1.1 percent in the second 
quarter. Separately, the Commerce Department said economic growth 
slowed abruptly to 2.3 percent during the second quarter as 
consumers curtailed exuberant spending that had been the major

umps will depart Sept. 2. The names of the National League umpires 
were sent from the league to the Major League Umpires Association 
this morning, a pair of management officials said on the condition 
they not be identified. The names were not immediately available. 
After most umpires announced their resignations July 14, baseball 
hired 25 replacements from Triple-A, effective Sept. 1.

</P>
<P>
	The shootings began at All-Tech Investment, a day-trading  
company on the third floor of one of the office buildings, company 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jai Ramoutar, director of All-Tech, said Barton had not traded  
there in some time. 
</P>
<P>
	He came into the office, ``and after speaking with our branch  
manager suddenly stood up and for no reason opened fire on the 
manager and his secretary,'' Ramoutar said in a statement released 
from the company's headquarters in Montvale, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``This man then went into our main trading room and began  
indiscriminately shooting the customers,'' he said. ``The man then 
ran out of our office and continued shooting in another part of the 
office building.... 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know the reason, if any, for this horrible act of  
violence. All-Tech's customers trade their own accounts in our 
offices and this man was such a customer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey Houtkin, 50-year-old chairman of All-Tech, said from  
Montvale that his employees told him Barton hadn't traded since 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a former client.'' Houtkin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Day traders buy and sell stocks, bonds or other securities on a  
moment-to-moment basis, usually using computer terminals linked to 
vast trading networks. While this holds the promise of quick gains, 
it also makes it easy to lose money. 
</P>
<P>
	At All-Tech, each day trader puts up at least $50,000 in equity  
to open an account. To cope with the stress inherent in day 
trading, the company employs a corporate psychotherapist to help 
traders. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta was one of several cities to sue gun manufacturers,  
seeking to recoup the costs of gun-related violence. But the state 
legislature and the governor, heavily lobbied by the National Rifle 
Association, swiftly passed a law prohibiting such suits. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., is pushing legislation in Congress that  
would block all cities and states from suing the gun industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia law requires no state permit to buy or own a gun but  
does require a permit to carry a concealed weapon, according to the 
National Rifle Association Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month a psychiatrist in Michigan was killed by his former  
patient, who also gunned down a 45-year-old woman and injured four 
other people in the attack. He then fatally shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, a 71-year-old man raked the first floor of the Mormon  
Family History Library in Salt Lake City with .22-caliber handgun 
fire, killing two people and wounding four others before police 
shot him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, a woman walked into a downtown Salt Lake office  
building with a grocery sack of bullets and opened fire. One person 
died.

<HEADLINE> NL Accepts Resignations of 13 Umps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thirteen National League umpires lost their jobs  
Thursday, meaning nearly one-third of major league umps will depart 
Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe West, famous for slamming pitcher Dennis Cook to the ground  
in 1990, and Eric Gregg, criticized for a wide strike zone in the 
1997 playoffs, were among those let go, one management official 
said, speaking on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hallion, suspended for three games earlier this month for  
bumping a player and coach, will be forced to leave, too, and the 
resignations of crew chief Terry Tata was accepted along with those 
of Bob Davidson and Bill Hohn. The names of the others were not 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some of the finest umpires in his history of this  
game,'' union head Richie Phillips said. ``Terry Tata has worked 
many, many important games. What they're saying is that an umpire 
who has never even worked a spring training game in his life is 
more fit to umpire in the major leagues than Terry Tata. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the conduct of major league baseball is reprehensible  
and oppressive. What they've really done here is attempt to execute 
surrendered prisoners. I absolutely vow to fight to the death in 
this case, and I will never ever rest until I right this wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On July 14, the day after the All-Star game, most umpires  
resigned effective Sept. 2, thinking the tactic would force an 
early start to negotiations for a new labor contract. The deal 
expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	But the move backfired when more than a dozen umpires refused to  
resign and baseball hired 25 replacements from Triple-A, effective 
Sept. 1. The umpires let go sent a letter Tuesday withdrawing the 
resignations, but baseball said it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine AL umpires were told Monday that their resignations had  
been accepted. That means 22 of the 68 major league umpires, or 32 
percent, are departing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really very sad,'' said AL ump Joe Brinkman, a Phillips  
foe. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallion, Hohn and Tata all declined comment after working the  
Phillies-Marlins game in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Many NL umpires were angry with commissioner Bud Selig and Sandy  
Alderson, the vice president of baseball operations in the 
commissioner's office. Neither of them commented Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a plan by Bud Selig and Sandy Alderson to break the  
union,'' NL umpire Steve Rippley said, adding that the firings have 
made him consider retirement, 
</P>
<P>
	``I've put 26 years of my life in the game. I don't like what  
they've done to this group, and I don't like where baseball's 
headed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many umpires spent the day wondering if they'd be kept or let  
go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been waiting since 6:30 this morning, calling people and  
getting phone calls,'' NL ump Dana DeMuth said in Los Angeles 
before the Dodgers played Cincinnati. ``And from that time on, our 
hearts have been jumping. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're standing here with our heads in a guillotine, and the  
blade is right here,'' he said, holding his hand an inch from the 
back of his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Ability, diversity and experience were among the factors used to  
make the decisions, several management officials said, all speaking 
on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has pushed to increase minority hiring in recent years  
and didn't want to decrease the percentage of minority umpires. 
Baseball also had to be careful not to accept the resignations of 
too many of the union's leaders, because that would open the sport 
to a charge of illegal retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, promising he will file a ``massive, massive unfair  
labor practice charge'' by Monday, cited a clause in the labor 
agreement barring ``discrimination or recrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In anticipation of baseball's moves, umpires sued in federal  
court in Philadelphia last Monday. Their attempt to gain a 
restraining order was denied by U.S. District Judge Edmund V. 
Ludwig, but a hearing on the case will be scheduled after Aug. 12, 
Ludwig's office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the umpires who kept their jobs blamed the mess on the  
union leadership, headed by president Jerry Crawford and Phillips, 
the umps' negotiator since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``The major league umpires have been seriously harmed because  
union leadership adopted a flawed strategy that was doomed to fail 
from the beginning,'' said the statement, agreed to by a group of 
14 umpires that included Brinkman, Dale Scott, John Hirschbeck, 
Dave Phillips and Rocky Roe. 
</P>
<P>
	Also signing the statement were NL umpires Wally Bell, Mark  
Hirschbeck and Jeff Nelson, and AL umpires Gary Cederstrom, Tim 
Craft, Jim Joyce, Tim McClelland, Durwood Merrill and Tim Welke. 
</P>
<P>
	``(They) started this ball rolling against us -- to pursue and  
save their own jobs instead of staying strong in our union,'' 
DeMuth said. ``They are the ones who did not stand with the 
majority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires said Alderson, Oakland's former general manager and team  
president, had the final say on their future. Selig wants to shift 
supervision of umpires from the league presidents to Alderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is Alderson -- who's never has any umpire capabilities and  
doesn't know a thing about my job?'' DeMuth said. ``How can he say 
that I must go? It doesn't make sense. But everything that he's 
done to this point doesn't make sense, anyway.''

<HEADLINE> Chaos Reigns After Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Police cruisers parked at odd angles across  
well-manicured lawns. Workers by the dozen fled their 
air-conditioned building into the 90-degree Southern afternoon. 
Drivers streamed from their parking lot, braking at security 
barricades for trunk checks. 
</P>
<P>
	For office workers at Securities Center in this swath of  
northern Atlanta, Thursday became anything but the usual summer 
afternoon at the office. In just moments, gunfire turned their 
workplace into a field of chaos and violence from which they had to 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
	``To think that when I woke up this morning, I thought that it  
was going to be a normal workday,'' said Tiombe Holland, 23, who 
works for a health services company one floor above some of the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't supposed to happen here. This isn't supposed to  
happen in Buckhead,'' she said. ``This caliber of neighborhood, you 
just don't expect it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buckhead, an affluent section within Atlanta's city limits, is  
typical of recent American development: green corporate lawns, lots 
of pavement, stores, restaurants, clubs and tinted-glass office 
buildings -- what's commonly called an ``edge city.'' Elton John 
lived in a luxury apartment here for a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities Center sits on Piedmont Road, along a strip that runs  
all the way from downtown Atlanta, through Buckhead toward the 
northern end of the city. Two of the region's biggest shopping 
malls are nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers emerged from the complex in groups of eight to 12 every  
15 minutes or so until the place was emptied. Though everyone 
looked shaken, most managed to keep calm as they wound their way 
out of the chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people were so shocked and surprised that there wasn't  
any panic,'' said Sharon Wright, 52, of suburban Stone Mountain, 
who works one floor above the third-floor day trading operation 
where some of the shootings took place. Police escorted her from 
the building at about 4 p.m. as helicopters hovered overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keep moving!'' witnesses said police were yelling. ``Don't  
turn around because you could get shot.'' One group of workers 
threw a computer through a window in an escape attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	As the scene stabilized, a somber, subdued Mayor Bill Campbell  
paced the epicenter of the chaos, answering reporters' questions 
and trying to make sense of the violence that had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pray for our city,'' Campbell implored after gunman Mark  
Barton committed suicide Thursday night. ``From Colorado to 
Atlanta, these things occur. We do not know why. ... We'll simply 
have to search our souls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some workers huddled under nearby trees; others made their way  
across the street to El Azteca, a Mexican restaurant, where they 
ate dinner, decompressed and -- with the wait staff -- watched the 
police investigation unfold. 
</P>
<P>
	At a nearby apartment complex, residents occasionally popped out  
onto their balconies to gaze upon the scene. On the perimeter of 
the police line, reporters crowded to get information. 
</P>
<P>
	Office worker Ryan Hensley, 23, said police escorted him to the  
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was there, he said, some officers rushed up and one of  
them told him: ``You need to get over to the next building now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said another officer: ``Get off the street. It's dangerous. I  
don't want anyone else picked off.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Strikes Immigrant Aid Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday abandoned  
the state's effort to preserve Proposition 187, a divisive 
voter-approved ban on schooling and other public benefits for 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and other parties involved in a legal dispute stemming  
from the 1994 measure emerged from mediation saying federal law 
already does much of what the measure sought to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 187 was approved by 59 percent of the voters, but  
federal courts have blocked virtually all of it from taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have resolved a divisive wedge issue in a way that is fair  
to the voters, the constitution and the law,'' said Davis, a 
Democrat who opposed the measure. His predecessor, Republican Pete 
Wilson, backed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' action puts a thorny political issue to rest.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, the parties in the secret mediation, who  
included several Proposition 187 opponents, asked a federal court 
to drop the state's appeals. There were no Proposition 187 
supporters in the mediation process. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Browne, a lawyer for the drafters of Proposition 187,  
condemned the deal. She said her group, the Pacific Legal 
Foundation, was studying the agreement and considering ``future 
litigation,'' including suing state agencies that do not implement 
provisions of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the voters who voted for Proposition 187 were without a  
voice in the litigation,'' Ms. Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, a vocal critic of Davis' handling of  
the matter, praised the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, an ugly chapter in the history of California politics  
has come to an end,'' said Bustamante, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative sought to exclude illegal immigrants from public  
schools and other social services, including non-emergency health 
care. It also would have required state and local officials and 
service providers to report suspected illegal immigrants to federal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Those in mediation agreed that the landmark 1996 federal welfare  
law cut illegal immigrants off from many of the same services 
targeted by Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties also agreed that a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling  
requiring Texas to educate illegal immigrants prohibited 
Proposition 187's effort to keep such students out of public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Illegal immigrants have long been ineligible for major federal  
programs such as Medicaid, food stamps, welfare and Supplemental 
Security Income. 
</P>
<P>
	The only part of Proposition 187 that survives is a provision  
imposing tougher penalties on those who sell or use false 
identification documents to hide their true citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer has until Sept. 30 to  
approve or reject the agreement.

<HEADLINE> More Than Ready Wins at Saratoga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- More Than Ready, the unbeaten  
odds-on favorite, romped to a 9 3/4-length victory Thursday in the 
Sanford Stakes for 2-year-olds at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	More Than Ready's time of 1:09 3-5 for six furlongs was the  
fastest for the event since Affirmed won in the same time in 1977. 
Affirmed went on to win the Triple Crown in 1978. Executioner set 
the stakes record of 1:09 2-5 in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Mighty was the distant runnerup in the $107,600 race that drew  
five starters. It was three lengths more to Bulling. Dance Master 
and Gone Super completed the order of finish. 
</P>
<P>
	John Velazquez was aboard More Than Ready, who carried high  
weight of 122 pounds in conceding 3 to 8 pounds to his four rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	More Than Ready broke alertly but found himself pinned down  
inside of and slightly behind Dance Master as they moved to the 
turn. Midway on the turn, Dance Master extended his advantage to 
two lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	Velazquez angled More Than Ready to the outside and overtook  
Dance Master, then pulled away with ease down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	It was More Than Ready's second straight graded stakes victory,  
following a victory in the Tremont at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once he gets to the lead, he pricks his ears and looks around.  
When he got close to the wire, he was keeping his eyes on the 
stands. I don't know what he could have done to be any more 
impressive than that,'' trainer Todd Pletcher said. ``He rated off 
the faster horse in the early part of it. He went inside, then had 
to go back outside. When it was time to take control of the race, 
he did it impressively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pletcher is looking at Saratoga's $200,000 Hopeful Stakes on  
Sept. 4, the Champagne Stakes on Oct. 9 at Belmont and the 
Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Gulfstream on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Pletcher said that schedule depends on ``if all goes well.''  
</P>
<P>
	More Than Ready earned $64,560 for owner James T. Scatuorchio  
and returned $2.70, $2.20 and $2.10. Mighty paid $4.10 and $2.10 
and Bulling was worth $2.10.

<HEADLINE> Martinez Due Back, Not Gordon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Tom Gordon got the doctor's opinion he didn't want  
to hear: The Boston Red Sox closer probably needs season-ending 
elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who set a major league record by succeeding in 54  
consecutive save chances, last pitched June 11, when he blew his 
second straight save opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	After a conversation with orthopedic specialist Dr. James  
Andrews on Wednesday, Gordon said his season could be over. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way Dr. Andrews talked to me, there's a pretty good chance  
I will have surgery,'' Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who has 11 saves, has a torn ulnar collateral ligament  
in his right elbow. He planned to see Andrews again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see what the doctor says. It's all we can do,'' Boston  
manager Jimy Williams said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	After Boston's two-game sweep in Toronto, Thursday was a typical  
day off at Fenway Park -- groundskeepers watering the field, a tour 
guide talking with a group of 50 parents and children. 
</P>
<P>
	In the manager's office, Williams chewed on his lunch and acted  
as if everything were fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox are back in the AL wild-card lead over Toronto,  
newly acquired Butch Huskey has two homers in two games, and Pedro 
Martinez expects to pitch Tuesday against Cleveland for the first 
time since July 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even the negatives -- a weekend series with the AL East  
leading New York Yankees, an angry Jose Offerman and the 
possibility of Gordon being sidelined for the season -- dampened 
Williams' spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon's prognosis followed Andrews' review of magnetic  
resonance imaging taken two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon was upset that the Red Sox waited two weeks to send the  
MRI to Andrews, who then told the reliever to stop throwing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Thurman, Gordon's agent, questioned the team's priorities  
since Dr. Arthur Pappas, the team doctor, is also one of its 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a conflict of interest,'' Thurman said. ``It's  
ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Nomar Garciaparra also was upset with the team's  
medical care. He noted the length of time it took to determine 
Gordon needed surgery and told teammates, ``Our doctors are killing 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon's streak of converting 54 save opportunities ended July 5  
against Atlanta. He blew another save in his next appearance, July 
11 against the New York Mets and went on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Tim Wakefield moved from starter to closer and has  
been successful in 13 of 14 save opportunities. He'll keep that 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez hasn't pitched since July 18, when he gave up a  
career-high nine runs in 3 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez (15-3) planned to see Pappas on Friday and probably  
will throw off the mound on Saturday, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The manager, citing poor defense, also decided to bench  
Offerman, signed to a $26 million, four-year contract during the 
offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be in this situation, that's for sure,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offerman's fine,'' said Williams, who used Donnie Sadler at  
second base Wednesday night. ``We need all of our team.''

	On June 27, Boston was just two games behind New York in the AL  
East and nine ahead of Toronto in the wild-card race. But a Toronto 
surge and a 12-18 Boston slide dropped the Red Sox behind the Blue 
Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston then swept two games in Toronto this week to jump ahead  
of the Blue Jays by a half-game. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Boston starts a three-game series Friday night against the  
Yankees, with New York's Hideki Irabu (7-3) facing Mark Portugal 
(6-7). Two of Irabu's losses came against Boston's Brian Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose (6-3) pitches Saturday against Roger Clemens (9-4),  
pitching for the first time at Fenway Park for the Yankees. Sunday 
night's matchup is Orlando Hernandez (12-6) against Bret Saberhagen 
(6-4).

<HEADLINE> Humana Earnings on Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Managed care company Humana Inc. met Wall  
Street expectations despite a drop in second-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the quarter ending June 30, 1999 was $28 million,  
or 17 cents a share a dramatic drop from the $52 million, or 31 
cents per share, in the year ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue increased modestly during the period from a year ago, up  
from $2.45 to $2.51 billion, but membership in the company's 
various managed care plans fell below 6.1 million members, a 2.8 
percent decline from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said continuing higher medical costs prompted  
the decline in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we have identified the specific causes of our  
medical cost trends and are actively implementing five major 
initiatives to overcome the trends,'' said Humana president and 
chief executive officer Gregory W. Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana, which has its headquarters in Louisville, is one of the  
nation's largest publicly traded managed health care companies. Its 
membership is primarily in 15 states and Puerto Rico where it 
offers plans such as health maintenance organizations, preferred 
provider organizations and administrative service products to 
employer groups, government plans and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors pushed Humana shares down 37 1/2 cents to $11.81 1/4 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Nearly Triples Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc. nearly tripled its  
second-quarter profit, meeting Wall Street forecasts, as the 
nation's second-largest long-distance company benefited from 
cost-cutting and a 16 percent gain in communications revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom reported today that its profit in the three months  
ended June 30 was $857 million, or 44 cents a share, excluding its 
acquisition last fall of a controlling stake in Embratel, the 
Brazilian long-distance phone company. That compared to earnings of 
$287 million, or 16 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. The 
year-ago results were recalculated as if MCI's merger with WorldCom 
last September already was completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit was in line with the 44 cents a share forecast by  
analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. MCI WorldCom's stock price 
lost 2 percent in morning trading amid a broad retreat on Wall 
Street. Its stock was down $1.37 1/2 at $85.31 1/4, on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue, excluding Embratel, rose to $8.26 billion from $7.48  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, based in Clinton, Miss., said it benefited from a  
16 percent gain in revenue from its core communications business, 
to $8.1 billion from $7 billion, that was fueled by more phone 
calls, Internet service and corporate data transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, MCI's year-ago results were eroded by major  
investments to expand its local-phone business. The company was 
able to save money in the recent quarter as MCI's 
telecommunications traffic was switched to WorldCom's network, 
instead of paying to lease lines from other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the six months ended June 30, MCI WorldCom earned $1.6  
billion, or 82 cents a share, excluding Embratel. That was up from 
a profit of $456 million, or 25 cents a share, in the year-ago 
quarter. The year-ago results, which exclude one-time charges, were 
recalculated as if MCI's merger with WorldCom was already 
completed.

<HEADLINE>  Sabres' Hasek Will Retire in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- He's earned millions of dollars,  
won Olympic gold and piled up five trophies as the NHL's top 
goalie. But for The Dominator, there's no place like home. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing relaxed and even relieved, Dominik Hasek said Thursday  
he would retire from the Buffalo Sabres at the end of next season 
so he could raise his children in his homeland, the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old goaltender said his kids, 9-year old Michal and  
4-year old Dominika, find it increasingly difficult to adapt to 
Czech life when they go home in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided to retire because of my friends and my family,''  
Hasek said, adding he and his wife Alena want their children to get 
a Czech education. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Michal turns 18, it will be his decision whether he  
becomes an American or a Czech boy. But now, we want both kids to 
live with us in the Czech Republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek also is tired of the limelight -- too many requests for  
autographs, too many people stopping him on the street, not enough 
peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``In America, they say, `Out of sight, out of mind,''' Hasek  
said. ``I hope this will work for me at home,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attention I've received is overwhelming. It's something I  
don't enjoy at all. It's time to step back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek's decision came a day after Barry Sanders stunned the  
Detroit Lions and the rest of the football world by announcing his 
retirement. Other high profile retirements this year include 
Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky and John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabres assistant general manager Larry Carriere flew to Prague  
for the news conference and praised Hasek's contributions to not 
only the team but to Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it will be difficult to replace somebody of the  
caliber of Dominik Hasek,'' he said. ``But he gave us the 
opportunity to plan ... our future a year in advance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Gary Bettman noted that Hasek would be playing in  
the upcoming season and hoped for more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish him well and we wish he could change his mind,''  
Bettman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek said he first started thinking about retirement nine  
months ago and met with Sabres' management about it. He and his 
wife made the final decision to quit just before the playoffs, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite struggling much of last season with a groin injury.  
Hasek helped the Sabres reach the Stanley Cup finals, losing to 
Dallas in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, known for flopping to the ice to block shots and even  
releasing his stick and grabbing for the puck with two hands, was 
paid $7 million last season. Only Patrick Roy of the Colorado 
Avalanche, who made $7.5 million, had a higher salary among 
goalies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek is walking away from millions of dollars. He has two years  
remaining on his contract, $7 million for the upcoming season and 
$7.5 million for 2000-01, and the club holds an option at $9 
million for the following season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have enough money to live a nice life, not only for me but  
for kids and wife,'' Hasek said. ``If somebody offered me $25 
million to play one more year, I wouldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is the third Czech ice hockey superstar to decide to head  
back home immediately after ending an NHL career. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Pittsburgh Penguins' Jaromir Jagr and the Phoenix  
Coyotes' Robert Reichel both said they prefer their homeland over 
the United States and will return as soon as their careers are 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Hasek wants to stay connected with the Sabres in some  
fashion after retirement and said he will remain active with 
Buffalo's Variety Club, an organization that takes care of children 
from poor families and pays for their hockey training. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech won the NHL's most valuable player in 1997 and 1998,  
and helped the Sabres reach the Stanley Cup finals this year. 
</P>
<P>
	His career highlight, however, came in the 1998 Winter Olympics  
in Nagano, Japan, where he led the Czechs to the gold medal with a 
performance that made him a national hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo acquired Hasek in 1992 in a trade from Chicago, where he  
was a backup to Ed Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
	He went to the NHL in January 1990 after the fall of the Iron  
Curtain. It took him three years to make his big breakthrough, and 
his years as a backup left him contemplating a return to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	He won his first Vezina Trophy as the NHL's best goalie in 1994  
with Buffalo -- at the age of 29, rather late even for a goalie. He 
won it four more times, including this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Stanley Cup, the other big prize missing from his  
career is a world championship trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek is one of the few top Czech athletes with a university  
degree -- he studied teaching, specializing in history and the Czech 
language. 
</P>
<P>
	His future, he said, will include working with children to  
educate them as well as teach them hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	He also plans to promote his Dominator hockey equipment. But  
there will be no comeback after next year, he pledged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I take off my equipment for the last time, that's going  
to be forever,'' Hasek said.

<HEADLINE> HUD: Make More Mortgages Available </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is requiring the two biggest  
housing finance companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to finance 
more mortgages for low- and moderate-income families, boosting 
their total to $2.4 trillion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The order, announced Thursday by HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo,  
means the companies must buy an additional $488.3 billion in 
mortgages from banks and other lenders, enough to provide housing 
loans for some 7 million families of modest means. That will enable 
the banking institutions and credit companies to lend more money to 
homebuyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- government-chartered corporations  
whose stock is publicly traded -- buy mortgages from original 
lenders such as banks and package them into securities for resale 
to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Housing and Urban Development, which regulates  
the two corporations, raised the proportion of mortgage loans they 
must earmark for low- and moderate-income families from the current 
42 percent of their total purchases to 50 percent. The first 
increase will be to 48 percent next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Affordable housing ``is in a crisis stage in this nation,''  
despite the booming economy, Cuomo told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still real needs out there,'' he said. '' ...  
There's plenty of work for us to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The HUD action ``will transform the lives of millions of  
families across our country by giving them new opportunities to buy 
homes,'' Cuomo said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Raines, Fannie Mae's chairman and chief executive  
officer, said, ``We're going to work very hard to reach'' the new 
mortgage financing level. 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae agreed to the new 50 percent level for low- and  
moderate-income mortgages after intense negotiations with HUD 
officials, Cuomo and other agency officials said. Freddie Mac, 
however, is still in discussions with the agency, which could 
impose the requirement unilaterally if it wished. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo said his department preferred to cooperate and negotiate  
with the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon McHale, a Freddie Mac spokeswoman, said only technical  
issues remain unresolved and the company believed the 50 percent 
requirement was reasonable.

<HEADLINE> Hoffa: Union Will Police Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teamsters president James P. Hoffa says the  
union will begin to police itself against organized crime in an 
attempt to end a decade of federal supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are vestiges of organized crime, we're going to find  
them and we're going to ferret them out,'' Hoffa said at a news 
conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa won the Teamsters' presidency and was sworn in in March  
after promising to root out corruption and seek an end to federal 
oversight that the union agreed to in 1989 in order to avoid 
racketeering charges brought by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	To start, Hoffa said the union has hired as a consultant Edwin  
H. Stier, a former federal prosecutor who served as a 
court-appointed trustee overseeing the cleanup of corruption in New 
Jersey's Teamsters' Local 560. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're going to try to do is to do that on a national  
scale,'' said Stier. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa's father, Jimmy Hoffa, built the Teamsters into a national  
powerhouse, but was sent to prison for jury tampering and misusing 
union funds. He disappeared in 1975, and is presumed a victim of 
organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'd be proud of what I'm doing,'' Hoffa said.  
</P>
<P>
	The anti-corruption plans include a new code of conduct for  
union members, enforced from within, and an internal investigation 
into what mob influences may still remain after a decade of 
government supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	In a June 16 letter to Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder,  
Hoffa said he believes that the Teamsters can demonstrate that 
there is no longer a need for federal intervention in their 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time to move forward,'' said Hoffa's letter, in which he  
noted $80 million in union dues has gone to support the federal 
monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the  
Southern District of New York who is the Justice Department 
official in charge of Teamsters oversight, said that her office had 
replied to Hoffa's letter inviting union officials to set a date to 
meet with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to meeting and working with the new leadership  
of the IBT (International Brotherhood of Teamsters) to ensure that 
the progress under the consent decree continues,'' said White's 
spokesman, Marvin Smilon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Paff, a national organizer for Teamsters for a Democratic  
Union, a faction that opposed Hoffa's election, said the union's 
recent campaign finance scandal should be taken as proof that some 
federal oversight is still needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa's 1998 election to the Teamsters' presidency came after  
his 1996 loss to incumbent Ron Carey was set aside when 
investigators found that Carey's campaign had improperly benefited 
from donations the union made to third-party political 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the chief functions of federal monitors has been to  
ensure fair elections,'' said Paff. ``Are we going to stop having 
supervision of our elections?''

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer Stamp Raises $8M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a year of sales, a special stamp that costs  
a little more than regular postage has raised $7.8 million to help 
research on breast cancer, the Postal Service said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Postal employees around the nation have embraced this effort  
and have demonstrated an outpouring of dedication to this worthy 
cause,'' Postmaster General William Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Issued July 29, 1998, the breast cancer stamp was the first  
so-called semipostal stamp offered by the United States. 
Semipostals sell for more than the normal price of a stamp, with 
the extra money going to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	The breast cancer stamp costs 40 cents. With first class postage  
of 33 cents, up to 7 cents per stamp goes to research. 
</P>
<P>
	At the direction of Congress, the research money is being  
divided between the National Institutes of Health and the health 
research arm of the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
	While semipostals have been used in the past in other countries  
the Postal Service had been reluctant to issue them, fearing a 
deluge of requests from various charities. 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress, in 1997, ordered the agency to issue the  
breast-cancer stamp. Since then, proposals have been made in 
Congress for other stamps to raise funds to combat prostate cancer 
and diabetes, but no final decisions have been made on those.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Gets Best of Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Blood flowed in wrestling and pride  
swelled in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what the sport, there's nothing like a meeting between  
the United States and Cuba to get the competitive juices going at 
the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States got the best of the major matchups Wednesday.  
Americans beat Cubans five times for gold medals in wrestling, 
including a victory by Joe Williams that left him bleeding from the 
left side of his head. 
</P>
<P>
	That came after the Americans pulled off an even more  
significant victory, stunning the powerful, confident Cubans 10-5 
in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Cuba, the team to beat,'' U.S. pitcher Dan Wheeler said.  
``We knew they would be tough. That's why we played so hard, so 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wrestlers competed hard as well, none more so than Williams  
and Stephen Neal, who staged a dramatic comeback to upset Cuba's 
defending world champion at 130 kilograms. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal, only 4 1/2 months removed from his NCAA championship at Cal  
State-Bakersfield, rallied from a 6-1 deficit to beat Alexis 
Rodriguez 8-7 on a takedown with 20 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real fortunate in that the USA has the top heavyweights in  
the world,'' Neal said. ``Four Americans have beat that guy in the 
last year. I knew I could do it because of my style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' match at 76 kilos against Yosmany Romero was a  
bruising affair that forced trainers to wrap his bleeding head 
three times. 
</P>
<P>
	The cut was opened when the two banged heads as Romero was  
taking Williams down -- after the whistle had blown. But Williams 
fought through it and won 3-0 for his first gold in a major 
international competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen matches like that, so it didn't surprise me,'' said  
Williams, a three-time NCAA champion at Iowa. ``You've just got to 
keep your composure and remember your sportsmanship. I'm out there 
to score, win and get off the mat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Americans who beat Cubans for gold medals were Cary Kolat  
at 63 kilos, Lincoln McIlravy at 69 kilos and Dominic Black at 97 
kilos. Les Gutches gave the United States its other gold by beating 
a Canadian at 85 kilos. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Guerrero, who arrived early Monday as a last-minute  
replacement for Terry Brands, won the silver at 58 kilos and Eric 
Akin took the bronze at 54 kilos as the United States went 30-3 in 
the two-day tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball victory was the first by the United States over  
Cuba in a major competition since the 1987 Pan Am Games and helped 
soothe the pain of a 7-6 first-round loss to Canada, a game in 
which the Americans led 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the United States lost on Wednesday, it probably would have  
had to play Cuba again before Monday's finals. Now, the Americans 
have a good chance to reach the gold medal game, which would give 
the United States a berth in the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I very much believe this has a lot to do with the game we had  
with Canada,'' said U.S. manager Buddy Bell, who was ejected for 
arguing a call in the ninth inning. ``That hurt a lot and we were 
disappointed. It also made us understand what we were up against.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right after Bell was tossed, Marcus Jensen hit a three-run homer  
to break a 5-5 tie, and the United States added two more runs to 
finish it off. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada passed Cuba in the medals race, but still trails the  
United States, which has 43 golds, 42 silvers and 28 bronzes for 
113. Canada has 21 gold medals and 72 overall, with Cuba at 26 
golds and 67 overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Defections and ejections were the story elsewhere, and Olympic  
gold medalist Donovan Bailey finally showed at the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more Cubans -- softball coach Jose Mendez and a shooter --  
have sought asylum in Canada, according to sources close to the 
Cuban team. They left the delegation earlier this week, said the 
sources, who would not provide the shooter's name. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the third and fourth Cubans to seek asylum at the  
games. Pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes asked for asylum before 
the games got started. Reporter Lisette Cepero of Radio Rebelde 
also has sought to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban sports federation officials repeatedly have denied anyone  
has defected. The Cubans have been livid about what they perceive 
as media attempts to ``incite desertion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer turned ugly when police had to rescue referee Rich Grady,  
who ejected four Guatemalans and both coaches in Canada's 2-1 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players from Guatemala rushed toward the retreating  
official following the final ejection. His assistants and several 
police officers formed a circle around Grady, and they waited for 
the field to clear before escorting him away. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, the Pan Ams poster boy roundly criticized for not  
running in the 100 meters, ran on the opening leg of Canada's 400 
relay team in Wednesday's semifinals and helped his team record the 
fastest time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I owe my teammates. I made a commitment to the Pan American  
Games people and the fans of Winnipeg to run the relay and that's 
what I did,'' said Bailey, the 1996 Olympic champion in the 100. 
``I'm not stung by the criticism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Track winners included Americans Marla Runyan, who is legally  
blind, in the women's 1,500, and 1991 men's discus champion Anthony 
Washington, at 210 feet, 9 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's Magalys Garcia won the women's heptathlon with 6,290  
points. Americans Shelia Burrell and Nicole Haynes finished 2-3.

<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The sun beat down on Tom Matthews as he  
wiped his brow and unloaded a beat-up pickup truck at the steamy 
Southside Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't had heat like this for 10 years, maybe 15,''  
Matthews said with a sigh amid the stench of rotting garbage and 
the wavering diesel fumes from a bulldozer nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a thing you can do about it,'' said Matthews,  
sweat soaking through his cloth gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	Folks across the eastern half of the nation sweated it out  
Thursday as a heat wave that has killed people in at least 12 
states dragged on, with little relief forecast until the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The hot weather has been blamed for at least 71 deaths since  
July 19 and has made millions miserable. Hardest hit have been 
Missouri, with 27 dead, and Illinois, with 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The extreme heat has come as a drought withers crops and lawns  
across the East. On Thursday, Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening 
declared the first-ever statewide drought emergency and urged all 
Marylanders to conserve water. Conservation measures could become 
mandatory by mid-week if the area does not receive substantial 
rain, the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If water consumption continues at the current rate, there is  
only a 35-day supply in these reservoirs,'' Glendening said. 
</P>
<P>
	By 10:30 a.m., it was 94 in Kansas City, Mo. -- making Thursday  
the 15th straight day the state had seen temperatures in the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures also reached the 90s from the Plains to the East  
Coast, with the heat index -- a measure of temperature and humidity 
-- breaking 100 in many places. 
</P>
<P>
	In Annapolis, Md., where temperatures have hovered in the 90s,  
Carolyn Heinlein has been shepherding tourists around the city's 
historic district, dressed in 18th century garb -- a plaid 
ankle-length skirt, a vest-like bodice over a cotton shift, and a 
straw hat. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in their shorts and tank tops are looking at me, but I  
tell them, I don't believe I'm any hotter than you are,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	How does she cope?  
</P>
<P>
	``Shade is a gift from God,'' she said. ``You bathe and bask in  
the air conditioning when you go into a building, and when a breeze 
comes along, you embrace it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A man who walked all the way from his home state of Georgia to  
deliver a petition to the American Medical Association in Chicago 
said it was a sweltering trek through the heat belt. Stuart Perry, 
who arrived Thursday, said he made the thousand-mile journey to 
educate people about depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Clutching a straw hat drenched in sweat, he said the heat was  
like a wall once he hit Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like you were cooking on the inside,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Council Grove, Kan., a town of 2,400 about 50 miles from  
Topeka, Bill and Pat Fisher joined friends at the ``Bull Session 
Table'' of the air-conditioned Saddlerock Cafe. Bill Fisher said it 
was his way of beating the heat by just staying indoors ``doing 
nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're coping with it damn poor,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Back in Indiana, the two glass doors of Sparkle Cleaners -- just  
down the street from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway -- were propped 
wide open to let a breeze in. It didn't matter much. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seven fans in here and it doesn't do a thing,'' owner  
Ryan White said, talking loudly so he could be heard over a pop 
song on the radio and the hissing of a steam presser. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so hot back there that one of my pressers -- she's an  
older lady -- after a full day of pressing she was getting ready to 
leave and just passed out right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White said the woman is a diabetic.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if it was the combination of heat and low sugar  
or what,'' he said, ``but since then, on these hot days, she's had 
to call in and say, `I can't make it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The heat is not just bothering people.  
</P>
<P>
	At the Oklahoma City Zoo, timers periodically turned on  
sprinklers to help zebras and other animals stay cool. Primates at 
the ape exhibit were periodically given Popsicle-like ice treats, 
some with fruit in them. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nebraska, where temperatures have pushed into the 100s in  
some places, the heat has killed at least 3,000 cattle. Some of the 
animals are registering a skin temperature of 120 degrees, said Dr. 
D. Griffin, a veterinarian with the University of Nebraska 
Cooperative Extension Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are cooking,'' he said. ``They are absolutely cooking.''

<HEADLINE> Kellogg Earnings Beat Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- Second-quarter earnings at Kellogg  
Co. jumped 7.7 percent, beating Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg earned $154.2 million, or 38 cents per share, compared  
to $143.2 million, or 35 cents a share, in the same quarter last 
year. Revenues totaled $1.8 billion, up 4 percent from $1.7 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of 1999, Kellogg made $273 million, a  
decrease of 13 percent from the $314 million in the first six 
months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were slightly higher than expectations of 36 cents  
per share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is a little better than what people  
expected,'' said Nomi Ghez, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. ``I 
think it was mostly a result of good performance in its convenience 
foods and cost-cutting. But the ready-to-eat cereal category is 
very lackluster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg's ready to eat cereal sales for the second quarter  
remained relatively flat from a year ago, but convenience foods 
shot up from $357 million the second-quarter of 1998 to $422 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg president and CEO Carlos Gutierrez predicted the company  
would reach its full-year goal of low double-digit growth in 
earnings per-share. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we continue to make progress in our cereal business, our  
high-growth convenience foods business delivered another quarter of 
strong double-digit growth,'' said Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg's first-quarter earnings were down 30 percent after a  
disappointing 1998, and the company has acted aggressively in 
recent months to counter the trend. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 salaried and 240 contracted positions were cut  
last year as part of a corporate reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Kellogg announced it is considering closing the  
southern part of its historic Battle Creek cereal plant, a move 
that would cost 700 jobs but save the company between $35 and $45 
million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Kellogg rose $1.93 3/4 to $35.75 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Blood flowed in wrestling and pride  
swelled in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what the sport, there's nothing like a meeting between  
the United States and Cuba to get the competitive juices going at 
the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States got the best of the major matchups Wednesday.  
Americans beat Cubans five times for gold medals in wrestling, 
including a victory by Joe Williams that left him bleeding from the 
left side of his head. 
</P>
<P>
	That came after the Americans pulled off an even more

	``The first race I went to was at Crown Point (Ind.) in 1927,''  
Andres said in a 1996 interview. ``I liked it so much I wanted to 
go to Indy. I drove a Model T Ford Coupe down, and it took eight 
hours. Louie Meyer won, and I sat on the hood of my car (watching) 
the whole race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four years later, Andres began his racing career at Evanston  
(Ill.) Motor Speedway. He drove stock cars in 1932 and sprint cars 
in 1933 and made his debut at Indianapolis in 1936 with an 
18th-place finish. He missed the 1937 race but was 29th, 30th, 12th 
and 30th in the four races before the Speedway was shut down for 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to racing in 1946, when he recorded his best finish  
at Indianapolis, fourth. He drove in three more races at Indy, then 
retired after his final race at Milwaukee in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my own fault I never won (at Indy),'' he said. ``I  
wasn't very sociable, which is why I never had a car that could 
win. I was rough and tough. I think you had to be that way during 
the Depression. You had to fight for every buck you got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Charlotte, two daughters, a son and  
two grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Heat Death Toll Climbs to 63 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With temperatures in the 90s and humidity levels making it feel  
as hot as 110 degrees, it was a lonely day to be a furrier in 
Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	Business wasn't exactly booming at Heather Ray's Christian Nobel  
Furs, despite an air-conditioned store and furs for up to 75 
percent off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even give them away,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Like much of the country, Omaha sweltered through another day of  
scorching temperatures Wednesday as a heat wave that has killed 
people throughout the country rolled on with little relief forecast 
until the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The hot weather has been blamed for at least 63 deaths since  
July 19. Hardest hit have been Missouri, with 22 deaths, and 
Illinois, with 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures were in the 90s from the Plains to the East Coast  
again Wednesday, with the heat index -- a measure of temperature and 
humidity -- hitting triple digits in many areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Dakota, Sue Runyan was working on an expansion project  
at the Bismarck Civic Center Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been the worst that I've seen it, this summer. Even  
without the heat, there's been the humidity. And the humidity will 
leave you drenched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Whew,'' said Antoine Dean, wiping beads of sweat from his brow  
as he worked at his food cart in downtown St. Louis. ``Most days 
people want the snow cones, but today they're taking the big 
cups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman said she planned to issue a  
drought warning so that water can be transferred from wetter areas 
to drier ones. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bismarck, N.D., temperatures reached 100 degrees for the  
first time in eight years. The nation's high Wednesday was 111 in 
Pierre, S.D. Little Rock, Ark., had the highest heat index at 118 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of showers helped cool some parts of Missouri but much  
of the state topped 90 degrees for the 14th straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	In St. Louis, two men in their 80s were found dead Wednesday in  
their homes with air conditioners turned off and the windows 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see these same things over and over again. Air conditioning  
wasn't a part of their lives while they were growing up, and a lot 
of them feel they don't need it now,'' said Jacqualine Hutchinson, 
spokeswoman for Operation Weather Survival, which provides 
education and relief during extreme heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you talk to the elderly, they will tell you how they used  
to sleep out on the porch or with nothing but the windows open,'' 
she added. ``But they can't do that any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, utility companies braced for more heavy demand as  
millions kept their air conditioners cranked up. 
</P>
<P>
	Some areas have set records for electrical usage. Mike Jones, a  
spokesman with the Omaha Public Power District, said the record for 
peak usage was broken three times over the last eight days. 
</P>
<P>
	People haven't been the only ones affected by the heat.  
</P>
<P>
	In Nebraska, more than 3,000 cattle have died since the heat  
wave began July 18, according to a Farm Service Agency survey. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Iowa, hundreds of fish have been killed in increasingly  
warm waters. State biologists say algae die in the water and 
release carbon dioxide, robbing the fish of oxygen. A million fish 
died in Maryland for the same reason a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all regions were dealing with severe heat.  
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rain slammed into Southern California and Arizona on  
Wednesday, swamping streets and stranding drivers. In Ohio, high 
winds knocked down trees and caused scattered power outages. 
Lightning struck the Promised Land Baptist Church in Elyria 
Township, sparking a fire that caused $225,500 in damage, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly, though, it was the heat that gripped much of the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	One man who expects to remain busy until the heat wave breaks is  
Rod Challburg, the manager of Snell Services in Sidney, Neb., which 
repairs air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do about eight estimates a day, and when we get back,  
there's 12 more calls for estimates,'' Challburg said. ``If there's 
any refrigeration technicians out there, tell them we're looking 
for good people. We just can't get caught up.''

<HEADLINE> California Shows Abortion Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Abortions dipped slightly in California in 1996,  
but the most populous state still had the nation's highest rate and 
Wyoming still had the lowest, government researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	California has had the nation's highest abortion rate since  
1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released  
state-by-state statistics Thursday showing California recorded 
280,180 abortions, or 39 for every 1,000 women ages 15 to 44, in 
1996. A year earlier, California reported 289,987 abortions, a rate 
of 40 per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyoming's total increased from 182 in 1995 to 208 in 1996, the  
latest year for which statistics are available. The rate stayed at 
2 per 1,000 women. 
</P>
<P>
	New York had the second highest rate in 1996, at 37 per 1,000  
women. Florida was third at 27, followed by Delaware at 26 and 
Rhode Island at 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC previously reported that the nationwide abortion rate  
held steady in 1996 at 20 per 1,000 women. 
</P>
<P>
	States reported 1,221,585 abortions in 1996, an increase of less  
than 1 percent from the year before. It was the first time 
abortions had failed to decline since 1990, when the total was more 
than 1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences in the state-by-state rates can be attributed in  
part to the age and racial makeup of the female population, the 
rate of contraceptive use and socioeconomic factors, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It also has to do with the proportion of pregnancies that are  
planned verses unplanned,'' said Lisa Koonin of the CDC's Division 
of Reproductive Health. ``The number of abortions are directly 
related to the number of unintended pregnancies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the women who had abortions in 1996 were white and  
unmarried, the CDC said.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Earns $1.59 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T earned $1.59 billion from April to June,  
edging most Wall Street forecasts for the first full quarter that 
reflects the telephone company's ambitious foray into cable TV with 
the acquisition of Telecommunications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-quarter profit, which amounted to 49 cents per share,  
compares with an operating profit $1.47 billion, or 54 cents per 
share, in the same period last year. Analysts had expected a profit 
of 48 cents per share in the latest quarter, according to a survey 
by the research firm First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The year-ago figures exclude gains from the sale of some  
operations and costs related to AT&AMP;T's work force reductions -- 
one-time factors that left AT&AMP;T with a net profit of $1.13 billion 
or 48 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter revenues from continuing operations totaled  
$15.82 billion. That's an increase of 6.7 percent from the combined 
$14.83 billion generated in last year's second quarter by AT&AMP;T and 
the not-yet-acquired operations of TCI and IBM's Internet services 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's business services reported revenues of $6.283 billion in  
the just-ended quarter, an increase of 6.7 percent from year-ago 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	But the consumer services unit, including AT&AMP;T's core  
long-distance calling business, posted a 3.4 percent decline in 
quarterly revenues to $5.50 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Wireless services revenues grew 42.4 percent, adjusted for the  
acquisition of Vanguard Cellular Systems in May 1999 and the 
October 1998 sale of AT&AMP;T's messaging unit. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's new Broadband and Internet Services unit, which includes  
the cable operations and At Home Internet service acquired with 
TCI, had second quarter revenues of $1.420 billion, an increase of 
7.6 percent from what those operations generated a year ago before 
the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The TCI deal and the pending acquisition of MediaOne Group, the  
nation's fourth largest cable TV company, are the lynchpins of 
AT&AMP;T's plan to bypass the local Bell monopolies for delivering 
local and long-distance telephone calls as a package with TV and 
high-speed Internet access -- all over the same cable wire. 
</P>
<P>
	Between acquisitions and spending to upgrade cable equipment for  
two-way communications, AT&AMP;T is expected to spend more than $150 
billion on its strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``AT&AMP;T's strong second-quarter earnings reflect steady progress  
in executing our strategy,'' said AT&AMP;T Chairman C. Michael 
Armstrong. ``We met investor expectations by delivering revenue and 
earnings growth for the sixth quarter in a row.''

<HEADLINE> Service Chiefs Unite Behind F-22 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top commanders at the Pentagon, even from  
rival services, are rallying behind the embattled F-22 fighter, 
lobbying the Senate to restore a nearly $2 billion cut by the House 
that some say could kill the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Showing rare unity behind a costly Air Force weapons program,  
the Joint Chiefs of Staff and senior field commanders wrote to 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott on Wednesday, urging the Senate 
to renew $1.8 billion for the first eight production line fighters 
cut last week by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lessons over the last 50 years have taught us that air  
superiority is the prerequisite for successful military 
operations,'' the Joint Chiefs told Lott, R-Miss. ``Since the 
addition of air power to the tools of warfare, no major military 
campaign has succeeded without air superiority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was signed by Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of  
the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston, the vice 
chairman; and Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff. 
Those three could be expected to back the F-22 because it is 
Clinton administration policy and an Air Force priority. 
</P>
<P>
	But the letter was also signed by Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army  
chief of staff; Adm. Jay Johnson, chief of naval operations; and 
Gen. J.L. Jones, Marine Corps commandant -- all commanders with 
their own spending priorities that will be competing for budget 
money with costly programs such as the F-22. 
</P>
<P>
	By supporting a single weapon system, the letter indicates the  
importance all commanders place on control of the skies in battle. 
</P>
<P>
	The House abruptly cut President Clinton's budget request to  
build the first production model F-22, citing the plane's rising 
cost and questions about its performance. Lawmakers also argued 
that the money is more urgently needed in stressed day-to-day 
accounts to pay for such things as spare parts and training. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon plans to buy 339 F-22s, fewer than half the number  
initially planned. Contractor Lockheed Martin Corp., which will 
assemble the plane in Marietta, Ga., is promising to reduce the 
cost per plane below $80 million, but the first aircraft will cost 
more than $200 million. The eight aircraft cut by the House were to 
have cost a total of $1.8 billion. The House left money for 
research and development in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Key senators, including Armed Service Committee Chairman John  
Warner, R-Va., are expected to restore some if not all of the F-22 
money, even though Warner and others have also raised serious 
questions about the program. 
</P>
<P>
	So many billions have already been invested in the  
radar-evading, high-performance fighter that to eliminate the money 
would be a colossal waste, some lawmakers have argued. The 
Pentagon's position is that eliminating money for next year will 
effectively kill the F-22. 
</P>
<P>
	Also writing to Lott in a separate letter were 10 of the  
so-called unified commanders, the four-star generals and admirals 
who lead U.S. forces in various regional commands. Among them are 
Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni, who leads U.S. forces in the 
Persian Gulf region, and Army Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO commander in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every theater of operation and for every military task  
across the spectrum of conflict, there is an underlying need to 
control the skies,'' the officers wrote. They said the current U.S. 
air superiority fighter, the F-15, is the product of 1960s 
technology and some of the older planes are approaching the end of 
their useful life.

<HEADLINE> Cleaves Sues Over Traffic Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Michigan State basketball star Mateen Cleaves has  
sued former University of Michigan player Maurice Taylor and his 
aunt over injuries suffered in a 1996 traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves alleges he ``has been rendered temporarily seriously  
disabled and ... suffered great physical pain and mental anguish'' 
as a result of the rollover accident involving a Ford Explorer 
driven by Taylor and owned by his aunt, Ellen Lloyd of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves was in his senior season at Flint Northern High when he  
traveled to Ann Arbor on a recruiting trip with Taylor and four 
other Michigan players. The Explorer crashed about 4:50 a.m. on 
Feb. 17, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports said at the time that the most serious injury was  
suffered by then-freshman Robert Traylor, who broke his arm and 
missed the remainder of that season. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Cleaves has twice been named Big Ten Player of the  
Year for the Spartans. He was a first-team All-America in 1998-99. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which seeks at least $25,000 in damages, alleges  
Cleaves' injuries resulted from Taylor's negligent operation of the 
Explorer and Ms. Lloyd's negligence in allowing Taylor to drive the 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed Jan. 29 in Wayne County Circuit Court.  
</P>
<P>
	Lamberto DiStefano, the attorney representing Taylor and Lloyd,  
said in a response filed July 16 that Cleaves ``has not suffered 
... serious disfigurement affecting his or her general ability to 
lead a normal life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiStefano asked that the suit be dismissed.  
</P>
<P>
	Calls from The Associated Press to Cleaves' attorneys, Barry  
Waldman and Brian McKenna of Detroit, were not returned Thursday. 
DiStefano also did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	A mediation hearing on the suit was scheduled for Oct. 25,  
according to radio station WDFN-AM. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor left Michigan after the 1996-97 season and was the Los  
Angeles Clippers' first overall draft choice, 14th overall, in 
1997. He averaged a team-high 16.8 points per game last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves led the Spartans to their second straight Big Ten title  
and first Final Four appearance in 20 years last season. He 
announced in May that he would return to Michigan State for his 
senior year.

<HEADLINE> ABC Adding Minorities to TV Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- TV producer Kevin Williamson said he  
felt enlightened, not pressured, by protests over the lack of 
minority characters in new fall series. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson, whose new ABC series ``Wasteland'' featured an  
all-white cast in its pilot, decided to move up the introduction of 
a black character, a New York prosecutor played by Jeffrey D. Sams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like my eyes have been opened a little bit wider,'' he  
said. ``It's not pressure, it's `Kevin, wake up.' I'm a minority, I 
get it,'' said Williamson, who is gay. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the NAACP condemned the absence of minority  
characters on broadcast television and said it was considering a 
boycott or other action. On Tuesday, a coalition of Hispanic also 
demanded more minority representation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Zwick, co-creator of the new ABC drama ``Once and Again,''  
said it wasn't demands from the network or outside groups that led 
to the addition of black actress Rachel True. 
</P>
<P>
	``The part was written about three months ago. The NAACP  
announced its boycott about three weeks ago,'' Zwick said 
Wednesday. ``This is something we had planned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zwick was exasperated that the ``Once and Again'' cast change  
was announced by ABC as part of several planned for its series, 
saying it gave the wrong impression. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not how we work,'' Zwick said. ``We don't cast according  
to any kind of perceived pressure or agenda. We cast according to 
what is appropriate to the part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While attempting to seem responsive to the NAACP and other  
groups, the networks are also trying to avoid the impression that 
they've been ignoring the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Moonves, CBS Television president and chief executive  
officer, and ABC Television Network President Patricia Fili-Krushel 
said their networks are actively seeking a meeting with the NAACP. 
But they said strides already are being made. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, ABC executives said at least five of their shows  
would add minorities -- a change in the works since May, said Jamie 
Tarses, ABC Entertainment president.

<HEADLINE> Sanders Was Never Ordinary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Barry Sanders went into the final game of his rookie season in  
1989, knowing just what he needed to win the NFL rushing title -- 
1,480 yards, the total reached earlier in the day by Christian 
Okoye of Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he took himself out of the game at the start of the fourth  
quarter, 10 yards short of Okoye, and resisted every effort to go 
back in and win the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry just doesn't care about those things like records,''  
Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy said Wednesday, the day Sanders 
announced he would retire from football after 10 years despite 
needing just 1,458 yards to eclipse Walter Payton's career rushing 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was an assistant with the Chiefs when he let Christian take  
the title, and we were all aware of what he was doing. He doesn't 
care about the spotlight and he doesn't care about records.''. 
</P>
<P>
	The conventional wisdom in a lot of places is that Sanders'  
announcement is a ploy either to force a trade or get more money 
from the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sanders never adhered to conventional wisdom, either on the  
field or off it. That's why his retirement announcement should be 
taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was astounded when I heard he was retiring with the record  
so close,'' former Buffalo coach Marv Levy said. ``But when you 
think about it, he's never been a guy who postures. There's nothing 
phony about him, so if he says he's retired, maybe he's retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No, Barry Sanders doesn't like posturing.  
</P>
<P>
	Go back to training camp in 1992, after Detroit lost 41-10 to  
Washington in the NFC title game, the closest Sanders ever got to a 
Super Bowl in 10 years with the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Side-by-side were two lockers, shrines to offensive linemen Mike  
Utley, paralyzed on the field the year before, and Eric Andolsek, 
killed in an offseason accident. That's the way Wayne Fontes, the 
team's emotional coach, thought was the best way to pay tribute to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders didn't agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I like that,'' Sanders said, looking at the  
lockers. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys weren't gods. They were real people. They have  
families, and those families have feelings. No, I don't like it. 
Mike's still very much alive and I think we should be reminded of 
Eric's positive contributions, not his death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the field, there was no one like Sanders, either.  
</P>
<P>
	He regularly led the league in yards for losses -- his style was  
zigzag, not straight ahead, and when he zigged for a hole that 
wasn't there, he'd get trapped -- yards behind the line of 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	But a play or two later, he'd break for 30 or more, sometimes  
bending his body at a 45-degree angle from the ground, then 
bouncing up to dart through a small hole. At 5-foot-8, 200 pounds, 
he had the flexibility of a gymnast, the ability to twist and turn 
in ways an Emmitt Smith or a Terrell Davis, the best of his 
contemporaries, wouldn't even attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry did things I wouldn't try to do,'' said Davis, who ran  
for 2,008 yards for Denver last season and is now the game's 
pre-eminent running back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a running back. He's a great athlete. If he were a  
lineman, he'd be the best lineman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why did he retire? Sanders said it was the culmination of a  
thought process that began after last season. And his father 
suggested in May that his son was upset by the mediocrity of the 
Lions and the inability of Detroit to trade him because of the 
multimillion-dollar salary cap hit they would take. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sanders' 10 years, his team was 78-82 in regular-season play  
and 1-5 in the five years they made the playoffs. In the Fontes 
era, which covered Sanders' first eight seasons, the Lions were 
constantly changing coordinators and systems -- from the 
run-and-shoot, to a one-back system with no blocker, to a more 
conventional pro set. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd gain his 1,500 or 1,700 or 1,800 yards regardless and got  
2,058 in Bobby Ross' first year, 1997, carrying Detroit to the 
playoffs in a brilliant final regular-season game. Naturally, they 
lost their first postseason game, 20-10 in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Lions finished 5-11 last season, Sanders apparently  
had enough. He'd had an ``off'' year, 1,491 yards, and there were 
no Super Bowl rings in sight. So he stayed silent until he shocked 
the football world on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I think he's serious,'' Dungy said. ``If he'd  
announced it after last season or last spring, he'd have had 
everyone in Detroit calling him to coax him back.''

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan Soccer Players Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Three Guatemalan men's soccer players  
and a Guatemalan coach were suspended Thursday for the remainder of 
the Pan American Games for their conduct during a game against 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Another player was suspended, along with a Canadian coach, for  
one game. 
</P>
<P>
	The players and coach gone for the remainder of the tournament  
are Denis Chen, Carlos Ruiz, Algeria Briones and coach Walter 
Calvieri. Their physical abuse of referee Richard Grady on 
Wednesday caused the suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen was warned in the 17th minute when he pushed Grady in the  
chest. Ruiz kicked the referee, also in the 17th minute, and 
Briones punched the referee in the back at the end of the game, a 
2-1 win for Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvieri was suspended because of his abusive conduct toward the  
referee at halftime. Merlos Sosa will be forced to miss the team's 
next game vs. Trinidad &AMP; Tobago on Friday because of his ejection 
in the 20th minute of the Canadian game for a serious foul. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian coach Bruce Twamley will have to miss Canada's next  
game vs. Mexico on Sunday because of his abusive conduct toward the 
fourth offical.

<HEADLINE> Navy Has Backlog of Burials at Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy is scrambling to eliminate a backlog  
of bodies to be buried ceremonially at sea, a problem brought to 
light by the rapid service the Navy provided for the burial of John 
F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife and sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy has 52 sets of remains in storage awaiting burial, some  
for several months, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, 
said Thursday. All but three of those are in storage at Portsmouth 
Naval Medical Center, Va. The rest are at Navy facilities on the 
West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Adm. J.P. Reason, commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, ordered  
immediate action to eliminate the backlog after he learned of it, 
Quigley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was completely unacceptable to him and he's working very  
hard to remove that backlog,'' Quigley said. ``Everyone involved in 
that would admit that this was not done very well and there's no 
really good reason for having that backlog there in the first 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The burials of Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and  
her sister Lauren Bessette occurred a day after their bodies were 
found in the waters off Martha's Vineyard, Mass., following the 
July 16 crash of Kennedy's private plane. Asked why the burials 
were handled without delay, Quigley said it was a case of an 
``unusual circumstance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The destroyer USS Briscoe was at sea off the East Coast as the  
search for the Kennedy plane was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the ability to be timely in that request, that was  
the decision that was made to send her north to accomplish the 
burials of those three at sea,'' Quigley said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 10 ships will be involved in relieving the backlog of  
sea burials by Aug. 6. The only remains that won't be buried by 
then will be those for which families have requested a later date 
or set other special conditions, such as a specific burial location 
requiring more time, Quigley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy said that no ships will be sent to sea just for burials  
but will conduct the ceremonies while deployed for other missions. 
The Navy blamed the backlog on several factors, including a reduced 
fleet and increased demands on remaining ships to participate in 
various operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sailors, retired Navy officers and enlistees, their spouses and  
dependent children are entitled to burial at sea. With special 
approval, as in the Kennedy case, others may also receive Navy 
burial rites at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The service is free, although family members must prepare either  
a casket or cremated remains in containers that fit Navy 
specifications. Unlike in the Kennedy case, family members are not 
allowed to attend the rites, which usually take place during 
regular ship deployments as part of other missions, according to 
Navy Capt. Ryland Dodge of the Navy's Bureau of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	About 90 percent of the remains the Navy buries at sea are  
cremated. The Navy handles about 500 burials at sea per year.

<HEADLINE> For-Profit Nasdaq, NYSE Raise Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Concern among securities industry watchdogs is  
growing that as the two largest U.S. stock markets move closer to 
for-profit status, they will have difficulty separating their 
regulatory obligations from their desire to make money. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the board of the National Association of Securities  
Dealers approved a series of steps designed to spin off its Nasdaq 
electronic market into a for-profit organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The steps could ultimately lead to an initial public offering of  
stock in the Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
	NASD officials emphasized that Thursday's actions weren't a  
final decision on creating an independent, for-profit Nasdaq 
market, but rather the continuation of an ongoing process. 
</P>
<P>
	The board's actions were expected in the wake of last week's  
announcement by the New York Stock Exchange that the Big Board is 
mulling a initial public offering, or IPO, as early as this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The dramatic shift in how the stock markets propose to conduct  
their business has many Wall Street observers questioning whether 
the Nasdaq and NYSE can fulfill their duties as so-called 
self-regulated organizations, while still responding to the demands 
of shareholders seeking profits on their investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Both markets will need to resolve that potential conflict of  
interest if they are to maintain investor confidence, said Philip 
Rutledge, deputy chief counsel for the Pennsylvania Securities 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutledge said he's concerned that both the Nasdaq and NYSE  
regulatory operations will fade into the background once market 
officials become accountable to shareholders. In other words, the 
need to turn a profit could ultimately supercede the responsibility 
to provide adequate market oversight. ``We have to worry about a 
vacuum on the regulatory side with all the focus on the survial 
side,'' Rutledge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pennsylvania official was echoing comments made earlier this  
week by SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt in a letter to top officials at 
both the Nasdaq and the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	In an apparent response to such concerns, NASD officials argued  
in a statement released after Thursday's meeting that the money 
raised through a shift to public ownership would provide additional 
funding for the NASD's regulatory arm and allow for increased 
market oversite. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq and NYSE officials have also argued that a shift to a  
for-profit structure through public ownership is needed in order to 
keep up with expensive technology and provide a currency -- publicly 
traded stock -- for possible acquisitions to remain competitive with 
the growing number of upstart, electronic stock trading systems. 
</P>
<P>
	NASD Chairman Frank Zarb said in a statement Thursday, ``We need  
to change our governance to make decisions more quickly in an 
increasing competitive environment that values speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many market analysts believe the trend toward publicly  
owned, for-profit stock markets is inevitable. Exchanges in Canada, 
Europe and Australia have already made the shift. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the shift for-profitstatus will help stock markets to  
move forward quickly with technological innovations that will lower 
trading costs and ultimately benefit investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The competition on a global level has become so tough that the  
exchanges need the extra capital to invest in technology and to be 
able to introduce new products quickly,'' said Reena Aggarwal, a 
business professor at Georgetown University who specializes in 
equity markets and IPOs. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leading U.S. stock markets are currently financed by  
their members. But that financing method pales in comparison to the 
money that could be raised through an initial public offering, 
Aggarwal said, especially since investor interest in IPOs has been 
remarkably strong in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Aggarwal noted that the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq  
Stock Market are two of the most widely recognized brand names in 
the financial services industry, and that investors could be 
expected to scramble for shares of the entities. 
</P>
<P>
	In the long run, investors will likely benefit from the shift to  
public ownership, Aggarwal added, because the new structure will 
allow the markets flexibility not currently afforded by their 
current bulky, bureauratic membership structures. ``The way they're 
structured now, the exchanges are extremely bureaucratic and it's 
hard to make quick decisions,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Big Tax Cut Facing Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate Republican plan to give Americans  
$792 billion in tax cuts over the next decade faced challenges 
today from a rival GOP proposal and a bipartisan package that 
reduces the cut by several billion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, with the backing of Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, introduced an alternative that would move the 
bill closer to the earlier House-passed version by reducing income 
tax rates by an eventual 10 percent and repealing estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Finance Committee, under pressure from Democrats, had  
rejected that approach because it confers a larger percentage of 
the benefits from the tax cut on the well-off. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is also taking up a proposal, backed by Republican  
and Democratic moderates, that would cap the tax cut at $500 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said again today that he will veto the ``large  
and risky tax cut,'' which he asserted could carry America back 
``to the dark old days of huge deficits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So I say to Congress, if you send me a tax cut that  
shortchanges America's priorities and our children's future I will 
veto it,'' Clinton said before leaving the White House for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders are shunting aside a much smaller Democratic  
alternative and ignoring Clinton's earlier veto pledges. 
</P>
<P>
	Determined to show they could both cut taxes and save Social  
Security, Republicans pushed a ``lockbox'' amendment that would bar 
future Congresses from using Social Security surpluses for 
non-Social Security purposes. The GOP failed, on a 54-46 vote 
today, to get the 60 votes needed to advance such a measure. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic alternative, which would have protected both Social  
Security and a portion of any Medicare surpluses, got 42 votes, 
with 58 opposing. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of the 10-year tax cut were confident, despite  
misgivings among several Republicans about its size, of winning 
passage by the end of the week and moving quickly to work out 
differences with a similar House-passed bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans ``are rightful heirs to the wealth they're creating,''  
Sen. William Roth, R-Del., the Finance Committee chairman and the 
bill's chief author, said in opening the debate Wednesday. ``After 
paying for the government programs for which Congress has planned 
and budgeted, the change must now be returned to the taxpayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was what to do with a projected budget surplus  
estimated to total $1 trillion over the next decade, or nearly $3 
trillion if the revenues from Social Security are included. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans insisted that their tax relief wouldn't affect  
efforts to restore fiscal integrity to Social Security and Medicare 
and would leave funds to bring down the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and most Democrats said a tax cut should come  
only after the Social Security and Medicare issues are dealt with, 
and that it should be kept modest -- under $300 billion -- so funds 
would be available to strengthen education and defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me be clear again,'' Clinton said in his brief Rose Garden  
address. ``I do strongly support tax cuts, but not if they are so 
large they undermine our strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This debate is not about tax cuts, it's about how big they  
should be, and what else this country wants to do,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP plan, envisioning the biggest tax cut since Ronald  
Reagan's in 1981, would reduce the 15 percent income tax rate to 14 
percent, effective in 2001. Beginning in 2005, the new 14 percent 
tax rate would apply to some income that is currently taxed at 28 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It also offers relief from the so-called marriage penalty,  
allows larger contributions to IRA retirement plans, cuts estate 
taxes and provides tax breaks for employer-provided health care, 
interest on student loans and long-term care insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate defeated, on a 60-39 vote, a $290 billion Democratic  
alternative centered on raising the standard deductions for married 
couples, removing more low-income families from the tax rolls, and 
providing tax credits for the care of children and the elderly and 
for education. Six Democrats voted against their party's 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said there should  
be no tax cut until the surpluses predicted by economic forecasts, 
which have been unreliable in the past, become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
	An amendment offered by Sens. Bob Graham, D-Fla., and Charles  
Robb, D-Va., that would have put off the tax cut until the solvency 
of Social Security and Medicare is ensured went down, 54-46. 
</P>
<P>
	Mistrust of economic projections was also expressed by a  
bipartisan group of senators, led by Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who 
proposed a $500 billion compromise bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Their plan, said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, errs on the side  
of economic caution. People from Maine know, she said, that ``just 
because the calendar says it's spring doesn't mean that you should 
put away the shovel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who testified before  
the Senate Banking Committee Wednesday, was quoted by both sides in 
defending their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats referred to his statement that the nation ``probably  
would be better off holding off on a tax cut'' because the surplus, 
left alone, was healthy for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans countered that Greenspan also made the point that he  
was strongly against using the surplus for new government spending. 
``If that appears to be coming, I would favor tax cuts even in the 
short term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1429.

<HEADLINE> Group Decries Bank Rate Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth, a former high school teacher  
working in an office in Rockville, Md., has organized her debts in 
a credit counseling program and is working to pare the more than 
$4,000 she owes. 
</P>
<P>
	She pays 12 percent interest on her credit card balances with  
NationsBank and nearly 22 percent to Sears -- levels she considers 
too high. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the monthly payment goes to the interest,'' she  
complained in an interview Wednesday. Still, the 29-year-old said, 
``It's a much better option than bankruptcy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth, who didn't want to give her last name, is one of a  
growing number of people trying to avoid bankruptcy with the help 
of credit counselors. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1.4 million Americans sought help last year from  
credit counseling agencies that are members of the National 
Foundation for Consumer Credit. Some 504,000 of them, with total 
debts of $2.3 billion, got into formal debt management or 
``workout'' programs, up from 254,000 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Federation of America said Wednesday that some big  
banks have raised the credit card interest rates they charge these 
deeply indebted consumers who are trying to get out of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	But a banking industry group maintained that some consumers have  
been abusing the services of credit counseling agencies to get 
reduced interest rates when they can afford to pay more. 
</P>
<P>
	And a spokesman for a major bank disputed the consumer group's  
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Federation said the increases in interest come as  
major banks, which own the biggest credit card networks, have cut 
their funding for credit counseling agencies. The agencies were 
created by banks about 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That has created a double-whammy for people trying to work their  
way out of debt and avoid filing for bankruptcy, officials of the 
consumer group told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks ``are trying to pull the rug out from underneath the  
last best stop before bankruptcy,'' said Travis Plunkett, the 
group's legislative director. The federation is a consortium of 
more than 250 consumer groups around the country that claim a total 
of 50 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry has defended the funding cuts as necessary  
belt-tightening and as a way to force the credit counseling 
industry to become more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry is doing more than ever to educate consumers  
about using credit responsibly,'' said Patricia Boerger, a 
spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	She said some consumers have been abusing the credit counseling  
process to get lower interest rates when they can afford to repay 
their debts in full. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Federation figures show that four of the 10 largest  
companies that issue credit cards -- Citibank, First USABank One, 
MBNA and Household Credit Services -- have substantially increased 
recently the interest rate they charge consumers who are in debt 
management programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Dalphon, a spokesman for MBNA, disputed the group's  
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We work with each customer's account individually'' and charge  
interest ranging from zero to 15.9 percent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its data, Consumer Federation noted that MBNA does consider  
reducing interest rates based on an individual's circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The group cited an increase by Citibank from 8 percent to 9.9  
percent, by First USABank One from zero percent to 6 percent and by 
Household Credit Services from 6 percent to 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	David Webster, a spokesman for First USABank One, called the new  
6 percent rate ``completely fair and appropriate'' and said it is 
intended to help cover the rising costs of debt management 
programs. He noted that the rate is substantially lower than most 
standard rates charged on credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the other two companies did not return telephone  
calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Other credit card issuers have become ``increasingly unwilling''  
to reduce interest rates for consumers in debt management programs, 
reversing a long-standing industry practice, said Plunkett and 
Stephen Brobeck, Consumer Federation's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's survey found that among credit card issuers, Sears  
charged the highest interest, 21.9 percent, for consumers in debt 
workout programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still other card issuers -- Bank of America, First North American  
National Bank, Mellon Bank and US Bancorp -- charge consumers in 
debt-workout programs no interest on their credit cards, according 
to the Consumer Federation data. 
</P>
<P>
	In debt management programs, counselors work with consumers and  
their creditors to come up with a repayment plan. Consumers agree 
to tear up their credit cards and make a monthly payment to the 
counseling agency, which distributes it to creditors.

<HEADLINE> House Foreign Aid Bill Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A $12.6 billion House foreign aid bill faces  
strong objections from the Clinton administration because of deep 
spending cuts and a tough anti-abortion provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Both family planning advocates and anti-abortionists claimed  
victory in back-to-back votes on amendments late Thursday, but a 
prohibition on money to any group lobbying for abortion laws 
courted a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The House worked on the bill until just after midnight this  
morning, postponing a final vote until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration says the legislation's cuts of $1.9 billion  
from President Clinton's requests would harm a wide range of 
foreign policy efforts, hurting the poorest countries and 
diminishing the ability to respond to foreign crises, to prevent 
nuclear smuggling, to deal with the Asian crisis, to expand the 
Peace Corps and to help refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	But many Democrats agreed to support it, hoping to find more  
money for critical programs and to delete the abortion restriction 
during House-Senate negotiations on the fiscal 2000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed a $12.7 billion foreign aid bill last month  
without the abortion language. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting 228-200, the House first passed a now-familiar amendment  
sponsored by Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J. It would ban aid to any group 
lobbying for changes in abortion laws even if the group uses 
privately raised funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, lawmakers approved, 221-208, a measure echoing claims that  
family planning reduces abortions. It would require groups 
receiving aid to certify that they will use funds to reduce the 
incidence of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith described it as a deceitful attempt to lure away foes of  
abortion from his hard-line position against any U.S. funding 
helping abortionists. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., predicted that Smith's more restrictive  
language would be taken out in negotiations to avoid a presidential 
veto. But Smith said he has guarantees from Republican leaders that 
no payment of overdue U.N. assessments will be funded if the 
anti-abortion language is removed. 
</P>
<P>
	The abortion debate obscured deep concerns over spending levels  
in the bill, which is $1.9 billion below Clinton's request, $715 
million below last year's bill and $20.7 billion below this year's 
actual spending on aid, including emergency appropriatons. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., who chairs the foreign operations  
appropriations subcommittee that crafted the bill, said it could be 
the biggest percentage cut from actual spending of any budget bill 
in history. 
</P>
<P>
	A Clinton administration statement said senior advisers would  
recommend a veto if foreign operations funding is not increased 
above both bills' appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Funding at this level would seriously impair the president's  
ability to conduct an effective foreign policy,'' the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the bill would cut funding to international lending  
institutions by $493 million from amounts needed to meet U.S. 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	Major provisions of the foreign operations bill include:  
</P>
<P>
	--$2.88 billion for Israel, representing a $120 million reduction  
in economic and a $60 million increase in military aid. 
</P>
<P>
	--$2 billion for Egypt, a $40 million reduction in economic aid  
but no change in military aid. 
</P>
<P>
	--$725 million for former Soviet states, $307 million below  
Clinton's request. It would withhold 50 percent of aid to Russia 
unless it ends missile cooperation with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	--$680 million for child survival programs.  
</P>
<P>
	--$410 million for family planning activities, including $25  
million for the United Nations Population Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	--$240 million for the Peace Corps, equal to this year's level  
but $30 million below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	--$285 million for international narcotics control.  
</P>
<P>
	--$181.6 million to combat terrorism and the spread of nuclear  
weapons and for removal of landmines.

<HEADLINE> FTC Wants Online Pharmacies Watched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission wants Congress to  
make Internet pharmacies to disclose information about the 
businesses selling the drugs and the doctors prescribing them 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	As consumers increasingly enjoy the cost-savings and convenience  
of buying medicine over the Internet, authorities have been 
frustrated in their attempts to enforce laws because many Web sites 
do contain adequate identifying information, according to the FTC. 
</P>
<P>
	``State authorities appear to have laws that are substantively  
adequate to stop irresponsible prescribing and dispensing of drugs 
via the Internet,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's 
Bureau of Consumer Protection. ``The real challenge lies in dealing 
with the logistical difficulties of identifying responsible parties 
and enforcing laws across states boundaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berstein was to testify Friday before the House Commerce  
subcommittee on oversight and investigations about the need for new 
laws covering Internet pharmacies. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC says the sites should contain the name, address and  
phone number of the pharmacy that will dispense the drugs and where 
that pharmacy is licensed to do business. Similar information also 
should be provided about physicians who prescribe drugs over the 
Internet, as well as the states where that physician is licensed or 
authorized to practice medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	There should also be information about any Internet operator --  
separate from the doctor or pharmacy -- who is offering the drugs 
for sale, including the principal owners of the business. 
</P>
<P>
	The site should tell consumers the states from which it will  
accept orders. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission says such disclosures are needed because of the  
new challenges posed by Internet pharmacies. For example, a 
consumer might go to a Web site and have an online consultation 
with an unknown doctor who then prescribes drugs for the pharmacy 
to dispense. 
</P>
<P>
	Prescriptions could be issued without adequate review of a  
patient's medical history, posing serious health threats, Bernstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is illegal for doctors to prescribe for patients in a state  
where they are not licensed to practice. Licensed doctors also must 
meet standards of care that in most states require a patient 
relationship to prescribe drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But authorities cannot monitor compliance with these laws if the  
state in which the Internet doctor is licensed or prescribing from 
is unknown, Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some online pharmacies stress they operate with the same  
standards as a traditional pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers at drugstore.com must already have prescriptions from  
their doctors, which must be either mailed or faxed to the store, 
said Peter Neupert, the company's president and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must be careful to distinguish between safe, legitimate  
online pharmacies and profiteers using the Internet to engage in 
illegal activities with willing participants,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the company has applied for approval from an  
online certification program established by the National 
Association of Boards of Pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also suggested that Congress consider other  
measures to aid enforcement, such as granting states the authority 
to bring actions in federal court.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil Gives Truckers Ultimatum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's truckers agreed Thursday  
to end a four-day strike that had paralyzed the country after the 
government promised to suspend a planned hike in road tolls, the 
Transportation Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also pledged to step up security on Brazil's  
roads, among other things, according to a ministry statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike, involving thousands of truckers, caused severe food  
and gas shortages across Brazil, which is heavily dependent on 
trucks to transport about 60 percent of its cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	Productions lines shut down and there were severe reductions in  
exports moving through the main port at Santos in the southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, the truckers agreed to unblock major  
highways. The government applauded that decision but warned that 
the strike had to end soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation, which has seriously affected the daily lives  
of all Brazilians, must come to an end today,'' said presidential 
aide Aluysio Nunes Ferreira. 
</P>
<P>
	More than five hours of negotiations Wednesday between the  
strike's leader and the government failed to produce results. 
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso then authorized the use of 
armed forces to open blocked roads. 
</P>
<P>
	There were minor clashes with riot police in Sao Paulo on  
Wednesday. But when asked to free the roads, the truckers complied 
peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the strike may represent the most serious  
challenge to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's authority since 
he took office in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike could not have come at a worse time for Cardoso,  
whose popularity has dipped to its lowest levels ever in recent 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is obvious some political forces are using the legitimate  
grievances of the truckers ... to dash his party's chances in the 
next presidential elections,'' said Alexandre Barros, head of the 
political consulting firm Early Warning.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Contraception Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new emergency contraceptive that works with  
less nausea and vomiting than earlier ``morning-after'' drugs has 
received marketing approval from the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The new treatment, to be marketed under the brand name Plan B,  
consists of two tablets of levonorgestrel, a synthetic hormone that 
prevents conception by blocking ovulation or fertilization. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Cruzan, an FDA spokeswoman, said Thursday that studies  
suggest Plan B is as effective as the current product on the 
market, but has less severe side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``morning-after'' contraceptive technique approved earlier by  
the FDA involves the selective use of pills normally used for 
monthly contraceptive protection. 
</P>
<P>
	A kit containing only the required pills, and sold under the  
brand name PREVEN, is now on the market. It follows what is called 
the Yuzpe regimen, which uses four hormone pills, including 
levonorgestrel, and must be started within 72 hours after 
unprotected sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies sponsored by the World Health Organization in 15  
countries and involving about 3,000 women showed that 
levonorgestrel used by itself is also an effective emergency 
contraceptive and causes less nausea and vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
	The studies showed the use of Plan B reduces the risk of  
pregnancy from a single act of unprotected sex from about 8 percent 
to 1 percent. The drug will not terminate an existing pregnancy. 
The first pill has to be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex 
and the second pill is taken 12 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to nausea and vomiting, Plan B can, in some  
patients, cause abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, changes in 
menstrual bleeding, dizziness and breast tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
	Plan B will be distributed in the United States by the Women's  
Capital Corp. and initially will be available by prescription 
through Planned Parenthood Clinics. Pharmacists in Washington state 
also will have access to the drug during its initial distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	A WCC announcement said that Plan B will be available in markets  
nationwide late in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	WCC is a privately held company that was organized to bring Plan  
B to U.S. and Canadian markets. Financing for development of Plan B 
has come from several U.S. Charitable foundations, along with five 
Planned Parenthood affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	Information about Plan B is available through a 24-hour phone  
line: 888-NOT-2-LATE. An emergency contraception web site can be 
addressed at www.go2planb.com.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Opens Fire in Atlanta Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A gunman opened fire in an office building  
Thursday, wounding 12 -- seven critically. Police hunted for the 
gunman and said he may have fled to the roof of a building across 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman John Quigley said there were multiple shooting  
victims, but he could not say how many. Grady Memorial Hospital 
said it was treating seven victims, four in critical condition with 
gunshot wounds. Northside Hospital said it had two people, both 
critical. St. Joseph's had two people in critical. Another facility 
listed a victim in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	At least seven ambulances were sent to the scene.  
</P>
<P>
	The gunfire was reported about 3 p.m. in Two Security Center,  
which houses a travel agency, a brokerage and other offices. It is 
in the wealthy and fashionable Buckhead section in northern 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Some witnesses told WSB-TV the shootings were at All-Tech  
Investment Group, a day-trading company on the third floor of the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Carter, who works for Allegiance Telecom on the third  
floor, said that as police escorted him out, he saw a man's body 
lying on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They weren't attending to him, which led me to believe he was  
dead,'' Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Belazi, who also works on the third floor of the building,  
said police told him a man walked into the building's leasing 
office on that floor and shot someone. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got us out of there,'' he said. ``We saw a bunch of blood  
in the leasing office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of police officers swarmed the building, apparently in an  
attempt to find the gunman.Quigley said the gunman, described as 6 
feet 4 and white with a receding hairline, may have fled to another 
office building. 
</P>
<P>
	Office workers were asked to stay inside Two Security Center,  
but some were later escorted outside in small groups. 
</P>
<P>
	About two hours after the shooting there were apparently still  
people inside the building. Police rounded up witnesses and were 
going to bus them out of the area to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman interviewed by WSB radio said she saw at least seven  
stretchers come out. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's only been one person that appeared to be seriously  
injured and they were doing CPR on them,'' said the witness, 
identified only as Beth. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Coinard, who was locked inside her office with three  
other women, told WSB-TV that police called to tell them to keep 
their doors locked. ``I'm just scared and would like to get out of 
here,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some witnesses told WSB-TV the shootings were at All-Tech  
Investment Group, a day-trading company on the third floor of the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	Day trading is the practice of buying and selling stocks, bonds  
or other securities at a moment-to-moment basis rather than holding 
them for a long-term. 
</P>
<P>
	All-Tech Investment Group is a day trading firm based in  
Montvale, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the company agreed to pay $278,000 to the Massachusettes  
Investor Protection Fund and investors to settle claims that it 
used deceptive advertising and made unauthorized transfers of 
customers' funds. 
</P>
<P>
	About two hours after the shooting there were apparently still  
people inside the building. Police rounded up witnesses and were 
going to bus them out of the area to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last month a psychiatrist in Michigan was killed by his  
former patient, who also gunned down a 45-year-old woman and 
injured four other people in the attack. He then fatally shot 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, a 71-year-old man raked the first floor of the Mormon  
Family History Library in Salt Lake City with .22-caliber handgun 
fire, killing two people and wounding four others before police 
shot him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	The library shooting came just more than three months after a  
24-year-old man allegedly walked into a downtown Salt Lake office 
building with a grocery sack of bullets and opened fire. One person 
died and another suffered minor gunshot wounds in the Jan. 14 
shooting.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Extradition of Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A liquor store owner accused in the 1975 slaying  
of a Dominican journalist can be extradited to the Dominican 
Republic to face the murder charge, a judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision last week by U.S. District Judge Alvin K.  
Hellerstein, announced Wednesday, should allow Dominican officials 
to take custody of Mariano Cabrera Duran, a sergeant in the 
country's air force at the time of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. marshals arrested Duran in November at the request of  
Dominican officials, who maintain he has admitted shooting 
journalist Orlando Martinez on March 17, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, director of the magazine Ahora and a writer for the  
newspaper El Nacional, was a critic of President Joaquin Balaguer, 
whose administration was attacked for human rights abuses and 
political killings. Balaguer left office under international 
pressure in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Government court papers allege Duran shot Martinez as he left  
work during an assault by a group of civilians and military 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominican officials say Duran told investigators at the time he  
had been ordered to arrest Martinez, but shot when the journalist 
brandished a revolver. 
</P>
<P>
	Duran emigrated to the United States in 1983. The case  
languished until President Leonel Fernandez ordered it moved to 
trial in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominican police have since arrested the former chief of the  
country's air force, two former generals and two other officers in 
connection with the slaying. More than 100 witnesses have been 
subpoenaed, including Balaguer.

<HEADLINE>  Hasek To Retire After Next Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Dominik Hasek, the five-time  
choice as the NHL's best goalie, will retire after next season so 
he can raise his children in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have decided that the upcoming season will be my last,'' the  
Buffalo Sabres' star said today at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old native Czech won the NHL's most valuable player  
award in 1997 and 1998, helped the Sabres reach the Stanley Cup 
finals this year and led the Czech Republic to Olympic gold in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dominator had another reason for quitting: He hates the  
limelight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attention I've received is overwhelming,'' he said. ``It's  
something I don't enjoy at all. It's time to step back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek said his family wanted to move back to the Czech Republic  
after hockey. He and his wife, Alena, have a 9-year-old son, 
Michael, and 4-year-old daughter, Dominika. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want our kids to go back to Czech Republic and share in our  
families' backgrounds and culture,'' Hasek said. ``I can see every 
year it's more and more difficult, especially for my son, to adapt 
to the Czech life. Every year he has more problems to speak Czech. 
This is one of the reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer we stay in the United States, the harder it will be  
for our kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was making the announcement now to head off rumors  
about retirement during the season and ``minimize the distraction 
for my teammates, for me and the Buffalo Sabres organization so we 
can concentrate only on hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to have lots of fun with my teammates.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hasek said he still had hopes for bringing the Stanley Cup to  
Buffalo, saying he wanted to win the last game of next season. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would like to stay connected with the Sabres in  
some fashion after retirement and will remain active with Buffalo's 
Variety Club, an organization that takes care of children from poor 
families and pays for their hockey training. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite struggling much of last season with a groin injury.  
Hasek helped the Sabres reach the Stanley Cup finals, losing to 
Dallas in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, known for flopping to the ice to block shots and even  
releasing his stick and grabbing for the puck with two hands, was 
paid $7 million last season. Only Patrick Roy of the Colorado 
Avalanche, who made $7.5 million, had a higher salary among 
goalies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has two years remaining on his contract, $7 million for  
the upcoming season and $7.5 million for 2000-01, and the club 
holds an option at $9 million for the following season. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he first started thinking about retirement nine months  
ago and had a meeting with Sabres' management about it in November. 
He and his wife made the final decision to quit just before the 
playoffs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of his NHL accolades, however, Hasek's career highlight  
came not in the playoffs but in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo acquired Hasek in 1992 in a trade from Chicago, where he  
was a backup to Ed Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour was in goal for Dallas when the Stars beat the Sabres on  
a controversial triple-overtime goal by Brett Hull in Game 6. 
Hull's skate was in the crease, but the goal was allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek played for the Czech club HC Pardubice during the 1980s  
and went to the NHL in January 1990 after the fall of the Iron 
Curtain. It took him three years to make his big breakthrough, and 
his years as a backup left him contemplating a return to Europe 
rather than sit on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	He won his first Vezina Trophy as the NHL's best goalie in 1994  
with Buffalo -- at the age of 29, rather late even for a goalie. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Stanley Cup, the other big prize missing from his  
career is a world championship trophy, much valued in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek is one of the few top Czech athletes with a university  
degree -- he studied teaching, specializing in history and the Czech 
language.

<HEADLINE> Autopsy May Reveal Texas Hate Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EMORY, Texas (AP) -- Civil rights activists say evidence  
indicates that a black man killed this spring was tied to a tree 
and burned, and federal prosecutors are investigating the slaying 
as a possible hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	State authorities determined that the killing of H.W. Walker,  
53, was a drug deal gone bad and had nothing to do with race. 
</P>
<P>
	But the NAACP and other groups say the suspect in custody  
appears to have been affiliated with a local hate group. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Mike Bradford said his investigators have received  
enough new information to ``decide if there is another motivation 
for this murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker disappeared in early May, and his decomposed body was  
found June 2 in remote woods 50 miles east of Dallas. The results 
of an autopsy were pending. 
</P>
<P>
	A 16-year-old white boy has been in custody in connection with  
the slaying since the day after Walker's remains were discovered. 
The boy's attorney declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Local authorities have not revealed the circumstances  
surrounding Walker's death. However, state authorities said 
Thursday that an investigation by the Texas Rangers found no 
evidence of a hate crime although Walker's body was badly burned. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing appears to have been ``a drug deal gone bad,'' said  
Tela Mange, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Safety, 
which oversees the Rangers. ``The evidence at this point doesn't 
indicate that race had anything to do with the killing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's sister, Daisy Walker Robinson, disputed the allegation  
and said her brother was not a drug user. 
</P>
<P>
	She appeared at a news conference with officials from the  
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and 
other civil rights activists who said wire fragments around 
Walker's body indicate he was tied to the tree before being burned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here today because we need some answers and we want  
justice,'' Ms. Robinson said. ``No human being is supposed to be 
burned and chained the way he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Alcorn, former president of the NAACP chapter in Dallas,  
said the activists' investigation found that the suspect was 
affiliated with a loosely formed hate group in the area known as 
the Day Walkers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Glenn of the NAACP in Greenville, where Walker was from,  
said he believes more than one person killed Walker because he was 
a big man and the suspect is relatively small.

<HEADLINE> Brooking Compared to Bennett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- When Keith Brooking lets a runner slip  
from his grasp, people will moan, ``Cornelius would have made that 
tackle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Brooking is beaten on a pass play, people will mutter,  
``I'll bet that wouldn't have happened to Bennett.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Let the inevitable comparisons begin.  
</P>
<P>
	Brooking, a second-year linebacker, is not just moving into the  
starting lineup for the NFC champion Atlanta Falcons. He's filling 
the spot occupied the last three years by Cornelius Bennett, the 
team's leading tackler on the way to the Super Bowl and one of the 
game's best defensive players over the past decade.

	``No doubt, there will be comparisons with Cornelius,''  
defensive end Lester Archambeau said Thursday. ``But I worked out 
with Keith during the whole offseason and, let me tell you, he's 
one intense dude. He likes competition. I think he'll take this 
challenge by the teeth.'' 
</P>

	Brooking, the Falcons' No. 1 pick in 1998, spent his rookie  
season apprenticing under Bennett. Now, the 23-year-old who grew up 
in the Atlanta suburbs and starred at Georgia Tech will get a 
chance to play a full-time role for his hometown NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I have the ability to play at this level,'' said  
Brooking, handed the starting job when Bennett was released. 
``Obviously, Cornelius was a great player. But there's no pressure 
on me to replace him. I'll just take what I learned from him last 
year and try to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooking wasted no time getting to work. Prior to the first  
practice of training camp, he strolled around the Furman University 
campus with two playbooks stuffed under his arm. He's also grown a 
goatee, adding a tinge of menace to his boyish face. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's got to get accustomed to prying himself loose from NFL  
blockers who are a lot more devious at hiding the tricks of the 
trade than their college counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The offensive linemen hold so much and they're able to get  
away with it,'' Brooking said, a bit of frustration in his voice. 
``They don't call it near as much as they did when I was in 
college. I've got to learn to get separation from those guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For one season, Brooking got a chance to learn from one of the  
best. Bennett led the Falcons with 121 tackles and was a prime 
reason the team had the second-best rushing defense in the NFL and 
ranked eighth overall in yards allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of weeks after the Super Bowl, Bennett was cut by the  
Falcons in a move that was more about age (soon-to-be-34) and cost 
(a cap figure of $3.7 million) than performance. He now plays for 
the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooking, who had 32 tackles during his rookie season, heard of  
Bennett's release during a trip to California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, my opportunity to start is better with him gone.  
But I'm not happy he's gone,'' Brooking said. ``I guess that's the 
nature of the business. It's going to happen to me one day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Safety Eugene Robinson, the eldest member of the Falcons  
defense, observes plenty of similarities between Brooking and 
Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of them are extremely fast. Both of them can cover a lot  
of ground,'' Robinson said. ``What I like about Brooks is he will 
flat-out fight you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He remembered a game last season in which Brooking took a robust  
blow to the face from an offensive guard. With blood trickling from 
his lip, the linebacker wasted no time extracting revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the next play, he smacked the guy right in the face and  
stared him down,'' Robinson said with admiration. ``You want a 
linebacker like that, a guy who is willing to eat nails.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Bennett is gone, Brooking still has a grizzled veteran  
he can rely on for advice. Jessie Tuggle, who's been starting at 
middle linebacker for the Falcons since 1989, is willing to pass on 
his wisdom to the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows exactly what he's supposed to do and he's eager to  
learn,'' Tuggle said. ``Unlike college, you can't just relay on 
your natural ability. You've got to prepare yourself mentally and 
physically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Let the inevitable learning begin.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big challenge for me,'' Brooking said. ``I've been  
stepping up to challenges my whole life. Hopefully, I can step up 
to this one.''
