<HEADLINE> Manila Ready to Expand All Round Ties with Pakistan: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Philippine President
Fidel Ramos said today that his country is ready to expand all
round ties with Pakistan, particularly in trade and commerce.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference this evening, Ramos said that
during his stay here, he held extensive talks with the Pakistani
leaders and business officials, and he was confident about the
future economic cooperation between the Philippines and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to take steps to expand our ties in trade,
investment, energy, including nuclear energy, agriculture,
industry, human resources development and defense cooperation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos noted the Foreign Ministers of the two countries have
signed a memorandum of understanding to hold annual bilateral
policy consultations and an agreement on the peaceful use of
atomic energy.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine president said that his country supports
Pakistan's efforts for closer ties with the Association of
Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN), particularly in terms of economic
and functional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The linkages between ASEAN and the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation could be explored for mutual benefits, he
added.
</P>
<P>
When answering a question, he said that the Philippines
"remains neutral on the Kashmir issue" and hoped "negotiation, not
fighting, will be a solution between Pakistan and India on the
Kashmir issue."
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is encouraged by the efforts taken by Pakistan
and India recently in a bid to improve bilateral relations, said
Ramos.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his appreciation for the new political
development in Pakistan and measures for opening up, privatization
and deregulation taken by the government of Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif to improve the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Answering another question, Ramos reiterated that "one-China
policy" pursued by the Philippine government remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Ramos arrived here Friday on a three-day official visit to
Pakistan. He is the second head of state of the Philippines to
visit this south Asian nation in the last four decades.

<HEADLINE> Morocco Condemns Murder of Little Loubna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RABAT, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Morocco today condemned the
abduction and murder of Loubna Benaissa, a nine-year-old Moroccan
girl who disappeared in August 1992 and whose corpse was found
Wednesday in the cave of an auto service station in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Her kidnapper, Patrick Derochette, had admitted kidnapping,
raping and killing Loubna.
</P>
<P>
Moroccan Minister of Communication and government spokesman
Driss Alaoui M'Daghri read a declaration condemning the "odious
crime and savage and inhuman act."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed sympathy for all the other Belgian children
who were killed by pedophiles in a similar way.
</P>
<P>
Belgium was again shaken this week by the discovery of the
murder of Loubna, which followed the discovery of the Dutroux case
last year, in which four children were abducted and two of them
died of abuse by pedophile Marc Dutroux.
</P>
<P>
A huge funeral for Loubna was held today in the Belgian capital
at the Grand Mosque of Brussels, which was attended by 20,000
people, according to reports from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
All the people attending the funeral expressed their anger at
the crime as well as at the incompetence of police and judicial
authorities over pedophiles.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian government has promised to take appropriate
measures to fight pedophile criminals.
</P>
<P>
The remains of Loubna will be flown back to Tanger, the city
from which her parents immigrated to Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Arab Labor Conference Ends in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The 24th Arab Labor Conference wound
up here today with the issue of a statement calling for a just and
comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued at the final session denounced the Israeli
settlement policies in the occupied Arab territories, especially
the measures to change the features of Jerusalem and cripple the
performance of Palestinian institutions in the city.
</P>
<P>
It urged Israel to implement U.N. Security Council
resolutions 242, 338 and 425 which call for halting settlement
activity and dismantling existing settlements which constitute a
violation of international agreements and a threat to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the conference called upon the United States and
Russia, co-sponsors of the peace process, to press Israel to
commit to the peace agreements signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
While calling on the U.N. to pressure on Israel to lift the
siege on East Jerusalem and halt digging operations threatening
the Al Aqsa mosque and other sacred places, the conference said
Palestinian bodies need assistance to promote their economic
capabilities to face up to Israeli practices.
</P>
<P>
The conference also expressed support for the Syrian and
Lebanese peoples in their struggle against Israeli authorities in
the occupied Golan Heights and south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It decided to form a committee comprising a number of ministers
of labor and the director-general of the Arab Labor Organization
(ALO) to visit south Lebanon and get acquainted with the economic
losses due to continued Israeli raids.
</P>
<P>
The conference decided to add the issue of economic reform
programs and labor issues on the agenda of upcoming sessions and
decrease the negative social impact caused by economic reform
programs. It also approved the ALO's 1997 budget of 3.5 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Arab ministers of labor and social affairs attended the
week-long conference, which opened here on March 1 aimed at
mapping out a common strategy to tap Arab labor resources.
</P>
<P>
World Bank sources estimate Arab labor force reached around 80
million with an unemployment rate of 14 percent. The Arab
gross domestic product exceeded 502 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Tajik Government, Opposition Sign Military Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Tajik government and opposition
Islamist rebels signed a military protocol here today aimed at
merging the rebels' armed units with government troops.
</P>
<P>
The accord signals some progress towards a possible peace
agreement between the two sides who have been fighting a civil war
for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Tajik Foreign Minister Talbek Nazarov and Akbar Turajonzadeh,
the number two in the opposition leadership, signed the agreement
which defines ways to integrate the opposition's armed forces into
the country's regular army, and to make changes to the
government's departments.
</P>
<P>
The reintegration of the rebels' forces will be carried out in
four stages over the next 16 months, Turajonzadeh told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said that the
signing of the agreement "paves the way for a comprehensive,
thorough, and unconditionally peaceful settlement in Tajikistan."
</P>
<P>
The two sides still have to reach a separate protocol providing
guarantees on the implementation of the accord, and agree on the
make-up of a reconciliation commission to act as an interim
post-war government, in line with the peace deal signed last
December.
</P>
<P>
The accord came during the latest round of Russian-brokered
peace talks which opened in Moscow in February.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic opposition suspended peace talks with the
government on Monday, after one opposition member was killed and
five others were seized in the Tajik capital Dushanbe, Interfax
reported. But they restarted on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The talks are aimed at working out military arrangements to
support a U.N.-sponsored peace accord signed last December.
</P>
<P>
The next round of talks is scheduled to be held in Tehran,
Iran, in April.

<P>
BRUSSELS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Around 20,000 people have turned
out in Brussels this morning for the funeral of a girl aged nine,
the fifth child found dead in Belgium in six months.
</P>
<P>
The service at the Brussels Islamic Center was broadcast live
on TV.
</P>
<P>
Loubna Benaissa disappeared while on a shopping errand in
August 1992. Her body was discovered last week in a metal trunk
hidden among car parts in the basement of a Brussels petrol
station.
</P>
<P>
The place was less than 300 yards from her home at the property
of a convicted paedophile, Patrick Derochette, whose father owned
the petrol station. Loubna would have passed the building on her
way to a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
The police have been accused of being less assiduous than they
should have been in searching for Loubna, whose family were
Moroccan immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Belgium has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal since last
August after the discovery of two girls in a dungeon at a home of
rapist Marc Dutroux. Four girls' bodies were later found.

outlined the achievements made since International Women's Day
celebrations last year.
</P>
<P>
The theme for the celebrations in Zimbabwe is "Let Us Share
Responsibilities, Power and Resources".
</P>
<P>
Lesabe said the challenge in Zimbabwe is to improve the access
of women to credit, market and land.

<HEADLINE> British Conservative MP Defects to Referendum Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling Conservative
Party's MP Sir George Gardiner has decided to resign as the
Conservative whip and join the country's Referendum Party,
according to a BBC television report.
</P>
<P>
The Referendum Party, which wants to have a national referendum
on Britain's position in Europe, announced this afternoon that
George Gardiner had quit the Conservatives and would represent the
Referendum Party in parliament until the general election due to
be held in May.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Glasgow, Referendum Party
leader Sir James Goldsmith said, "Sir George's move showed country
must come before party."
</P>
<P>
Gardiner was quoted as saying today that he was "sick to death"
of equivocation over Europe and the single currency but his
decision to leave the Conservative Party did not mean he would
"cross the floor" to the Labor ranks.
</P>
<P>
"I am not interested in joining with Labor in humiliating the
government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the Conservative Central Office said that the party
was "relaxed" over Gardiner's decision, the latest defection would
put Prime Minister John Major's government in a minority of two in
the House of Commons, inflicting another fatal blow to the
embattled Conservatives.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Albania's rebels ransacked the
government's main army base in the southern town of Gjirokaster
today, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels seized thousands of arms, such assault rifles and
grenades, from the army base in Gjirokaster, some 30 kilometers
from the Greek border, and then left there firing their new
weapons in the air, said the reports quoting witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Rebels, blaming President Sali Berisha for the collapse of five
popular investment schemes in January, seized towns across the
south last week in a popular uprising against the president. Many
Albanian lost their savings from the schmes.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
today stepped up its efforts to end the seven-week crisis in
Albania by sending a delegation to the country.
</P>
<P>
Head of the delegation, former Austrian Chancellor
Franz Vranitzky, held separate talks today with Albanian
opposition leaders and Albanian President Sali Berisha who is
facing open rebellion in the country sparked by the collapse of
fraudulent pyramid investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people lost their life savings and started
protesting to demand their money back. Two weeks ago, the protests
turned violent and the government declared a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
OSCE officials were quoted as saying here that President
Berisha has agreed to call early elections within 45 days if the
opposition, who took several towns in the south, lay down their
arms.
</P>
<P>
The general elections were held in Albania in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government and the opposition Thursday reached an
agreement for a 48-hour halt to military operations in the south
starting from Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the anti-government protesters, have turned down Berisha's
offer of an amnesty if they turn in their weapons during the
two-day suspension. They are demanding that Berisha resign.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE's mission is the latest in a series of European
attempts to calm the crisis. The Council of Europe and the
European Union have also sent envoys to the country.
</P>
<P>
Both delegations called on President Berisha and opposition
leaders to work out a peaceful solution to the crisis.

HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese opposition party have
criticised the decision by the Sudanese government to put on
trial 10 of their top leaders, saying the move is meant to
misinform the international community, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe based southern Africa representative of the Sudan
People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), Barnarba Benjamin said in a
statement today the move was both "ludicrous and preposterous to

The Sudanese government announced recently that it was
considering the possibility of trying 10 opposition leaders who
include Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) commander-in-chief
John Garang on treason charges.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA, based in southern Sudan, has fought against the
Sudanese government since 1983 and claims that it has taken
control of most of the southern part of Sudan and is now
advancing into the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "it is imperative that the idea of the trial
for the opposition leaders must be condemned in its entirety and
dismissed with the contempt it deserves."

HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- France, which has so far been one

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Regional Forum Meeting Ends in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) --The Inter-sessional Support Group
on confidence-building measures of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)
concluded successfully in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Chen Jian and the Philippine
Deputy Foreign Minister Severino presided over the meeting, which
was attended by diplomatic and defence officials of 21 ARF members.
</P>
<P>
ARF is a governmental forum focusing on politics and security
whose first session was held in Bangkok, Thailand in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
It has made great progress in increasing mutual understanding
and trust and in improving regional peace and stability, providing
a major channel for dialogue and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific
Region.
</P>
<P>
China has placed importance to this three-day meeting because
it's the first on multilateral dialogue and cooperation hosted by
China.
</P>
<P>
The participants discussed the regional security environment,
the sense of security, confidence-building measures and
cooperation in the region, national defence policies, military
factories being converted to civilian use, and confidence-building
in non-military areas.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that Asia has ushered in a period of
peace, and all Asian countries have taken economic development as
their central task. Rapid economic development has provided a
solid foundation for political stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
A solid security network has been formed among countries of the
region through increasingly expanded economic and trade
cooperation, and improving regional security by means of
consultations and cooperation has become a trend.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that, in view of the diversity of the
region, regional security should be safeguarded on the basis of
the UN Charter, the five principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and
provisions of the Southeast Asian treaty on friendly cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China has always placed great importance to and actively
participated in the ARF process and has had sound dialogues and
cooperation with ARF members, according to Chinese Foreign
Ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
The success of the Beijing meeting will have a useful effect on
the forum's efforts to build trust and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion worked out by the Forum's co-chairmen will be
submitted to the ARF senior officials meeting to be held in
Malaysia in May.

<HEADLINE> French PM Urges Women More Into Political Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
today called for more participation by women in France's political
life, saying that the French society will run better if women play
a bigger role in it.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar entitled "Women in Motion" organized by some
women's groups in Paris, Juppe said that all remains to be done to
give women more places in the political life and to give them more
means to participate.
</P>
<P>
He said that to promote the social status of women is "one of
the essential preoccupations of the government."
</P>
<P>
The French government will start next week a parliamentary
debate on proportional representation by women in parliament, in
order to raise their 5.3 percent representation rate in the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The French Socialist Party has decided to let 30 percent of its
candidates run in the next general elections in 1998 to be women.
</P>
<P>
In France, 10 percent of the ministerial seats, 5.6 percent of
the seats of general councillors and 12.3 percent of those of
regional councillors are taken by women, while only one president
of regional council -- that of Nord-Pas-Calais -- and one mayor of
big cities -- that of Strasbourg -- are women.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Government Vows to Support Women in Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The government of Tanzania
today vowed to support women in ensuring equal land ownership
between men and women in the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a public rally in the capital today during the
national level celebrations to mark International Women's Day,
Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye said government laws and policies
provide for equal land ownership by all citizens irrespective of
their gender.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sumaye admitted the existence of sections in both
the land act and the draft land bill scheduled to be tabled in
the parliament next month, which empowers the customary legal
bodies to decide on matters related to land ownership.
</P>
<P>
At present, most of the customary laws in the country are
discriminative against women in land ownership. The land,
according to the traditional beliefs and practices, belong to man
while women and girls are not allowed to inherit land.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed that the land issue is sensitive
and cannot be solved over night nor can the government over rule
the customary laws which have been in existence since time in
memorial.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing here is to sensitize the men and women of
the land ownership problem, and let them know that some of these
beliefs are outdated and retards both individual and national
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said the government has no objection in land ownership
by women, citing many women particularly in the urban areas who
have acquired building plots, and pledging government support
whereever possible.
</P>
<P>
He also noted, there is a law which bans married men from
selling family land without the concert of their wives.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Sumaye said the government will continue to
collaborate with various women groups to sensitize the public on
the need to change their attitude and acts oppressive to women.
</P>
<P>
The government will not tolerate any acts of abuse to women
and children, including rape, child sexual abuse and defilement,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Some ministers, members of parliament, high-ranking government
officials and diplomats, joining hands with more than ten
thousands of women from all districts in the Dar es Salaam
region, participated the celebrations.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Attack Guerrillas in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes launched this
afternoon an air strike at suspected guerrilla targets of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery also bombarded a number of villages,
security sources said, adding that one civilian was slightly
injured in the bombardment at Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of
Apple, a height some 60 kilometers southeast of Lebanese capital
Beirut, which is ofter used by Hezbollah guerrillas as a
springboard for attacking Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
Najwa Hussein Khafaja, a 21-year-old woman at Jibaa,
Nabatiyeh, was wounded in the hands when the town was hit by
Israeli shells. The attack broke a relative calm which had
shrouded the area for five days.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Jibaa, the Israeli occupation forces in the
so-called "security zone" also fired artilleries at Kfar Melki,
Jarjoua, Bouswar, Ein Qana and Musallif in Iglim Al-Toffah at
3:30 p.m. (13:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
More than 60 shells were fired at the area in the
bombardment, according to the security sources.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jet fighters launched two consecutive air raids near
4:00 p.m. (14:00 GMT) at Wadi Kafra on the heights and fired
four air-to-surface missiles at the targets.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas announced that they responded to the
Israeli aggressions by bombarding an Israeli position at Rihan
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, also
said that its fighters carried out earlier this morning an
attack at the Israeli position of Zamrya with machine guns and
rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
Radio of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia
confirmed the dawn attack, but said no casualties were caused.
</P>
<P>
As a result of today's Israeli bombardment, the Lebanese
security sources accused the Jewish state of violating a
cease-fire understanding between Lebanon and Israel signed last
April which barres fighting sides from targeting civilians in
their military operations.
</P>
<P>
Armed frictions and bombardments constitute a daily scene on
the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict, where
Hezbollah spearheads a guerrilla warfare in order to oust the
Israeli occupation forces from the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in 1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> EU President Supports Turkey for EU Admission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Current President of the European
Union (EU) Van Mierlo said today that Turkey has spared no
efforts in obtaining admission into the EU and he is the
supporter of Turkey for this goal.
</P>
<P>
Mierlo, also Dutch Foreign Minister, made the remarks
following his two-hour-odd talks with Turkish Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller on Turkey's EU bid in
Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said that many European politicians defend the same views
on Turkey's EU bid and only a minority of the politicians share
different views.
</P>
<P>
Mierlo arrived in Istanbul Friday for a special visit to
Turkey to exchange views on Turkey's EU bid with Ciller
following his trips to Greece and Albania.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Ciller expressed her gratitude to Mierlo for
his support for Turkey to be included in the EU's expansion
plans.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the leaders of Christian Democrat parties, that
form the center-right European People's Party (EPP), was held in
Brussels Tuesday and reached a consensus that "Turkey is not a
candidate to become an EU member, short-term or long," reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Ciller and other high-ranking Turkish officials have lodged
Turkey's strong complaints over the stance of the European
politicians in several occasions.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Friday by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said
that Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi had a telephone
conversation with Ciller, saying that he was not in agreement with
all the views of other European Christian Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Prodi and Ciller had also discussed
the course that would be followed henceforth in the Turkish-EU
ties.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, an associate member of the EU, has long been
struggling for admission into the EU, but no breakthrough has
been achieved so far due to human rights and Kurdish issues in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Condemns US Veto of UN Resolution on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today condemned the U.S. veto of
the U.N. Security Council's resolution calling on Israel to
abandon building Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that the U.S. veto was "a completely wrong
decision" after talks with Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti in Gaza this afternoon,
</P>
<P>
Following a Security Council debate, in which nearly all 50
speakers condemned Israel for building settlement at Har Homa,
U.S. Friday vetoed the resolution, as all the other 14 Security
Council members voted in favor.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti, who arrived in the Gaza Strip this morning, called
for a new U.S. effort to prove the veto does not mean some kind
of backtracking from the original U.S. position.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti was accompanied by six Jordanian ministers for a
meeting of the Jordanian-Palestinian Higher Committee, which is
aimed at improving the economic situation in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Later today, Arafat is due to return with the Jordanian
delegation to Amman, capital of Jordan, where he will meet King
Hussein on the development of situation regarding the Israeli
settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that he would hold consultations with Hussein on
the Israeli government's decision to hand-over 9 percent more of
the West Bank to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
He called the decision "a trick and a conspiracy," stressing
that the Oslo peace accords call for the transfer of 30 percent
of the West Bank territories to the Palestinian self-rule
government.
</P>
<P>
In the earlier hours of Friday morning, the Israeli cabinet,
after seven hours of discussion, approved the 9 percent pullback
plan as the first phase of the further Israeli army redeployments
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the January Hebron Agreement between Israel and
the PNA, all of the three phases of the further redeployments
should be completed in mid-1998.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Confident on Return of Axum Obelisk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Vice-minister of
Foreign Affairs Tekeda Alemu today expressed confidence on the
implementation of the recently concluded agreement between
Ethiopia and Italy on the return of the historical relic Axum
Obelisk.
</P>
<P>
The expression was made by the vice-minister when he returned
here after signing the agreement in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Tekeda who is also leader of the Ethiopian delegation on the
return of Axum Obelisk told local reporters at the airport that
the agreement will be practical since the government of Italy
attaches great significance to the bilateral relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the government of Italy has pledged to clean and
polish the obelisk and to cover the expense for the return of the
obelisk.
</P>
<P>
Axum obelisks were made of single blocks of granite carved in
the representation of multi-storey buildings during the ancient
Axum Kingdom established about 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Axum obelisk which is now standing in Rome was looted
sixty years ago under the order of Benito Mussolini, leader of
the then fascist Italy.

<HEADLINE> Doctor With HIV Sparks Trace of Women at Risk in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 2,000 women at risk of
infection with the Aids virus in Britain are being traced after
the discovery of a doctor with HIV.
</P>
<P>
The doctor, whose identity and sex have not been disclosed,
worked as an obstetrician and gynaecologist at four hospitals in
Britain between February 1991 and January this year.
</P>
<P>
The doctor did not know he was HIV positive until January this
year and followed General Medical Council guidelines by informing
his superiors as soon as he found out. The doctor then volunteered
to stop work straight away.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement released today, the four health
authorities involved said, "The authorities emphasize that their
detailed check of patient records should have identified every
patient who has faced any degree of risk."
</P>
<P>
This is believed to be the largest exercise in Britain to track
patients who have been treated by a doctor with Aids or HIV and
50,000 records were checked.
</P>
<P>
However, medical experts insisted that the chances of any
patient being infected were extremely low and there was no risk at
all of the virus being transmitted to babies.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade more than a dozen British healthcare
workers have been found to be infected with HIV. But in no case
has the infection been passed to a patient.
</P>
<P>
Dr Georgia Duckworth, an epidemiologist for North Thames, said
that there had been only two reported instances anywhere in the
world of a healthcare worker infecting his patients.
</P>
<P>
The Patients Association protested about the authorities'
refusal to name the doctor. But National Health Service insisted
that maintaining confidentiality was essential to avoid false
reassurance.

<HEADLINE> AL Official: UN's Non-intervention in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council's decision
of non-intervention in case of any violation of the peace
agreements signed by the parties concerned in the Middle East
would be "very dangerous", an Arab League (AL) official said today.
</P>
<P>
Saeed Kamal, AL's Assistant Secretary General for Palestinian
Affairs, made the remarks while commenting on the U.S. veto of a
European-sponsored resolution against Israel's decision to build
new Jewish homes in East Jerusalem, the Egyptian MENA news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson, after casting the
veto, said that the parties concerned themselves, instead of the
Security Council, should resolve the Middle East issue.
</P>
<P>
It could be a "dangerous matter" if the world body takes
no action at all and let the situation slide, the AL official
warned.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution calls on Israel to refrain from any action
with negative implications for the Middle East peace process and
to abide by its obligations under international law, he added.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 14-1 on the resolution presented by Portugal,
Sweden, France and Britain, but the U.S. has a veto power,
together with other four permanent members Russia, China, Britain
and France.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Israel's biggest ally and co-sponsor of the peace
process, last week joined an international chorus of disapproval
over Israel's plan to build 6,500 Jewish homes on a tree-covered
hill in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat had a
private meeting with the Security Council representatives a few
hours before the debate started in the 15-member body Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said his message is "how to implement accurately and
honestly what had been agreed upon, to prevent any provocations
and breaching of the United Nations and Security Council
resolutions, which are the platform of the peace process."

<HEADLINE> Sudan Blasts UN Security Council Resolution 1070 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali
Osman Mohammed Taha today denounced U.N. Security Council
Resolution 1070, calling it an attempt to put pressure on Sudan
and to intimidate it with the sanctions stick.
</P>
<P>
Taha said that the proposed sanctions have become controversial
within the world body, and that they are a hard test for the world
conscience and the U.N. as well.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council Resolution 1070 passed last August calls
for imposing an air ban on Sudan unless the latter extradites
three Egyptians wanted for trial on charges of attempting to
assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the Ethiopian
capital in June, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan News Agency (SUNA) quoted the Sudanese foreign
minister as saying that a number of U.N. Security Council members
think that the reasons for Resolution 1070 are political, not
legal, and that the suspects are not in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan had sent an expert from the
Economic Department of the U.N. to tour Sudan from January 18 to
February 8 to prepare a report on the negative humanitarian
effects of Resolution 1070.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. expert affirmed that any air ban on Sudan would
affect carrying people with serious illnesses overseas to receive
medical treatment, would affect the importation of life-saving
medicines and might affect duties of the World Food Program
team operating in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government has expressed the hope that the U.N.
Security Council member states, especially those seeking to get
U.N. sanctions imposed on Sudan, will give up their stance towards
Sudan after the above-mentioned report is published.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Frustrated over US Veto of UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official today
voiced frustration over the U.S. veto on a European-sponsored
draft resolution against the Israeli plan to build a new Jewish
neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Palestinians in Jerusalem and in other Palestinian lands have
nothing left after this feeling of frustration except to defend
their land and rights by bare hands," said Palestinian Permanent
Delegate to the Arab League Ambassador Mohamed Sobeih.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Israel's biggest ally and sponsor of the peace
process, last week joined an international chorus of disapproval
over Israel's plan to build 6,500 Jewish homes on Abu Ghoneim, a
tree-covered hill in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
However, it vetoed the European-sponsored draft resolution
against the Israeli decision today despite the fact that other 14
U.N. Security Security Council member states support it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. stance will only help Israel's hard-liners to go
ahead with the settlement policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih pointed out that the stance runs contrary to the
U.S. letters of guarantees relayed to the Palestinian side at the
Madrid peace conference. The letter guarantees that no change
would be made regarding the demographic features of the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
"Palestinians are shocked. They resent the U.S. stance and
their patience is growing thin," he said.
</P>
<P>
He deplored that trust and confidence in the peace march have
been largely prejudiced due to this veto.
</P>
<P>
"Now the U.S. must directly shoulder the responsibility of
trying to halt the building of a Jewish neighborhood in Abu
Ghoneim and elsewhere in the Holy City," he said.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution calls on Israel to refrain from any action
with negative implications for the peace process and to abide by
its obligations under international law.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President

called for donor technical support to Radio Tanzania which is so
far the most effective media in terms of reaching the targeted
populations in the rural areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
Poindexter said having been so much impressed by the good work
done by Radio Tanzania in changing the life styles of the young
people in Tanzania, his organization will work out strategies to
assist its broadcasting abilities.
</P>
<P>
He said, research findings indicated that the PCI supported
programs have been effective in the HIV prevention strategies and
in family planning education to the youth in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Poindexter was leading a delegation to attend a four-day board
meeting held in the Tanzanian capital.
</P>
<P>
The PCI carries out mass education programs and is supported
mainly by private donations, UN agencies and relevant government
departments in the countries of operation.

China, the USA, Mexico, Tanzania, Kenya, St. Lucia, Nigeria,

DAR ES SALAAM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania requires about 1.8
billion Tanzania Shillings (about 3 million US Dollars) to
eradicate rinderpest said to be threatening both livestock and

<P>
PARIS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Liamine Zeroual
today expressed his wish that women will be represented in the
country's future parliament, which will be produced from the
legislative elections to be held on June 5.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Zeroual as making the
statement at a ceremony in Algiers honoring former Moudjahidate
women who fought during the country's independence war from 1954
to 1962.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Algerian state is committed to "providing
all the support to women to let them contribute to the process of
national development and the defense of acquired social rights."
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people demonstrated today in Algiers, urging
the government to abolish the country's family law, which was
adopted in 1982 by the former government of the National
Liberation Front (FLN) on the basis of the Islamic law, Shariah,
according to AFP.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to President Zeroual, the demonstrators
also accused Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism of "raping and
executing women."
</P>
<P>
The Algerian government said recently that it intended to
revise the family law, but decided to let the future legislature
do the job after meeting some oppositions.

<HEADLINE> Hussein, Arafat Meet on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein and visiting
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met here this evening on the
latest developments of the peace process, especially the Israeli
decision to build Jewish homes in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reiterated that the Israeli decision to build
new Jewish settlements in Arab East Jerusalem violates relevant
U.N. resolutions, on which the Middle East peace process is based,
Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed means of pushing forward the peace
march. Arafat briefed Hussein on the outcome of his recent visits
to the United States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti, after a short
visit to Gaza, returned Amman this afternoon accompanying Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat paid a previous visit to Jordan on February 21 and
discussed the peace process with Hussein and senior Jordanian
officials.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government formally decided to build new Jewish
housing in East Jerusalem at the end of February despite
strong international opposition.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Arafat has been rallying every possible support to
force Israel to rescind its decision. However, he was frustrated
at the veto by the U.S. of a U.N. Security Council resolution
calling for Israel to halt the settlement plan in East
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> New Municipality to Promote Development in Interior Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of Chongqing
Municipality will help promote economic development in China's
vast central and western regions, commented deputies to the
National People's Congress (NPC) in session here.
</P>
<P>
The motion to set up the centrally-administered Chongqing
Municipality was submitted by the State Council, China's cabinet,
for approval by the NPC last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It will benefit Sichuan," said Yang Xizong, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress. He
noted Sichuan Province, which is composed of more than 200
counties, is too large.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 111.9 million, which is equivalent to
those of Britain and France combined, Sichuan covers 570,000
square kilometers, larger than France.
</P>
<P>
In China's Yangtze River Valley development strategy,
Shanghai's Pudong Area is often compared to the "dragon head" while
Chongqing is described as the "dragon tail." "How can we achieve fast
economic growth in the Yangtze River Valley and central
and western regions at a time when the "dragon head" is moving while
the "dragon tail" remains still?" asked Ma Lin, who served as
deputy governor of Sichuan for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhongli, a noted economist and president of the Shanghai
Academy of Social Sciences, shared Ma's views. Zhang said
Shanghai, a major industrial city in the Yangtze River delta, has
brought about rapid economic advances in its surrounding areas.
Chongqing, an industrial city in the west, is expected to lead an
economic take-off in central and western areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Fangyun, party secretary of Guizhou provincial committee,
also welcomed the move to establish the new municipality.
Chongqing, which shares Wujiang River with Guizhou and just a few
hours drive from Guiyang, Guizhou's provincial capital, will help
exploit the rich hydropower resources along the Wujiang, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Youwei, Communist Party secretary of Shenzhen City
Committee, also welcomed the move.
</P>
<P>
If the proposal is approved by the NPC, Chongqing will foresee
lots of arduous tasks ahead such as resettlement of one million
population for the Three Gorges Project, poverty relief for three
million people, industrial modernization and environmental
protection, said Guo Daiyi, president of the board of directors of
the Chongqing Iron and Steel Complex.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns US Veto of UN Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today indignantly condemned the U.S. veto of a U.N.
resolution criticizing Israel over plans for a new Jewish
neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that Iran has struggled against the United
States for 18 years and it would continue its struggle
against the United States for 180 years.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that Khamenei made the
strong-worded statement before a big gathering in the southwestern
city of Abadan, Khuzestan province, which witnessed an eight-year
bitter war between Iran and Iraq from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. veto of the U.N. resolution criticizing Israeli
controversial plan is the manifestation of what Iran has been
struggling against in the past 18 years," the 58-year-old
leader was quoted by the radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader described the United States as "oppressive,
tyrannical, incapable of understanding and bully," saying that its
measure against the Palestinian people is the "essence of world
imperialism."
</P>
<P>
He said that the struggle of the Iranian people, especially
the people of Khuzestan, should provide the Islamic world with a
model to look up to and follow.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei analogized the contemporary world to "the rule of
Jungle" and the epoch of the predominance of "force and fraud."
</P>
<P>
He termed the Palestinian people as a nation of the oppressed
who can do nothing despite the injustice against them and the
righteousness of their claims in the face of the Israeli control
over mass media and means of propaganda.
</P>
<P>
However, he praised the U.N. resolution as the world's
"outcry" and reaction to a "catastrophe" and one of the few fair
resolutions ever put together by the world organization.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also condemned the Israeli plans for building new
Jewish homes, describing Israel as "counterfeit, false, occupying,
oppressive and blood-thirsting."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the United States vetoed the U.N. resolution which
was put to a vote after a Security Council debate Wednesday and
Thursday in which 50 countries condemned Israel's plan to erect
6,500 homes for Jews at a site called Jabal Abu Ghoneim in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The official English daily, Tehran Times, said in its
editorial that there are several reasons behind the U.S.
opposition to the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
First of all, it said, Israel is the closest ally of the
United States, functioning as its proxy in the Middle East.
Hence Washington will not endanger the interests of its closest
ally in the region.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, though the U.S. is the sponsor of the Middle
East peace talks, Washington is never committed to an honorable
peace leading to the establishment of an independent Palestinian
state. The White House tries to squeeze the Palestinian
authority to comply with all conditions of the Israeli regime
in order to reduce it to a tool in the hands of Israel
to eliminate Arab resistance from the region.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Washington opposed the resolution because it was not
forwarded by the U.S., which is not inclined to allow other
members of the council to take the initiative in an international
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the resolution was forwarded by four members of
the European Union (EU). The U.S. policy-makers are well aware of
the fact that the EU is going to be their economic rival in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the daily noted, the U.S. is never after finding a
basic solution to the problem in the Middle East, and on the
contrary, it is determined to establish the hegemony of the
Israeli regime in the region.

<HEADLINE> China's Government Advisor Calls for Stepping up Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- An advisor of the Chinese
government has urged the state-owned enterprises to step up
marketing and increase their market share so that they will become
increasingly competitive on the market.
</P>
<P>
As a bridge and bond between market demand and enterprise
reaction, marketing can facilitate the efforts of enterprises in
improving their product mix and developing marketable products,
said Guo Guoqing, a member of the Eighth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
China's top advisory body that in its fifth session here.
</P>
<P>
China's state-owned enterprises are undergoing a shift to the
market economic system from a planned economic system and their
market competition is getting tougher and tougher, said Professor
Guo of the People's University of China, who has dedicated himself
to the study of the theory of marketing in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"However, some state-owned enterprises were still at a loss
what to do with market access and market exploration," Guo noted,
adding that many enterprises do not organize production in line
with the market demand, lack the initiative to develop new
products and fail to fix the prices for their products reasonably.
</P>
<P>
He also acknowledged that state-owned enterprises still do not
have proper outlays to sell their products, and chain sales
networks yet to be further developed or standardized.
</P>
<P>
If the problems are not resolved, Guo warned, the enterprises'
difficulties in operation will exacerbate, and the drive to
restructure the economy and retooling of the enterprises will be
affected, Guo warned.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the issue, China's state-owned enterprises should pay
still greater attention to marketing and strive to set up a modern
marketing mechanism that well suits the market, the professor
said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to help enterprises set up an agent
system and distribution centers, and encourage them to adopt
chain-store marketing methods and marketing strategies such as
market itemization, selection of target markets and market
positioning, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, efforts should be made to establish and
improve a marketing information system and publish information
concerning domestic and foreign markets at a still more regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
Marketing information should be collected, disposed of and fed
back promptly, Professor Guo said.

JERUSALEM -- The Israeli company YMA Ein Hamifratz has won a
prestigious contract to supply a leading Jordanian marketing
company with carton packaging material, according to the biweekly

A spokesperson for the company explained that the Jordanians
had conducted a survey of Israeli packaging manufacturers before

<P>
KATHMANDU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's outgoing ruling party
today changed its parliamentary party leader after the fall of the
coalition government on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President of the Nepali Congress (NC) party Girija Prasad
Koirala was unanimously elected by NC lawmakers at a meeting here
today to the post of NC parliamentary leader, which had been held

win a confidence vote in the lower house of parliament.
</P>

At today's meeting Deuba quit his post of NC parliamentary
leader and proposed Koirala for the post, stating that it would be
improper for him to become prime minister after failing to secure

Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) will

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies Military involvement in Great Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian parliament said today
Egypt has no military cooperation with nor military presence in
any of the Great Lake countries of Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here today, the People's Assembly
Foreign Relations Committee lauded the swift Egyptian action to
contain the deteriorating situation in the Great Lakes countries
like Tanzania and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed support to the government's efforts to
realize peace and stability in the Great Lakes area and called on
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to lend greater interest to
the deteriorating conditions there.
</P>
<P>
The recent tour of Assistant Foreign Minister for African
Affairs Ambassador Badr Hmmam to the region helped cleared reports
on Egyptian intervention in the affairs of this region, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has a firm belief in the non-interference in the internal
affairs of African countries and it extends no military support to
any country in this conflict, it said.
</P>
<P>
While the committee welcomed regional and international efforts
towards a peaceful solution to the problems of the Great Lakes, it
urged more attention from OAU to the conflict to ensure "the
attained solution is African and in the interest of the security
of the African nations."
</P>
<P>
The Great Lakes region includes Burundi, Rwanda, Zaire, Uganda
and Tanzania. Zaire has accused Rwanda and Uganda of sponsoring
rebels in the country. The three countries are all plagued by the
refugees flying out of the civil wars in their own countries
pitting ethnic Hutus against Tutsis.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Organizations in Syria Condemn US Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The unified leadership of the
Damascus-based Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine
and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine today
condemned the U.S. for its veto of a U.N. Security Council
resolution on Israeli settlement activities in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the unified leadership of the two
Palestinian organizations denounced the U.S. for using its veto
power to kill the draft resolution, which urged Israel to abandon
its plan on building Jewish homes in Jabal Abu Ghoneim in East
Jerusalem, which was seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the unified leadership said the use of the
veto power reaffirmed the biased U.S. policy in favor of the
Israeli aggressive, expansionist practices. It underscored the
need to put an end to the U.S. unilateral control of the destinies
of the region and its peoples.
</P>
<P>
The statement called for an immediate termination of bilateral
negotiations with Israel until its settlement activities stop in
East Jerusalem and other occupied territories.

WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered Federal agencies to
recruit and hire welfare recipients and gave staff members 30 days
to find a way to do it. "Government can help to move people from
welfare to work, by acting the way we want all employers to act,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Germany has ordered an American diplomat to leave the
country after accusing him of trying to recruit senior officials
for espionage and steal secrets related to high-technology
projects, German government officials said.
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration's efforts to win Senate approval
of a major treaty aimed at barring poison gas warfare suffered a
new and possibly fatal setback on Saturday when Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms pledged to block it
unless it is substantially modified.

<HEADLINE> Army Deputies Call for Better Defense Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- With the draft of China's first
Defense Law being deliberated and likely to be adopted by the
Chinese legislature, a national defense education drive should be
launched throughout the country, according to deputies from the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) who are attending the current
session of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Defense education is an important part of efforts to improve
the quality of the Chinese people, they say.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xitao, chief of staff of the Nanjing Military Area
Command, said defense education in peace times is different from
that just before and during a war.
</P>
<P>
What is called the grand defense concept should include
education on the international strategic pattern, competition in
comprehensive national strength, and the supremacy of national
interests, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Mingyuan, former political commissar of the Military
Education Institute, noted that only with a clear-headed
understanding of the international strategic pattern and
competition in nations' comprehensive strength, and of the gap
between China and developed nations, will a sense of crisis and
responsibility be enhanced, and the timeliness of defense
education improved.
</P>
<P>
What the deputies talked most about the draft law is the part
that stipulates that governments at all levels incorporate defense
education in their respective economic and social development
plans, and guarantee fund for defense education.
</P>
<P>
Ding Yucai, political commissar of the arms department of the
Headquarters of the General Staff of the PLA, said the law makes
clear the responsibilities of all government organs, social
organizations, businesses and schools in defense education, which
will be conducive to the provision of defense education.
</P>
<P>
The deputies pointed out that with Hong Kong's impending return
to China, the convocation of the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China, and the 70th anniversary of the founding
of the PLA, this year will be a most opportune time to promote
defense education.

<HEADLINE> Youth Plant Trees in Shenzhen for Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Today, 114 days ahead of the
scheduled return of Hong Kong to the motherland, more than
1,000 young people, including over 500 from Hong Kong, planted
1997 agalloch eaglewood trees in a local park here.
</P>
<P>
The trees form the "Memorial Forest for the Upcoming Return of
Hong Kong," which is in the shape of China.
</P>
<P>
According to some of the participants, the eaglewood tree is of
significance to Hong Kong, as the name Hong Kong means "fragrant
port," and the tree's sap is used in making perfume.
</P>
<P>
Three Hong Kong-based students planted trees that were numbered
1840, 1856 and 1984, signifying important historical dates: the
years 1840 and 1856 are the beginning dates of the first and
second Opium wars, during which British troops invaded China under
the pretext of protecting British merchants who were smuggling
drugs into China. In 1984, the Sino-British Joint Communique was
signed.
</P>
<P>
Each of the youngsters was granted a certificate for the
tree-planting.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Non-Communist Parties Stress Cooperation with CPC (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- At the end of 1996, a number of
events in China's political arena attracted much public attention.
</P>
<P>
On November 11, He Luli, 62, was elected Chairwoman of the
Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese
Kuomintang (RCCK), at the fifth plenum of the Eighth RCCK Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen days later, the fifth plenum of the Seventh Central
Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL) elected Ding
Shisun, 69, Chairman of the CDL Central Committee after accepting
the resignation of the former chairman Fei Xiaotong.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also elected Jiang Jingbo and Yuan Xingpei new
vice-chairmen of the CDL Central Committee, to replace Qian
Weichang and Tan Jiazhen, who had resigned office.
</P>
<P>
On December 13, the fifth plenum of the Sixth Central Committee
of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA)
accepted the resignation of former chairman Sun Qimeng, who was
replaced by Cheng Siwei, 61.
</P>
<P>
RCCK, CDL, and CDNCA belong to China's eight non-Communist
parties. Born in the period of new democratic revolution, these
parties have developed a sincere and enduring friendship with the
Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China in 1949, they have actively
taken part in the building of a multi-party cooperation and
political consultation system under the leadership of the CPC, and
made outstanding contributions to China's development.
</P>
<P>
However, as time goes by, it has become a pressing task for the
non-Communist parties to renew their leadership, for some parties'
leading posts were still held by their founders.

<P>
"The society progresses on the basis of ceaseless inheritance
and replacement, and like all living things, China's non-Communist
parties also need metabolism for development," noted Fei Xiaotong,
former CDL chairman who is 87.
</P>
<P>
Major leadership reshuffles in the Chinese non-Communist
parties also conveyed a message to the world, that is, the
multi-party cooperation system under the leadership of the CPC
will be insisted on and carried forward in a long period of time
to come.
</P>
<P>
The primary concern for all non-Communist parties during the
selection of new leaders was whether they could carry on and help
develop the time-honored friendship and cooperation with the CPC,
retired party leaders noted.
</P>
<P>
They said that the new leaders must be able to adhere to the
principle of "long-term co-existence and mutual supervision"
between the CPC and the non-Communist parties, insist on the
glorious tradition of multi-party cooperation under the CPC
leadership, and stick to the country's basic line and the theory
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The new leaders should also have correct political orientation
and principles, devote themselves to party work, and be honest,
incorruptible, and democratic-minded, they added.
</P>
<P>
Political experts commented that as party leaders, He Luli,
Ding Shisun and Cheng Siwei are both young and competent, and have
strong political consciousness.
</P>
<P>
They were all elected with a vote of absolute majority, which
showed that they enjoyed support from most of their parties'
members.

"Leaders of non-Communist parties must unswervingly accept the
leadership of the CPC, adhere to the multi-party cooperation and
political consultation system under the CPC leadership, and keep
on studying Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong thought, and Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics," said He Luli.
</P>
<P>
Ding Shisun stressed that the non-Communist parties should keep
in line with the CPC's fundamental theories and basic line and try
to increase the cohesive force of their leadership, to give full
play to their involvement in political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Siwei urged all members of the non-Communist parties to
firmly carry out the country's basic line of "one focus, two basic
points" affirmed by the CPC, and strive for China's reunification
and invigoration.
</P>
<P>
"We should take an active part in political consultation, and
try our best to perform our duty of democratic supervision," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Peng Qingyuan, executive vice-chairman of the RCCK Central
Committee, said that the leadership of the CPC over non-Communist
parties was a historic choice made by the non-Communist parties
during China's revolutionary struggle, an outcome of China's
social and political struggle and development in the past century,
and a natural result of the CPC's long-term practice of its united
front policy.
</P>
<P>
"The non-Communist parties are not opposition parties, but are
friends and political partners of the CPC," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng Siwei, the CDNCA would make every effort to
strengthen democratic supervision on the CPC, which is the
brilliant tradition of the party's older generation of leaders.

In recent years, he said, the CDNCA alone has put forth over
110 criticisms and suggestions to the CPC party committees or
local governments.
</P>
<P>
Feng Zhijun, vice-chairman of the CDL Central Committee, said
that the multi-party cooperation system has provided a broad arena
for the non-Communist parties to participate in the country's
government and political affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Front Work Department of the CPC
Central Committee, since the beginning of reform and opening up in
1978, the CPC Central Committee has hosted more than 150
conferences and forums ahead of making any major decisions, to
solicit opinions from non-Communist parties and people without
party affiliation. The number of such meetings since 1993 has
exceeded 80.
</P>
<P>
Among deputies to the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC),
China's legislature, 572 are members of non-Communist parties and
people without party affiliation, including nine vice chairmen and
51 members of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Members of non-Communist parties and people without party
affiliation also account for 60.3 percent of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body, including 14
vice-chairmen and 189 Standing Committee members.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that nearly 100 members of non-Communist
parties and people without party affiliation have been engaged as
special supervisors or inspectors by a number of departments under
the CPC Central Committee and the central government, while
various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have
also invited several thousand non-Communists to serve as
supervisors or inspectors.
</P>
<P>
To date, the non-Communist parties have put forth more than 90
significant proposals to the CPC Central Committee and the State
Council, China's cabinet, most of which have been adopted.

<HEADLINE> Prospects for Cross-Strait Agricultural Cooperation Broad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the current session of
the National People's Congress (NPC) agreed that
mutually-beneficial, cross-strait cooperation in agriculture has a
broad prospect.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 600 Taiwan-funded agricultural projects in
east China's Fujian province and south China's Hainan province,
with an actual investment of 310 million US dollars from Taiwan
businesses, an annual output value of some two billion yuan, and
over 100 million US dollars in exports.
</P>
<P>
When most projects were small-scale exploratory ones when they
first appeared in the early 1980s, and, afterwards, they grew in
scale and became soly-invested ones in the 1990s, said Li Tiansen,
mayor of Zhangzhou, the city with the largest number of
Taiwan-funded agricultural projects in Fujian.
</P>
<P>
And such projects have developed from monoculture to a wide
range of businesses, such as to aquatic breeding in sea beaches,
processing factories in suburban areas, vegetable growing on plains
and fruits planting in hilly regions, said Wang Faren, director of
the provincial land reclamation administration in Hainan province.
</P>
<P>
The deputies concurred that the growing trend in agricultural
cooperation should be attributed to the fact that the agricultural
sector across the Taiwan Strait are complementary to each other.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's agricultural sector is now facing difficulties such as
rises in land prices and labor cost, shortage in resources, and
deterioration of ecological environment, explained Xie Hua'an,
president of the Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
While in Fujian province across the strait, Li Tiansen added,
there are rich agricultural resources, a market with immense
potentials, and low labor cost.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Zhangzhou, which just has begun a large-scale
agricultural development and is urgent need of amassed funds and
advanced technologies, is a definitely ideal partner for Taiwan's
agro-businesses."
</P>
<P>
To date, 95 percent of Taiwan-funded agricultural projects in
the provinces are making profits.
</P>
<P>
The State Council and its Taiwan-Affairs Office and the
Ministry of Agriculture have set up bases of demonstration both in
Fujian and Hainan provinces for cross-strait agricultural
cooperation, and plans are under way to establish centers of
cooperation on an experimental basis, in an effort to keep
widening the areas of agricultural cooperation in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Legislature Deliberates Amendments to Criminal Law to Ensure Justice (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese legislature is
considering to amend the country's existing criminal law to better
ensure justice and wipe out abuses and unstandard practices in law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Draft amendments to the 1979 criminal law are under review by
the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, now
in session here.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments contain detailed provisions on punishment
whose severity is below what is prescribed in the law, punishment
reduction and release on parole, to ensure that the guilty be
duly punished in accordance with law and be effectively educated
and reformed.
</P>
<P>
The existing law rules that the judicial committee of a court
is empowered to mete out a sentence less severe than the minimum
as prescribed in the law, if it considers the minimum punishment
still too severe.
</P>
<P>
But the law is unclear about in what circumstances this
provision may be applied, and some courts have been found to abuse
this power.
</P>
<P>
To make the legal procedures more stringent, in the case of a
sentence less severe than the minimum as prescribed by the law,
examination by and approval of the judicial committee of the
Supreme People's Court is needed, according to the amendments.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing law, decisions on punishment reduction and
release on parole are based mainly on "verified behaviors of
remorse or meritorious services" and "verified behaviors of
remorse with no possibility to harm the society again."
</P>
<P>
But in practice, such "behaviors" are hard to verify because
there are no clear verification procedures in the law.

<HEADLINE> Legislature Deliberates Amendments to Criminal Law to Ensure Justice (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Meanwhile, to ensure the authority of court verdicts, the
convicted will not have their sentences reduced or be released on
parole so easily; and violent offenders and recidivists, in
particular, should not be released on parole.
</P>
<P>
Now, according to the draft amendments, acts of remorse must be
verified by the court with evidence provided by prison
administrators, before the reformed inmates are released on parole
or have their sentences reduced.
</P>
<P>
And violent offenders whose jail terms exceed 10 years or who
will be imprisoned for life shall not be released on parole,
according to the draft amendments.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the NPC said provisions on punishment reduction and
release on parole were originally intended to help and encourage
inmates to reform themselves.
</P>
<P>
But if relevant provisions are applied improperly, that is, if
offenders not worthy of punishment reductions or release on parole
are let out of prison, such acts of the court would discourage
their fellow inmates and exert an extremely bad impact on them,
and the society would very likely be threatened again, deputies
said when discussing the draft amendments.
</P>
<P>
Legislators believe that more strict provisions are
necessary.
</P>
<P>
The draft law contains another addition -- "all are equal
before the law." This principle has been included in the
Constitution, but its inclusion in the criminal law is still
believed to be of practical significance.
</P>
<P>
A new provision in the draft law saying that punishments must
be commensurate with crimes will serve as another means to prevent
malpractices in law.
</P>
<P>
Provisions on "justifiable defense" in the existing criminal
law have also improved to ensure that victims of violence be free
from unreasonable prosecution and to encourageiry for public
interests. Amendments in this regard are also conducive to law
enforcement by the police.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition to Form Government with Former </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition party
has agreed to join a coalition led by a small party's leader to
form an alternative government, informed sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Senior Leader of the National Democratic Party (RPP) Lokendra
Bahadur Chand has so far managed to garner 103 MPs' support
required for forming a new government to replace the three-party
government which was resigned Thursday after losing a confidence
vote in the 205-seat lower house, they said.
</P>
<P>
Chand is going to submit to King Birendra the formation of his
coalition government with the signatures of the 103 MPs including
90 from main opposition the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
The RPP, a ruling partner of the outgoing government led by the
Nepali Congress (NC), has been holding the key to any political
equation in the country with its 19 MPs in the hung parliament.
</P>
<P>
Neither The CPN-UML nor the NC, the two biggest parties with 90
and 88 MPs respectively in the house, could form a stable
government without the RPP's support.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing government under NC leader Sher Bahadur Deuba came
to power in September 1995 when an alliance of the NC, the RPP and
another small party voted down a minority CPN-UML government.
</P>
<P>
The Deuba government's fall on Thursday mainly resulted from
the withdrawal of a RPP faction led by Chand from the coalition
three months ago.
</P>
<P>
The absence of two NC MPs, reportedly lured by Chand, from
Thursday's house voting directly led to the defeat of the
confidence motion tabled by Deuba for his three-party government.

<HEADLINE> Amended Criminal Law Covers All Crimes in China: Legislators (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- For most ordinary Chinese, crimes
like "money laundering," "computer-related crimes" and "securities
fraud" are still something that can only be heard or seen in
foreign movies.
</P>
<P>
But these crimes are covered by draft amendments to the
Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, which are being
discussed in Beijing by nearly 3,000 deputies to the National
People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
"What is money laundering? My understanding is that it is an
offense that turns illegal incomes into legal profits through a
certain means. But it may be a bit difficult for ordinary people
to understand this legal term, and we should add some explanations
to it," said a deputy from southeast China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
China has decided to make a comprehensive and major amendment
to the existing Criminal Law, which was enacted 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments increase the law's articles to 449 from
the previous 192, and define many new crimes unimaginable 17 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"The 1979 law defined the task and basic principle of the
criminal law, and made a lot of concrete and feasible
stipulations," said Wu Fuzhao, a member of the NPC Law Committee.
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that, with China's economic development,
many new problems and new crimes that are hard to deal with have
emerged, and the legislature has had to enact 22 supplementary
laws and decisions to make the 1979 Criminal Law viable in a new
situation.
</P>
<P>
"If the draft amendments are adopted at the current NPC
session, the resulting criminal law will become China's first law
having the nature of a legal code, which can cover all kinds of
crimes in the current society," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
The legislators held that the draft amendments reflect China's
social, economic and political changes during the past dozen years
when the country is building a market economy, especially in the
third and sixth chapters.

<HEADLINE> Amended Criminal Law Covers All Crimes in China: Legislators (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two chapters are namely "crimes of sabotaging the order of
the socialist market economy" and "crimes of jeopardizing social
management and order."
</P>
<P>
"The two chapters reflect the current social trends, and provide
a legal guarantee for implementing Deng Xiaoping's principle of
placing equal emphasis on material progress and ethical-cultural
progress," said Zhang Binsheng, vice-chairman of the All-China
Lawyers Association.
</P>
<P>
In these two chapters, the draft amendments to the Criminal Law
make detailed stipulations on the definition of various economic
and social crimes in China today and punishment for perpetuators
of such crimes, which include new crimes like securities inside
trading, computer-related crimes, and environmental sabotage.
</P>
<P>
In the view of economist Dong Fureng, who is a member of the
NPC Standing Committee, the amended Criminal Law will become a
parental law that will exert a profound influence on the
development of a market economic structure, economic
legislation and law enforcement in China.
</P>
<P>
"It is of great significance for the maintenance of a normal
order of a market economy, and will safeguard the principle of
'openness, fairness and justice' for the market economy," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that articles in the draft amendments
directly linked to the interests of common citizens are those
concerning disturbance of social and public order and illegal
market competitions, which include shoddy commodities, false
advertising and cheating.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the amendments have promised protection of
citizen's personal and democratic rights, while making it clear
in its general principles that all are equal before the
law.

eclipse this morning were stymied by a snow storm that whitened
the blackout.

The sky darkened in Darhan for just two minutes between
8:48-8:50 a.m (Ulan Bator time), but the whole process of the moon

Today is the last time of this century to witness a total sun

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Plant Trees During NPC Recess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Quite a number of deputies from
nine provinces and municipalities to the on-going session of the
National People's Congress (NPC) planted trees while other
legislators were having a day off today at the Temple of Heaven,
where late senior leader Deng Xiaoping had planted trees on three
occasion.
</P>
<P>
They were joined by ranking Party and government officials
Jiang Chunyun, Wen Jiabao, Chen Muhua and Chen Junsheng, and
leading officials of the relevant government departments and
Beijing Municipalities Xu Youfang, Hou Jie and Jia Qinglin.
</P>
<P>
The tree planting endeavor by all people on a voluntary basis
was personally initiated by Deng Xiaoping, and the Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core has paid close attention to
the cause of greening the country, said Jiang Chunyun, Chinese
vice-premier and a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that the NPC deputies' participation in
tree planting every year has been a great push for China's
afforestation drive.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the NPC organized its deputies to take part in the
tree planting during its annual session every year, Chen Muhua,
vice-chairperson of the NPC Standing Committee, urged the NPC
deputies to take an active part in the afforestation drive
nationwide and called on the entire country to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu Youfang, vice-chairman of the National Greening
Committee and minister of forestry, some 300 million to 500
million people have been involved in China's afforestation every
year, who have planting some two billion saplings annually. Thanks
to the nationwide afforestation effort, the country's forest
coverage rate has increased year by year in the past dozen years.

<HEADLINE> Circular on Studying Documents Related to Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese cadres and the public are
urged to study documents and articles about Deng Xiaoping in
commemoration of the late Chinese leader.
</P>
<P>
According to a circular issued recently by the General Office
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, "Comrade
Deng Xiaoping was an outstanding leader whose great prestige was
acknowledged by the whole Party, Army, and the people of all
ethnic groups throughout China. He was a great Marxist, a great
proletarian revolutionary, a statesman, a military strategist, a
diplomat, and a long-tested communist fighter, the chief architect
of China's socialist reforms, opening-up and modernization drive,
and the founder of the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics."
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Deng Xiaoping's passing represents an immeasurable
loss to the Communist Party of China and to the Chinese people,"
it continues.
</P>
<P>
The circular calls on the cadres and the public to turn grief
into strength, carry out Deng's wishes, and express their
love and esteem for him by hard work in all fields.
</P>
<P>
In order to further study Deng's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, it says, the CPC Central Committee
has decided that for now, Party committees of all levels should
organize cadres and the public to conscientiously study "The
Letter to the Whole Party, the Whole Army, and the People of
Various Ethnic Groups Throughout the Country," "Comrade Jiang
Zemin's Speech at Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Memorial Meeting" and
"The Great and Brilliant Life of Deng Xiaoping."
</P>
<P>
It stresses that the three documents are of great significance
to the Party, the Army and the people of various ethnic groups for
studying the achievements, thought and style of Deng; for sticking
firmly to the Party's principal theory and line; and for preparing
for the convening of the Party's 15th National Congress.
</P>
<P>
Party organizations at all levels should carry out the study in
a serious manner, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The circular urges the cadres and the public to push forward
the great cause of the socialist reform, opening-up and
modernization drive, under the strong leadership of the Party
Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and holding
high the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics.

<HEADLINE> China's First Non-state Bank Profitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China's first non-state-owned
commercial bank made a profit in 1996, the first year of its
operation.
</P>
<P>
The China Minsheng Banking Corporation, the country's first
non-government bank founded in January last year with a registered
capital of 1.38 billion yuan, made a profit of more than 10
million yuan in 1996, according to bank president Tong Zengyin.
</P>
<P>
Minsheng's success broke with a convention in China, namely,
new banks normally lose money in the first year, break even in the
second and only begin to turn out a profit in the third year, said
Tong, who is here attending the fifth session of the Eighth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, the country's top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
He added that his bank's assets have exceeded eight billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have shown that there is a broad prospect for the
development of non-government banks in China," he said. "The birth
of Minsheng is itself a breakthrough in the reform of the
country's banking system."
</P>
<P>
Besides the "big four" state-owned banks -- the Industrial and
Commercial Bank, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank of China
and the China Construction Bank, China now has 16 smaller
commercial banks, including Minsheng.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce,
Minsheng was established to serve non-government enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The non-state economy is among the fastest-growing sectors in
China. Statistics show that non-government scientific and
technological enterprises alone numbered more than 9,700 at the
end of 1995.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: S. Africa Expects More Trade with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela seems successful in promoting economic cooperation
with Southeast Asian nations during his visits to the
Philippines, Brunei, Singapore and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, 78, started his 10-day Southeast Asian tour with a
104-strong trade delegation on March 1, the first of its kind
since the South African Government of National Unity took power
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the four member states of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Mandela had a series of
"friendly and constructive" talks with leaders of the visited
states on promoting bilateral and regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that such talks have remarkably
closed ranks between South Africa, an economic power in Africa,
and Southeast Asia where economy is developing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Mandel's "massive marketing drive in Southeast Asia",
South Africa's economy will be boosted by at least one billion
Rands (227 million U.S. dollars) this year, local mass media
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Local economists and observers said Mandela's current visit to
Southeast Asia indicates that the South African government, while
attaching great importance to traditional trade relations with
West Europe, is also trying hard to expand its trade ties with
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo, Asia
has become South Africa's second largest trading bloc after the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Trade between South Africa and Asia in 1996 expected to exceed
the record 954 million U.S. dollars of last year, Nzo noted.
</P>
<P>
It is worth saying that Mandela, also Chairman of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), has reportedly seized every
opportunity to urge ASEAN nations to foster closer links with
SADC countries.
</P>
<P>
With abundant mineral resources, a market of more than 100
million people and great tourist potential, the Southern African
region will become a center of rapid economic development in the
world, Mandela told ASEAN states leaders repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
The South African government is sparing no efforts in carrying
out its Macro-Economic Strategy which is characterized by
promoting exports and attracting foreign investment to speed up
national economic construction.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, Mandela is making his Southeast Asian tour to
be an international advertizement for both his country and
southern Africa.

<HEADLINE> Cultural, Ethical Progress to Be Based on Education: Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The current drive to promote
cultural and ethical progress in China should be based on
education, so that it won't be a flash in the pan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hui, a professor from Hebei Teachers' University, said the
focus of efforts to promote cultural and ethical progress should
be on education, especially basic education and the training of
teachers.
</P>
<P>
Her view was shared by many other deputies to the National
People's Congress, which has been in session here, and members of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference also in session here.
</P>
<P>
The promotion drive, started last year, aims to improve
the nation's ethical and cultural standards when the country is
making rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Ma Zhongchen, who is also governor of Henan province,
said the drive shows that cultural and ethical progress should be
a part of the development of a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
They agreed it will be a long-term task to improve the cultural
and ethical standards of the nation.
</P>
<P>
"Primary and middle schools are a key stage for the
formation of a person's outlook on life, and better education for
children and teenagers are more effective than telling adults not
to spit on the ground," said Professor Zhang Aizhen from Nanjing
University.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that the number of illiterate people in China
accounts for one fourth of the world's total, and the percentage of
college graduates in the Chinese population is much lower than
that in industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
Fang Liluo, a research fellow from the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, said promotion of cultural and ethical progress is a
complex system, including control of population, improvement of
the quality of child-bearing, and increase of input in education.
</P>
<P>
As an important and grim issue facing today's China, he said,
"improvement of the quality of the nation probably will require
the efforts of several generations."
</P>
<P>
And the point is not how many school are to be set up, said
Fang. The gospel for many schools is to encourage students to
score higher points in examinations, which results in their
neglecting other aims of education, among them the most important
one - to produce responsible and civilized citizens for the
society.
</P>
<P>
Some deputies and members also pointed out that other subjects
such as the education of the children of one-child families and
migrant workers also merit special attention.

DAMASCUS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara had talks today with his Iranian counterpart Ali Akbar
Velayati who arrived in Damascus this morning.

the recent decision of the Israeli government on building new
Jewish settlements in east Jerusalem, said a Syrian foreign
ministry spokesman.

the resolution sponsored by Britain, France, Portugal and Sweden,
which called for Israeli halt of the construction plan.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Future Will be Brighter: Government Advisor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A vice-chairman of China's top
advisory body said today that the future of Macao will be brighter
after its return to the embrace of the motherland in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man-kei, who is here attending the ongoing fifth session of
the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said: "With the backing of the
powerful motherland, Macao's future will still be brighter after
its return in 1999."
</P>
<P>
Ma, 77, vice-chairman of the Committee for Drafting the Basic
Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region, noted that Macao's
return to the embrace of the motherland on December 20, 1999 is an
exceptionally big, joyous event of the Chinese people including
the compatriots in Macao after Hong Kong's return in July this
year, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Basic Law was formulated after four and a half years
of efforts in line with the guidelines of "one country, two
systems and the Sino-Portugese joint declaration. The law provides
a legal guarantee for keeping Macao's existing system and life
styles unchanged for 50 years and retains various favorable
factors for economic development in Macao, such as free entry and
exit of Macao residents and low tariff levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central government's solution of the Macao issue in line
with the principle of "one country, two systems" initiated by Deng
Xiaoping is not an expedient measure but the most ideal way for
the solution of problems left over from history in the light of
its realities, to the welcome and heartfelt support of the Macao
compatriots, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is pleased that China and Portugal have cooperated
very well on the Macao issue and created favorable conditions for
the stable transition of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he noted, Macao's smooth return is the common
aspiration of the people and general trend of the times," Ma said,
adding that people's confidence in Macao's future is increasing
under the current good situation.
</P>
<P>
The steady growing tourism, rising industry and exports, a
recovering real estate business and increasing investment all
indicate the people's growing confidence in the future of Macao,
he explained.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in Macao remained mild in recent years and
picked up speed last year, Ma added.
</P>
<P>
As president of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of
Macao, he know very well that a prosperous and strong motherland
is the most powerful guarantee for Macao's development.
</P>
<P>
Reform and opening-up in the interior areas over the past years
have created opportunities for economic development of Macao, he
said.
</P>
<P>
With Macao's return in 1999, the interior areas' support for
economic growth in Macao will be more direct and powerful and its
economic and trade with the interior areas scale to a new height,
Ma noted.
</P>
<P>
Beyond any doubt, he noted, Macao will be more prosperous in
the future, and he was full confident.
</P>
<P>
"The central government has been attaching great importance to
the return of Macao and this has inspired us to do a good job in
this regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ma pledged, as a CPPCC member and a deputy to the
National People's Congress, he will unite with all Macao
compatriots and strive to spread the knowledge of the basic law
and the relevant state policies among them.
</P>
<P>
Finally, he said, Macao's return to the motherland, the
principles of "one country, two systems" and "Macao people
governing Macao" will surely be achieved, and the tomorrow of
Macao will certainly be brighter, thanks to the leadership of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee with Jiang Zemin
at the core, the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and
Portuguse governments and the support from the people of the whole
nation, including the compatriots in Macao.

<HEADLINE> People Go to Fortune Tellers Just for Fun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Many Chinese say they go to
fortune tellers just for "fun," according to a report released by
the China Association of Science and Technology (CAST) shows.
</P>
<P>
A survey of Chinese people's viewpoints on unknown phenomena
shows that 28.4 percent of the respondents said they visit fortune
tellers "for fun."
</P>
<P>
Of the leading concerns they would like to have psychically
addressed, according to the survey, knowing what the future has in
store topped the list, followed by information on health and
marriage.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that over 50 percent of the public do not
believe in fortune telling and 47 percent think it's a form of
sorcery, while 7.6 percent hold the view that fortune telling has
a scientific basis.
</P>
<P>
Some 44 percent believe that people capable of predicting the
future do exist, but that most of them are common people; only 4.4
percent of those surveyed said they thought that fortune tellers
have special psychic powers.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two percent of the respondents answered that fortune
tellers are crooks.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 74.7 percent of the people do not
believe that a computer can be used to predict the future.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 33.3 percent of the respondents think
that supernatural abilities are "magic" that is used for
entertainment, while 19.5 percent think that so-called psychics
are cheats.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the people do not believe that one's future can
be forecast by palm reading or analyzing the components of a
written Chinese character. However, 61.2 percent of the people do
not oppose the practice of geomancy before building or moving into
a new house.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that 26.4 percent of the public believe
in the existence of extra-terrestrial beings, and 47.6 percent
don't.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted nationwide at the end of 1996 and
targeted adults ranging from ages 18 to 69. Of the 5,000
questionnaires distributed, 51.9 percent were returned.
</P>
<P>
It is the first large-scale in-depth survey in the field in
China, according to Chen Gang, a CAST official in charge of the
study.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Trying Hard To Regain Former Glory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- For decades, the name "Shanghai"
meant "quality" to most Chinese consumers because goods produced
in the country's largest metropolis were considered to be the best.
</P>
<P>
Things have changed though, and many other Chinese cities,
especially those in coastal areas, caught up in the eighties by
using foreign technology, equipment, and managerial expertise.
</P>
<P>
So, in 1995 the Shanghai municipal government launched a
"Brandname Program" campaign to recover the glory days, a move
that has had the support of local residents.
</P>
<P>
Recently, 217 Shanghai-made goods were chosen as '1996 Shanghai
Brandname Products' out of 480 items competing from 419
Shanghai-based companies. Over 600,000 local consumers sent in
their choices to municipal government departments.
</P>
<P>
To show their support for the government program, hundreds of
shops that only handle local brandname goods have opened in the
downtown area, and manufacturers of brandname products have
benefited from the campaign. According to official figures, nearly
50 percent of the companies whose products are brandnames saw
profits increase by over 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are still hazards: four of 1995's brandname products
disappeared from the list in 1996 because of plummeting sales and
a declining market share.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- This capital of south China's
Guangdong Province plans to redouble its efforts to improve
services for workers who have been made redundant and to bring its
unemployment rate down further this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 17,000 laid-off workers were
re-employed in Guangzhou last year, accounting for 64 percent of
the people on relief, and that the unemployment rate was brought
to below three percent.
</P>
<P>
The city expects to see an increase of some 38,000 people in
its workforce this year, and the number of redundant workers is
expected to exceed last year's 34,000 substantially, according to
the Guangzhou City Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou plans to make full use of special re-employment
project funds and to continue to provide free training to laid-off
workers.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that more than 60 percent of the jobless
attended training courses last year, and some 1.6 million yuan
(about 192,700 US dollars) of training fees were waived.
</P>
<P>
The city will set up a network to help the jobless workers,
providing more employment opportunities for them, and the number
of people coming in from other parts of the country will be
restricted this year.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere Calls for Eradication of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Julius Nyerere, former president of
Tanzania, has called on African leaders to eliminate poverty from
their domains if they want peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
It is not possible to achieve peace and stability in the face
of widespread poverty among the people, he stressed, according to
press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, currently chairman of the Geneva-based South-South
Center, also advised African leaders to stop fighting among
themselves and, instead, use their resources for national
development.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere arrived the Lagos international airport on Saturday on
his way to the Nigerian capital Abuja, where he is expected to
become the first winner of Zik Prize in Leadership and meet with
the head of state General Sani Abacha today.
</P>
<P>
The prize, named after Nigeria's first president Nnamdi
Azikiwe who died of illness in May last year at the age of 92, is
established for prominent African leaders.
</P>
<P>
According to Nyerere, 75, who retired from active politics in
1985 after ruling Tanzania for 23 years, the younger general of
African leaders should borrow from the experience of successful
past leaders such as Nnamdi Azikiwe and Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah in
their efforts to develop their areas.
</P>
<P>
He also called on them to learn from Michael Manley, th
Jamaican two-time former prime minister who died last month.
</P>
<P>
"It is not all the time one achieves what one has set out to
achieve, but with the little Manley having achieved, it is the
duty of the younger generation to take over from him," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere came in company of five aides from Ghana, where he
participated in activities marking the country's 40th
independence anniversary on March 6.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Contractors handling government
projects in Akwa Ibom State in southeast Nigeria will not be paid
if they cannot produce their voters' cards to show that they have
been registered for the March 15 local government elections.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Vanguard newspaper quoted the state administrator
Navy Captain Joseph Adeusi as giving the directive in Uyo, the
state capital, during a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The administrator reportedly said it is unfair for anybody
including th contractors to exhibit a lukewarm attitude to
government functions when actually they are earning their living
from the government.
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who is doing business with the government should be
ready to keep government appointments at all times," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's registration of voters for the local government
elections under the military government's transition to civil
rule program took place from February 10 to 19.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary government assessment said about 60.6 million
people were registered, which is rather high, considering that
about 45 percent of the country's 115 million population are
children under 15 and three percent elders above 64.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Wants to See U.S. Fair Role in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
has said that his country looked to Washington to play an active
role as a "fair and unbiased mediator" to get the Mideast peace
process back on track.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published today by local newspaper "al-Ahram",
Moussa said that although the U.S. role in the peace process is
much criticized, it will always be required.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who has been in Washington to prepare the current visit
of President Hosni Mubarak, has made clear that Egypt would press
the U.S. to take a firm line with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Israel's biggest ally and sponsor of the peace
process, last week joined an international chorus of disapproval
over Israel's plan to build 6,500 Jewish homes on Har Homa, a
tree-covered hill in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
However, it vetoed the European-sponsored draft resolution
against the Israeli decision supported by other 14 U.N. Security
Council members.
</P>
<P>
"An active role to be played by the United States as an honest
broker should be promoted, should be preserved, because the role
is very much a must," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Egypt would never change its stand in support for the
Palestinian rights, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt as an Arab country and as the founder of the theory of a
just Arab-Israeli peace, has its commitments and obligations
towards the Palestinian cause," he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
He stressed nothing would make Egypt change its stand regarding
the Jewish settlements, Jerusalem or any other questions connected
with the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will tell the U.S. administration its stands which
believes in the importance of realizing a true peace, restoring
Palestinian rights and serving regional interest, he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians, outraged by the Israeli decision and frustrated
over the U.S. veto, has voiced doubt about Washington's
credibility as a fair mediator in the Mideast, in light of its
veto against the resolution that bans Israeli settlement in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak flew to the U.S. Saturday night on a five-day
visit. His talks with President Bill Clinton today will touch on
the peace process on all tracks and means to implement the Hebron
protocol.
</P>
<P>
But the focus of the Clinton-Mubarak summit will light on means
of promoting bilateral relations and boosting joint economic
cooperation, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also deal with joint cooperation in fields of
education and transfer of technology within the framework of the
Mubarak-Gore initiative of Egyptian-American partnership, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Filipinos to Get Tax Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs)
will get a 60,000 US dollar exemption under the tax reform bill
which the Philippine House of Representatives is set to approve
this week, officials of the House special committee on OFWs said
today.
</P>
<P>
Liban, chairman of the committee, said under the bill's
individual income tax component, OFWs as well as non-resident
Filipinos abroad will be allowed a tax exemption for the first
30,000 US dollars on their compensation income, and a personal
exemption of 30,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Income in excess of the 60,000 US dollar exemption plus the
income tax paid to the host country will be levied at one to three
percent, Liban said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this preferential tax treatment will provide
meaningful economic relief to our OFWs and their families, and at
the same time encourage them to file their income tax returns
regularly," Liban said.
</P>
<P>
Liban, meanwhile, sought the speedy passage of a bill proposing
to increase to 2,000 US dollars from 1,000 US dollars the regular
shopping privileges of returning OFWs in state-run duty-free
shops.
</P>
<P>
The bill also gives OFWs an additional 2,000 US dollars
duty-free shopping limit for livelihood equipment purchases and a

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Netanyahu Struggling to Head off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu is struggling to survive a coalition crisis
which could topple his government in the upcoming no-confidence
motion.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has held talks overnight with several rebellious
Knesset (Parliament) members from within the Likud-led coalition,
and is scheduled to meet more today in an attempt to persuade
them to refrain from voting for the non-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
So far eight Knesset members have declared to vote against
the government in the motion tabled by the opposition parties,
which is expected to take place Monday.
</P>
<P>
If they vote for the motion with the 54 opposition members,
the government could be brought down with a required 61 votes in
the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The rebellious lawmakers, all ultra-rightist hardliners,
include Uzi Landau, Likud's Chairman of the Knesset Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee, Deputy Education Minister Moshe
Peled of Tsomet, Zvi Hendel and Hanan Porat of the Oxthodox
National Religious Party.
</P>
<P>
They all denounced Netanyahu's handling of the further troop
redeployments on the West Bank and the Har Homa building project
in eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's cabinet approved Friday the hand-over of an
additional 9 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) in the first stage of the three-phase further
redeployments.
</P>
<P>
Among the 9 percent included 7 percent of Area B which is
under Israeli-Palestinian joint control, and 2 percent of Area C
which is under Israeli sole control.
</P>
<P>
The hardliners oppose any hand-over of Area C to the
PNA. Meanwhile, they are also angry about Netanyahu's decision to
delay the start of construction in Har Homa of southeastern
Jerusalem because of the increasing Palestinian and international
pressure.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Netanyahu's agreement to hand over more
land to the PNA was aimed at appeasing its anger over his
decision to build a settlement in Har Homa. Originally,
Netanyahu only promised to hand over 2 percent of the West Bank
to the PNA in the first stage pullback.
</P>
<P>
David Re'em, from Netanyahu's own Likud Party, called Friday
on Netanyahu to resign, citing that he had broken his election
promises and abandoned the party guidelines which uphold the
notion of Greater Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Meanwhile, in a move perhaps
aimed at preventing the possible government downfall, Netanyahu is
reportedly considering the option of forming a national unity
government with the opposition Labor Party. This could prevent
the Labor, biggest party in the Knesset, from voting against him.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported today that Netanyahu discussed this
issue with Labor leader and former premier Shimon Peres when
they met Thursday, although both have denied publicly such
discussion.
</P>
<P>
Peres, one of the leading architects of the peace process, is
publicly adopting the idea of national unity government in
the hope of saving the peace process which has been facing
consistent crisis since the Likud-led coalition came to power
last June.
</P>
<P>
For Peres, defeated by Netanyahu in the elections last May,
his time for final comeback to power is running out. The Labor
is to hold a congress this June to elect a new leader, former
chief of staff and foreign minister Ehud Barak is the top
leading contender.
</P>
<P>
But under an inner party deal, Barak agreed to let Peres to
lead the unity government on condition that such government
should be formed by the end of this year. Otherwise, Peres will
be forced to retire from the party.
</P>
<P>
Some dovish Likud activists also support forming a national
unity government. Michael Eitan, the coalition chairman in the
Knesset, has repeatedly called for the formation of a unity
government between Likud and Labor. He has called on the Labor
to delay the non-confidence vote because Netanyahu is due to
visit Russia Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, most Labor notables, including Barak, Yossi Beilin,
who is another strong contender for party leadership, and party
veteran Uzi Baram, oppose forming such a government with the
Likud.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a party rally Saturday, Beilin said that it would
be a mistake for the Labor to rescue the Likud government at this
time. "There is no reason in the world not to vote no-confidence
in this bad government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak also ruled out possibility of forming a unity
government now, saying "anyone who does so will be branded with
amark of disgrace." He regarded this as a good opportunity to
overthrow the Likud government which he described as
incompetent.

<HEADLINE> Asian Traders Urged to Invest More in Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary
Roberto de Ocampo urged the private sector of Asia to boost
investments and participation in the region's infrastructure
projects, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
finance and central bank deputies meeting in the southern city of
Cebu, De Ocampo said the share of private sector sponsorship in
the region's infrastructure projects is less than 10 percent of
the sector's total investments.
</P>
<P>
"This share must be raised," he said, adding that the private
sector must invest more in the infrastructure projects and
domestic capital markets.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo cited the huge financing requirement for
infrastructure development in the Asia-Pacific region is estimated
at 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars in the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
APEC finance and central bank deputies met at the Shangrila
Mactan Island Resort Hotel on Saturday and Sunday to discuss
issues which will be included in the final agenda of the APEC
Finance Ministers meeting in Cebu next month.
</P>
<P>
Possible issues to be discussed at the APEC finance ministers
meeting are capital flows, harmonization of taxes and customs
processes as well as the flow of money for illegitimate purposes.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo said he hopes the officials in April will come up
with a joint ministerial statement which will serve as a
blue-print from achieving reforms consistent with the Manila
Action Plan for APEC agreed by the APEC leaders in November last
year.

<HEADLINE> Manila Extends Ceasefire With National Democratic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government announced
today that it will extend its unilateral ceasefire with the
National Democratic Front (NDF) for another month as part of the
administration's confidence-building effort for peace in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the government said that the extension of the
unilateral suspension of offensive against the NDF will end at
mid-night of April 6.
</P>
<P>
This is the second extension of the government's unilateral
ceasefire with the NDF this year.
</P>
<P>
Last November, President Fidel Ramos declared a unilateral
suspension of military offensive against the NDF from December 1,
1996 to January 29 this year, and later this was extended to March
6.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Defense Secretary Renato de Villa said that the move
will "give the government the moral high ground especially in the
light of the resumption of our negotiations" with the NDF.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the unilateral ceasefire will not cover the
normal law enforcement functions and "shall be without prejudice
to actions aimed at protecting government troops and
installations."

85-meter, 1,600-tonne vessel on which is capable of carrying
various U.S. and European missile systems.
</P>
<P>
But he said a contract might be "a couple of years off."
Transfield completed in 1993 delivery to Kuwait of four 40-meter,
500-tonne coast guard vessels ordered prior to the 1991 Gulf war.

Al-Modhef said his ministry would soon finish a study on the
establishment of a free trade zone and welcomed an Australian
participation.

The two sides also discussed possible direct air links. "We
have negotiated on this and it is under consideration," Fischer
said.
</P>
<P>
Australia's exports to Kuwait rose to 127 million U.S. dollars
in 1996 from 66 million U.S. dollars in the previous year. Imports
from Kuwait in 1996 were worth 91 million U.S. dollars comparing
with 67 million U.S. dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Total Solar Eclipse Meets With Comet in Mohe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOHE (HEILONGJIANG), March 9 (Xinhua) -- A total solar eclipse
turned the day into "night" at 09:07:40 (010740 GMT) at Mohe
County of Heilongjiang Province, the northernmost part of China,
with the arrival a Hale-Bopp comet, the brightest comet which will
not reoccur for 3,000 years to come.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90,000 people, including Chinese and foreign scientists,
amateur star-gazers, journalists and local residents observed with
specially made observation cards the unique scene that lasted two
minutes and 40 seconds at the northern tip of China.
</P>
<P>
Before the total solar eclipse, the last one in this century,
the sun rose high, the sky was very clear and the ground was
covered with thick snow in Mohe.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the sun waned a little, then it became smaller and
smaller as a crescent. Finally it disappeared altogether. It
looked like a big black hole with dim-light silver lining.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Hale-Bopp comet arrived, extending its
long tail to the northwest.
</P>
<P>
Star-gazers felt colder at the moment and a meterological
expert told Xinhua that the temperature at the moment dropped from
27 degrees centigrade below zero to 30 degrees centigrade below
zero.
</P>
<P>
Shen Haizhang, an astronomer at Beijing Observatory, told
Xinhua that "we get more information from the total solar eclipse
in Mohe as the whole period is much longer than the previous ones
and the sky is much clearer. And we saw clearly the sunspots and
the Mercury nearby."
</P>
<P>
He had observed two total solar eclipses, one in Xinjiang in
1968 and the other in Yunnan Province in 1980. Each of their
processes lasted only about one minute and the sky was not clear
enough at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Li Qibin, president of Beijing Observatory and China
Astronomical Society, said "the simultaneous occurrence of a total
solar eclipse and the close encounter of a comet is really a
rarely seen phenomenon which only occurred twice in history, one
on May 17, 1882 in Egypt and the other on May 20, 1947 in Brazil,
according to the astronomical history."
</P>
<P>
He said a comet is a kind of small celestial body which is made
of stone, ice pieces and dust. When it approaches the sun, it
would appear with a long, brilliant tail.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen units including Beijing Observatory,
Nanjing-based Purple Mountain Observatory have established four
observation sites in Mohe, which was believed to be the world's
best place for observing the total solar eclipse and comet meeting
this time.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yuying, an expert at Beijing Observatory, told Xinhua that
radio telescopes and computers have successfully recorded energy
transformations during the solar eclipse.
</P>
<P>
Ye Shuhua, a famous scientist, said, "This is not only an
extraordinary phenomenon that shows the movements of the sun and
the moon and enables people to see comet in daytime, but also a
golden opportunity for researches on solar eclipse's impacts on
the earth magnetic filed and ionized stratum."
</P>
<P>
Since the town is surrounded by hills and the sky could be
affected by dense smoke from kitchen chimneys in the morning which
is affected by low atmospheric pressure, the county government
banned home fires from early morning until the end of the solar
eclipse before noon. The move won ardent support from the local
residents.
</P>
<P>
This solar eclipse began at 08:44 a.m. between south of Biysk
in Russia and Altay Prefecture in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, continued across Mongolia and achieved totality in Mohe
and passed over the eastern part of Russia and the Siberian Sea
before concluding above the Arctic Sea.
</P>
<P>
According to scientific calculation, the next total solar
eclipse will be witnessed in northwestern China in 2008.

KAMPALA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- V1 Tree Planting, a Swedish based
non-governmental organization operating in Uganda is to get a
grant of 9,500 U.S. Dollars from the Swedish International
Development Agency (SIDA) to help it to plant trees.
</P>
<P>
President of the organization Gideon Barigye was quoted by
today's ''Monitor'' daily as saying that his organization will
use the grant to promote tree planting in Uganda's southwestern
district of Masaka where V1 Tree Planting has planted hundreds of
trees.
</P>
<P>
V1 Tree Planting has had projects in Rakai district, about 40
kilometers south of Masaka for the last six years -- supporting
three nurseries in different sub-counties. The major objective of
V1 is to fight desertification.
</P>
<P>
The trees act as wind breakers and stop soil erosion, provide
fodder for animal, and can be used as fuel for households.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is losing its forest cover at an alarming rate.
Statistics show that the country's forest cover had dwindled from
14 percent of its total land area in 1967 to seven percent at
present. Due to the situation, some parts of Uganda are
threatened by desertification.

In rural areas, family planning should be tied to promoting the
economy, helping farmers become prosperous through diligent work,
and making civilized and happy families, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the management of the floating population
is another major problem for family planning.
</P>
<P>
He urged the authorities of the residential areas of the
floating population to take charge of carrying out family planning
policies among those people.
</P>
<P>
The preparation for the 23rd General Population Conference,
which will open in Beijing in October, is another major task for
this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the first of its kind in China, will be jointly
sponsored by the Demographic Society of China, the State Family
Planning Commission and the International Union of the Scientific
Study of Population.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the improved family planning work has kept the
birth rate and the natural growth rate of China's population in
1996 on a par with that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The project of tackling key scientific and technological
problems in family planning for the 1996-2000 period has started,
with the help of an additional state investment of 25 million yuan
(about three million US dollars), he added.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-2000 period, there will be an average annual
increase of 12 million people in China, and the total population
will rise to some 1.27 billion by the year 2000, according to a
lastest forecast from the State Statistics Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Former PAC President Stripped of Parliamentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Former Pan Africanist
Congress (PAC) president Clarence Makwetu has been stripped of
his parliamentary seat, serving another severe blow to the
veteran's political career, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
The decision to sack Makwetu from parliament "with immediate
effect" was made at an extraordinary meeting of the PAC National
Working Committee (NWC) in Johannesburg on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu, 69, now PAC national chairman, was ousted as PAC
president during the party's congress in Thohoyandou, Northern
Province last December and replaced by former Methodist cleric,
Bishop Stanley Mogoba.
</P>
<P>
According to PAC inside sources, Makwetu's sacking came
following recent intensifying Makwetu/Mogoba differences within
the organization.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu was allegedly charged by the PAC of "misconduct,
insubordination and bringing the organization into disrepute" and
would have to appear before the PAC's disciplinary committee for
his utterances at the Sobukwe Day rally last week.
</P>
<P>
During the commemoration service of PAC's founding president
Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe, Makwetu addressed a mass rally in
Sobukwe's birthplace in Graaff-Reinet, where he was still
referred to as the party's "president", to counter the rally
addressed by Mogoba in East London.
</P>
<P>
However, Makwetu, currently on a tour of Kenya as part of a
government delegation, did not make any comment on his dismissal
from parliament after he was reportly informed of the decision
faxed to him via the South African embassy in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu had earlier been ordered by the PAC not to go to Kenya
as an urgent NWC meeting, where his fate was going to be decided,
was to be held, but he allegedly defied the PAC and left with the
government delegation, said the source.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Pakistan, Philippines to Develop All Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and the Philippines are
heading towards developing all-round ties by enhancing cooperation
in various fields, including trade and commerce, nuclear research
and defense.
</P>
<P>
As a major achievement of Philippine President Fidel Ramos'
three-day visit to Pakistan, the two countries signed two
agreements to establish policy consultation talks and strengthen
cooperation in peaceful use of atomic energy.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and the Philippines have also agreed to set up a
business council to explore ways to boost their trade and
commercial ties. Ramos has asked Pakistan to send a business
delegation to Manila to find ways of further promoting bilateral
trade.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Ramos held wide-ranging talks with
Pakistani leaders on regional and international matters of mutual
concern, including the Kashmir issue and bilateral defense
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here last night, the Philippine
President said his country welcomed emerging hopes of a thaw in
strained relations between Pakistan and India and that the
Philippines was ready to play a helpful role.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the agreement between Pakistan and India to hold
foreign secretary-level talks after a gap of three years, Ramos
said that "we are encouraged by the trend toward rapprochement"
between the two South Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said, "We are strictly neutral over the Kashmir dispute,"
over which Pakistan and India fought two of the three wars between
them since their independence in 1947. He added that the
Philippines hoped "negotiation, not fighting, will be a solution
to the Kashmir issue."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and the Philippines are also expected to enhance their
cooperation in combating international terrorism, drug trafficking
and money-laundering.
</P>
<P>
A treaty between Pakistan and the Philippines on cooperation in
these fields was of prime importance, Ramos said, adding that the
Philippines was willing to host an international conference on
these issues.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are also negotiating an extradition treaty,
and according to Ramos, both sides have been in consultation for a
long time and are working to finalize details.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who arrived here Friday on a three-day visit, is the
second head of state of the Philippines to visit this South Asian
nation in almost four decades.
</P>
<P>
During his formal talks with President Farooq Leghari and Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, Ramos said the Philippines supported
Pakistan's bid to participate in the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) dialogue process as sectoral dialogue
partner.
</P>
<P>
The linkages between ASEAN and the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could be explored for mutual benefit,
Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
During Ramos' stay in Pakistan, the two countries also
discussed their cooperation in the field of defense. "We encourage
defense cooperation" between the two countries, Ramos told the
press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippines might purchase small arms from Pakistan
as the latter has the expertise in this field.
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippine president said the highlight of his
meetings with President Leghari, Prime Minister Sharif and
businessmen was on promoting economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ramos expressed his appreciation for the new political
development in Pakistan and measures taken by the new government
here towards opening up, privatization and deregulation in a bid
to improve the national economy.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Pakistan and the Philippines have entered a
new era of all-round cooperation. Bilateral trade links, which
have been developing soundly in the last few years, are to be
further strengthened.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Lake Wamala Dying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 9 (Xinhua)-- Lake Wamala, about 60 kilometers
west of Kampala is dying with its shoreline receding by more than
half a kilometer in some places, reported ''the Monitor'' daily
today.
</P>
<P>
Its depth has decreased from an average of 4.3 meters to 1.7
meters, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The lake, covering 180 square kilometers in Mubendi district,
is slowly but steadily drying and dying due to the constantly
changing climatic conditions in the district mainly influenced by
long period of drought, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Four rivers -- Mpamujugu, Nyanzi, Kabasuma and Bulonda -- had
poured into the lake for a long time, but today the latter two
have dried up due to the longer dry seasons and secondly, because
of encroachment of water catchment areas by farmers, said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time that the lake is drying up, but given
the climatic conditions, this may mark the death of the lake as
most have been turned into swamps.
</P>
<P>
according to an environmental survey report, due to soil
erosion, siltation of lakes, rivers and streams in Uganda is very
serious. The water level of Lake Victoria, over 40 percent of it
belonging to Uganda has gone down as many as two meters. Some
other lakes including Kyoga and Wamala have been reportedly
reduced to huge shallow ponds.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Women Ask for More Parliamentary Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan women have called for a
legislation to reserve 25 percent of the national parliamentary
seats for women, the Sunday Times said today.
</P>
<P>
During the celebrations to mark the International Women Day
held here on Saturday, Cabinet Minister Nyiva Mwendwa urged the
government to draw a draft legislation which will reserve 25
percent of parliamentary seats to women.
</P>
<P>
She said that such a move would strengthen gender equality in
development and provide for the much needed gender policy
framework.
</P>
<P>
The women attending the celebrations immediately declared
their support for a minimum of 50 women parliamentary contestants
in the forthcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Kenyan women organization chairlady Zippora
Kittony said, her organization "has decided that it will support
women who will vie for parliamentary seats in the coming general
elections since the existing six women MPs we have are too few to
represent the wider interest of the entire women population in
the country."
</P>
<P>
Mwendwa, Minister for Culture and Social Service, noted that
"what we want is to be given equal opportunities with men in
terms of education, politics and leadership positions in work
places."

<HEADLINE> Zambia Disposes Obsolete, Banned Pesticides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia today starts disposing
obsolete and banned pesticides that are dangerous to people's
life and environment.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Zambia has over 400 tons of obsolete
pesticides, some of which date back to the early 1970s, and these
include Organo-Chlorine compounds such as DDT and Dierin which
have been banned in many parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka alone accounts for 300 tons of these obsolete chemicals
whose stock date back to the 1980s and are close to the main
water bore holes of an industrial area and next to the main grain
storage.
</P>
<P>
The need to dispose these chemicals came after the
Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ) had noticed that they had
a potential to pollute the environment and endanger life.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka ECZ senior education and communications officer
Shadreck Nsongela recently said, ''the obsolete pesticides were
not safely secured and looked after. The packages they were in
were breaking down, posing danger to the environment.''
</P>
<P>
The obsolete pesticides can be easily washed down into the
underground water systems which are sources of drinking waters.
In November 1995, the government discovered traces of DDT,
Endisulfan, Lindane and Diuron near a stock in Lusaka and it was
feared that they would be hazardous to human life in the long run
if the pesticides were allowed to be in the open for too long.
</P>
<P>
The ECZ has sourced 1.2 million U.S. Dollars for the project
to be undertaken by a British firm.

WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of
Spain defeated Italian Silvia Farina 6-4, 6-2 to reach the third
round of the Indian Wells tennis tournament on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez' victory over Farina, ranked 40th in the world, took an
hour and 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
She broke the Italian in the ninth game of the first set to
take a 5-4 lead and served out for the set. She finally took a 4-1
lead in the second set after squandering a 0-40 lead in the fifth
game.
</P>
<P>
Two errant groundstrokes by Farina gave Sanchez match point, on
which Farina netted a backhand.
</P>
<P>
In other second-round matches Argentina's Florencia Labat
rallied for a 1-6, 7-5, 7-5 victory over eighth-seeded South
African Amanda Coetzer. She advanced to a third-round clash with
France's Sandrine Testud.
</P>
<P>
The unseeded Testud upset 16th-seeded Lisa Raymond 5-7, 6-3,
6-4 -- her second comeback victory in as many matches.
</P>
<P>
Testud won the see-saw battle in one hour and 58 minutes,
breaking Raymond to love in the ninth game of the third set for a
5-4 lead and serving out the match to the dismay of the loudly
pro-Raymond crowd.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Seeks Chinese Partner to Manage Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government is looking
for a Chinese partner to manage the 25-million-dollar Sino-Swiss
Partnership Fund, according to a report in today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Swiss governments agreed last November to
launch the fund -- with 20 percent Chinese and 80 percent Swiss
equity -- to finance joint-venture projects in China with small
Swiss firms as investors, the report quoted Swiss ambassador to
China Uli Sigg as saying.
</P>
<P>
Swiss investors have about 300 projects in China, with
blockbuster companies, such as Nestle Coffee, elevator maker
Schindler, electric giant ABB and pharmaceutical producer Ciba
Geigy, operating successfully.
</P>
<P>
"However, lack of resources makes it hard for small and
medium-sized Swiss firms to be here in China," Sigg said, adding
that it is time-consuming and costly to commute between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese partners in the fund will be able to save Swiss
investors such troubles and will contribute to the projects'
success, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the Swiss government also made it possible for
Chinese importers to draw 45 million US dollars in mixed Swiss
credits, he said.
</P>
<P>
Concessional loans subsidized by the Swiss government make up
40 percent of the mixed credits.

<P>
TIRANA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The leader of a delegation from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on
Saturday called on the Albanian government to extend for another
48 hours the deadline for rebels to turn in weapons, allowing more
time for political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Heading an OSCE mission to try to mediate an end to the
seven-week crisis in Albania, former Austrian Chancellor Franz
Vranitzky said President Sali Berisha was taking a flexible
attitude in considering his proposals.
</P>
<P>
A 48-hour ceasefire ordered by Berisha expires at 6 a.m. local
time on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky, on the eve of his departure, said that he offered a
number of proposals to Berisha, but did not achieve the expected
objectives. He did not explain what the expected objectives were.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, the latest of a string of international
efforts to restore peace in the Balkan nation, Vranitzky held
separate and "very extensive" talks with Berisha and leaders of
major opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky said Berisha was considering extending the ceasefire
and holding new elections.
</P>
<P>
"He was very open to the idea and will give it very serious
thought. He could even imagine that it (the truce) could be longer
than 48 hours," Vranitzky said after a second round of talks with
the Albanian president.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE mediator said he had urged Berisha to continue
round-table negotiations with the opposition parties on the
latter's demand of forming a broader-based government, and to set
up a caretaker cabinet to oversee a parliamentary polls later this
year.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE also offered to send a group to help the Albanian
government with the arms surrender of rebels.
</P>
<P>
Berisha, re-elected to a second five-year term last Monday by
the parliament dominated by his Democratic Party, had proposed to
hold elections within 45 days. But opposition parties said polls
would be impossible in the current emergency state.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky said Berisha welcomed the OSCE offer to help
overseeing the surrender of rebel arms and, softening his earlier
stance, agreed to hold elections as long as public order is
restored.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky said no international financial aid program could be
worked out nor closer EU-Albanian cooperation be sought unless the
violence in the country was ended completely.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE mission followed attempts by two other Western
delegations to mediate in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van Mierlo, whose country is
holding the European Union presidency, led a delegation to Albania
on Friday and urged Berisha and oppositions to pursue dialogue and
refrain from violence.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, a European Commission mission also visited
Albania and proposed international financial institutions work out
and implement "an emergency aid package".

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper was forced today to cancel his visit to the city of
Barrancabermeja in the northeast of the country, when an
assassination attempt was discovered.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said that the army disactivated mines this

would pass.
</P>
<P>
"Nueva Granada" Battalion commander Col. Pedro Reyes Cardenas
said that according to intelligence reports, the guerrilla group
National Liberation Army (ELN) was responsible for the attempt.
</P>
<P>
After a technical stop in the Barranca Bermeja airport,
President Samper boarded a helicopter to Santa Rosa del Sur
without entering the city.
</P>
<P>
This is the second assassination attempt against Samper in
Colombia within a month.

The last one occurred on February 12 when an explosive charge
detonated three kilometers from the Barranquilla airport, some
minutes before the presidential plane would land at the airport.

friendly visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport,
Gen. Wang said in a written statement that the Chinese government
and the Chinese armed forces attach great importance to the
development of friendship between China and Malaysia, which is not
only in keeping with the aspirations and the common interests of

stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>

The aim of the current visit, he said, is to maintain
high-level contact between the armed forces of the two countries,
further promote mutual understanding and trust, and strengthen
friendship and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> High Risk of HIV Infection From Breast Milk: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- About 25 to 50 percent of newly
born babies who escape infection from their HIV-positive mothers
at birth are likely to be infected through breast milk, the
Sunday Mail paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Deputy Minister of Health and Child Welfare
Tsungirirai Hungwe told the paper that recent studies have shown
children are now at risk of contracting the HIV virus from breast
milk which for years was regarded as safe and could not carry the
virus.
</P>
<P>
She said between 25 and 30 percent of babies were infected
through birth (vertical transmission) from an HIV-positive
mother, and 25 to 50 percent of those not infected at birth will
be infected through breast milk.
</P>
<P>
These findings come as Zimbabwe is experiencing its highest
number of AIDS-related deaths. About 500,000 women are said to be
infected with the HIV virus and 150,000 of them were expected to
pass the virus on to their children if they breast-fed.
</P>
<P>
The research carried out by the Blair Institute and Oxford
University had shown that if zimbabwe continues without taking
any action to curb the current trend, the population would either
become static or, worse still, decline.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Sees "No Risk of Delaying" in EMU Launching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said today that he saw "no risk of delaying" in the launching
of European Union's planned economic and monetary union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of an Italo-British seminar, Dini said that
for the moment he could see no signs of a delay to EMU, which is
supposed to be launched on January 1, 1999 after the member
selection scheduled for early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the chances of Italy not becoming an EMU member in
the first batch, Dini said, "it would be a great defeat that we
cannot afford."
</P>
<P>
He added, "the costs of trying to catch up with the Euro train
would be much higher later than they are now."
</P>
<P>
Dini noted that the goal of the EMU was so important for Italy
that it would take measures to come along, with or without the
agreement of the Communist Refoundation, the group which provides
its majority in Italy's lower house of parliament.

TEGUCIGALPA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Honduras
and El Salvador failed to reach agreement on the problem of the
Salvadoran wood cutters who live in the Honduran areas bordering
El Salvador, according to media reports here today.
</P>
<P>
A meeting attended by representatives from the two sides, which
ended Friday, examined the situation faced by the Salvadorans who
were stranded in the Nahuaterique Bolson, west of Honduras, by a
resolution of the International Court of The Hague.
</P>
<P>
Abel Salazar Rodezno, Salvadoran Foreign Ministry
representative to the meeting, said that an obstacle to the
agreement was the refusal of the Salvadorans lumbermen to pay
timber tax demanded by Honduras.
</P>
<P>
However, negotiations will be continued after the municipal and
legislative elections on March 16 in El Salvador.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Haitian Lt. Col. Joseph Michel
Francois, who participated in the coup that deposed Jean Bertrand
Aristide, will be deported to the United States on drug
trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
Considered by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) as one of
the biggest drug kingpins in the Antilles, Francois, 39, has been
living in Honduras since April 22, 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Washington which charges him of having
smuggled 33 tons of drugs into U.S. territory, the Honduran police
arrested him Friday in the industrial city of San Pedro Sula, in
the north of the country and now under DEA custody.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Gomez, regional director of Criminal Investigation of
Honduras, said today that the U.S. request was based on a
reciprocal judicial assistance agreement signed by the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the first investigations, Francois was using
Honduran territory as a bridge for transshipping cocaine and
heroin from the Caribbean toward Honduras and then sent the drugs
from clandestine airstrips to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Residents Begin Fleeing Prior Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of residents in southern
Albania, worrying about further conflicts, start fleeing abroad
today, with many more preparing for the similar as the government
deadline for rebels to turn in weapons draws nearer.
</P>
<P>
President Sali Berisha had required rebels to hand in all
weapons by 6 a.m. (0500 GMT) on Sunday, or face government
actions. But fearing punishment afterwards, rebels have rejected
the ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
About 150 women and children in the southern port of Saranda,
which is in the rebels' control, went on aboard a ship sailing to
the Greek island of Corfu, about 10 kilometers east of Albania.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Italian government today sent a second military
helicopter to Vlore, after its Monday rescue of 35 Italians living
there, and picked up Albanians seeking asylum.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring Greece and Italy, favorite destinations of the
Albanian refugees, have strengthened their coastal and land
borders to stop the influx of panic-stricken Albanians, who
flocked in without visas.
</P>
<P>
The United States also asked about 1,600 American citizens in
Albania not to leave their houses and required them to go back to
the United States at the earliest convenience.
</P>
<P>
After two weeks of protests and violent riots, sparked by the
collapse of pyramid get-rich-quick investment schemes in January,
armed rebels hold sway in most of the southern region, including
Vlore, Saranda, Delvine and Gjirokaster.
</P>
<P>
Armed with heavy machine guns, tanks and even torpedo boats and
warships, looted from government arsenals, the rebels are busy
beefing up defenses.
</P>
<P>
The rebels vowed never to give up until Berisha resigns, an
early general election is called and full compensation is made to
hundreds of thousands of Albanians for their savings lost.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the government ordered a 48-hour suspension of
military actions starting from 6 a.m. Friday, and guaranteed the
rebels amnesty if they surrender arms before the deadline.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Tycoons on Investing in Inland Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Investing in inland areas of China
represents enormous opportunities for Hong Kong businesses, said a
well-known Hong Kong tycoon who has large investments in many
parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Gao Jingde, chairman of the board of directors of Sunbase
International (holdings) Ltd, said Hong Kong businessmen should
explore new opportunities in parts of China other than its coastal
areas since, with rising wages and the upgrading of industries,
operation in the latter will involve higher costs in years to
come.
</P>
<P>
According to Gao, who is in Beijing for the ongoing session of
the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), hundreds of thousands of joint
ventures have been established by Hong Kong businessmen in China's
booming coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
The vast inland areas have rich mineral and manpower resources
and a solid industrial foundation, he said. These, coupled with
the strategic shift of economic development from the coastal areas
to the central and western regions encouraged by the Chinese
government, enable inland areas to have great development
potential and vitality, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu Fa-kuang, chairman of the board of directors of Ryodn
Machinery Co. Ltd of Hong Kong, said Hong Kong businessmen should
take full advantage of their business connections by introducing
new and high technologies as well as capital from overseas and
further cut down on production costs by investing in inland areas.
</P>
<P>
As one of the first businessmen who invested in inland areas of
China, Gao Jingde summed up the secret of his success as focusing
on technological upgrading by making optimal use of the excellent
technological foundation of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
By now, Gao and the firm in which he and his partner have a
controlling interest have invested three billion yuan in interior
areas for the upgrading of a dozen state-owned enterprises in
Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Xinjiang and Hebei.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 his firm invested in the upgrading of the Harbin
Bearing Factory. After only one year of joint venturing, the
factory's profit increased by 30 percent to reach 130 million
yuan. By the year 1998, his investment in the factory is expected
to top 750 million yuan with 1.5 billion yuan in output value and
400 million yuan in profits and taxes.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Advocate Thriftiness, Hard Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese people should still
practice thrift and work hard although their living standard is on
the rise thanks to the country's fast economic development.
</P>
<P>
When 58 million peasants are still living under the poverty
line, deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) said,
thriftiness and hard work are a sensible means to help them get
rid of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from both economically developed and underdeveloped
areas concurred that it is hard work that lifted the country from
the trauma of decades of wars when the People's Republic was
founded 47 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Although the 18 years of reform and opening-up have greatly
promoted China's economic and social development, they pointed
out, it is still a developing nation, and the wide-spread practice
of wealth parading on the part of both government departments and
the business community must be held in check.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from the poorer central and western regions said hard
work and self-reliance are especially needed in the fight against
backwardness.

Wang Jiufu, a deputy from Yan'an, a revolutionary base for the
Chinese communists in the 1940s, said advocating hard work is not to
require people to live an ascetic life, but rather to bear
hardships and stand hard work when building the country.

<P>
On the way to fulfilling the state plan for national economic
and social development for the 1996-2000 period, and long-range
goals through the year 2010, deputies said, the Chinese people
will meet unprecedented difficulties and unimaginable obstacles,
which precisely require people to work hard and spend the limited
amount of funds on where it is most needed.

<P>
KATHMANDU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve
Gowda's visit to Nepal, originally scheduled for March 14-16, has
been postponed indefinitely, unconfirmed reports said here today.
</P>
<P>
The postponement of Gowda's three-day official visit apparently
resulted from the resignation of Nepal's coalition government led
by Sher Bahadur Deuba after he lost a confidence vote in
parliament Thursday.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra has called for the formation of an alternative
government with majority parliamentary support by Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The political situation here remains uncertain as major
political parties are busy holding talks with each other on the
formation of a new, stable ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
No officials were available for confirming the postponement of
Gowda's visit because of the three consecutive public holidays
here since Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian prime minister was scheduled to inaugurate an Indian
Trade Fair in Kathmandu on the day of his arrival.

<HEADLINE> Sino-GM Mid-Size Car Project To Be Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp
(SAIC) and US-based General Motors (GM) are expected to sign a
contract for a one-billion-dollar mid-size car manufacturing joint
venture, according to a report in today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will be China's largest mid-size car maker,
producing 100,000 vehicles per year in Shanghai. It is expected to
help the country end decade-long dependence on mid-size car
imports, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The contract of the project, which has been approved by the
State Council last month, will be signed as soon as the Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) endorses it.
</P>
<P>
"The project would be globally competitive in product quality,
cost and technology," the report quoted GM Vice-President Rudolph
Schlais as saying.
</P>
<P>
Schlais said the project was an example of GM's promise to
bring the latest technology to China. At least 40 percent of 2.5-
and 3.0-liter cars would be made from domestic parts.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts predict domestic demand for mid-size cars will
constitute 11.3 percent of the demand for 1.2 million passenger
cars in the year 2000, compared with nine percent this year and
eight percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Schlais said GM expected the project to control half of the
market share in 2000, and within the next five years the project
should be able to design and produce new cars.
</P>
<P>
"GM has a long-term commitment to China's automotive industry
and economy and will use its global systems and resources to help
the Shanghai Project," Schlais said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Automotive and GM are to evaluate 400 Chinese supliers
for the project and help them update their equipment. So far, 50
have been chosen.

ROME, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said today that the Albanian crisis has demonstrated that the
European Union should take up its own diplomatic responsibilities
and develop rapid reaction capabilities, including the use of
force.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Venice, Dini said that the Albanian crisis is a
classic Europe post-Cold War crisis which is too far from the
United States to interest it, while too close to Europe for it to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Dini said, to tackle problems like the one prosed by
Albania, the Union needs its own foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian Government resigned recently following the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes that led to armed conflicts
in the southern part of the country.

PYONGYANG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the Democratic

broadcasting of "Radio Free Asia" of the United States.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Korean Central News Agency, the
government spokesman said that the radio broadcasting, which
started in Korean a few days ago, is aimed at imposing American
values and decadent ideas and culture on the country.

This shows the U.S. policy of antagonizing and stifling the
DPRK remains unchanged, and is getting even more pronounced with
the passage of time, he said.
</P>
<P>
The more false propaganda the U.S. makes against the DPRK, the
stronger the Korean people's anti-imperialist sentiments, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called on all Asian countries to "smash the
imperialist ideological and cultural infiltration."
</P>
<P>
"We, together with all other Asian countries, will maintain our
independent policy of defending Asia's unique time-honored
traditions and culture," he said.

<HEADLINE> German Coal Miners Continue Protest Over Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Over 5,000 German coal miners held
demonstrations today in the western German states of North
Rhine-Westfalia and Saarland to protest a government plan to trim
federal subsidies to the hard coal industry.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that miners staged work stoppages
and gathered for a rally in Duesseldorf, capital of North
Rhine-Westfalia, this morning.
</P>
<P>
Coal mines were laid idle today in Saarland where some 250
miners gathered for a protest rally at a traffic circle near the
Ensdorf pit.
</P>
<P>
Protests were also staged Friday at several mines in both
states after the German government announced one day earlier its
plan to gradually reduce subsidies to coal mining from about 10
billion marks (5.8 billion U.S. dollars) a year currently to 5.5
billion marks (3.19 billion dollars) in the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Apart from miners' protests, this plan also triggered strong
opposition from political leaders of North Rhine-Westfalia and
Saarland, both of which are run by the Social Democratic Party
(SPD), the main opposition in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
North Rhine-Westfalia Economics Minister Wolfgang Clement
warned that if Bonn's subsidy cuts were completely carried out, it
would mean that seven mines in the state would have to be closed
by the year 2000 and another three would be lost by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Some cities in the Ruhr heavy industrial area would face
unemployment levels of about 25 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine today also said that his party
would not agree to any plan which would result in mass job losses.
</P>
<P>
Triggering Bonn's need to cut subsidies was a German Supreme
Court ruling in 1994 declaring unconstitutional the so-called
"coal penny," a surcharge on households' electricity bills to
finance some 7 billion marks' (4.06 dollars') worth of purchases
of hard coal for electric utilities.
</P>
<P>
Despite the massive support, German-produced hard coal has
dropped in importance. It was reported that hard coal production
now covers only 17 percent of Germany's energy consumption,
compared with 70 percent in 1957. Coal output has also dropped
from 149 million tons to 50 million tons during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The number of employees in the mining sector has plunged from
600,000 in 1957 to just less than 90,000 today.
</P>
<P>
Although the coal production cost in Germany runs much higher
than that in other countries, the industry is kept alive by
subsidies to avoid unrest in the heavily unionized sector, German
media reports quoted analysts as saying.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Plans to Sell 91 Companies By Mid-1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian government intends to
sell 91 companies by the end of June 1998 as a bid to pick up the
pace of the privatization process, Minister of Public Sector Atef
Obeid said today.
</P>
<P>
Obeid, also Minister of State for Administrative Development
and Environment, said today that altogether shares of 30 companies
will be traded on the stock market while the remaining 61 will be
sold to investors, according to the Egyptian MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
In a report addressed to a two-day conference on challenges
facing the Arab world in the global economy, Obeid said that there
is a growing trend in the process of privatization to sell
companies to investors so that they can run these companies better.
</P>
<P>
The beginning of this year has witnessed a big leap in the
privatization process as the shares of 36 public enterprise
companies were sold, he said.
</P>
<P>
Obeid said that since the beginning of the privatization
program, three companies were sold entirety to investors while 10
others were sold to workers' unions and 11 companies were
liquidated.
</P>
<P>
The government is concentrating on the main challenges facing
privatization, namely, how to attract big investors, settle the
problems associated with the extra-workers and promote public
confidence in privatization, he said.
</P>
<P>
The success made so far encourages the government to carry on
with the implementation of the process till its very end, he said.
</P>
<P>
The revenues of the public enterprises jumped from 41 billion
Egyptian pounds (12.06 billion U.S. dollars) in 1990 to 63 billion
pounds (18.53 billion dollars) in 1995 while the number of workers
went down from 1.083 million to almost 900,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the public sector still controls 70 percent of
the country's industry, especially in the vital sectors of metal,
cement and wheat powder refining.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts said privatization, a vital part of Egypt's
reform program since 1991, has positively contributed to the
country's improved economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, now in full swing of the reform process, has taken
serious steps towards privatization since 1993 by either selling
part of the profit-losing companies to their employees or putting
them on the public market.
