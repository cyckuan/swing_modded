The region's present northeast boundary line runs between the
Dapeng peninsula on the side of Guangdong and Ping Chau islet on
the side of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
There are altogether 35 points along the boundary line which
was agreed on between Guangdong and Hong Kong through

the new map is "for the convenience of administration and
navigation", the officials explained.
</P>

The standard official map of HKSAR has been drawn up by the
State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping in three versions, with
scales of 1:100,000, 1:500,000 and 1:750,000, and in two languages

<P>
Hong Kong has been China's territory since ancient times.
Britain established colonial rule in Hong Kong away by forcing the
government of the Qing Dynasty to sign three unequal treaties in
1842, 1860 and 1898.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the governments of China and Britain signed a joint
declaration on the Hong Kong question, which proclaims that the
Chinese government will resume the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
All of China has been bustling with activity in anticipation of
the day that would put an end to more than 100 years of national
humiliation. Lanterns and colored streamers are hanging in shops
and office buildings, and various celebrations have been held to
exhibit the Chinese people's pride.
</P>
<P>
People throughout the country marked the great event in a
variety of festive activities, many staying up all night to watch
live TV broadcasts of the historic handover.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, the enthusiasm of the crowd of 100,000 turned
Tiananmen Square into a sea of revelry.
</P>
<P>
Only one minute before the zero hour of July 1, many people
stood to the east of the square facing the digital countdown clock
ticking off the seconds until Hong Kong's return. They chanted in
unison from 60 to 1.
</P>
<P>
When the board showed all zeros, the cheers of the jubilant
crowd mingled with the swelling sounds of music which could be
heard miles away.
</P>
<P>
At Jinghai Temple in the city of Nanjing, where the unequal
Nanking Treaty to cede Hong Kong was negotiated, people took the
155th and final strike on the "Warning Bell" at the zero hour of
July 1, symbolizing the end of 155 years of national humiliation.

<HEADLINE> PLA Troops Take Up Defense Duties in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The national flag of the People's
Republic of China (PRC) was hoisted at zero hour today over the
Tamar Barracks, signaling to the world that the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) troops have officially taken over defense
duties in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A solemn flag-hoisting ceremony was held at 23:58'50 on June 30
at the site of the former headquarters of the British Forces in
Hong Kong at Tamar, also known as the Prince of Wales Barracks,
which was brightly lit.
</P>
<P>
At zero hour on July 1 (Beijing time), the national anthem of
the People's Republic of China was played, while three soldiers
hoisted the national flag. More than 100 officers and men of PLA
ground, naval and air forces lined up in formation and stood in
salute to the fluttering five-star red flag.
</P>
<P>
At 23:58 on June 30, the Chinese and British sides held a
simple defense duties handover ceremony, with 22 officers and
soldiers from each side participating.
</P>
<P>
After the hoisting of the national flag, Major General Xiong
Ziren, political commissar of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison, said in
a brief address, "The sacred moment which the Chinese nation
yearned for so long has arrived, and we hoist the red flag over
Hong Kong now."
</P>
<P>
He noted that this historic moment marks the complete end of a
156- year history of humiliation for Hong Kong, and signals the
Chinese government's resumption of its exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, this also signifies that the PLA Hong Kong
Garrison has taken up defense duties in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, and started to implement the sacred mission
entrusted by the people of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"We will conscientiously implement the principle of 'one
country, two systems', keep our mission in mind, live up to
people's expectation, remain always loyal to the motherland,
strictly perform our defense duties, and resolutely safeguard the
sovereignty and dignity of the motherland and the long-term
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on his troops to step up army building in an
all-round way, so as to keep raising the capabilities to perform
defense duties and keep up the good image of a powerful and
civilized army in line with the instructions of Chairman Jiang
Zemin of the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday evening, the British troops held a "sunset" or
farewell ceremony at Tamar East and lowered the Union Jack.
</P>
<P>
Flag-raising ceremonies were held in 13 other barracks taken
over by the PLA Hong Kong Garrison, including those at
Stonecutters Island, Gun Club Hill, Shek Kong and Stanley.
</P>
<P>
The Tamar Barracks is centered around the 28-story building,
which, built in 1979, served as the headquarters of the British
Forces in Hong Kong. Tamar was named after a British warship,
which landed the British forces on Hong Kong Island in 1841.

office said in Mannheim, Germany, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Graf, 58, was sentenced to three years, nine months in prison
on January 24 but had remained free along with his former tax
adviser and co-defendant Joachim Eckardt pending appeals both by
their lawyers and the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Both appeals were dropped in mid-June, paving the way for Graf
to be ordered back to prison from which he had been released in
November while awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
Graf must go to Stuttgart-Stammheim prison on July 28, where
the decision on the location of his prison will be made.
</P>
<P>
During his time awaiting trial the courts systematically
rejected his pleas for conditional release, citing fears that he
might abscond.
</P>
<P>
Given the 15 months that he has already spent in custody, and a
remission for good behaviour, Graf could be out of jail again by
September next year.
</P>
<P>
Eckardt, who was given two years and six months in prison, is
due to resume his sentence at the same time, Kuehner said
earlier. Because of the 13 months he has already spent in prison,
he may only have to serve another six months before being released.
</P>
<P>
The Mannheim court exonerated Steffi Graf in the affair, in
which Graf and Eckardt were found to have evaded taxes totalling
12 million German marks (7.5 million dollars) on the tennis
champion's earnings between 1989 and 1993.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Jiang's Speech at Hong Kong Handover Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of a
speech made by Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the ceremony for
the handover of Hong Kong early this morning:

SPEECH BY H.E. PRESIDENT JIANG ZEMIN OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF
CHINA AT THE CEREMONY FOR THE HANDOVER OF HONG KONG HELD BY THE
CHINESE AND BRITISH GOVERNMENTS
 1 July 1997

Your Royal Highness Prince Charles,
Prime Minister Tony Blair,
Distinguished Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
</P>
<P>
The national flag of the People's Republic of China and the
regional flag of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of
the People's Republic of China have now solemnly risen over this
land. At this moment, people of all countries in the world are
casting their eyes on Hong Kong. In accordance with the
Sino-British Joint Declaration on the question of Hong Kong, the
two governments have held on schedule the handover ceremony to
mark China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong and the official establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. This is
both a festival for the Chinese nation and a victory for the
universal cause of peace and justice.
</P>
<P>
Thus, July 1, 1997 will go down in the annals of history as a
day that merits eternal memory. The return of Hong Kong to the
motherland after going through more than one century of
vicissitudes indicates that from now on, Hong Kong compatriots
have become true masters of this Chinese land and that Hong Kong
has now entered a new era of development.
</P>
<P>
History will remember Mr. Deng Xiaoping for his creative
concept of "one country, two systems." It is precisely along the
course envisaged by this great concept that we have successfully
resolved the Hong Kong question through diplomatic negotiations
and finally achieved Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
On this solemn occasion, I wish to express thanks to all the
personages in both China and Britain who have contributed to the
settlement of the Hong Kong question and to all those in the world
who have cared for and supported Hong Kong's return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
On this solemn occasion, I wish to extend cordial greetings and
best wishes to more than six million Hong Kong compatriots who
have now returned to the embrace of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
After the return of Hong Kong, the Chinese Government will
unswervingly implement the basic policies of "one country, two
systems," "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and "a high
degree of autonomy" and keep Hong Kong's previous socio-economic
system and way of life of Hong Kong unchanged and its previous
laws basically unchanged.
</P>
<P>
After the return of Hong Kong, the Central People's Government
shall be responsible for foreign affairs relating to Hong Kong and
the defense of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region shall be vested, in accordance with the Basic Law, with
executive power, legislative power and independent judicial power,
including that of final adjudication. Hong Kong people shall
enjoy various rights and freedoms according to law. The Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region shall gradually develop a democratic
system that suits Hong Kong's reality.
</P>
<P>
After the return, Hong Kong will retain its status of a free
port, continue to function as an international financial, trade
and shipping center and maintain and develop its economic and
cultural ties with other countries, regions, and relevant
international organizations. The legitimate economic interests of
all countries and regions in Hong Kong will be protected by law.
</P>
<P>
I hope that all the countries and regions that have investment
and trade interests here will continue to work for the prosperity
and stability of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong compatriots have a glorious patriotic tradition. Hong
Kong's prosperity today, in the final analysis, has been built by
Hong Kong compatriots. It is also inseparable from the development
and support of the mainland. I am confident that, with the strong
backing of the entire Chinese people, the Government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region and Hong Kong compatriots will
be able to manage Hong Kong well, build it up and maintain its
long-term prosperity and stability, thereby ensuring Hong Kong a
splendid future.
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

<HEADLINE> Grand Celebrations in Tianjin To Welcome Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- With torches in hand, 200 runners
embarked on the final leg of a race tonight in northern Tianjin
Municipality to welcome Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Other runners joined the team as it passed two relay points,
and a total of 600 reached the final destination, the municipal
Youth's Palace, where 1,397 more torch-bearers were waiting for
them.
</P>
<P>
All 1,997 runners gathered at the square of the city's railway
station, and arranged themselves so that their torches formed the
Chinese characters "Hui Gui," which means "return."
</P>
<P>
As the digital countdown clock on the square ticked off the
last ten seconds till midnight, the entire crowd counted down in
unison from 10 to 1.
</P>
<P>
At the zero hour on July 1, 1997, with the handover ceremony of
Hong Kong broadcast live from a TV screen on the square, the whole
city was swept up in the fireworks displays, deafening cheers and
festive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fireworks also illuminated the night sky over
Dagukou Fort near the mouth of the Haihe River, as a symbol of
blowing away the century-long humiliation suffered at the fort
when the British invaded more than 150 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Thousands more Tianjin residents attended a rally near the
fort, located in an area which has already become the most
economically-developed in Tianjin, to unveil a monument and
embrace the final return of Hong Kong to the motherland.

<HEADLINE> HK to Maintain its Role After Handover: Swedish FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's role as Sweden's
base of investment in Southeast Asia and China's inland areas will
not be weakened and Sweden will remain in Hong Kong like other
countries, Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen said in a
newspaper interview published today.
</P>
<P>
Dagens Industri newspaper published the interview in today's
special issue marking Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Hjelm-Wallen said she was confident that Hong
Kong's role as the trade and financial center would be maintained
after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's future depends primarily on the development of
China's inland areas, especially the economic development of the
inland areas, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
To maintain Hong Kong's present prosperity and present social
system was obviously in the interest of the Chinese government and
was important to the development of the country itself, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, Hong Kong will continue to function as a fast
developing commercial center and a gateway to China, and its role
will not be changed after China resumes its exercise of
sovereignty there," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Transfer of Government Moves On Smoothly: HSBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- "Business as usual" has become a
shared dictum among the business community in Hong Kong, said
Global Outlook, a British quarterly publication of HSBC.
</P>
<P>
In an article entitled Transfer of Government Moves On
Smoothly, the third issue of Global Outlook 1997 said, "A
strengthening local economy and rising public confidence has
helped the transfer of government to proceed smoothly."
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the upbeat public sentiment, the quarterly said that
both the stock and property markets staged strong rallies in the
first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
So far, Hong Kong's economy has shown resilience despite a
slower-than-expected recovery in external trade. In the first four
months of 1997, exports grew by a 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Retail business continued to gather momentum, rising by 6.1
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in Hong Kong remains subdued, moderating to 5.2
percent in April, mainly due to benign food prices. Its more
vibrant economic activity will begin to feed through into higher
prices in the second half of 1997, HSBC expected.
</P>
<P>
Overall, real GDP is estimated to have risen strongly by 6
percent in the first quarter. For the rest of the year, growth
will mainly be driven by strong consumption and investment demand,
Global Outlook said.

<HEADLINE> UK Employers Optimistic Over Jobs, Says Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain's employment prospects are
the brightest since 1989, shortly before its economy dipped into
recession, according to the latest quarterly labor market trends
survey published today by Manpower, the leading job services
company.
</P>
<P>
Looking at job prospects among more than 2,000 employers in the
three months from July to September this year, Manpower said that
29 percent forecast an increase in job levels, with 9 percent
predicting a fall -- an overall net balance of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest figure in a Manpower survey since 1989 and
marks an increase of 5 percentage points from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The strongest sectors for job opportunities over the next three
months will be electronics, clothing, manufacturing, engineering
and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
However, largely domestic sectors such as retail distribution
and construction are also reporting a rise in demand for
employees. The survey also showed strong growth in banking and
other financial services. Lilian Benneth, chairman of Manpower,
said, "Clearly these figures are good news for those seeking
employment and for the country as a whole."
</P>
<P>
However, she warned about increasing upward pressures on wages
and about general recruitment difficulties and skill shortages,
particularly in information technology.
</P>
<P>
The Manpower survey was based on responses this month from
2,067 companies who are the largest employers in the local labor
markets covered by the company's 170 UK officers.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Foreign Minister Threatens To Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- In another sign indicating a
deepening cabinet crisis, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
declared this afternoon that he would decide in the coming days
whether to remain in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Levy made the statement at a hastily arranged press
conference held in the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who was deeply offended by not having been informed of
the meeting between Israeli National Infrastructure Minister
Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO)
Secretary General Abu Mazen on June 16, canceled a scheduled
meeting with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu Sunday, at which
the two men had been expected to patch up their differences.
</P>
<P>
Levy called off the meeting, which would have been his third
with Netanyahu in the past four days, on Sunday morning only
half-an-hour before it was to take place at 11:30 a.m.. Levy then
shut himself up in his office, rejecting all attempts by the
prime minister's aides to placate him.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the peace process with the Palestinians, Levy
complained that just like Israel's demand on the other side to
live up to its commitment, the Israeli government must also make
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Levy is reportedly worried about the possibility of Sharon's
takeover of his position in charge of the negotiations with the
Palestinians. Sources close to Levy said he insisted that
Netanyahu should make it clear that he, not Sharon, would be in
charge of the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, Levy said that he does not object to Sharon's
involvement in the peace process. What he objects to is that he
was not told about the meeting although he is in charge of the
peace negotiations with the Palestinians, the Israeli foreign
minister added.
</P>
<P>
In light of the growing cabinet crisis, various Israeli parties
are preparing for the possibility of early elections. But Likud
officials dismissed the suggestion that Levy's eventual departure
would lead to the fall of the one-year-old rightwing government.

<HEADLINE> Fireworks, Laughter and Tears Fill Beijing at Final Moments of Hong Kong's Homecoming Journey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Minutes before the digital
countdown clock in China's Tiananmen Square ticked down to zero,
an array of fireworks lit up the night sky of the Chinese capital
over hundreds of thousands of Beijingers in the world's largest
square.
</P>
<P>
The square was heaving with jubilant crowds in an all-night
celebration. Some 100,000-plus Beijingers gathered in the square
after dusk, awaiting the final moments of Hong Kong's return to
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
At one minute to midnight, the clock-watchers gradually
calmed down, and only the sounds of chanting and drumbeats could
be heard over the 440,000-square-meter area as the spectators
counted down from 60 to 0.
</P>
<P>
Their voices were amplified and telecast to all parts of the
world through a live broadcast.
</P>
<P>
Tiananmen, or the "Gate of Heavenly Peace," tonight again
witnessed an historic moment in China.
</P>
<P>
Some 48 years ago, it was there the late Chairman Mao Zedong
proclaimed the founding the New China. The Memorial Hall of
Chairman Mao is now located across the road from the countdown
clock.
</P>
<P>
"The helmsman is surely with all of us at this moment," said
Zhang Quanrui, a worker who participated in the building of the
hall.
</P>
<P>
People in the square also held up portraits of Deng Xiaoping,
who initiated and directed the negotiations with the British
Government on Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
The event lasted for more than seven hours, and is said to be
one of world's largest and longest. But the lengthy schedule of
activities hardly dampened the enthusiasm of the attendants.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, the Chinese people had been waiting for this moment
for one and half centuries," said Zhang Zaixing, a professor with
the prestigious Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
Middle school student Liang Shanshan said, "Even though we will
have final exams soon, all our classmates are eager to join the
celebrations."
</P>
<P>
The celebrations, featuring traditional lion dancing and
Beijing opera performances, were centered around the countdown
clock, located in front of the Museum of the Chinese Revolution.
</P>
<P>
The 16-meter-high digital countdown clock erected in 1994. Li
Weimin, one of the persons who proposed the putting up of the
clock in the square, said, "After the zero hour last night, the
clock is no more a chronometer. Gone is the 100-year history of
humiliation. What the clock really symbolizes is a new chapter in
Chinese history."
</P>
<P>
The clock will be relocated at the foot of the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
Performers tonight staged a party hailing China's unity and the
leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC). July 1 is also the
76th anniversary of the founding of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Danzim, a Tibetan college student and his schoolmates from
other ethnic groups demonstrated their folk dances. "We all think
that today is the common festival for all Chinese nationalities,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations paused as it was nearing 12:00 when the people
began to count down in chorus until the digital clock indicated
zero. Then, the people turned their eyes to the five large TV
screens that were showing the live broadcast of the handover
ceremony held some 2,000 km away in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A flood of cheers burst out from the square when the national
flag of the People's Republic of China and the flag of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region were raised and as the Chinese
President Jiang Zemin declared that Hong Kong's return is "a
victory of justice and the cause of world peace."
</P>
<P>
"Although we have already been waiting for it so long, it
seemed that this night is longer than I had anticipated," said Li
Baoduo, an army officer.

<HEADLINE> China Resumes Exercise of Sovereignty Over Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China has resumed the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, ending 156 years of British colonial
rule here, as a five-star red flag was raised at zero hour today
after the lowering of the Union Jack of Britain.
</P>
<P>
The wish cherished by the Chinese people for one and a half
centuries has come true.
</P>
<P>
"July 1, 1997 will go down in the annals of history as a day
that merits eternal memory," Chinese President Jiang Zemin
proclaimed at the Hong Kong handover ceremony hosted by the
Chinese and British governments in the Grand Hall on level five of
the Extension to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong to the motherland after going through
more than a century of vicissitudes indicates that from now on,
Hong Kong compatriots have become true masters of this Chinese
land and that Hong Kong has now entered a new era of development,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
His speech drew rousing applause from more than 4,000 Chinese
and foreign dignitaries in the hall. The scene was televised live
to billions of people across the world.
</P>
<P>
The handover ceremony began at 23:42, June 30.
</P>
<P>
At 23:46, amid music and applause, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, Premier Li Peng, Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, Vice-Chairman of
the Central Military Commission Zhang Wannian and HKSAR Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa entered the hall and sat in chairs on the
rostrum. Also seated at the rostrum, from the British side, were
Prince Charles, Prime Minister Tony Blair, Foreign Minister Robin
Cook, departing Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten and Chief of
Defense Staff Sir Charles Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
After the guards of honor from both countries had performed
their military salute, Prince Charles delivered a speech. He said
the important and special ceremony marked the restoration of Hong
Kong to the People's Republic of China, under the terms of the
Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, after more than 150 years
of British administration.
</P>
<P>
He paid tribute to those who had turned the concept of "one
country, two systems" into the Joint Declaration, and to the
dedication and commitment of those who had worked so hard over the
last 13 years to negotiate the details of the Joint Declaration's
implementation.
</P>
<P>
The heir to the British throne said Hong Kong has shown the
world how dynamism and stability can be defining characteristics
of a successful society.
</P>
<P>
When the flag lowering and raising ceremony that signified the
transfer of power in Hong Kong began, all people in the hall
focused their attention on the flagpoles standing on both sides of
the rostrum.
</P>
<P>
At 23:59, the British national flag and the British Hong Kong
flag were lowered slowly amid the sound of the British national
anthem. The Union Jack of Britain, which had flown over Hong Kong
for more than 150 years, came completly down in about 50 seconds,
signifying the end of British colonial rule of as many years in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At zero hour today, amid the sound of the national anthem of
the People's Republic of China, the five-star red flag of the
nation, accompanied by the bauhinia regional flag of the Hong Kong
Special Administration Region (HKSAR), rose slowly.
</P>
<P>
The entire hall burst with resounding applause, and tears welled
up in the eyes of many people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have struggled for one and a half centuries
for this historic moment. Hong Kong, which includes Hong Kong
Island, Kowloon and the "New Territories," has been Chinese
territory since ancient times. After the Opium War in 1940,
Britain forced the Qing government of China into signing three
unequal treaties, grabbing by force and "leasing" this piece of
Chinese territory. The Chinese people never ceased struggles
against British occupation of Hong Kong in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Today, Hong Kong has returned to China, and the Chinese head of
state stands on this part of Chinese territory for the first time
in history.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the handover ceremony, Jiang Zemin said history
will remember Deng Xiaoping for his creative concept of "one
country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
It is precisely along the course envisaged by this great
concept that China has successfully resolved the Hong Kong
question through diplomatic negotiations and finally achieved Hong
Kong's return to the motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the mention of Deng Xiaoping's name, the entire hall was
filled with gratitude for the founder of the great cause of Hong
Kong's return. Attention was directed toward Madame Zhuo Lin, the
widow of the late Chinese leader.
</P>
<P>
Deng had expressed on many occasions that he would visit Hong
Kong upon its return to China even if he has to go there in a
wheelchair. Regretably, he passed away several months ago. Zhuo
Lin's presence at today's handover ceremony, in a sense, has
fulfilled Deng's long-cherished wish.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang Zemin reiterated that, after the return of
Hong Kong, the Chinese government will unswervingly implement the
Chinese government's Hong Kong-related basic policies of "one
country, two systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and
a high degree of autonomy and keep Hong Kong's previous
socio-economic system and way of life unchanged and its previous
laws basically unchanged.
</P>

NEW YORK, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), South Korea and the United
States today began their new round of talks for a peace treaty to
end the 1950-53 Korea War, a U.S. State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
The one-day talks are being held in a New York hotel, the U.S.
official told reporters.

<P>
The DPRK delegation is headed by Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye

Minister Song Yong Shik.
</P>
<P>
Senior envoys of the three parties appeared to be in a relaxed
mood, shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries before starting
talks, according to the U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
The current meeting is a follow-up to the one held in March in
New York to discuss the proposed four-way peace talks aimed at
replacing the armistice of 1953 with a formal peace treaty.
</P>

The four-way talks, which would eventually also include China,
were proposed in April 1996 when U.S. President Bill Clinton
visited Seoul.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Revelers Mark Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the largest industrial
city of China, was lit up by 800,000 red lanterns tonight and the
banks of the Huangpu River that swerves through the city's
downtown were a sea of jubilant and singing crowds as more than
10,000 Shanghai residents gathered to celebrate the return of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
"One hundred years ago, I was hopelessly watching you leave; a
century later, I am here awaiting your homecoming," were the
lyrics to one tune.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, festooned with 800,000 lanterns and decorated with
two million pots of flowers, was once forced to lease its port to
western nations. Tonight, the city's streets were swarming with
hundreds of thousands of people celebrating the historic handover.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai Bund Park, which was set up by British colonialists
and used to be notorious for a signboard that read "No Trespassing
for Chinese," about 2,500 people sitting in front of the countdown
clock cheered when the city's bell tower struck twelve times.
</P>
<P>
As the people saw the national flag of the People's Republic of
China was raised in Hong Kong through the live broadcast by a
large TV screen, they could not help but burst into the singing of
the national anthem. Their exciting faces were illuminated by the
fireworks blazing through the sky. Industrial workers beat drums
and gongs; youngsters rose into lion and dragon dances. Children
with color flags in their hands jumped with joy. Grey-haired
professors clasped each other, so excited that tears were rolling
down their cheeks.
</P>
<P>
Du Xuan, 84-year-old playwright of a drama on Hong Kong's
return newly staged in Shanghai, said that he worked for years in
Hong Kong before the founding of the People's Republic of China,
and had witnessed the great changes that have taken place in the
island over the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong is an historical event that signals a
brighter future for Hong Kong," he said.

The 23 principal officials of the government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have been sworn in at the
ceremony for the inauguration of the HKSAR and the swearing-in of
the HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
The proceedings are supervised by Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
The 23 principal officials, standing in front of the rostrum
with their faces turned to the national flag and the regional flag
of the HKSAR and their right hand raised, and led by
Administrative Secretary Chan Fang On-sang, swear: We pledge to
uphold the Basic Law of the HKSAR of the People's Republic of
China (PRC), be loyal to the HKSAR of the PRC, fulfill our
official duties faithfully, abide by laws, be clean and honest,
and serve the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The majority of these officials had held posts in the British
Hong Kong government. As representatives of the 180,000 civil
servants in Hong Kong, the fact that they work for the HKSAR in
their original posts has been regarded as an indication of Hong
Kong's smooth transition.

HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa has been sworn in a moment
earlier.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Holds Night-long Carnival To Welcome Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The whole nation opened its heart
to welcome Hong Kong home, with a dusk-to-dawn celebration on
Tiananmen Square in the capital of Beijing tonight.
</P>
<P>
"The Beijing citizens will go all out to support prosperity and
stability in Hong Kong. We will join hands with Hong Kong people
to create a more beautiful future," Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin told
a cheering crowd of 100,000 on the square.
</P>
<P>
Tiananmen Square was ablaze with hundreds of floodlights and
red lanterns for one of the biggest festivities of the
century. The square is decorated with 30,000 pots of flowers and
the trees around the square are festooned with colorful lights.
</P>
<P>
"I told my students a lot about Hong Kong's past. But today, a
new page of history is unrolling before our eyes," said Xu Yanqin,
a middle school history teacher.
</P>
<P>
A student from Beijing University said, "It is hard to imagine
that we could see Hong Kong coming home today if China had not
opened up to the outside world and adopted the 'one country, two
systems' policy that allows Hong Kong to maintain the existing
capitalist system and lifestyle."
</P>
<P>
At about midnight, dozens of men, each with a red scarf wrapped
around his head, beat huge drums in a thundering fashion while
1,997 displays of fireworks emblazoned the summer sky. The crowd
of 100,000 counted down in unison the last 10 seconds of British
colonial rule in the east.
</P>
<P>
And at the zero hour of July 1, they watched the raising of the
Chinese national flag in Hong Kong televised on five huge screens
on the square, singing the Chinese national anthem.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's future will be brighter because it has a unique
position in China's reform, opening up and modernization drive," a
government employee said.
</P>
<P>
She participated in the musical performance "Beijing Bless You,
Hong Kong" held on the stage on the east side of the square.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong is a
historic trend that we must follow," Mayor Jia Qinglin said.
</P>
<P>
The sound of favorite national songs echoed throughout the
spacious square as the crowd danced in a grand spectacle of
patriotic fervor.
</P>
<P>
"I feel exited to have the opportunity to witness Hong Kong's
return to the embrace of the motherland on this square in
Beijing," said Xu, a Hong Kong businessman who flew here from Hong
Kong to attend the celebration.
</P>
<P>
"I have full confidence in the future of Hong Kong, because the
Special Administrative Region will be run under the guideline
of 'one country, two systems' that Deng Xiaoping put forward," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The celebration will end after the national flag is raised on
the square at about 5:00 a.m. Tuesday.

<P>
MOGADISHU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- At least four employees from a
local travel agency were killed by armed men in an ambush outside
Modasishu yesterday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Ballidogle Airport, the travel
agency staff were ambushed by gunmen equipped with technical
vehicle, on their way to the airport.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Air Djibouti employees had been accompanied
by two armed wagons with more than 20 heavily militiamen who
returned fire as the ambush started.
</P>
<P>
A contract dispute between the current contractor of Air
Djibouti and a former contractor of the agency whose job was
terminated as the contract is renewed for the new contractor
early in the year, is said to be the cause of the ambush.
</P>
<P>
The current contractor has been one of the employees of the
former contractor.
</P>
<P>
In a similar attack last week, one person was killed and 11
others were wounded when the same group who carried out
yesterday's ambush had attacked the employees of the agency on
the road to Ballidogle.
</P>
<P>
Traffic on Ballidogle road has been suspended for a while, but
returned back to normal after the attack.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, which belong to the Habar Gidir clan loyal to
Hussein Mohamed Aidid, had been mediated by their clan elders for
several times, but the midiations were proved to be fruitless.
</P>
<P>
Two painted technicals and more than 50 armed men from Hussein
Aidid's faction had intervened and separated the combatant
militiamen at Marehan street of south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
So far, seven people were killed more than 17 others wounded
since the contract dispute began between the warring sides.
</P>
<P>
The future operation of the agency is uncertain as each side
is determined to control the travel agency.

<P>
MACAO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Flags of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) and China waving back and forth,
champagne popping open as the final moment came. Thousands of
Macao residents broke into deafening cheers in a square in central
Macao.
</P>
<P>
They have been singing and dancing all night, waiting for the
countdown to the handover of Hong Kong at midnight on June 30.
Many said it is dream come true not only for Hong Kong citizens,
but also for all Chinese people around the world.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most glorious moment in the history of China,"
said the 90-year-old Choi Moi, a retired worker who was chairman
of a minor trade union in Macao. "I am very happy because it shows
China no longer suffers from bullying by foreign powers."
</P>
<P>
The climax of celebration arrived after days of preliminary
events in Macao, which also returns to the embrace of the
motherland in two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for tonight's celebration began a month ago.
Almost all grassroots organizations, Chinese-funded companies,
associations of different industries in Macao have held activities
to mark the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all major buildings in Macao are awash with red lanterns
and banners hailing Hong Kong's return to China. Streets are lit
up. Macao is immersed in a joyful spree of celebration.
</P>
<P>
From 8:30 pm tonight, thousands of people began gathering in
the central square. Organized by the Macao Association of
Neighborhood Committees, the evening party attracted both elderly
citizens and children despite a hot and humid weather.
</P>
<P>
Attendants at the party said they were excited and happy that
Hong Kong has returned to the motherland after more than 150 years
of separation.
</P>
<P>
The 90-year-old Choi Moi sang a piece of Guangdong Opera
tonight, hailing Hong Kong's return and praising the great idea of
"one country, two systems" put forward by Deng Xiaoping. He wrote
the lyrics himself.
</P>
<P>
"I admire Deng's talented design of 'one country, two
systems,'" he sang. "It helps people live happily without changing
their lifestyle."
</P>
<P>
Leung Heng Teng, an organizer of tonight's gala, said that
under the policy of "one country, two systems", he is convinced
that Hong Kong will have a bright future.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will remain prosperous and stable under that policy,
he said. "Just as the policy has helped contribute to a smooth
transition in Hong Kong, it will also be an inspiration to the
transition in Macao."
</P>
<P>
Leung's opinion was shared by the 41-year-old Lao Ion Fai, who
works as a computer engineer at the Macao Running Water Company.
He was among the thousands of viewers at another celebration party
organized by the Macao Federation of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
"I feel proud as China wipes out more than one and a half
century of humiliation," he told Xinhua. "I am confident Hong Kong
will have a bright future under the policy of 'one country, two
systems' after its return. And so will Macao."

<HEADLINE> HK Provisional Legislature Examines Reunification Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the first of the PLC after the establishment of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid a "legal vacuum", the PLC was convened
immediately after the swearing-in ceremony.
</P>
<P>
At the PLC meeting, Elsie Leung Oi-sie, Secretary of Justice,
is to table the draft Reunification Bill for endorsement.
Published by the Chief Executive's Office, the Bill is intended to
ratify 13 bills which had been passed by the PLC prior to July 1,
1997, and to deal with various transition-related matters.
</P>
<P>
The Bill is to endorse the appointment of judges of the Court
of Final Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High Court. It also
deals with such matters as adaptation of laws, establishment of
courts, continuity of legal proceedings and administration of
justice, continuity of public service, and transfer of government
property.
</P>
<P>
It is the first plenary meeting the PLC has ever held in Hong
Kong since the interim legislature was formed in December 1996.
Over the past six months, the PLC has met in Shenzhen, a southern
China city bordering Hong Kong, and has examined and passed 13
bills, which are indispensable to the establishment of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-nine legislators of the 60-member PLC attended today's

Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) tabled to the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) the draft Hong Kong
Reunification Bill here in the small hours today.
</P>
<P>
The Bill seeks to confirm the 13 bills which have been passed
by the PLC prior to July 1, 1997, and to deal with various
transition-related matters.
</P>

"It is a great privilege for me to be fitting the first bill
into the Council after its formal inauguration earlier this
morning. It is fitting that, on this historic day, the first bill
put before the Council should relate to the reunification of Hong
Kong with the motherland," Leung said.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter both of fact and of law, the reunification has, of
course, been successfully achieved. It is nevertheless desirable
to introduce a number of legislative provisions to facilitate the
smooth transition of the legal system, the administration of
justice, and the public service," she told the legislators.
</P>
<P>
Founded in December 1996, the interim legislature has passed 13
bills, which are indispensable to the establishment of the HKSAR.
These bills cover public holidays, the national flag and national
emblem, the regional flag and regional emblem, provisional
district organizations, the Court of Final Appeal, judicial
service, public order, societies and right of abode.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of Justice explained to the legislators that the
Bill also aims to endorse the appointment of judges of the Court
of Final Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High Court.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Reunification Bill deals with transition-related
matters such as adaptation of law, establishment of courts,
continuity of legal proceedings and administration of justice,
continuity of public service, and transfer of government property.
</P>
<P>
After the presentation by the Secretary of Justice, the PLC
will go on the first and second readings of the draft
Reunification Bill. Then legislators will immediately have the
second reading debate on the Bill before it goes through the
committee stage and receives the third reading.

<P>
"I felt immensely proud that Hong Kong is returning to the
motherland and the traces of 150-year disgrace will be erased
completely," said Zhong Nanshan, a professor from the city's
medical institute, in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>

Jieyi sang praises of patriotism exhibited by the ancient Chinese
people in the fight against British invaders.

<P>
Wei Lianjian, a descendent of an anti-British hero in the Qing
Dynasty, said:"One hundred years ago, our ancestors fought
gallantly against the British imperialists; today, we should
remember the history and make greater contributions to a more
powerful and prosperous motherland."
</P>
<P>
The mosting exciting moment came when the countdown clock
ticked down towards zero. People in the stadium shouted in chorus,
"five, four, three, two, one" before bursting into cheers and
excitement.
</P>
<P>
In the waves of cheers, Huang Guocheng, a Hong Kong resident who
has come to invest in inland areas since the late 1970s, told
Xinhua, "As Chinese, I feel proud that Hong Kong has at last
returned to the embrace of the motherland."
</P>
<P>
"With the strong backing of the motherland, I am convinced that
Hong Kong will become all the more stable, more prosperous, and
more closely linked to the inland areas," he added.

BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Nationwide rejoicing in China
reached a climax at midnight, as tens of millions of people across
the country celebrated the return of Hong Kong with a wide range
of activities, many of which lasted until dawn.
</P>
<P>
The 100,000 people gathered at Tiananmen Square in Beijing
counted down in unison the last 10 seconds of June 30, until the
moment on July 1 when Hong Kong returned to China.
</P>
<P>
Clock-watchers on the square cheered and applauded as they
watched live coverage of the handover ceremony in Hong Kong,
especially when the Union Jack was lowered and the Chinese
national flag raised.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 colored flags are flying in the balmy summer
air here, and thousands of traditional Chinese red lanterns are
hanging over and around the square, where an all-night gala is in
full swing.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's largest economic center, over 10,000
singers gathered along Huangpu River to welcome Hong Kong back
with song.
</P>
<P>
"One hundred years ago, I hopelessly watched you leave; a
century later to celebrate the historic Hong Kong return," they
sang.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, festooned with 800,000 lanterns and two million pots
of flowers, was once forced to lease its port to western
powers. Tonight, thousands of people swarmed onto the streets to
celebrate the historic Hong Kong return.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai Bund Park, which was set up by British imperialists
and is notorious for a notice board saying "No Chinese and Dogs
Allowed," about 2,500 people sitting in front of the countdown
clock cheered when the city's bell tower struck 12 times.

<P>
Guangzhou, capital of the prosperous Guangdong Province
adjacent to Hong Kong, was still buzzing with life at this hour of
the night, as thousands of fragrant fresh flowers and bright neon
lights brought residents to the streets for a walk or to take
photos.
</P>
<P>
In the city's Tianhe Stadium, 30,000 people attended a gala
party with singing and dancing which will continue till dawn.
</P>
<P>
The city of Dongguan, where the Chinese launched the resistance
against British invaders by burning large quantities of opium
confiscated from British traders 157 years ago, is awash in a sea
of colorful banners, balloons, flowers and still reverberating

from the Qing Dynasty.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets with Prince Charles in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met with Prince Charles here tonight in the Hong Kong Convention
and Exhibition Center Extension.
</P>
<P>
He said that the smooth settlement of the Hong Kong question
marked a successful application of Deng Xiaoping's great concept
of "one country, two systems", and is the result of the joint
efforts by both Chinese and British sides. It is in the interest
of both China and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Both Jiang and Charles arrived here for the Hong Kong handover
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang said that he was very delighted to be able to
co-officiate the Hong Kong handover ceremony with Prince Charles.
</P>
<P>
Prince Charles said that he was also delighted to meet with
President Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain has always had a special relationship with
China and Hong Kong, and is willing to continue to maintain and
develop this kind of relationship.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang said that the great concept of "one country,
two systems" is by no means an expedient measure, but a
far-reaching consideration oriented with China's reunification and
is therefore in the fundamental interest of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return, he said, the Chinese government will
unswervingly implement the principle of "one country, two
systems", "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree
of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"We are full of confidence in Hong Kong's long-term prosperity
and stability," he said. "Hong Kong will continue to play its
special role as a window, bridge and channel in China's opening to
the outside world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that with the smooth transfer of Hong Kong, the
problem between China and Britain left over from history has been
solved. He expressed the hope that a new good beginning will be
made in the Sino-British relationship.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang also asked Prince Charles to convey his
greetings to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
Prince Charles expressed his thanks to President Jiang, and
said that Her Majesty had paid a visit to China, which had left a
very good impression on her.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
were present at the meeting. Both of them expressed the hope that
after Hong Kong returns to China, the Sino-British relationship
will have a new starting point for further development.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, vice chairman of the Central
Military Commission Zhang Wannian, State Councilor and secretary
general of the State Council Luo Gan, Director of the Xinhua News
Agency Hong Kong Branch Zhou Nan, and first Chief Executive of the

In east China's city of Fuzhou, where fireworks are prohibited,
the municipal government granted special approval to set off
firecrackers in some areas of the city while 20,000 people
gathered in the Provincial Sport Center to watch grand fireworks
displays.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited homecoming of Hong Kong also boosted sales of
color TVs in the city. "Many people are buying new TVs to watch
the live coverage of the homecoming celebrations," a sales girl at
an electronic shop said. "We're selling more TVs than during the
Chinese Lunar New Year."
</P>
<P>
In east China's Xiamen city, which is separated from Taiwan by
only a strip of seawater, people lit fireworks on the shore close
to the Jinmen Islands so that the islanders could see them.
</P>
<P>
A man named Chen from a Taiwan shipping company said that the
return of Hong Kong is a joyous occasion for all Chinese around
the world. If the two sides across the Taiwan Straits are
reunited, miracles will happen, he added.
</P>
<P>
One million people took part in a long-distance marathon today
in Tianjin to express their excitement over the return.
</P>
<P>
At midnight, with fireworks bursting in the sky, people waving
national flags took to the streets for dragon dancing and other
traditional Chinese festivities.

China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held simultaneous singing
and dancing parties to greet the historic moment.
</P>
<P>
In Urumqi, thousands of people swarmed to seven spots to watch
the colorful performances given by members of various ethnic
groups. Twenty-thousand firecrackers were sent into the sky at the
stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
A monument was set up today in Lijiang District of southwest
China's Yunnan Province, to express gratitude of the local people
to their Hong Kong compatriots. In February last year, the area
was hit by an earthquake which claimed 309 lives. Donations from
Hong Kong to the region totalled 220 million yuan (about 27
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
And the festive mood is also seen in Mohe, a small town at
China's northernmost tip. People lit bonfires along the
Heilongjiang River, singing and dancing the night away.
</P>
<P>
At Mohe Meteorological Station, Director Feng Xianhua said that
though Mohe is thousands of miles from Hong Kong, he will visit
China's economic powerhouse if he gets the chance.
</P>
<P>
"Although Hong Kong is far from here, the people there are also
Chinese just like us," said Liu Wenbao, a local farmer.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
solemnly proclaimed here today: "I hereby declare the
establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
The proclamation was made at the ceremony to mark the
establishment of the HKSAR and the swearing-in of the HKSAR
Government.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR Government, composed entirely of Hong Kong residents
and headed by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, was sworn in today,
thus ushering in a new era of "Hong Kong People governing Hong
Kong" after 156 years of British colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
A grand ceremony was held at the extension to the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center (CEC) to mark this historic
moment. One and half hours ago, the five-star red flag was hoisted
in the CEC, symbolizing the return of Hong Kong to the embrace of
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Hung at the front of the main hall, the venue for the
inauguration and swearing-in ceremony, were a five-star red flag
and the regional flag of the HKSAR featuring a bauhinia. Hundreds
of pots of beautiful flowers before the rostrum increased the
festival atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The hall, which is as large as a football ground, had a full
house at 01:20 AM today. Also present were more than 4,000
representatives and guests from more than 40 countries and regions
and some 30 international organizations, all members of a viewing
delegation from the interior areas of China, 300 representatives
of overseas Chinese and foreigners of Chinese origin in all parts
of the world, persons from Macao and Taiwan, and people from all
walks of life in Hong Kong, who were still in high spirits after
attending the handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In the rear of the main hall were more than 400 journalists
from various media organizations across the world. They put up
over 10 TV transmission booths, 12 TV transmission rooms and 13
radio transmission booths to broadcast live this historic event to
an estimated two billion viewers around the world.
</P>
<P>
Walking into the main hall, amid warm applause, were President
Jiang Zemin, who is also general secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China, (CPC) and chairman of
the Central Military Commission (CMC); Li Peng, premier of the
State Council; Qian Qichen, vice premier; Wang Hanbin, vice
chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress; Zhang Wannian, CMC vice chairman; and Tung Chee Hwa,
chief executive of the HKSAR. They were seated in the front row on
the rostrum. Other members of the central delegation also took
seats on the rostrum.
</P>
<P>
At 01:30 AM, Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen announced the
opening of the ceremonies for the inauguration of the HKSAR and of
the swearing-in of the HKSAR Government. All present stood up and
the military band played the national anthem of the People's
Republic of China.

After the national anthem was played, President Jiang Zemin
proclaimed, in a solemn manner and sonorous voice, "I hereby
declare the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region of the people's Republic of China." This drew a long and
thunderous applause from the audience.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the concept of "one country, two systems"
put forward by late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has become a
reality.
</P>
<P>
Then, members of the HKSAR Government began to be sworn in.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, the first chief executive of the HKSAR, walked
to the rostrum and, facing the national flag and the regional flag
and raising his right hand, swore: "I, upon assuming the office of
the Chief Executive of the HKSAR, pledge to uphold the Basic Law
of the HKSAR of the PRC, fulfill my duties wholeheartedly, abide
by laws, be clean and honest, serve the HKSAR, and be responsible
for the PRC and the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng supervised the process, shook hands
with Tung and congratulated him on his assumption of office.
</P>
<P>
Then, the swearing-in of the 23 principal officials of the
HKSAR was also supervised by Premier Li Peng. Tung Chee Hwa
supervised the swearing-in of the 14 Executive Council members, 59
members of the Provisional Legislative Council and 34 judges.
</P>
<P>
Administrative Secretary Chan Fang On-sang led the principal
officials in the swearing-in. Most of these officials had held
posts in the Brutish Hong Kong Government. As representatives of
the 180,000 civil servants in Hong Kong, the retention of their
posts for the HKSAR has been regarded as an indication of Hong
Kong's smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
The swearing-in of the members of the Executive Council was led
by Chung Sze-Yuen, convener of the Executive Council, while that
of the Provisional Legislative Council was led by its president
Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai.
</P>
<P>
The executive and legislative departments of the HKSAR are
composed entirely of Hong Kong residents. This reflects the
implementation of the policy of "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong."
</P>
<P>
Led by Chief Justice Li Kwok-nang, judges of the HKSAR were
sworn in. This demonstrates that the HKSAR enjoys independent
judicial power, including that of final adjudication.
</P>
<P>
The swearing-in was followed by a speech made by Premier Li
Peng.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the return of Hong Kong to the motherland and the
establishment of the Government of HKSAR mark the successful
application of Deng Xiaoping's great vision of "one country, two
system" in resolving the question of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
They represent an immense success of the Chinese people in
their pursuit for complete national reunification. At the same
time, they are a major contribution to the cause of universal
peace and progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has now entered a new historic era and its future will
be even more splendid, Li said. His speech drew a warm applause
from the audience.
</P>
<P>
The policy address of Tung Chee Hwa expressed full confidence
in Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will perform, in great dedication, the sacred
duty of a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong as entrusted by law
and lead the pioneering Hong Kong people on their march along the
road of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
the 32-minute ceremony ended amid music and applause.

<P>
The provisional legislature was elected in the southern China
city of Shenzhen on December 21, 1996 by a 400-strong Selection
Committee, which was also responsible for the selection of the
first Chief Executive of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three of the 60 PLC members served on the last
Legislative Council under the British Hong Kong government while
11 were permanent Hong Kong residents with no Chinese citizenship
or with right of abode in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of the PLC was made necessary after the British
side unilaterally pushed ahead with the so-called "political
package" and derailed the "through train".
</P>
<P>
The "through train" means that members of the last Legislative
Council produced by the British Hong Kong authorities in 1995 may
become members of the first Legislative Council of the HKSAR after
going through specified legal procedures if the composition of
this last Legislative Council is in conformity with the relevant
decision of China's National people's Congress (NPC) and the
relevant provisions of the Basic Law and if its members meet
certain requirements.
</P>
<P>
However, the "political package" put forward by Hong Kong
Governor Chris Patten tampered with the means of election by
functional constituencies and by an election committee. As a
result, the composition of the 1995 Legislative Council was not in
conformity with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law and its
members cannot board the "through train" to form the first
Legislative Council of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, there should be a provisional
legislature to avoid a legal vacuum.
</P>
<P>
According to a decision made by the Preparatory Committee for
the HKSAR on the establishment of the PLC, seven major tasks were
laid out for the provisional legislature, including enacting laws
indispensable to the normal operation of the HKSAR, and revising
and abrogating laws if necessary; examining and approving the
transitional budget; and approving the appointment of the judges
of the Court of Final Appeal and the Chief Justice of the High
Court of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The PLC will stop functioning when the first Legislative
Council of the HKSAR is established, not later than June 30, 1998,
according to the decision.
</P>
<P>
The first plenary meeting of the PLC was held in Shenzhen on
January 25, with Rita Fan elected President of the interim body.
From then on, a total of 12 meetings were held in the southern
China city bordering Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The PLC proved its worth by examining and passing a total of 13
bills since early May.
</P>
<P>
These are the Holidays (1997 and 1998) Bill, the Urban Council
(Amendment) Bill 1997, the Regional Council (Amendment) Bill 1997,
the District Boards (Amendment) Bill 1997, the Legislative Council
Commission (Amendment) Bill 1997, the National Flag and National
Emblem Bill, the Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Bill, the
Public Order (Amendment) Bill 1997, the Societies (Amendment) Bill
1997, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (Amendment) Bill 1997,
the Judicial Service Commission (Amendment) Bill 1997, the
Immigration (Amendment)(No.3) Bill 1997, and the Oaths and
Declarations (Amendment) Bill 1997.
</P>
<P>
These bills, which are believed to be vital to the smooth
operation of the HKSAR, have to be ratified and signed by the
Chief Executive to become HKSAR laws.
</P>
<P>
Three motions were endorsed during pre-handover meetings in
support of the transitional budget, the appointment of Andrew Li
Kwok-nang as the Chief Justice of the HKSAR Court of Final Appeal
(CFA), and the appointment of three permanent judges of the CFA
and the Chief Judge of the High Court.
</P>
<P>
After July 1, the PLC will focus on the election method for the
first Legislative Council of the HKSAR, as PLC President Rita Fan
put it.

<HEADLINE> Return of Hong Kong To Console Soul of Patriot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xi'an, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The return of Hong Kong to the
motherland was ceremoniously celebrated by descendants of a
patriot in northwest China's Shaanxi province tonight.
</P>
<P>
The event is of special significance for the descendants of a
prime minister of the Qing Dynasty named Wang Ding, who committed
suicide in 1842 to protest the government's shameful decision to
cede Hong Kong to Britain after the loss of the Opium War.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ding was also perceptive in that he went all out to advise
the emperor not to dismiss from post Lin Zexu, the national hero
who courageously imposed a ban on opium trade with Britain.
</P>
<P>
"The soul of Wang Ding could now be comforted now that Hong
Kong is returned....And I hope that future generations could learn
from him and love our country deeply," said one of Wang's
descendents, who donated Wang's former residence to the country
for the building of a memorial hall.

<HEADLINE> Southwest Municipality Hails Return of Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The return of Hong Kong has
filled more than 30 million residents in southwest China's
Chongqing municipality with great joy and excitement.
</P>
<P>
The city, approved to become a new municipality under the
direct administration of the central government, was immersed in
festivity as all the city from the main city area to the 600-km
Three Gorges reservoir zone to Qianjiang in the Wuling Mountainous
area were beautifully decked out. Rows of decorative lanterns were
lit to illuminate the city dotted with colorful banners and scrolls
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Most attractive among the variety of activities celebrating
Hong Kong's return to the motherland was a "motorcycle parade"
sponsored by a local motorcycle manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
A caravan of 1,997 locally produced Jialing-brand motorcycles,
heralded by the national flag and the regional flag of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region and a big watchword board, was
advancing in neat lines through the city's major streets and
across the Yangtze and Jialing rivers.
</P>
<P>
Joyful and prolonged cheers were heard everywhere when the
motorcade passed by.
</P>
<P>
"I feel really very proud driving the motorcycle produced by
ourselves to participate in the parade to mark the historic event
of Hong Kong's return, and I also feel very proud of the
prosperity of our country and the development of our national
industry," said an official from the local Jialing Group Company.
</P>
<P>
In the Chaotianmen port zone where the Jialing River joins the
Yangtze, an orchestra and a singing team made up by 200 local port
workers sang songs to show their love for the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"How are you, Hong Kong; return, return." The audience burst into
exciting cheers again and again.
</P>
<P>
At midnight when the exciting moment came, scores of ships
anchoring along river banks sounded sirens to extend their
greetings to the more than 6 million Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
In the newly built People's Square, the main gathering place in
Chongqing to celebrate the return of Hong Kong, tens of thousands of
citizens from all walks of life sang and danced.
</P>
<P>
As the clock ticked closer to zero, the crowed cheered in
and shouted in chorus: Welcome Home, Hong Kong!
</P>
<P>
The gala party was brought to its climax when a colorful dragon
and carp-lantern dance rose amidst the deafening sound of the
beating of drums and gongs.
</P>
<P>
"At the very moment, the nation's grand dream of Hong Kong's
return has at last been materialized," said Li Yuejin, a young
Chongqing resident who during the past one year has traveled more
than 80,000 kilometers across the country to publicize the
significance of the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The gala party ended with a chorus "My Motherland" by all the
people in the square. The song reverberated in the sky over this
hilly city.

<HEADLINE> Bell Striking To Celebrate HK's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- At 11:30 tonight, representatives
from various circles in China's eastern city of Nanjing gathered
at Jinghai Temple here and sounded a specially-crafted bell to
celebrate the return of Hong Kong to the motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Lin Gang and Deng Yuan, descendants of the late Chinese
national heroes Lin Zexu and Deng Tingzhen, who led the Chinese
troops to resist British aggression in the Opium War, together
took the first strike at the bell.
</P>
<P>
"We have been waiting and striving for this moment for
generations, and now our ancestors will have no more regrets,"
said an emotional Lin Gang.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing is where the Treaty of Nanking was signed in 1842,
which ceded Hong Kong to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Yu Xiaodong, a bank clerk, proposed that an alarm
bell be made to remind people of this historical period. In
response, local residents donated more than 1 million yuan for the
bell.
</P>
<P>
The bell was struck 155 times to commemorate the 155-year
history of humiliation and people's struggle for reunification.
</P>
<P>
With people counting down the strikes in unison, Nanjing Mayor
Wang Hongmin took the last whack just as the clock reached the
zero hour of July 1. The sound echoed throughout the city,
declaring the end of the history of humiliation and the beginning
of a new era for Hong Kong.

HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of the
speech delivered by Chinese Premier Li Peng at the ceremonies for
the inauguration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) and the swearing-in of the HKSAR Government:
</P>
<P>
Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, On this momentous
occasion, I would like to extend, on behalf of the Central
People's Government of the People's Republic of China, our warmest
congratulations on the establishment of the Government of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
I wish to take this opportunity to express heartfelt thanks to
all the distinguished guests present at this ceremony. My thanks
also go to members of the Preparatory Committee of HKSAR, members
of the Selection Committee of the first Government of the HKSAR
and all those who care for and support the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
As of today, the Basic Law of the HKSAR of the People's
Republic of China takes effect. The first Chief Executive of the
HKSAR, principal officials of the Government of the HKSAR, members
of the Executive Council, members of the Provisional Legislative
Council and judges of the Court of Final Appeal and of the High
Court, you have now been sworn into office. History has invested a
very important responsibility on you. The Hong Kong people have
placed high hopes on you. I hope that you will, in the spirit of
loving China and loving Hong Kong, implement the Basic Law in real
earnest, scrupulously fulfill your duties and live up to the
expectations of the people. The Central People's Government will
give full support to the Chief Executive Mr. Tung Chee-hwa and to
the work of the Government of the HKSAR. I am convinced that, our
Hong Kong compatriots, now back in the great family of the
motherland, will make positive contributions to Hong Kong's
continued long-term prosperity and stability with their industry
and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to the motherland and the establishment
of the Government of the HKSAR marks the successful application of
Mr. Deng Xiaoping's great vision of "one country, two systems" in
resolving the question of Hong Kong. It represents an immense
success of the Chinese people in their pursuit for complete
national reunification. At the same time, it is a major
contribution to the cause of universal peace and progress. Hong
Kong has now entered a new historical era and its future will be
even more splendid!
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turkish New Government Vows to Restore Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The newly formed Turkish
government today vowed to safeguard and revive the fundamental
principles of the secular republic.
</P>
<P>
A four-page protocol was disclosed by Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz at a news conference in parliament shortly after his
cabinet list was approved by President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
The document stressed that Turkey's secularism and democracy
must be respected and safeguarded completely.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the country's secularism has been the
focus of tension between the military and former pro-Islamic Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan, who was forced to step down on June 18.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military and some opposition parties have been
accusing Erbakan and his Welfare Party (RP) of supporting rapidly
expanding fundamentalist force, which was regarded as the most
dangerous threat to the country.
</P>
<P>
The protocol also stated that the coalition partners would do
their utmost to stop the society's moral decay, to bring about
the revival of "a clean society" and to rebuild the people's
confidence in the state.
</P>
<P>
It said that immunity of parliamentarians would be restricted
and obstacles preventing the effective battle against corruption
would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Local English newspaper Daily News said that the Yilmaz
government was extremely possible to launch a judicial
investigation into the corruption charges against Tansu Ciller,
chairwoman of the True Path Party (DYP).
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have tried to bring Ciller, also deputy
prime minister of the Erbakan-led coalition government, to a
Supreme Court trial for alleged financial scandals, but their
efforts failed due to the RP protection.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, leader of the Turkish Motherland Party (ANAP) who
formed the country's 55th government, told reporters that he
believed the newly-established government would overcome the
current difficulties with the support of the Turkish peoples.
</P>
<P>
He succeeded in forming the new government thanks to the
support of secular bloc -- the Democratic Left Party, Republican
People's Party and Democratic Turkey Party.
</P>
<P>
As of Sunday, the ANAP-led alliance enjoys 278 votes in the
550-seat parliament with two vacancies, and the RP-DYP alliance
has 270 seats in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that at present Yilmaz and his alliance
would have no difficulty in winning a vote of confidence which was
expected to take place in two weeks at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan resigned under pressure from both the military and
other secularists and then failed to persuade President Demirel to
appoint DYP leader Ciller to form a new government.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Holds Night-long Carnival To Welcome Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The whole nation opened its heart
to welcome Hong Kong home with a dusk-to-dawn celebration on the
Tiananmen Square in central Beijing tonight.
</P>
<P>
Well into the night, the crowd of 100,000 hailed, applauded and
danced as the inauguration ceremony of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) government was beamed through five
huge TV screens on the square.
</P>
<P>
"The ceremony fully demonstrated solemnity of a legitimate
government of the HKSAR," said Jin Xiaoyue, a 26-year-old worker
of neighborhood service.
</P>
<P>
"My colleagues and I never doubt that Hong Kong will have a
brighter future under the HKSAR government," he said.
</P>
<P>
The celebration began at 10:00 this evening.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin said at the beginning of the
celebration that Beijing citizens will go all out to support
prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and will join hands with the
Hong Kong people to create a more beautiful future.
</P>
<P>
Tiananmen square was ablaze with hundreds of floodlights and
red lanterns for the biggest festivity in the century tonight. The
square is decorated with 30,000 pots of flowers and the trees
around the square are festooned with colorful lights.
</P>
<P>
"I told my students a lot about Hong Kong's past. But today, a
new page of history is unrolling before our eyes," said Xu Yanqin,
a middle school history teacher.
</P>
<P>
At about midnight, dozens of men, each with a red scarf wrapped
around his head, beat huge drums while 1,997 displays of fireworks
emblazoned the summer sky. The crowd of 100,000 counted down in
unison the last 10 seconds of British colonial rule in the east.
</P>
<P>
At zero hour of July 1, they watched the raising of the Chinese
national flag in Hong Kong televised by five huge screens on the
square, singing the Chinese national anthem.
</P>
<P>
"The nation's fate has been totally changed," said Ma Lin, a
worker from a steel company in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Ancient emperors living in the Forbidden City beside this
square closed the doors of China, but failed to stop Britain to
seize Hong Kong from the country. Today, we resumed the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong because China has become more open
and stronger," he said.
</P>
<P>
The celebration is still going on with the crowd dancing in big
circles around the square.
</P>
<P>
"I feel exited to have the opportunity to witness Hong Kong
comes back to the embrace of the motherland on this square in
Beijing," said Xu, a Hong Kong businessman who flew into here from
Hong Kong to attend the celebrating activities.
</P>
<P>
"I have full confidence in the future of Hong Kong, because the
Special Administrative Region will be run under the guideline
of 'one country, two systems' that Mr. Deng Xiaoping put forward,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The celebration will end at about 5:00 this morning as the
national flag is raised on the square.

<HEADLINE> hkhk-Full Text of Inaugural Speech by HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of the
speech delivered by Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), at the inauguration
and swearing-in ceremony held today:

President Jiang, Premier Li, my fellow countrymen, and friends,
</P>
<P>
This is a momentous and historic day: July 1, 1997. After 156
years of separation, Hong Kong and China are whole again. This is
a solemn, stately, and proud moment. We are here today to announce
to the world, in our language, that Hong Kong has entered into a
new era.
</P>
<P>
In recent history, China, as a nation, and we, as a people,
have been through days of glory and times of despair. We have
lived through days of hope, prosperity and glory. We have lived
through days of despair, humiliation, and hopelessness. The lesson
is clear: the most precious possession of any nation or any people
is the ability to chart one's own future, to be master of one's
own destiny. Indeed, over the past century and a half, many
compatriots, driven by lofty ideals and steadfast conviction, have
devoted themselves to the advancement of our people and
safeguarding the territorial integrity of our nation. Their
enormous sacrifice and tireless efforts have brought us to where
we are today. Never have we, as a nation, had such prosperity and
potential to achieve greatness as we do today. Nor have we
achieved greater recognition and dignity in the international
community as we do today; as Hong Kong is finally re-united with
China in a smooth and peaceful manner.
</P>
<P>
Today, we, as a nation, are fortunate to be in a position which
our predecessors could only dream about. As a Chinese living in
Hong Kong, and on behalf of all the people of Hong Kong, I would
like to express our profound respect and gratitude to all the men
and women who have made such sacrifices and given us what would
otherwise have been impossible to attain.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong under "one
country, two systems" is an ingenious and novel concept. The eyes
of the world are on us, as Hong Kong accepts the great honor, and
the challenge, of charting new waters which will make history. I
am confident that we will rise to the challenge and build a
brighter and better future. Our confidence is well founded. Our
conviction is based on the intellect and vision of a great patriot
and statesman; on the solemn commitment of a great nation; and on
the wisdom, industry and versatility of the Hong Kong people, a
legacy from our heritage and culture. Above all, we, as one nation
and one people, will implement the "one country, two systems"
concept; it is entirely within our prerogative to make it work.
</P>
<P>
Through a solemn act of law, the Central People's Government
has granted Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, unparalleled
anywhere in the world. We value this empowerment, and we will
exercise our powers prudently and responsibly. We are embarking on
a new era. With the respect and trust from the entire nation, we
will be that much more equipped to sail forward with confidence
and with conviction. We will play a part in facilitating the
re-unification of the entire nation, and bringing a better life to
all in the nation.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in history, we, the people of Hong Kong,
will be master of our own destiny. The Special Administrative
Region Government is fully committed to preserving the Hong Kong
way of life, maintaining Hong Kong's free and open economic
system, upholding the rule of law, and building a more democratic
society. We will be compassionate to those in need, and we will
maintain Hong Kong as a vibrant and international city.
</P>
<P>
The nation and the people have entrusted to me the
responsibility as Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. As I
stand here at this historic moment, a moment of great honor and
pride, I am mindful of the enormous responsibilities which lie
ahead. Throughout my life, I have experienced the joy and
satisfaction of success and the pain and frustration of failure. I
understand the hopes and aspirations of Hong Kong people. I am
fully aware of the power in unity of purpose and direction. I will
resolutely uphold the principles of autonomy as set forth under
the Basic Law. I will carry out my duties with honesty, sincerity
and determination. I will lead the 6.5 million people of Hong
Kong, along with our indomitable spirit, towards the future. As
part of China, we will move forward as one inseparable nation with
two distinct systems.
</P>
<P>
I firmly believe, as a Special Administrative Region of China,
the future of Hong Kong will be more glorious and more successful.
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

Tabled to the PLC in the small hours today by Secretary of
Justice Elsie Leung Oi-sie, the Hong Kong Reunification Bill is
intended to ratify 13 bills passed by the PLC prior to July 1,
1997, so as to complete the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bill aims to endorse the appointment of judges
of the Court of Final Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High
Court. It also deals with transition-related matters such as
adaptation of law, establishment of courts, continuity of legal
proceedings and administration of justice, continuity of public
service, and transfer of government property.
</P>
<P>
Founded in December 1996, the interim legislature already
passed 13 bills prior to July 1, 1997 which are indispensable to
the establishment of the HKSAR. These bills cover public holidays,
the national flag and national emblem, the regional flag and
regional emblem, provisional district organizations, the Court of
Final Appeal, judicial service, public order, societies and right
of abode.
</P>
<P>
The PLC meeting started at 2:45 a.m. today in the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center Extension.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid a "legal vacuum", the meeting followed
immediately the inauguration ceremony of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan, President of the PLC, made an address at the
beginning of the meeting. She said: "It is of great and historic
significance that the PLC should hold our first meeting on this
day of jubilation throughout China following the birth of the
HKSAR."
</P>
<P>
After outlining the PLC's work prior to July 1, She said, after
the handover the PLC will focus its work on enacting the election
method for the first Legislative Council of the HKSAR, so that the
first Legislative Council can be produced as soon as possible, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Then, Elsie Leung Oi-sie, Secretary of Justice, tabled to the
PLC the nine-part Reunification Bill for three readings.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great privilege for me to be introducing the first
bill into the Council after its formal inauguration earlier this
morning."
</P>
<P>
"It is fitting that, on this historic day, the first bill put
before this Council should relate to the reunification of Hong
Kong with the motherland," she told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Continuity is a central theme of both the Joint Declaration and
the Basic Law and this Bill reflects that theme by putting into
place practical arrangement to facilitate the continuity of the
legal system, the administration of justice, and the public
service, she noted.
</P>
<P>
After the first and second readings of the Reunification Bill,
legislators began debate on the Bill before it was passed at the
third reading.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-nine legislators attended today's meeting, except for
Maira Tam Wai-chu, who has just resigned as she was appointed as a
member of the first HKSAR Basic Law Committee under the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen principal officials of the HKSAR government sat in the
gallery.
</P>
<P>
The PLC will meet again on July 9.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Create Observer Mission in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council today voted unanimously to close its current peacekeeping
operation and create an observer mission in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The observer mission, including 86 lightly-armed military
officers and 345 civilian police, will begin its operation on July
1.
</P>
<P>
The former U.N. Angola Verification Mission, set up in 1995,
will withdraw slowly from the country.
</P>
<P>
The Verification Mission was set up to help implement the
agreement signed in Lusaka, Zambia, in November 1994 that ended
nearly two decades of civil war in the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
"After a long and difficult path, the Lusaka protocol has
finally entered its final stage," Afonso van Dunem Mbinda,
Angola's representative to the United Nations, told the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xuexian, China's Deputy Permanent Representative to the
United Nations, said at the Council meeting that the Chinese
government was pleased at the positive momentum of the Angolan
peace process, but was concerned at the recent outbreaks of
violence in northern Angola.
</P>
<P>
The dawn of peace was on the horizon, and the Angolan
government and UNITA should seize the opportunity of achieving the
remaining tasks in the political field, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China supported the establishment of the U.N.
observer mission in the belief that it would promote national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
But, as a principle, the Security Council should not get
involved in those activities which fall under the terms of
reference of other U.N. bodies, the Chinese Deputy Representative
stressed.

Union (EU) could help improve the settlement of the Cyprus problem
because the solutions being pursued should be compatible with
European principles.

consulting with Greek leaders ahead of his forthcoming talks with
Denktash in New York on July 9.

SHENZHEN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Residents on both sides of Chung
Ying Street, the middle line of which served as the boundary
between China's inland area and Hong Kong's New Territories,
celebrated their reunion today.
</P>
<P>
People in Shatoujiao Town, where the street is located, had
been living in two separate areas since the Convention Respecting
An Extension of the Hong Kong Territory was signed in 1898.
</P>
<P>
Today, the long winding street was decorated with colorful
lights and lanterns and scores of the Chinese national flag and
the flag of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) were
hung up and down the street.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, more than 300 people in Shatoujiao Village
of Hong Kong's New Territories crossed Chung Ying in the rain to
enter the city of Shenzhen in South China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
One of the villagers, surnamed Lee, told reporters that he was
pleased about Hong Kong's return. "Though the street will remain
divided, we will be like one family, running businesses and
seeking development together," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 Hong Kong and Shenzhen people paraded along the
street, waving miniatures of the Chinese five-star flag and the
flag of HKSAR, and beating gongs and drums. Some of them performed
lion and dragon dances.
</P>
<P>
The dance of the Chinese unicorn, staged under a big fig tree
to symbolize that the Hong Kong and Shenzhen people have the same
roots, was warmly received by the audience.
</P>
<P>
"We are like two melons growing on the same vine," said Liu
Weiqiang, head of a neighborhood committee on Zhongxing Street in
Shenzhen, referring to Hong Kong and Shenzhen people. "We should
help and take care of each other and build our hometown together."

<HEADLINE> Angolan President Calls for UNITA'S Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President and Chairman of
the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola currently in
power, Eduardo Dos Santos today calls for the cooperation of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) with
the government in speeding up the implementation of the Lusaka
Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos made the appeal at the opening ceremony of the
Second National Conference of the People's Movement for the
Liberation of Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the primary task now for the peace
process is the reestablishment of national administrations, the
realization of free trade and UNITA's dispersing of all armed
people who have not entered the concentration areas.
</P>
<P>
The delays in the peace process and clashes in the north and
north-east border areas should not discourage all parties
involved, nor would they change the general direction of the
peace process, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Second National Conference of the People's Movement is the
party's first national meeting since the multi-party elections in
September 1992. The conference will be concluded on July 4.

YANGON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to Myanmar Chen

resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong today.
</P>
<P>
About 400 guests, including First Secretary of the Myanmar
State Law and Order Restoration Council Khin Nyunt, Second
Secretary Tin Oo, several government ministers, as well as foreign
diplomats, attended the reception.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the reception, Khin Nyunt said that Myanmar,
along with many other countries which suffered the similar bitter
experiences of colonial scourges, as well as the people of the
whole world "warmly welcome the reunification."
</P>
<P>
Myanmar fully shared the jubilant sentiments of the Chinese
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
This successful reunification can be mainly attributed to the
concept of "one country, two systems" expounded by Deng Xiaoping,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Myanmar's confidence that "prosperity and
development of the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region)
will be further enhanced."

<HEADLINE> EU Makes New WTO Offer on Financial Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) made a
new offer today to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva as
part of its drive to bring about a global deal to open financial
services markets by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The new proposal, adopted by trade officials from EU member
states, includes eliminating 12 residual restrictions and reducing
nine others in Austrian banking, the Amsterdam stock exchange and
Portuguese investment funds among other areas.
</P>
<P>
The offer to increase the scope of the EU's market opening in
financial services is aimed at spurring other WTO members to
improve their commitments to the financial services market.
</P>
<P>
The EU expected the other WTO countries to grant real market
access opportunities to foreign financial institutions by July
14, the pre-agreed date for revised offers.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the EU is trying to inject momentum into the WTO
talks well in time for a global deal by the December deadline set
by the WTO two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The EU's financial services market represents more than 25
percent of the world's insurance, banking and share trading
markets.

the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the reception, Chinese Ambassador to Austria, Wang

said.

<HEADLINE> US Called for "No Conditions" on Payment of Dues to UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has been urged to insist that the U.S. Senate's 38 conditions
precluding payment of American dues to the United Nations be
stripped from the foreign affairs authorization bill in the
upcoming House-Senate Conference Committee.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in a strongly worded letter to Clinton at
the end of last month by John C. Whitehead, chairman of the U.N.
Association of the USA, and Ellitot Richardson, co-chairman of the
Association's National Council, according to a press release of
the association available today.
</P>
<P>
"We urge you to use the power of the Presidency, publicly and
forcefully, to reverse the dangerous direction of Congressional
debate," the two former U.S. statesmen said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House version of the bill makes no provision for
payment of the 1.6 billion dollars the U.S. owes in arrears to the
world body and other international agencies.
</P>
<P>
However, the Senate bill, sponsored by Republican hardliner
Jesse Helms, authorizes payment of up to 819 million U.S. dollars
in arrears over the next two years. It stipulates that the United
Nations must first meet dozens of conditions.
</P>
<P>
These conditions of repayment include a write off of nearly
half of the U.S. debt to a dormant account and reduction of the
U.S. share of U.N. expenses from 25 percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The two statesmen said that many of the ideas found in the
legislation are "ill-conceived," particularly the unilateral
demand fro reduction in the U.S. rate of assessment, which would
force the other member states to add a fifth of America's share to
their own U.N. assessment.
</P>
<P>
They also regarded unacceptable the requirement that 5 percent
of U.N. professional staff positions remain vacant.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the fear that these provisions "will cast a long
shadow over our conduct of multilateral diplomacy as well as
undercut our leadership at the United Nations."

<HEADLINE> First Day of HKSAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- When the Chinese national flag
and the regional bauhinia flag of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) were hoisted at zero hour today,
Hong Kong started a new day and a new era.
</P>
<P>
At the stroke of midnight, police officers on duty in the Hong
Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, the venue for Hong Kong's
handover ceremony, replaced their colonial police insignia with a
new insignia featuring bauhinia. Reporters from inland areas and
Hong Kong exchanged greetings, saying "we are of the same family."
</P>
<P>
Countless people stayed the night to watch the handover
ceremony, to wait for the moment that Hong Kong became part of
China again, and to greet the first day of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
On the Hong Kong Island, the bright illumination in the
Convention Center lit up the Victoria Harbor; in Kowloon, the
3.5-km-long dragon formed by lights extended from Tsim Sha Tsui
way up to the Border Street; and in "New Territories", tens of
thousands of people thronged to the junction with Shenzhen to
welcome the arrival of the People's Liberation Army troops to be
stationed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
When morning came, people swarmed to newsstands to buy
newspapers, all covering extensively the handover activities. In
front of the General Post Office on the Hong Kong Island, hundreds
of people queued for a set of commemorative stamps and envelopes.
</P>
<P>
Although today is the fourth of a five-day public holiday, the
subway was even crowded than rush hours on working days. A
commemorative ticket costing only 25 HK dollars enables people to
travel an unlimited mileage in Hong Kong's extension subway
network, called the Mass Transit Railways, within today.
</P>
<P>
In the square in Central, Hong Kong's downtown area, people were
having pictures taken in front of a commemorative pavilion for
Hong Kong's return to China. More lens were focused on the red
five-star flag, the Chinese national flag, and the bauhinia flag
of the HKSAR, which were hoisted for the first time in the
building housing Hong Kong's legislature.
</P>
<P>
A young couple taking pictures caught the attention of
passers-by, for wearing T-shirts with the words "Hello, China" on
the front, and "Good bye, Britain" on the back.
</P>
<P>
In a shop selling magazines and souvenirs on the Theatre Lane
in Central, Lo Hoi and his two assistants were busy receiving
people coming to buy the national and regional flags.
</P>
<P>
"Most people want national flags, and they prefer larger ones.
How many have we sold? I really cannot tell," said Lo, who owns
the Ah Lo Magazines Co., while busy taking flags for customers.
</P>
<P>
At nine o'clock in the evening, hundreds of thousands of people
flocked to both banks of the Victoria Harbor to watch Hong Kong
'97 Spectacular, a gala show with music, fountains, laser,
decorated boats, and fireworks.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin's 20 Hours in Hong Kong (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The presence of the Chinese government delegation led by Jiang
Zemin at the Hong Kong handover ceremony at the midnight of June
30 attracted worldwide attention. An estimated two billion people
watched the ceremony via live TV broadcast. At zero hour of July
1, the five-star red flag was raised at the venue of the ceremony
and Jiang Zemin proclaimed to the world China's resumption of the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"July 1, 1997, will go down in the annals of history as a day
that merits eternal memory. The return of Hong Kong to the
motherland after going through more than a century of vicissitudes
indicates that from now on, Hong Kong compatriots have become true
masters of this Chinese land and that Hong Kong has now entered a
new era of development."
</P>
<P>
At 1:32 am, Jiang Zemin announced the establishment of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's
Republic of China at the ceremony for the inauguration of the
HKSAR of the PRC and the swearing-in of the HKSAR government. This
was followed by the swearing-in of the HKSAR government composed
entire of Hong Kong people. The "one country, two sytems" concept
has become a reality.
</P>
<P>
Before the handover, President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng
met with more than 80 foreign dignitaries who had come to attend
the Hong Kong handover ceremony and celebrations.
</P>
<P>
It was 2:30 am when Jiang Zemin met officials of the HKSAR
government who had just been sworn in. Up to then, the Chinese
president had spent the first ten busy hours in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At 10 am, July 1, Jiang went again to the Extension to the Hong
Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, where he attended a grand
celebration for the establishment of the HKSAR. This was the first
time a top Chinese leader joined Hong Kongers in a joyous
celebration.
</P>
<P>
At the celebration, the Chinese president extended his
congratulations to Mr Tung Chee Hwa on his assumption of office as
HKSAR Chief Executive. "We have full confidence in the HKSAR
government under his leadership and will give it full support," he
said.
</P>
<P>
At 1:05 pm, President Jiang Zemin boarded his plane and flew
back to Beijing after spending 20 busy hours in Hong Kong. In
Beijing, the national capital, a grand celebration attended by
80,000 people was waiting for him.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin's 20 Hours in Hong Kong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
left here for Beijing this afternoon after a 20-hour whirlwind
visit to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 hours, Jiang, who is also general secretary of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and
chairman of the Central Military Commission, led the Chinese
government delegation for attendance to the Hong Kong handover
ceremony and the Central Delegation for attendance to the ceremony
for the inauguration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China and the
swearing-in of the HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, together with Premier Li Peng, met with the Prince of
Wales and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and more than 80
other foreign dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
The special airplanes carrying the Chinese government
delegation led by Jiang Zemin touched down at the Kai Tak
International Airport at 5:05 pm on June 30. They were greeted by
hundreds of people representing all walks of life in Hong Kong,
who stood in the rain and held the national flag of China and the
regional flag of the HKSAR. Some 150 Chinese and foreign reporters
had arrived at designated areas hours before the arrival of the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin and Li Peng descended from the ramps at 5:28 with
smiles. This represented a historic moment: it was the first time
in history that China's top leader set his foot in this part of
Chinese territory subjected to British colonial rule for 156
years.
</P>
<P>
The cause of bringing Hong Kong back to the embrace of the
motherland has involved the incessant struggles of the Chinese
people and painstaking efforts of three generations of Chinese
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Prior to departure from Beijing, Jiang said, "We should bear in
mind the great achievements made by the late Chinese leaders Mao
Zedong, Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping."
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Hong Kong, Jiang expressed on various
occasions that he cherished the memories of Deng Xiaoping, who put
forward the great concept of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with British Prime Ministry Tony Blair at 8:20
pm, Jiang said Chinese and British leaders should "stand high and
look forward" and view Sino-British relations from a strategic
point of view geared to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
When he met Prince Charles before the handover ceremony, Jiang
expressed the Chinese Government's confidence and determination in
 implementing the policies of "one country, two systems" and "Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
When he met with foreign dignitaries or made speeches during
his stay in Hong Kong, Jiang stressed, time and again, that the
policy of "one country, two systems" is not an expedient measure
but a decision that has been made with China's overall national
interests taken into account. He reiterated at the HKSAR
inauguration ceremony that this basic policy will remain unchanged
for 50 years.

</P>
<P>
Chairman of Myanmar's State Law and Order Restoration Council

celebrating.
</P>
<P>
It would help promote the development of the Chinese economy,

</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said: "I am confident that Hong

two systems' is viable. I hope Hong Kong will become another
active participant in Russia-China cooperations." he added.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Acting Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said his country
welcomes the historical event marking the end of colonial rule
of more than 150 years in eastern Asia.

contribution to the comprehensive strengthening of relations

<HEADLINE> Somalis Condemn Military Court Decision in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The main factions in the Somali
capital have today reacted strongly to the decisions made by the
military court in Belgium which acquitted two soldiers who
committed human rights violations in Somalia during their stay
with the United Nations troops in the southern port town of
Kismaio.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Sheikh Ahmed Kadare, press secretary of Ali Mahdi's
faction, said the acquittal made by the Brussels court was a real
degradation of the Somali people and the Muslims in general and a
major violation to the international laws.
</P>
<P>
Kadare said, anger has incited them when they heard the
reasoning of the judge in the court who freed the two men on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The secretary has proposed that the case of those soldiers be
taken to a neutral court in a neutral country with the presence
of Muslim scholars and judges.
</P>
<P>
The military court decision was also criticized and condemned
by the faction led by Hussein Mohamed Aidid who called on all
international human rights organizations and those who advocate
for the rights of the children to condemn the Belgian legal
administration.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Qanyare Afrah, interior secretary of Hussein Aidid's
government, said the decision by the Belgian court shows the
persistence of white people's discrimination against the black.
</P>
<P>
Afrah said the Belgian soldiers have not only violated the
prestige of the Somalis, but the Muslim religion and the culture
of the Somalis as well.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, large demonstrations were held today in several
parts of the war torn capital, Mogadishu, marking the 37th
anniversary when the southern regions of Somalia took their
independence from the Italian colony, who joined the northern
regions colonized by Britain in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of cheering people have gathered in Mogadishu's main
stadium today singing and dancing traditional folklore dances,
blowing horns and beating drums.
</P>
<P>
"It is now time when the Somalis forget the use of arms and
settle their differences through peaceful ways without the
intervention of foreigners," Hussein Mohamed Aidid told the
crowd.

<HEADLINE> Macao Editorials Hail Hong Kong's Return to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Leading Chinese newspapers in Macao
today carried editorials, hailing the return of Hong Kong to China
as a "major event both for China and the entire world."
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News, the number one newspaper in Macao, said
in an editorial in an extra published early in the morning that
Hong Kong's return marks a new beginning for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return to China is the success of Deng Xiaoping's
great concept of "one country, two systems," it said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it said that people should also commemorate the
national heroes who fought against foreign invasions since the
Opium War (1840-1842).
</P>
<P>
The Va Kio newspaper said in a frontpage editorial that Hong
Kong will enjoy a better future after China resumes its exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also said that Hong Kong's return and the
establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) have far-reaching significance.
</P>
<P>
The Tai Chung Pou newspaper said that Hong Kong's return has
broad and far-reaching significance in five aspects: that China
gets rid of humiliation, that the policy of "one country, two
systems" achieves success, that Hong Kong began to enter a new
era, that China has taken an important step in its reunification
cause and that Hong Kong's return is a success of the people of
the whole people in anti-colonialism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some editorials pointed out that Hong Kong's return
will have a positive impact on Macao, which will also return to
China in two and half years under the same policy of "one country,
two systems."
</P>
<P>
"What happened in Hong Kong today will happen in Macao
tomorrow," the editorial in the Va Kio newspaper said. "Macao can
learn a lot from Hong Kong, such as in the preparation for the
Hong Kong SAR."
</P>
<P>
It added that Macao still needs to do much for a smooth
handover of power in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The Macao government should step up the process of the
localization of civil service, of law and the use of Chinese as an
official language. And the work on the transfer of archives and
government assets should be started as soon as possible," it said,
adding, "The Basic Law of Macao should also be known by more
people."

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's ruling New Korea Party
(NKP) Chairman Lee Hoi-chang resigned today to compete with the
other six contenders for presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
After Lee submitted his resignation, President Kim Young-sam,
the president of the NKP, appointed the party's Standing Adviser
Lee Man-sup as new chairman.
</P>
<P>
Lee's resignation, following his declaration on June 20 to bid
for the party's presidential candidate, has brought an end to the
dispute over his step-down.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who became the NKP chairman in March when the nation was
rocked by the Hanbo scandal, was asked earlier to step down to
ensure a fair competition in the nomination race by the six
promising presidential nominees and the party's largest faction,
the Council for Political Development (CPD).
</P>
<P>
The six are former Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung, Provincial
Governor Rhee In-je, lawmaker Kim Deog-ryong, former Seoul mayor
Choe Byung-yul, veteran politician Park Chan-jong, and Lee
Han-dong..
</P>
<P>
The NKP is expected to choose its presidential candidate at a
national convention scheduled for July 21.
</P>
<P>
Joint speech rallies of the contenders, the highlight of the
20-day campaign, will be held in the party's provincial and
municipal chapters on July 5-16.

On behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's
Government and people of all ethnic groups throughout China, Jiang
extended warm congratulations on the return of Hong Kong and the
establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong marks an end to the 100-year national
humiliation of leaving Hong Kong under foreign occupation and has
opened a new era of common development of Hong Kong and the
inland areas of the motherland," Jiang Zemin said.
</P>
<P>
"It also symbolizes an important step in the great cause of
achieving national reunification and a new contribution of the
Chinese people to world peace, development and progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Comrade Deng Xiaoping made historic contribution
to the settlement of the Hong Kong question and the promotion of
the complete reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"We shall carry forward his legacy and work to ensure the
success of Hong Kong and that of our modernization program and
national reunification," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also paid a great tribute to Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu
Shaoqi, Zhu De and other proletarian revolutionaries of the older
generation who were founders of New China.
</P>
<P>
Through their hard struggle, the Chinese people overturned
feudalism, imperialism and bureaucrat-capitalism and opened a new
epoch of maintaining independence and building socialism, Jiang
said, adding that the Chinese nation will no longer allow itself
to be bullied, oppressed and exploited by others.
</P>
<P>
"Today, the Chinese people have made remarkable achievements in
their modernization endeavor," Jiang said. "As a result, China now
enjoys a higher international status in the world. It is against
this background and for this very reason that Hong Kong has come
back to China."
</P>
<P>
"We will unswervingly carry out the principles of 'one country,
two systems', 'Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong' and 'a high
degree of autonomy', and make sure that the current socioeconomic
system and way of life of Hong Kong remain unchanged and that the
laws now in force in Hong Kong remain basically unchanged," Jiang
Zemin said.

All departments of the central government, provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central
government shall all observe the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR
and none of them shall interfere in the affairs that shall be

"Economic activities, trade and investment interests of other
countries and regions in Hong Kong will be protected by law."
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the implementation of these policies
will not only ensure long-term prosperity and stability in Hong
Kong after its return to the motherland but also help promote the
socialist modernization drive in the interior.
</P>
<P>
It will set an example for a smooth return of Macao and for the
final solution to the Taiwan issue. It will also contribute to

to world peace and stability, he said.

"To modernize our country and rejuvenate our nation, we must
unswervingly implement the basic line advanced by the CPC and
follow the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics

"At the forthcoming 15th National Congress of the CPC, we will
map out a comprehensive strategic plan for reform, development,
stability and other major issues in our country and put forward a
program of action to guide our people in their efforts to press
ahead with the socialist reform, opening-up and modernization
drive towards the new century in an all-round way," the president

BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of the
speech made by Jiang Zemin, President of the People's Republic of
China, at the public gathering today in Beijing in celebration of
the return of Hong Kong to the motherland:
Comrades and Friends,
</P>
<P>
Today, the Chinese and British Governments have held the
handover ceremony of Hong Kong, declaring the resumption by the
Chinese Government of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
and the formal establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China.
With the rising of the Five-Star Red Flag and the Regional Flag of
the SAR over Hong Kong, the over six million Hong Kong compatriots
have now come back to the embrace of the great motherland. The
vast land of China is a scene of jubilation and people from all
corners of the world are fixing their eyes upon Hong Kong. The
return of Hong Kong, the 100-year expectation of the Chinese
people, has finally come true.
</P>
<P>
Tonight, people from all walks of life in Beijing have solemnly
gathered here to celebrate this major event of our nation together
with people in other parts of the country. On behalf of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), the Central People's Government
and people of all ethnic groups in China, I would like to express
my warm congratulations on the return of Hong Kong and on the
establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong marks an end to the 100-year national
humiliation of leaving Hong Kong under foreign occupation and has
opened a new era of common development of Hong Kong and the
mainland. It also symbolizes an important step in the great cause
of achieving national reunification and new contribution of the
Chinese people to world peace, development and progress.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong is a major event in the annals of the
development of the Chinese nation and also in world history in the
twentieth century.

<P>
At this important juncture, we cannot but think of Comrade Deng
Xiaoping, chief architect of China's reform and opening-up program
and the founder of the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics. The contribution he made to the settlement of the
Hong Kong question and the promotion of the complete reunification
of our motherland was of major historic significance. We shall
carry forward his legacy and work to ensure the success of Hong
Kong and that of our modernization program and national
reunification.
</P>
<P>
This important moment has also revived our profound memory of
Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De and other proletarian
revolutionaries of the elder generation who were founders of the
New China and made outstanding contribution to the Chinese
nation. We recall the revolutionary martyrs and noble-minded
patriots who heroically devoted their lives to the liberation of
the Chinese people and to an independent, unified, strong and
prosperous China. They would find it a great relief to hear that
Hong Kong has finally come back to the motherland, Macao will come
back soon, and the prospect of a complete national reunification
and all-round rejuvenation of the Chinese nation now stands
promisingly in sight.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the past in the light of the present, all sorts
of feelings have welled up. Since the beginning of modern history,
the Chinese people, tragically but heroically, traversed a long
and rugged road, a road full of humiliation and hardship,
aspirations and tenacious pursuit, twists and turns, and struggles
and sacrifices. Without all this, we would not have been able to
obtain full independence, progress, development and pride today.
</P>
<P>
In the 1840s and 1850s, Britain launched two aggressive Opium
Wars against China and forced the government of the Qing Dynasty
to sign the Treaty of Nanking, 1842 and the Convention of Peking,
1860, documents of national betrayal and humiliation which led to
the cession of the Hong Kong Island and Kowloon to Britain. With
the Convention of the Extension of Hong Kong in 1898, Britain
forced the lease of the "New Territories" for ninety-nine years,
thus occupying the entire Hong Kong area.

<P>
What the modern history of China also tells us is that the
leadership of an advanced political party and guidance by
scientific theories are indispensable for national liberation and
for building a strong and prosperous country. Comrade Mao Zedong
once said, it was only when the progressives in China found the
scientific theory of Marxism and Leninism as the instrument for
studying a nation's destiny that the Chinese people ceased to be
passive in spirit and gained the initiative. It was the
Communists who, integrating the basic theory of Marxism and
Leninism with the specific reality in China, founded the Mao
Zedong Thought and guided the people of China to their national
independence and liberation and a socialist country with initial
prosperity. Today, it is again the Communists who have carried
forward and developed further Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong
Thought, founded Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics and led the Chinese people to victory and
progress in the reform, opening-up and modernization
endeavour. Without the leadership of the CPC and the guidance of
its scientific theory, it would be inconceivable for us to achieve
national liberation and build China into a strong and prosperous
country.
</P>
<P>
China's modern history also tells us that to catch up with the
progress of the times and trends in world development, a country
must break up self-seclusion and go in for opening up. A major
cause for the backwardness that China suffered after the
industrial revolution in the West was the unwise closed-door
policy adopted by the then feudal rulers, who, unaspiring as they
were, forfeited China of its ability to advance with the times and
to resist the imperialist aggression, leaving it many records of
national betrayal and humiliation. To lift themselves out of
poverty and backwardness, a rotten legacy of history, it is
imperative for the emancipated Chinese people to concentrate on
economic development and conduct extensive economic, trade,
scientific, technological and cultural exchanges and co-operation
with all other countries in the world to draw upon fine fruit of
world civilization.
</P>
<P>
In the fundamental interests of the country and the nation and
in view of historical and practical conditions, Comrade Deng
Xiaoping, with the farsightedness of a great statesman and
strategist, initiated the creative concept of "one country, two
systems", which charted a right path to the realization of our
national reunification. It was in accordance with this concept
that we have successfully worked out a settlement for the question
of Hong Kong's return to the motherland through diplomatic
negotiations, and it has also set a new model for peaceful
settlement by the international community of outstanding
historical issues between states and international disputes.

<P>
The occupation of Hong Kong is an epitome of the humiliation
China suffered in modern history. The Treaty of Nanking was the
first unequal treaty imposed by a big Western power upon the
Chinese people. The Opium War turned China from a feudal society
into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal one.
</P>
<P>
The brutal aggression of China by big powers and the two-fold
imperialist and feudalist oppression of the Chinese people
aggravated their sufferings and hence the crisis of the Chinese
nation. On the other hand, they also awakened the entire nation
and aroused people's resistance which contributed to the
development and social progress of China. This is the rule of
historical dialectics which is independent of the will of the
oppressors.
</P>
<P>
The modern history of China tells us: a backward nation is
liable to grief and a poor and weak one to bullying. The only way
to fundamentally change one's historical fate is to rise up in
resistance and work for a prosperous and powerful country. Ever
since the first day of the big powers' aggression of China, the
Chinese people had held high the patriotic banner in their
struggle for national salvation and survival and against bullying
through unity. From the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Uprising to the
Boxing Movement, from the Reform Movement of 1898 to the
Revolution of 1911 led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, numerous sons and
daughters of the Chinese people and noble-minded patriots advanced
wave upon wave and endured all difficulties and hardships in
pursuit of the salvation for the country and the people. In
particular, after the May 4th Movement and the founding of CPC,
the Chinese people got further united and, through hard struggle,
eventually overturned the "three big mountains" and opened a new
epoch of maintaining independence and building socialism. The
Chinese nation will no longer allow itself to be bullied,
oppressed and exploited by others.  Today, the Chinese people
have made remarkable achievements in their modernization
endeavor. As a result, China now enjoys a higher international
status in the world. It is against this background and for this
very reason that Hong Kong has come back to China.

<P>
Continued prosperity and stability in Hong Kong will benefit
all countries and regions having economic activities, trade and
investment interests in Hong Kong as well as those having economic
and trading ties with the mainland. As this is an issue involving
interests of many parties, we hope that countries and regions
concerned will adopt a constructive and co-operative attitude to
it.
</P>
<P>
Above the sea, the moon shines bright; And everywhere in the
world, people celebrate this moment in solemn delight. On this
fine night, our compatriots in Macao and Taiwan and overseas
Chinese are sharing the joy together with us on this grand
occasion of celebrating Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
Macao will return to the motherland in 1999, which will be
another great event of our nation. Thanks to the friendly
co-operation between China and Portugal, preparations for the
return of Macao are now progressing smoothly. We have full
confidence in Macao's smooth return.
</P>
<P>
It is an ardent aspiration of all Chinese to settle the
question of Taiwan in line with the basic policy of "peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems" and to realize the
great cause of national reunification. We hope that the Taiwan
authorities will, setting store by the overall interests of our
nation, truly return to the one China position and take concrete
steps towards the development of cross-Straits relations and to
the complete reunification of the country.
</P>
<P>
As the 21st century is approaching, profound and encouraging
changes are taking place on this planet where we live. With
accumulated progress of human civilizations of several millennia,
mankind has displayed enormous creativity. Peace and development
have become the mainstream of our times and the world is moving in
a direction favorable to the formation of a multipolar pattern
and the establishment of a just and rational new international
order. The new scientific and technical revolution driven by the
development of the information technology has advanced by leaps
and bounds. And never before have the world economic co-operation
and competition and cultural exchanges and interplay been so
extensive and profound. In today's world, we are faced with both
challenges and opportunities. We must seize the precious
development opportunities without letting them slip away and
courageously take up the challenges to further expand the social
productive force, increase the aggregate national strength of our
country and improve the livelihood of our people.

<P>
We will unswervingly carry out the principles of "one country,
two systems", "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and "a
high degree of autonomy", and make sure that the previous
socio-economic system and way of life of Hong Kong remain
unchanged and that laws previously in force in Hong Kong remain
basically unchanged.
</P>
<P>
We will firmly support the Hong Kong SAR in its exercise of the
functions and powers bestowed on it by the Basic Law and the Hong
Kong SAR Government in its administration in accordance with law.
The Central People's Government shall, in accordance with law,
manage the foreign affairs and defence of the Hong Kong SAR. All
departments of the Central People's Government, provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central
People's Government shall all observe the Basic Law of the Hong
Kong SAR and none of them shall interfere in the affairs that
shall be managed by the Hong Kong SAR on its own in accordance
with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
We will unequivocally protect the rights and freedoms of Hong
Kong residents in accordance with law. Economic activities, trade
and investment interests of other countries and regions in Hong
Kong will be protected by law.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of these policies will not only ensure
long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong after its return
to the motherland but also help promote the socialist
modernization drive on the mainland. It will set an example for a
smooth return of Macao and for the final solution to the Taiwan
question. It will also contribute to enhanced international
economic and technological co-operation and to world peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
In modern times, Hong Kong compatriots waged a heroic struggle
against foreign aggression together with the rest of the Chinese
nation. They have opened up and developed Hong Kong with their
own hands and wisdom. Now that Hong Kong is back in the
motherland, their political status has changed momentously. Never
before have they showed such patriotism towards the motherland and
Hong Kong. There is every reason to believe that with the great
motherland as its strong backing, with the vigorous support of the
entire Chinese people and the concerted efforts of Hong Kong
compatriots, with full exploitation of its unique advantages, the
international metropolis of Hong Kong will shed even greater
radiance.

To realise the modernization of our country and the

<HEADLINE> Three Peace Makers Killed by Kamajors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 1 (Xinhua)- Three delegates on two peace
missions to urge Kamajor militia-men in the south to abandon
their fight and join the military junta in Sierra Leone in a
broad based government were killed in separate incidents on
Sunday, military sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The first incident occurred in Sengehun village, four miles
from Bo when two of the delegates, university lecturer Joseph
Tommy and a leading businessman Moses Jajah were beheaded by a
group of militiamen. Three other delegates fled into a nearby
forest to escape capture by the Kamajors who branded them as
traitors.
</P>
<P>
The third victim, a security officer of a private agency in
Bo, Philip Bayo was beheaded in Gerihun, 22 miles from Bo when he
attempted to hold a peace meeting with a group of Kamajors on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bayo's body was later dumped in a dustbin, local residents
said.
</P>
<P>
According to observers, this is the third group of peace
makers that had been rebuffed by the Kamajors.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a 10 man delegation went to the north on a similar
mission. Nine of the delegates were seized by the Kamajors and
have not yet been released while the tenth was given a message to
four northern paramount chiefs requesting a meeting with the
Kamajors. The chiefs declined the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bo-Kenema highway blocked by Kamajors for over
three weeks was reopened Monday night after government troops
backed by former rebel combatants overran the barrier, killing 10
Kamajors and losing six soldiers after a three day fighting.
</P>
<P>
The first convoy of commercial vehicles carried essential
consumer items including petroleum products, local residents
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Celebrate Return of Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's homecoming has been
enthusiastically welcomed by the Chinese people across the country
who have organized non-stop activities to celebrate the historic
event.
</P>
<P>
In Urumqi, the capital city of north China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, some 10,000 people from all walks of life
gathered at the central square this morning to watch the first
raising of the national flag after the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At 6:30 a.m., the crowd sang the Chinese national anthem as the
Five-Star Red Flag was raised in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
A spectator in his 50s said that today's flag-raising ceremony
is of special significance, as Hong Kong has finally returned to
the embrace of the motherland and the country has become more
powerful.
</P>
<P>
"As people of the Chinese nation, we all feel very proud and
excited," he said.
</P>
<P>
A 64-year-old man who works in a mosque said, "After watching
the handover ceremony, I feel China has become more powerful and I
feel it is sacred to participate in a flag-raising ceremony on a
special day like today."
</P>
<P>
Among the crowd were 62 pairs of newlyweds who gathered for a
joint wedding ceremony.
</P>
<P>
One couple said they timed their wedding to coincide with the
return of Hong Kong because it is "an honorable and memorable
event."
</P>
<P>
In Zhengzhou, capital of central China's Henan Province, the
main streets and the square were decorated with pots of flowers,
flags, banners and lanterns.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese national flag was hoisted in Hong Kong, the
people sang and danced.
</P>
<P>
In Jinghua Village of Xinxiang County, the local park was lit
up and lanterns were hung everywhere. Families gathered in front
of the TV to watch the live broadcast of the midnight handover
ceremony in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We are proud that our country is becoming more powerful and
prosperous by the day, and has erased the traces of humiliation of
over 100 years. And we farmers are becoming better-off day by
day," said a 73-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
In central Hunan Province, Shang Qixu, a centenarian who has
been deaf for 20 years, said, "I cannot hear the footsteps of the
homecoming of Hong Kong with my ears, but I can hear it with my
heart."
</P>
<P>
Shang said he still clearly recalls the unfair treatment he
received from foreigners when he participated in a work-study
program 79 years ago. He said that people of a poor, backward
country are subject to humiliation and bullying and they will
regain their pride only after their country becomes more
powerful.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian first lady, Mrs Vera
Chiluba, has urged people in her country to uphold cultural
values in an effort to halt the spread of the deadly disease of
AIDS, Zambia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Chiluba who is the chairperson of the Hope Foundation of
Zambia, made the appeal in Chingola during her tour of Hope
Foundation clubs in Copperbelt province on Monday.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS could be attributed
to people's negative attitude towards cultural values. She said
that modern generation has discarded traditional values like
abstinence from sex by youths, leading to moral decay and the
outbreak of sexually transmitted diseases like AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Chiluba said that the AIDS pandemic is unfortunately
claiming lives of people still in the prime of their lives.
</P>
<P>
The youths form the bulk of workers in the productive sector
and there would be no meaning for development if they continued
to die from the disease, she added.
</P>
<P>
AIDS is one of the major killer diseases in Zambia. Measures
are on publicity to prevent it from spread particularly among the
youths.

<HEADLINE> Compensation Paid to Families of Victims in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that
34.5 million U.S. dollars in compensation has so far been paid
to bereaved families of 143 victims of an Iranian Airbus shot
down by a U.S. warship in the Persian Gulf in 1988.
</P>
<P>
This was made known by Goudarz Eftekhar Jahromi, head of
the International Legal Services Department of Iran's
Presidential Office, on the eve of the 19th anniversary of the
downing of the airliner on July 3, 1988, which killed all the
290 passengers and crew aboard.
</P>
<P>
The Iran Air Airbus en-route to Dubai of the United Arab
Emirates was shot and blown up into pieces in the air by missiles
fired by the U.S. warship of the USS Vincennes shortly after its
take-off from Bandar Abbas in southern Iran.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the latest measures taken to pay compensated money
to the immediate relatives of the victims, the Iranian official
said that relatives of 32 victims have not yet received their
compensation. Necessary measures have been taken to contact them,
he added.
</P>
<P>
On the payment of the compensation to relatives of each victim,
Jahromi said, some 300,000 dollars will be compensated to the
family of each victim who was a bread-winner of the family while
those victims who were not the major supporters, the families
will receive 150,000 dollars each.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the scale of the catastrophe is such that
payment of the compensation would not make up for the disaster.
The United States will always bear the shameful scars of this
hideous act on its face, he added.

MOSCOW, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian media today gave

<HEADLINE> Southern Philippine Situation Under Control: Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said today that the situation in Mindanao, the southern
Philippines, has been put under control and that the Muslim rebels
would return soon to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
He said that "most, if not all, of the civilian hostages" held
last week by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels have
been released and government agencies have been in place to
provide assistance to dislocated civilians.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating that fears that hostilities between government
troops and the MILF would escalate had no basis, he said the
conflict has been confined to only a few villages in three
provinces in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"The confrontation has died down and again, we are hopeful that
the MILF would resume the peace negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
MILF rebels took some 100 bus passengers last week as human
shields against offensives by government troops. After a fierce
fighting, the rebels freed 60 hostages and fled the area of
conflict.
</P>
<P>
At least 100 rebels have been killed since the military
launched an all-out war on June 16 against MILF rebels suspected
of being involved in kidnap activities in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
After the hostage-taking event, the MILF called off its peace
talks slated for June 29-30 with the government. Since earlier
this year, the two sides have held five rounds of preliminary
talks, but made little progress in forging even a full ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a 12,000-member rebel group, broke away in the 1970s
from the Moro National Liberation Front which inked a final peace
agreement with the government last year.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Again Urges Israel to Implement UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri reiterated here today his country's demand on Israeli
compliance with U.N. Security Council resolution 425, calling for
Israel's unconditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by the state-run Radio Lebanon, the prime minister
denied that France has put forward a suggestion on a partial
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"I've the confidence that France would not take any step in
this direction without consultation with the Lebanese government,
and this was agreed on by us and French President Jacques Chirac,"
Hariri said, claiming that the new French government will honor
the commitments.
</P>
<P>
"There are Israeli words (on a partial withdrawal) we have heard
from time to time," he added. "If Israel really wants to withdraw
from south Lebanon, what it should do is only to implement
resolution 425."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has reportedly
proposed that France will lead a peacekeeping force in south
Lebanon to gradually replace Israeli troops which have occupied a
border strip of the "security zone" in south Lebanon since 1985.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Maariv daily said Monday that Mordechai proposed
the suggestion at a meeting with French Defense Minister Alain
Richard in the French capital Paris last week.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the Israeli defense minister as saying
that Israel would eventually be able to withdraw to the
international border, if the French-led multi-national force
proved able to curb the activities of the Lebanese guerrilla of
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
A today's front-page report of the Lebanese daily As-Safir
quoted French official sources as saying that France had
rejected the Israeli proposal.
</P>
<P>
"This can only be accomplished by agreement of all the parties
concerned and through a comprehensive settlement involving
Lebanon, Syria and Israel," the sources stressed.
</P>
<P>
The special report from Paris said French officials believe
the Israeli proposal was intended to pacify Israeli public
opinion which is increasingly demanding an Israeli troop
withdrawal from south Lebanon in view of the increasing Israeli
casualties caused by Hezbollah guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese militant group of Hezbollah often launches
cross-border attacks to fight against the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Israeli soldiers have been killed and some 50 others
wounded in clashes with Hezbollah fighters on the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict since this year.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Warmly Congratulates on Hong Kong's Return to Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chinese
President and Chairman of the Central Military Commission
expressed his warm congratulations on Hong Kong's return to the
motherland and the establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) this evening at a public gathering
in Beijing in celebration of the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the gathering, Jiang said, "The Chinese and
British Governments have held the handover ceremony of Hong Kong,
declaring the resumption by the Chinese government of the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the formal establishment of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic
of China."
</P>
<P>
"With the rising of the Five-Star Red Flag and the Regional
Flag of the SAR over Hong Kong, the over six million Hong Kong
compatriots have now come back to the embrace of the great
motherland. The vast land of China is a scene of jubilation and
people from all corners of the world are fixing their eyes upon
Hong Kong. The return of Hong Kong, the 100-year expectation of
the Chinese people, has finally come true," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the return of Hong Kong is a major event in
the annals of the development of the Chinese nation and also in
world history in the twentieth century.
</P>
<P>
"At this important juncture, we cannot but think of Comrade
Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of China's reform and opening-up
program and the founder of the theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics. The contribution he made to the
settlement of the Hong Kong question and the promotion of the
complete reunification of our motherland was of major historic
significance. We shall carry forward his legacy and work to ensure
the success of Hong Kong and that of our modernization program and
national reunification.
</P>
<P>
"This important moment has also revived our profound memory of
Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De and other proletarian
revolutionaries of the elder generation who were founders of the
New China and made outstanding contribution to the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
"we recall the revolutionary martyrs and noble-minded patriots
who heroically devoted their lives to the liberation of the
Chinese people and to an independent, unified, strong and
prosperous China. They would find it a great relief to hear that
Hong Kong has finally come back to the motherland, Macao will come
back soon, and the prospect of a complete national reunification
and all-round rejuvenation of the Chinese nation now stands
promisingly in sight."
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the past in the light of the present, Jiang said,
all sorts of feelings have welled up. "Since the beginning of
modern history, the Chinese people, tragically but heroically,
traversed a long and rugged road, a road full of humiliation and
hardship, aspirations and tenacious pursuit, twists and turns and
struggles and sacrifices. Without all this, we would not have been
able to obtain full independence, progress, development and pride
today," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "In modern times, Hong Kong compatriots waged a
heroic struggle against foreign aggression together with the rest
of the Chinese nation. They have opened up and developed Hong Kong
with their own hands and wisdom. Now that Hong Kong is back in the
motherland, their political status has changed momentously. Never
before have they showed such patriotism towards the motherland and
Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
He said that there is every reason to believe that with the
great motherland as its strong backing, with the vigorous support
of the entire Chinese people and the concerted efforts of Hong
Kong compatriots, with full exploitation of its unique advantages,
the international metropolis of Hong Kong will shed even greater
radiance.

Government's resumption of its exercise of sovereignty over Hong

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Fundamental Reason for Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin today
attributed Hong Kong's return to the motherland to the Chinese
people's overturning of the "three big mountains" on the back of
the Chinese people through hard struggle and to their opening of a
new epoch of maintaining independence and building socialism.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the remarkable achievements made by the Chinese
people in their modernization endeavor and a higher international
status in the world enjoyed by the country is another fundamental
reason and the background for Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks while addressing a public gathering in
Beijing this evening in celebration of the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The modern history of China tells us: a backward nation is
liable to grief and a poor and weak one to bullying. The only way
to fundamentally change one's historical fate is to rise up in
resistance and work for a prosperous and powerful country," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the first day of the big powers' aggression of
China, Jiang said, the Chinese people had held high the patriotic
banner in their struggle for national salvation and survival and
against bullying through unity.
</P>
<P>
"From the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Uprising to the Boxing
Movement, from the Reform Movement of 1898 to the Revolution of
1911 led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, numerous sons and daughters of the
Chinese people and noble-minded patriots advanced wave upon wave
and endured all difficulties and hardships in pursuit of the
salvation for the country and the people.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, after the May 4th Movement and the founding of
the CPC, the Chinese people got further united and, through hard
struggle, eventually overturned the 'three big mountains' and
opened a new epoch of maintaining independence and building
socialism.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese nation will no longer allow itself to be bullied,
oppressed and exploited by others. Today, the Chinese people have
made remarkable achievements in their modernization endeavor.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, China now enjoys a higher international status in
the world. It is against this background and for this very reason
that Hong Kong has come back to China," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "What the modern history of China also tells us is
that the leadership of an advanced political party and guidance by
scientific theories are indispensable for national liberation and
for building a strong and prosperous country."
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that it was the Communists who, integrating the
basic theory of Marxism and Leninism with the specific reality in
China, founded the Mao Zedong Thought and guided the people of
China to their national independence and liberation and a
socialist country with initial prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"Today, it is again the Communists who have carried forward and
developed further Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought,
founded Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and led the Chinese people to victory and progress
in the reform, opening-up and modernization endeavor.
</P>
<P>
"Without the leadership of the CPC and the guidance of its
scientific theory, it would be inconceivable for us to achieve
national liberation and build China into a strong and prosperous
country," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that to catch up with the progress of the times and
trends in world development, a country must break up
self-seclusion and go in for opening up.
</P>
<P>
"A major cause for the backwardness that China suffered after
the industrial revolution in the West was the unwise closed-door
policy adopted by the then feudal rulers, who, unaspiring as they
were, forfeited China of its ability to advance with the times and
to resist the imperialist aggression, leaving it many records of
national betrayal and humiliation.
</P>
<P>
"To lift themselves out of poverty and backwardness, a rotten
legacy of history, it is imperative for the emancipated Chinese
people to concentrate on economic development and conduct
extensive economic, trade, scientific, technological and cultural
exchanges and co-operation with all other countries in the world
to draw upon fine fruit of world civilization," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin: China To Unswervingly Carry out Principle of "One Country, Two Systems" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
today that China will unswervingly carry out the principles of
"one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people administering Hong
Kong" and "a high degree of autonomy", and make sure that the
previous socio-economic system and way of life of Hong Kong remain
unchanged and that laws previously in force in Hong Kong remain
basically unchanged.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while speaking at a public gathering in
Beijing in celebration of the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We will firmly support the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) in its exercise of the functions and powers bestowed
on it by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong SAR Government in its
administration in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
"The Central People's Government shall, in accordance with law,
manage the foreign affairs and defence of the Hong Kong SAR. All
departments of the Central People's Government, provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central
People's Government shall all observe the Basic Law of the Hong
Kong SAR and none of them shall interfere in the affairs that
shall be managed by the Hong Kong SAR on its own in accordance
with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
"We will unequivocally protect the rights and freedoms of Hong
Kong residents in accordance with law. Economic activities, trade
and investment interests of other countries and regions in Hong
Kong will be protected by law," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the implementation of these policies will not
only ensure long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong after
its return to the motherland but also help promote the socialist
modernization drive on the mainland. "It will set an example for a
smooth return of Macao and for the final solution to the Taiwan
question. It will also contribute to enhanced international
economic and technological co-operation and to world peace and
stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that continued prosperity and stability in
Hong Kong will benefit all countries and regions having economic
activities, trade and investment interests in Hong Kong as well as
those having economic and trading ties with the mainland. He said
that as this is an issue involving interests of many parties, "we
hope that countries and regions concerned will adopt a
constructive and co-operative attitude to it."

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK), South Korea and the United States have agreed to
hold four-party peace talks to formally end the 1950-53 Korean
War, United States officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached, Monday, after a one-day meeting of
senior officials from the three nations in a New York hotel.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement said China would join the talks, proposed by
U.S. President Bill Clinton during his visit to South Korea in
April 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The three delegations agreed that the four parties involved
will meet for preparatory talks on August 5 in New York," said a
separate statement issued by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright today.
</P>
<P>
"At that meeting, the four parties will decide the date, venue,
agenda and procedures for the formal start of four-party peace
talks," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The 1953 armistice ended the fighting in the Korea War, but
technically not the war on the Korean peninsula. The proposed
four-party peace talks are designed to replace the armistice with
a formal peace treaty.

<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and
Chinese president, said here this evening that the forthcoming
15th National Congress of the CPC will map out a comprehensive
strategic plan for reform, development, stability and other major
issues in China.
</P>
<P>
It will also put forward a program of action to guide the
Chinese people in their efforts to press ahead with the socialist

as to open up new prospects for the continued thriving of our
cause."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, "As the 21st century is approaching, profound and
encouraging changes are taking place on this planet where we
live. With accumulated progress of human civilizations of several
millennia, mankind has displayed enormous creativity. Peace and
development have become the mainstream of our times and the world
is moving in a direction favourable to the formation of a
multipolar pattern and the establishment of a just and rational
new international order. The new scientific and technical
revolution driven by the development of the information technology
has advanced by leaps and bounds.
</P>
<P>
"And never before have the world economic co-operation and
competition and cultural exchanges and interplay been so extensive
and profound. In today's world, we are faced with both challenges
and opportunities. We must seize the precious development
opportunities without letting them slip away and courageously take
up the challenges to further expand the social productive force,
increase the aggregate national strength of our country and
improve the livelihood of our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people love peace dearly and fully appreciate its
value, he said, adding, "We will unswervingly pursue the
independent foreign policy of peace, oppose hegemonism and power
politics, support international just causes, continue to develop
friendly relations and co-operation with all countries in the
world, and will never seek hegemony. We are committed to regional
and world peace and we want to be trustworthy friends of world
people forever."

<P>
Jiang said, "Reviewing the history and looking into the future,

<HEADLINE> Beijing Rally Highlights National Unity and Patriotism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A number of Chinese officials
highlighted the importance of national unity and patriotism in
speeches to a crowd of some 80,000 Beijing people gathered at
Workers' Stadium this evening here in the Chinese capital to
celebrate Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The speakers urged their countrymen to unite more closely
around the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at its core in the period following the return of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
They also vowed that the nation's officials will do their part
to step up the socialist modernization drive as well as the
reunification of the motherland, and revive the nation under the
guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"After the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, leading
officials at all levels in our city will strictly observe
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region and
further study and implement the central government's basic
principles and various policies regarding Hong Kong," said Wei
Jianxing, secretary of the Beijing Committee of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
He urged that exchanges and cooperation between Beijing and
Hong Kong be broadened, and that the nation work for the long-term
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In addition, educational programs designed to spread patriotism
among the general public should be continued, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fei Xiaotong, on behalf of non-Communist parties and persons
and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that
China lost its national dignity in the period between the Opium
War in 1840 and the founding of the New China in 1949. To change
its destiny, China waged bold and time-honored struggles, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prerequisites for the return of Hong Kong were the
achievements made in the socialist construction as well as the
rise of China's international status, Fei said.
</P>
<P>
He also referred to the praiseworthy unity among different
ethnic groups and that of all patriotic organizations, which
provide the basic guarantee of the nation's development course.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qizao, speaking for various non-governmental
organizations, said that without the Chinese people's long-term
struggles, and without the leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party, China could not have achieved its independence or seen
development and prosperity, nor could Hong Kong have returned to
the embrace of the motherland, she added.
</P>
<P>
Huang noted that the return of Hong Kong demonstrates the
success of Deng Xiaoping's "one country, two systems" concept, and
is an important milestone in the process to reunify the nation.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the reunification of our great motherland as a
whole will unquestionably be achieved one day," she said.

<HEADLINE> Bailey faces Challenge in Lausanne GP Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Olympic 100 meters champion Donovan
Bailey faces the fastest sprinters at the Lausanne athletics
meeting on Wednesday after he beat Michael Johnson and Linford
Christie in two 150 meters showdowns last month.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian will find out if he can defend his title at next
month's world championships in Athens when he runs 100 meters at
the Lausanne grand prix meeting.
</P>
<P>
His opponents are expected to include Namibia's Frankie
Fredericks, the Olympic silver medallist who ran 9.92 seconds last
week, bronze medallist Ato Boldon of Trinidad, whose best mark
this season was 9.89 seconds, and Britain's former world and
Olympic champion Linford Christie.
</P>
<P>
The track is fast at the Athletissima meeting. American Leroy
Burrell, who is also in the field, ran the former world record of
9.85 in the stadium in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Last season Fredericks went within 0.01 of a second of that
mark when he beat Bailey and Christie in a similar high-class
clash in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
Bailey has been cashing in on his Atlanta success in the first
stage of the season, taking on American 200 and 400 Olympic
champion Johnson in a $1.5 million showdown over the rarely-run
150 metres in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday he made another $82,500 in just over 15 seconds when
he beat Christie in a winner-takes-all 150 metres duel in
Sheffield.

<HEADLINE> Drums, Cymbals Mark Hong Kong Handover in Melbourne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The beating of drums and cymbals
reached a crescendo as Chinese dragons moved through Melbourne,
marking China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong in celebrations tonight.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Chinese-Australians from more than 100 community
groups joined the dragons as they danced their way through
Chinatown to the Melbourne Town Hall.
</P>
<P>
There they took part in an international performance for more
than 2,000 guests. Melbourne is home to 160,000 Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In a blast of firecrackers, the dragons performed for several
dignitaries including Lord Mayor Ivan Deveson, state opposition
leader John Brumby and Chinese Consul-General Liang Jianming
before a cocktail party ahead of the performance, the Australian
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The town hall celebrations followed a high-flyers' party held
by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce last evening at the Crown
Casino.
</P>
<P>
This evening's performance included Chinese dancers and singers
from Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Organizer for the Hong Kong Return to China committee Adrienne
Farrelly said the Chinese communities in Melbourne were "over the
moon" about the handover.
</P>
<P>
She said most Chinese-Australians believed Hong Kong could only
benefit from the change.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong-born Kam Lam, who is also the president of the
Chinese Unity Association, said Hong Kong's return to China was
"fantastic".
</P>
<P>
"We have been waiting for too long," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of what political side you are on, Hong Kong
belongs to China. It's the young child returning to the mother,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Exchange Reserves up in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is sitting on foreign
exchange reserves well in excess of one billion U.S. Dollars
partly due to the coffee boom over recent years, the East Africa
Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The country has come a long way from 15 years ago when it was
down to barely three weeks' equivalent of imports in foreign
exchange reserves, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, sceptics argue that a substantial portion of Kenya's
foreign reserves comprises so-called hot money that has come in
to take advantage of the high interests rates on the local
market, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report also warned that capital money is finding their way
out of the eastern African country because of lack of security
for investments or limited investment channels although the
Exchange Control Act is in place.
</P>
<P>
The exchange control as means to control capital is never a
solution, the report concluded.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Press Hails Hong Kong's Return to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian press today published
editorials and commentaries hailing the return of Hong Kong to
China, terming Hong Kong's handover as a final nail in coffin of
the British colonialism.
</P>
<P>
Persian Daily Abrar's political commentary said "China's
resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
symbolizes the end of the era of humiliation."
</P>
<P>
"It also heralds the beginning of a new period in history in
which the colonial powers have declined," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that Hong Kong's return to China is not
merely the return of a piece of land, but also the return of
national self-confidence, power and prestige.
</P>
<P>
The English daily Tehran Times today welcomed the return of
Hong Kong to China, saying that the event marks the end of the
British colonialism in the world.
</P>
<P>
The British empire was built at the cost of pauperization and
underdevelopment of a large number of countries and territories
in the southern hemisphere, it noted.
</P>
<P>
"Whether it was spice trade from India, rubber and jute from
south and southeast Asia or oil from Middle East, Great Britain
exploited host countries either through direct colonization or
long-term contracts," said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
Almost until the end of World War II, it said, no colony dared
to defy British colonial rule for the answer of the colonial
rulers to the empty-handed freedom fighters came through barrels
of gun and cannon.
</P>
<P>
"The handover of Hong Kong to China on July 1 was the final
nail in the coffin of British colonial rule in southeast
Asia. This gives a message for third world countries,
neocolonialism which replaced old colonialism will not last long
and the message for neocolonialism is that sooner or later it has
to perish," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Kar-o-Karegar's political commentary said "the
return of Hong Kong can be source of achievement of great
results for China. In the first analysis, the return of this
island would mean the end of national humiliation, and an
end to bitter memories of the past defeats, and an end to
the colonial rule over a part of the Chinese territory."
</P>
<P>
The handover would be a boost to the national pride and
patriotism in China, it said.
</P>
<P>
The daily said "This is something that Chinese leaders have
been seeking in order to elevate China's international stature."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, this victory can herald the resolution
of the Taiwan problem in the future, it added.
</P>
<P>
After taking over Hong Kong from the British and Macao from the
Portuguese, China would only think about Taiwan. The daily said,
the Chinese leaders hope that with the success of the concept of
"One Country, Two Systems," they would eventually bring about a
reunification of Taiwan with the motherland.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Office of Commissioner of the
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) was inaugurated here today.
</P>
<P>
At the zero hour today, a five-star red flag, China's national
flag, was hoisted in front of the building of the commissioner
office.
</P>
<P>
The office will deal with relevant foreign affairs concerning
the HKSAR on behalf of the Central People's Government and will
serve as a channel through which the HKSAR government communicates
the central government over such affairs. Its establishment is an
important symbol of China's resumption of exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Chief
Executive of the HKSAR Tung Chee Hwa and Commissioner of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR Ma Yuzhen attended the
inaugural ceremony held this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Extending warm congratulations on the inauguration of the
office on behalf of the Central People's Government, Qian said
that the resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
by the Chinese government is a great historical event for the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The event has filled the heart of every Chinese at home and
abroad with exultation and pride, as well as confidence in Hong
Kong's bright future, he added.
</P>
<P>
"To maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong is the
strong desire of the Hong Kong compatriots, which is also shared
by their 1.2 billion fellow countrymen in the inland areas," he
said, adding that the Central People's Government would
unswervingly implement the policies of "one country, two systems",
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law of the HKSAR, he said, the Central

handle relevant external affairs on its own in accordance with the
law.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the wish that the Office of the Foreign Ministry
Commissioner in the HKSAR would maintain close contacts and
cooperation with the HKSAR government and make positive
contributions to safeguarding state sovereignty and interests,
protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the Hong Kong
compatriots, and promoting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong.

</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Governorship Election Put Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The much-speculated postponement of
Nigeria's governorship election to next year was confirmed during
a meeting between Head of State General Sani Abacha and former
U.S. president Jimmy Carter on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Abuja, the capital, at the end of his
two-day visit to Nigeria, Carter said General Abacha confirmed
the shift to him, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
But Carter gave no details of the election originally
scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year according to the
military administration's three-year transition to civil rule
program announced in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
"He was pleading with me that although the election of
governors for this year will not be held as scheduled in October,
the governorship election will be held next year, the same year
as election for president," Carter added.
</P>
<P>
He said Abacha reassured him on certain decisions made by the
government to have free and democratic elections so that the
October 1, 1998 military disengagement date could be realized.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. president said there was no assurance yet on
the release of former head of state General Obasanjo and
Major-General Yar'Adua imprisoned on alleged involvement of a
coup, as well as the detention of Chief M.K.O. Abiola for alleged
treason. Abiola was said to be the winner of the annulled
presidential election in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Their imprisonment was the cause of the lingering strained
relations between Nigeria and America, said Carter, now head of
the Carter Center, a foundation committed to the eradication of
Guinea-worm and river blindness in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said: "A lot of problems have been brought about by the
fact that the rule of law in Nigeria has not been prosecuted
properly."
</P>
<P>
However, while kicking against the imposition of further
sanctions on Nigeria, Carter said he would see improved
diplomatic ties between Abuja and Washington.
</P>
<P>
Western countries have imposed sanctions on Nigeria since the
military administration's execution of nine minority nationality
activists in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
The alleged poor human rights record in the country has come
under fresh attack from Britain and the U.S., with the new
British Labor government vowing that it would not compromise its
tough stand until there is a positive change by the military
government.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) has invited
Nigeria's opposition National Democratic Coalition and several
pro-democracy groups to London for discussion on the country's
political situation.
</P>
<P>
The discussions, expected for July 10, are to enable CMAG to
decide whether the suspension slammed on Nigeria two years ago
should be lifted, retained or even changed to expulsion.

TIANJIN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- More than nine million people in
Tianjin, the biggest port city of north China, are taking part in
various activities to celebrate Hong Kong's return to the
motherland after more than 156 years' colonial rule under the
British.
</P>
<P>
China resumed its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong today.
</P>
<P>
All streets and lanes in Tianjin have been decorated with red
lanterns and colorful flags, but the most popular decoration and
symbol of national pride is the five-star national flag.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has opened the gates of all its park free to the
public. Many of them will hold outdoor performances to mark the
arrival of the long-awaited day.
</P>
<P>
"Water Park", the city's largest, has been spruced up for the
event. A floral map of China, made from red buds and featuring
Chinese characters "Welcome Hong Kong's Return", is one of the
park's highlights.
</P>
<P>
Eight islets in the park have been planted with 1,997 colorful
flags, while scrolls bearing messages of welcome flutter high in
the sky above roads and bridges outside.
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was out playing. Workers with Dongya Woollen Mill
of Tianjin decided to spend the July 1 national holiday in their
factory to show their happiness.
</P>
<P>
Deng Weisheng, director of the mill and also a national labor
model, said that "Modern history proves that without the Communist
Party of China (CPC), there would be none of the present day's
strength and prosperity. Likewise, Dongya would not be so well
developed without reform and opening."
</P>
<P>
A major ceremony was also held by Tianjin Municipal Government
this morning in the city's stadium. About 3,000 people from the
city's professional and amateur troupes gave performances at
gathering, presided over by city mayor Zhang Lichang.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of the
speech made by Li Peng, Premier of China's State Council, at a
reception celebrating the return of Hong Kong to the motherland:

Distinguished Guests, Friends and Comrades,
</P>
<P>
Today the Chinese and British Governments have successfully
held the ceremony for the handover of Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) has announced its
establishment. Hong Kong, which has gone through countless
vicissitudes, has finally returned to the embrace of the great
motherland. The day will be inscribed in the annals of history as
a grand festival for the Chinese nation. Today is also the 76th
anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. It is
indeed a day of great rejoicing for double celebration.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of national jubilation we have gathered here to
solemnly celebrate the return of Hong Kong. This is not only a
celebration of a new epoch for Hong Kong and a major victory in
the great cause of China's peaceful reunification, but also a
celebration of a great triumph for justice and progress of mankind.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong will not erase our memory of the
humiliation and the struggle of the Chinese nation in modern
history. For over a century, numerous fine sons and daughters of
the Chinese nation have fought successively and bravely for
national independence and liberation, adding a brilliant chapter
to China's annals of national salvation and rejuvenation. The
return of Hong Kong has wiped out the century-long national
humiliation and greatly kindled the patriotic passion of people of
all ethnic groups in China.
</P>
<P>
At this very moment we deeply cherish the memory of the
revolutionary martyrs and forerunners for their great
achievements, treasure all the more the ever growing prosperity of
the great motherland today and stiffen our determination to
further advance China's socialist modernization drive.

The future of Hong Kong has attracted the attention of not only
the entire Chinese people but also of the international
community. The basic guideline of China for Hong Kong is "one
country, two systems", "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"
and a high degree of autonomy with the current capitalist system
and way of life remaining unchanged and its laws basically
unchanged. This guideline has been written into the Basic Law of
the Hong Kong SAR in clear terms and solemnly announced both at
home and abroad. As provided for in the Basic Law, The Hong Kong
SAR, directly under the Central People's Government, is vested
with the executive, legislative and independent judicial power,
including that of final adjudication.
</P>
<P>
The Central People's Government supports the Hong Kong SAR
Government in exercising its functions and powers according to
law. The departments under the Hong Kong SAR Government are not
administratively subordinated to corresponding departments under
the Central Government and the latter shall not interfere in the
affairs that, according to law, shall be managed by Hong Kong
itself. We are convinced that long-term prosperity and stability
will surely be maintained in Hong Kong as long as those basic
guidelines and policies are earnestly implemented.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR was formulated in accordance
with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and by
taking into full account the history and reality of Hong Kong. A
democratic system that is consistent with the provisions of the
Basic Law and suits Hong Kong's reality will surely develop in a
gradual manner in Hong Kong and our Hong Kong compatriots will
surely enjoy extensive rights and freedom unparalleled during the
colonial rule. With the return of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong
compatriots have become the real master of the land and they are
fully capable of creating an even better future by giving full
play to their wisdom and talent.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return to the motherland has injected fresh
vitality into its economy. And Hong Kong is blessed with unique
advantages for its economic growth. The sustained, rapid and sound
development of national economy in the inland areas as a result of
the reform and opening policy has provided the economy of Hong
Kong with strong support. An enhanced role of Hong Kong as a
bridge and linkage between the mainland economy and the
international economy will facilitate the modernization drive of
the mainland. The enterprises of the mainland operating in Hong
Kong have worked actively to strengthen the economic ties and
cooperation between the motherland and Hong Kong, and they will
continue to participate in the market competition on an equal
footing and thus contribute to the prosperity and stability of
Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Approves Cut of Port Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos has
approved a 50 percent reduction of existing port charges for
vessels plying ports accredited under the
Brunei-Indonesia-Philippines-East ASEAN Growth Area Program.
</P>
<P>
A news release from the Presidential Palace said today that
port dues were fixed at 0.040 US dollar per gross tonnage (GRT)
while dockage charges were reduced to 0.020 US dollar per GRT.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of port charges was based on the proposed
arrangement between the Philippines and Indonesia to adopt a
common tariff for vessels plying the ports accredited under the
program, it said.
</P>
<P>
The tariff cuts, it added, were designed to further boost
shipping activities between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also directed Philippine Port Authority General Manager
Carlos Agustin to issue the appropriate guidelines of the revised
port charges in coordination with the Maritime Industry Authority.

<TEXT>
<P>
A prosperous and stable Hong Kong serves not only the interests
of China but also those of other countries in the world. Hong Kong
will continue to play a unique role in the Asia-Pacific region and
global economy by remaining a separate customs territory, free
port and international financial, trade and shipping center. As
Hong Kong will maintain and improve its sound investment
environment already in place, we believe all personages with
vision from the business community can see the bright prospect for
economic growth in Hong Kong and will increase their economic and
trade exchanges with it. The legitimate interests of all countries
of the world in Hong Kong will be protected by law.
</P>
<P>
Now that China has resumed the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong, Hong Kong affairs have become internal affairs of
China's. According to the Basic Law, the Central People's
Government shall be responsible for the foreign affairs and
defense of Hong Kong. The Office of the Commissioner of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong SAR has been established
and the People's Liberation Army Garrison in Hong Kong has already
been deployed. The Central Government will not interfere in
anything that should, according to the Basic Law, be decided by
Hong Kong people themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR is authorized by the Central People's
Government to handle a very broad range of external affairs on its
own. It may, on its own, using the name "Hong Kong, China",
maintain and develop relations and conclude and implement
agreements with foreign states and regions and relevant
international organizations in the fields, including economy,
trade, finance, shipping, communications, tourism, culture and
sports. It may join international organizations and participate in
international conferences in an appropriate capacity, establish
economic and trade offices in foreign countries, and apply
immigration controls on entry into and exit from the region.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will continue to take part in the activities of over
30 international organizations and more than 200 international
conventions will continue to be applicable to Hong Kong. China has
concluded agreements with 94 countries on maintaining their
consular missions in Hong Kong and it has also reached an
agreement with Britain on the establishment by the latter of a
consulate-general in Hong Kong through negotiations. Some official
missions established in Hong Kong by states which have not
established formal diplomatic relations with China may also be
maintained in an appropriate capacity. Hong Kong will continue to
unilaterally grant visa-free access to people from 170-odd
countries and regions. A number of countries have also waived visa
requirements for people holding the Hong Kong SAR passports and we
hope to see more countries do so. With the powerful backing of the
motherland, Hong Kong will enjoy a stronger status in
international activities.

<P>
The return of Hong Kong represents an important milestone for a
complete reunification of the motherland. The scientific concept
of "one country, two systems" initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping
has now been put into practice in Hong Kong. The preparations for
Macao's return are progressing systematically. If the formula of
"one country, two systems" works in Hong Kong and Macao, it
should also work in Taiwan. No matter how many difficulties we may
encounter in the road ahead, we will and can achieve the complete
reunification of our motherland.
</P>
<P>
We are now standing at the threshold of the 21st century. The
world today is moving towards multipolarity at an accelerated pace
and peace and development remain the main themes of our time. The
goal of China's economic development is to enable our people to
lead a relatively comfortable life by the end of this century and
to basically realize modernization by the middle of the next
century. As China is a developing country, its modernization drive
requires strenuous efforts of several generations, and therefore
it needs a long-term peaceful international climate and a
favourable surrounding environment.
</P>
<P>
The peace-loving Chinese people will always be an important
force in maintaining world peace and regional stability, and they
will never pose a threat to any other country. Pursuing an
independent foreign policy of peace, China stands ready to develop
friendly relations and cooperation with all countries in the world
on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and
make unremitting efforts to promote the establishment of a new
international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
This vast land of China is now a thriving scene of political
stability, economic growth, national unity and social
progress. Holding high the great banner of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, a theory initiated by Comrade Deng
Xiaoping, and under the leadership of the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, the Chinese people are
forging ahead courageously and with full confidence for the
complete national reunification and the great revitalization of
the Chinese nation!
</P>
<P>
Now, I would like to propose a toast
</P>
<P>
To the return of Hong Kong to the embrace of the motherland and
to its long-term prosperity and stability,
</P>
<P>
To the prosperity and reunification of China and to the
well-being of its people,
</P>
<P>
To world peace and development,
</P>
<P>
To the health of all the distinguished guests, diplomatic
envoys to China and their wives, and
</P>
<P>
To the health of the friends and comrades present!

an erratic start to the new financial year, sinking sharply from
the opening bell before rebounding to end only slightly weaker.

fell 14.93 points to 7,672.79 ahead of a key Federal Reserve
meeting on interest rate policy starting tonight.

of profit-taking after the market ended the 1996-97 financial year

But a gradual recovery from mid-morning demonstrated the
ongoing support underpinning the market.

all industrials dropped 10.8 points to 4,291.0, with interest
rate-sensitive banking stocks mostly weaker.
</P>

Intersuisse's Andrew Sekely said there may be a growing belief
that an interest rate cut was perhaps not just around the corner,
the Reserve Bank of Australia met today.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank rose 4.9 cents to 19.02 Australian
dollars but the Commonwealth Bank slipped 16 to 15.84 Australian

<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A flotilla of boats sailed for the
first time Monday through the diversion canal which has been built
to allow navigation to continue on the Yangtze River as work on
the coffer dam, part of the Three Gorges Project, nears completion.
</P>
<P>
The 3.5-km-long canal, 350 meters in width at the bottom and 58
meters deep, is both wider and deeper than the Suez and Panama
canals, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The man-made canal, into which water from the river has been
diverted, will also be used to discharge floods when necessary.
</P>
<P>
Dredging of the canal floor is continuing to provide a better

SHENZHEN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen people stayed up through
the night and gave a rapturous welcome at dawn to the first group
of Hong Kong compatriots to come back "home" over the Lo Wu Bridge
in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Forty-year-old Mr. Kwan was the first Hong Kong resident to
cross into Shenzhen and be confronted by crowds singing and
dancing to celebrate a special homecoming.
</P>
<P>
"I feel so lucky to be the first to `come back home'," he said,
"I was celebrating the return all night long, so just came here
straight afterwards."

One humorous old man hurrying across the bridge at the crack of
dawn was asked why he came here so early. "I've been waiting all
my life," he replied.
</P>
<P>
Another early bird was Mr. Lo, who told reporters that he came
early for a celebratory morning tea appointment with his friends
in Shenzhen. Morning tea is a traditional breakfast event in south

Lion dancers and other artists were still going strong at Lo Wu
Bridge, despite having sung and danced all through the night.

foreign states and regions and relevant international
organizations in the fields including economy, trade, finance,
shipping, communications, tourism, culture and sports, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
It may join international organizations and participate in
international conferences in an appropriate capacity, establish
economic and trade offices in foreign countries, and apply
immigration controls on entry into and exit from the region, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will continue to take part in the activities of over
30 international organizations and more than 200 international
conventions will continue to be applicable to Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said China has concluded agreements with 94 countries on
maintaining their consular missions in Hong Kong and it has also
reached an agreement with Britain on the establishment by the
latter of a consulate-general in Hong Kong through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Missions established in Hong Kong by some states which have not
formal diplomatic relations with China may also be maintained in
an appropriate capacity, he noted, adding that Hong Kong will
continue to unilaterally grant visa-free access to people from
170-odd countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
"A number of countries have also waived visa requirements for
people holding the HKSAR passports and we hope to see more
countries do so," Li said.
</P>
<P>
With the powerful backing of the motherland, Hong Kong will
enjoy a stronger status in international activities, he said.

MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) said today that it was considering a third party to
broker the resumption of its peace negotiations with the
Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs, said
in a statement that he wanted a third party to mediate in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The MILF earlier called off the sixth round low-level meeting
between the two parties, which was scheduled for June 28-29 in the
southern North Cotabato province, following the outbreak of
hostilities there.
</P>
<P>
Government troops attacked MILF rebels last week who held
hostage some 100 persons in North Cotabato, leaving about 100
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
The fierce conflict also caused the evacuation of some 66,000
civilians. At present, the displaced are still housed at some 39
evacuation centers in North Cotabato and Maguindanao provinces.
</P>
<P>
With the prevailing situation, peace advocates had called on
the immediate resumption of talks between the two groups for the
evacuees to be able to return home.
</P>
<P>
Several related organizations and church groups proposed a
third party in a bid to bring the government and the MILF peace
panels back to the negotiating table.

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Mayor Anticipates Stronger Ties With Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to China
will present new opportunities for trade and economic cooperation
between San Francisco and Hong Kong, San Francisco Mayor said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there will be alternations in Hong Kong," Willie
Brown said in an interview with Xinhua. "Hong Kong will remain its
position of an international financial and trade center."
</P>
<P>
With Chinese consisting of 25 percent of the population in San
Francisco, the city has strong ties with Hong Kong and other
cities of China. The mayor noted that trade and family ties
between San Francisco and Hong Kong were very strong.
</P>
<P>
Brown, who has visited Hong Kong for four times, said that he
has strong confidence in Hong Kong's future. He said he was
considering opening a trade office in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In another interview, Leland Y. Yee, Supervisor of San
Francisco, also said that the relationship between San Francisco
and Hong Kong will continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
"The Board of Supervisors have passed a resolution to continue
support of Hong Kong," Yee, an American Chinese, said. "The people
of San Francisco have always understood that Hong Kong would
eventually come back to China, so now the support of China by
Chinese community will be even greater."
</P>
<P>
Yee said as an American Chinese, he woke up early this morning
to watch TV broadcasting on Hong Kong's handover ceremony. He
said, "All Chinese Americans are very proud of the handover of
Hong Kong to China."
</P>
<P>
He said he believes China is going to get stronger and more
prosperous.

<HEADLINE> Britain Sails out of Hong Kong in Imperial Twilight (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 -- The lowering of the Union flag at midnight
June 30 marked the end of Britain's 156-year colonial rule in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The final act of British withdrawal from Hong Kong was
performed by the royal yacht Britannia. Carrying the Prince of
Wales and the last British governor in Hong Kong, Christopher
Patten, the ship sailed out of the Victoria Harbor in the wee
hours of today.
</P>
<P>
British withdrawal began in the afternoon of July 30 at the
Government House on a hill slope in the district of Central on
Hong Kong Island, the official residence for 25 British Hong Kong
governors.
Amid a steady drizzle, Chris Patten bid farewell to this House
where he had lived for five years.
</P>
<P>
At 4:30 p.m. local time, the Governor's standard, a British
Union flag with the Hong Kong crest in the center, was lowered to
the strain of the Last Post, a traditional military farewell tune.
A stern-faced Patten, standing on a podium in front of the House,
gazed silently at the falling flag as rain seeped into his
dark-blue suit.
</P>
<P>
The lowering of the Governor standard had been standard
practice for every departing governor. But this time, there would
not be another Governor's standard raised here.
And, with the departure of the last Governor, this white mansion,
built in 1855 and renovated and expanded in the following years,
will become a place of historical interest, a museum possibly.
</P>
<P>
At 4:40, Patten, who had ruled Hong Kong for the past five
years on behalf of the British Queen, left the Government House in
a black Rolls Royce decorated with the royal emblem.
</P>
<P>
At 6:15 p.m., a formal farewell ceremony for the British side
was held at the harbor-side East Tamar site beside the Prince of
Wales Barracks, headquarters of the British armed forces in Hong
Kong. The Britannia was moored close by, ready to carry the Prince
of Wales and Chris Patten back to Britain. On a skyscraper in the
opposite direction hung a giant design of the bauhinia, a symbol
of the soon-to-be established Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region of the People's Republic of China. This formed a setting
for what is called the "sunset ceremony," the sunset of the
British empire.

<P>
The heir to the British throne said,"...the Union Flag will be
lowered and the flag of China will fly over Hong Kong. More than
a century and a half of British administration will come to an
end."
</P>
<P>
At 7:45 pm, the Union Jack was lowered at the site of the
ceremony. One hundred and fifty-six years ago, a British naval
captain named Edward Belcher led his men in planting the first
Union Jack on Hong Kong Island, grabbing it from China. Today,
another naval soldier brought down the flag beside the Prince of
Wales Barracks on the same island.
</P>
<P>
The moment that fixed the attention of the entire world came at
midnight.
</P>
<P>
At the last minute of June 30, 1997, the British Union flag was
lowered in Hong Kong for the last time, signaling the end of 156
years of British rule here.
</P>
<P>
At zero hour, July 1, the Chinese national flag was raised
slowly on a flagpole at the venue of the Hong Kong handover
ceremony to the strain of China's national anthem, signifying the
return of Hong Kong to China.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Chinese national flag was also raised in
front of the Prince of Wales Barracks, which had been turned over
to the People's Liberation Army shortly before.
</P>
<P>
At 0:40 a.m. July 1, Prince Charles and Chris Patten, who had
just attended the handover ceremony, boarded the Britannia.
Escorted by the British navy frigate HMS Chatham and motorboats of
the Hong Kong police, the Britannia steamed away from the Victoria
Harbor and soon vanished into the night of the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
One hundred and fifty-six years, five months and four days
elapsed between January 26, 1841, the day a British expedition
force first planted the Union Jack on Hong Kong island, and July
1, 1997, when the Chinese national flag started flying over Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Britain, or Britannia in Latin, came from the sea and departed
on the same route.

<P>
KAMPALA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has embarked on a project
to establish a development strategy for the next 25 years,
reported the local daily "The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
The strategy, code-named Uganda Vision 2025 was funded by the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is the 16th country in Africa to embark on such a
venture.
</P>
<P>
Sam Kuteesa, state minister for planning and economic
development was quoted as saying, "we in Uganda are fortunate to
be among a number of African countries currently involved in the
process of preparing national long-term perspective studies with
a view to formulating its long-term vision for national
development."
</P>
<P>
Uganda Vision 2025 will be formulated by the Uganda National
Core Team. The UNDP had already earmarked up to 1.5 million U.S.
Dollars for the exercise.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, human development-based initiatives are a recent
phenomenon. Uganda's human development index of 0.328 registered
in 1994 ranked it the 150th out of 175 countries in the global
ranking of human development. Among 44 sub-Sahara African
countries, Uganda was ranked the 29th.

HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A giant sculpture, a gift
presented to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) by
the Central People's Government, was erected today by Victoria
Harbor at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
The sculpture, called "Ever-Blooming Bauhinia", was presented
to the Hong Kong SAR, which was founded early this morning, by
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen on behalf of the Central People's
Government.
</P>
<P>
A simple yet solemn gift-presentation ceremony was held at the
center at noon today. Amid the strains played by a band of the
Hong Kong police, Qian presented to Tung Chee Hwa, the Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong SAR, the certificate of the gift from
the Central People's Government of the People's Republic China.
</P>
<P>
The glittering bauhinia, a flower to represent the Hong Kong
SAR, brings profound feelings and best wishes of the Central
People's Government for the Hong Kong SAR, a lady attending the
ceremony said.
</P>
<P>
The work of art, which weighs 70 tons and is six meters long,
wide and high respectively, is made of bronze and coated with gold
foils. It has a cylinder-shaped base with a squared bottom.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
directly under the Central Government in China's interior areas
also presented gifts to the Hong Kong SAR to honor its return to
the motherland.

contingent who arrived as dawn was glowing today.
</P>
<P>
-- Disappointed by the confirmation by the Renault automaker to

the comment by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin over the Denver G-8

KAMPALA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Soldiers of the government army --
Uganda People's Defense Force -- will leave Kampala from August
1, 1997 and move to Bombo barracks, 32 km north of the capital,
reported ''The New Vision'' daily today.
</P>
<P>
Army sources here said that ministry of defense headquarters,
Mbuya army headquarters, Kireka barracks and family members of
soldiers here will be moved to the new premise, which until
recently was a military academy.
</P>
<P>
They said, defense headquarters will be taken over by
parliament while Kireka barracks will be taken by the Ministry of
Lands. Part of Mbuya army headquarters is to be turned into a
military hospital.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the decision was passed at the army
high command meeting at Rwakitura in southwestern Uganda, about
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
This, they said, is intended to reduce army expenditure as
well as save money for the welfare of the force.
</P>
<P>
''It was agreed upon that the army should not stay in the
middle of Kampala. It should be at least 20 miles away and that's
why Bombo was chosen,'' a source said.

TEHRAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The special envoy of King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz of Saudi Arabia arrived here today for a short visit,
carrying a message from the Saudi king for Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani on developing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Iran' official news agency IRNA reported that Saudi State
Minister Abdul Aziz Bin Abdullah al-Khoweiter is carrying one
message from King Fahd and another from Saudi Crown Prince
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz for the outgoing Iranian president.
</P>
<P>
The report said that both messages deal with expansion of
relations between the two Muslim countries. The envoy is expected
to meet Rafsanjani later today and is to leave Tehran this evening.
</P>
<P>
Iran is trying hard to improve its relations with Arab
countries, especially with Saudi Arabia, but Riyadh has still been
suspicious of Tehran's export of Islamic revolution, observers
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian press reported earlier that Rafsanjani would visit
Saudi Arabia in April, but Saudi Ambassador to Iran Abdullatif
Abdullah Al-Maimanee said that Saudi Arabia did not extend an
invitation to the Iranian president for a state visit.
</P>
<P>
The observers said that King Fahd did not extend the official
invitation to Rafsanjani because of pressure from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani has invited King Fahd to attend the summit of the
Organization of Islamic Conference scheduled in Tehran in December.
</P>
<P>
The king only welcomed the invitation but did not promise
to attend the summit.

JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Johannesburg, a commercial

Hillow Maeko, an executive of the Metropolitan Public Safety

<HEADLINE> Zambia Set Higher Target for Non-traditional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has set a higher target of
400 million U.S. Dollars for its annual non-traditional exports
(NTEs) by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In its exporter audit available here today, the Export Board
of Zambia (EBZ) said that the target is feasible because a number
of donors support improvement of the NTEs and the government is
also taking steps to improve the sector.
</P>
<P>
A summary of export findings indicates that the long term
target was set in 1990 to reach 200 million Dollar mark by the
year 2000, but this has since been met, thus there is need to
revise the figure upwards during 1995 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
The exporter audit said with declining copper earnings and
highest growth coming from NTEs, this sector remains the only
hope for Zambia to broaden its foreign exchange earnings and
diversify its exports.
</P>
<P>
The exporter audit called on the government to speed up
establishment of export zones and reintroduce special incentive
for the exporters to improve duty and tax exemption for the NTEs.
</P>
<P>
The NTEs earned Zambia 310 million Dollars in 1996, an
increase of 94 million Dollars over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
To promote the NTEs is part of the government efforts to
diversify the economy of the country.

</P>
<P>
Kleiman said that the revised figures came as a result of the
increased revenues and profits during the current summer season.
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers are Israelis going abroad, who are
flying in record numbers this summer, he said, adding that,
however, there are fewer tourists than those expected arriving
here.
</P>
<P>
The company attributes its losses to non-flights on Shabbat
(Jews' weekly day-off Saturday), security and the political
situation in the region, which led to widespread cancellations
last year and a failure to rekindle the interest of tourists
abroad this year.
</P>
<P>
The favorite destination for Israelis so far this summer has
been New York, although flights to Orlando of the U.S. have also
been doing very well, he said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the U.S. Department of Transport threatened to
withdraw permission for EL AL to fly to Orlando after the
Israeli Civil Aviation Administration denied two U.S. air lines,
Tower Air and American Airlines, the right to fly between New
York and Tel Aviv via Athens. The two governments have recently
resolved the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kleiman said that there is strong government pressure on EL
AL to cut its losses ahead of the company's planned
privatization next year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to concern over who will be prepared to purchase
shares in the company if it doesn't fly on Shabbat, there is also
worry that receipts from the sale will be particularly low while
it reports annual losses.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the company is optimistic about the
future and is negotiating with Boeing to take up its option for a
fourth 747-400.

Jiang said Hong Kong's return to the motherland is a shining
page in the annals of the Chinese nation. From now on, he said,
Hong Kong compatriots will truly become masters here and a new
leaf will be turned in the annals of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We cherish dearly and with great admiration the memory of Mr.
Deng Xiaoping, who passed away not long ago," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"He initiated, with exceptional wisdom and great statesmanship,
the creative vision of 'one country, two systems,' charting the
correct course for us to resolve the Hong Kong question through
diplomatic negotiations and to maintain the long-term prosperity
and stability of Hong Kong," he said.
</P>

The Chinese president reaffirmed that the policies of "one
country, two systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and
a high degree of autonomy will remain unchanged for 50 years.

Jiang said Hong Kong's success today is inseparable from
China's development and support from people in interior areas.

He said that, with the continuous advance of China's
modernization drive, Hong Kong's economic link with the interior
areas will become even closer, that its role as a bridge will be
increasingly enhanced, and that this in turn will give a stronger
impetus to Hong Kong's economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Operation Restores Man's Sight by Using Mouth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- In a first-of-its-kind operation
in Israel, doctors from Jerusalem's Hadassah University have
successfully restored a man's eyesight by using membrane from his
mouth.
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old patient, named Shalom Gozlan, suffered three
years ago from an inflammatory eye disease called cicatricial
premphygoid, which made him totally blind. In this disease, the
transparent cornea is covered by a membrane and keeps out the
light, today's The Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
During the past three decades, victims of the disease have
undergone implants of plastic lenses, called keratoprostesis.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, however, they have been able to see only for a
few months, because the patient's eye tends to produce materials
that dissolve the contact between the lens and the supporting
tissue, causing infections or a slippage of the lens from its
place.
</P>
<P>
Based on French know-how, the Hadassah ophthalmologists, headed
by Doctor Yossi Frucht, covered the lens with the patient's own
oral mucous membrane. A few months later, when the lens
stablized, an opening of five millimeters in the membrane was
made to expose the lens to light inside the eye.
</P>
<P>
Gozlan's first operation was performed on one eye at Hadassah
in April, and two weeks ago, a hole was made in the membrane to
uncover the lens which enables him to see things now.

<HEADLINE> New State of Emergency Bill Tabled in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A new State of Emergency
Bill, to allow for the declaration of a state of emergency that
conforms to South Africa's new constitution, has been introduced
in Parliament, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The existing State of Emergency Act was approved by the new
Parliament in 1995, but was enacted under the new constitution,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution provides that a state of emergency may
only exist for 21 days, unless the National Assembly extends it,
and then only for a maximum of three months at a time.
</P>
<P>
Any additional extension beyond a first three-month period
will require approval by a 60 percent majority of members of the
National Assembly, following a public debate on the declaration.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the new State of Emergency Bill in Parliament,
Justice Minister Dullah Omar said: "Since it is necessary that
our emergency legislation should be in accordance with the
provisions of the new constitution, the Bill provides for the
repeal of that Act."
</P>
<P>
Omar said, however, the state of emergency could only be
declared if "the life of the nation is threatened by war, any
invasion, general insurrection, disorder, any national disaster
or any other public emergency, and the declaration is necessary
to restore peace and order".
</P>
<P>
A state of emergency may be declared in any area of the
country or in the whole country, according to the clauses of the
new legislation.
</P>
<P>
The state president is therefore empowered to make regulations
which are "necessary to restore the peace and order and to make
adequate provision for terminating the state of emergency".
</P>
<P>
The president is required to table any declaration in the
National Assembly "as soon as possible" after the declaration.

over whether to invite Romania and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
Despite outspoken opposition from the United States, nine other
countries - France, Luxembourg, Belgium, Greece, Spain, Canada,
Italy, Turkey and Portugal - are pushing for the admission of
Romania and Slovenia in the first wave of new members.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. stance is supported by Germany, Britain, The
Netherlands, Iceland, Norway and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Solana said, "Some (member) countries do think that these two
(Romania and Slovenia) are important countries that can contribute
to security on the continent, therefore they will be part of NATO,
but I can't tell you when (it will happen)."
</P>
<P>
NATO sources said that the search for consensus among the
member states on enlargement proposals was likely to continue
"right up until the Madrid summit" on July 8.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Naval Unit Comes to HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- When petty officer second class
Hu Fangjun knotted the cable to a dock on the Stonecutters Island
this morning, the 23-year-old ended a 156-year absence of the
Chinese navy in Hong Kong, part of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
At 7:25 a.m., missile boat Shunde, the flagship of the Naval
Unit of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Garrison in Hong Kong,
led the other nine naval vessels and arrived at the Stonecutters
Naval Base west of Kowloon in a torrential rain.
</P>
<P>
"I feel so honored and proud that I have berthed the first
Chinese naval vessel in Hong Kong within more than 150 years,"
said Hu.
</P>
<P>
In 1841, a British expeditionary force embarked on the
Possession Street on the Hong Kong Island, opposite the
Stonecutters Island, starting 156 years of Britain's colonial rule
over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Volunteer Li Guoliang, helmsman of Shunde, was also excited.
"Every step from our departure and crossing the border to getting
berthed marks a part of history," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ships started off at 4:15 this morning from the Mawan
Harbor at the southern end of Shenzhen. At six o'clock sharp, they
crossed the border and entered Hong Kong's waters. Escorted by the
Hong Kong marine police boats, all of the ten ships were berthed
at 8:25 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the Naval Unit Zhu Yifei said the unit is the best
equipped in the Chinese navy.
</P>
<P>
"As part of the Hong Kong Garrison of the PLA," he said, "we
shall resolutely safeguard China's territorial sovereignty, and
discipline our unit in strict accordance with the Basic Law and
the Garrison Law."
</P>
<P>
At nine o'clock sharp, the naval unit got ready to carry out
its defense duty.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Newspapers Hail Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Newspapers here today hailed the
return of Hong Kong to China, saying the year 1997 is of great
significance in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
All the newspapers here in Indonesian or English issued stories
on the first page on the ceremony marking the handover of Hong
Kong to China which took place at midnight on June 30 in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
In its editorial, "the Jakarta Post" says, "the sun has finally
set for the once great British empire with today's handover of
Hong Kong to China."
</P>
<P>
"But for the territory, and the rest of Asia, the sun will
shine even brighter," it notes.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that Hong Kong had been one of the few
last vestiges of European colonialism, which for most of Asia, is
a dark era in its history.
</P>
<P>
Any form of colonialism is deplorable and must, as a matter of
principle, be eliminated from the face of the earth, it adds.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong's future, the paper says most of the fears about
Hong Kong's future under Chinese rule are overplayed. Beijing has
assured it will maintain the current economic system in Hong Kong,
and it knows that it is in its own interests to do so.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian observer" in its editorial says, objectively
speaking, Hong Kong has the clout, experience and knowhow to
retain its position as one of the busiest business center in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"It is the goose that lays the golden egg, and China is wise
enough to keep it that way," it stresses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local press also reported the activities of
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas in Hong Kong. The minister
is in Hong Kong as the Chinese government's guest to attend the
ceremony marking the handover of Hong Kong to China.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with Hong Kong's chief executive Tung Chee Hwa on
Monday, Alatas, on behalf of the Indonesian government, people and
President Soeharto, congratulated China in connection with Hong
Kong's handover.
</P>
<P>
Alatas hoped the relations between Hong Kong and Indonesia can
be continued in the future.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's 3rd Largest Party Formally Splits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's third largest party,
Jatiya (national) Party (JP), has formally split as both arch
rival sides expelled each other and claimed they are real JP.
</P>
<P>
Kazi Zafar Ahmed and Shah Moazzam Hossain, the two rebel
leaders who were earlier expelled from the JP by party chief HM
Ershad, held a one-day council session Monday and expelled HM
Ershad and two other senior leaders, Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury and
Naziur Rahman Manju.
</P>
<P>
The council session, participated by several thousand
councilors and delegates, also elected Kazi Zafar and Shah Moazzam
as co-chairmen of the breakaway faction.
</P>
<P>
However, None of the 30 JP's lawmakers and 31 JP presidium
members were seen in the council session.
</P>
<P>
Denying the lawful authority of the rebel's council session, JP
General Secretary Anwar Hussain Manju said that "the rebels have
already been expelled from the party and whichever faction Ershad
belonged to would be the real JP."
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the JP's split is the outcome of
political differences.
</P>
<P>
The JP led by former president Ershad, after last year's
parliamentary elections, supported Awami (people's) League to form
the government. General Secretary Anwar Hossain even joined Sheikh
Hasina's government as communication minister.
</P>
<P>
Kazi Zafar, one of the founders of JP and former prime minister
of Ershad's regime, opposed Ershad's soft attitude towards the
ruling party and asked Anwar Hossain to quit the government.
</P>
<P>
"Our party is essentially a force of patriotic and nationalist
elements with Islamic ideals," Kazi Zafar told the council
session.
</P>
<P>
While criticizing the government for its policies on issues
like transit to India, Ganges water sharing treaty, sub-regional
grouping, he urged for unity among like-minded parties for a
movement to protect the independence and sovereignty of
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Kazi Zafar, however, said that they have no intent to join the
main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party or any other party.

HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text of
the speech by Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the ceremony
marking the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region of the People's Republic of China:

SPEECH AT THE CEREMONY MARKING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HONG KONG
SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

Jiang Zemin
President of the People's Republic of China
1 July 1997

Ladies and Gentlemen,
My Fellow Countrymen,
</P>
<P>
Today, the Chinese and British Governments have held the
handover ceremony of Hong Kong, solemnly announcing the resumption
by the Chinese Government of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong. Now, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the
People's Republic of China is formally established, which is an
event of great importance and far-reaching influence for Hong
Kong, for China and even for the whole world. I take this as a
redletter day not only for the Hong Kong compatriots, but also for
the Chinese people and the entire Chines nation.
</P>
<P>
At this August historical moment, on behalf of the Central
People's Government and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, I
wish to extend our warm congratulations on Hong Kong's return to
the motherland and the establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, to extend our cordial greetings to the six
million Hong Kong compatriots now back to the big family of the
motherland, and to express our gratitude to the compatriots in
Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and the overseas Chinese who have
contributed to Hong Kong's return and all the patriotic personages
supporting China's reunification. My thanks also go to all our
foreign friends who have cared for and supported Hong Kong's
return to China. I also wish to extend, on behalf of the Chinese
Government, our welcome to the distinguished guests and friends
who are present at this Ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return to the motherland is a shining page in the
annals of the Chinese nation. From now on, the Hong Kong
compatriots will truly become masters here as a new leaf will be
turned in the annals of Hong Kong.

With the passage of time, earthshaking changes have taken
place. The rise of the first Five-Star Red Flag at Tiananmen
Square showed the world that China had achieved national
independence and liberation and embarked on a road to socialism.
Thanks to reform and opening-up, a rejuvenated Chinese nation has
taken on a completely new look, and its international stature has
been greatly enhanced. It is under these conditions and against
this historical backdrop that Hong Kong has finally returned to
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In these days of national jubilation for Hong Kong's return, we
cherish dearly and with great admiration the memory of Mr Deng
Xiaoping, who passed away not long ago. He initiated, with
exceptional wisdom and great statesmanship, the creative vision of
"one country, two systems," charting the correct course for us to
resolve the Hong Kong question through diplomatic negotiations and
to maintain long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
After the Chinese Government resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over it, Hong Kong will continue to practice the
capitalist system, with its previous socio-economic system and way
of life remaining unchanged and its laws basically unchanged while
the main part of the nation persists in the socialists system.
</P>
<P>
As a special administrative region of the People's Republic of
China, Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy as provided
for by the Basic Law, which includes the executive, legislative
and independent judicial power, including that of final
adjudication. The Central People's Government will administer
foreign and defense affairs of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region in accordance with law. We extend our
sincere congratulations to Mr Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, who has
been sworn in today. We have full confidence in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region Government under his leadership and
will give it full support. The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region shall be observed not only in Hong Kong, but
also by all departments of the Central Government as well as the
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under
the Central Government. No central department or locality may or
will be allowed to interfere in the affairs which, under the Basic
Law, should be administered by the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region on its own.

After Hong Kong returns to the motherland, the overwhelming
majority of the laws previously in force will be maintained. Hong
Kong residents will enjoy their rights and freedoms in accordance
with law and will be equal before the law. The provisions of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,
and international labor conventions as applied to Hong Kong will
remain in force to be implemented through Hong Kong's regional
legislation. A gradually improved democratic system suited to Hong
Kong's reality is an important guarantee for its social and
political stability. Hong Kong will, in accordance with the Basic
Law, develop democracy gradually with the ultimate aim of electing
the chief executive and the Legislative Council by universal
suffrage.
</P>
<P>
After its return to the motherland, Hong Kong will retain the
status of a free port and an international financial, trade and
shipping center while continuing to maintain and develop its
economic and cultural relations with other countries, regions and
relevant international organizations so that this international
economic metropolis will forever be vigorous and dynamic. The Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region protects the right to own
private property in accordance with law and may, on its own,
formulate its economic, trade, monetary, financial, educational,
scientific and technological, cultural and sports policies in
accordance with law. It will have independent finances, practice
an independent taxation system and be a separate customs
territory. All the economic and trade activities and investment
interests of other countries and regions in Hong Kong will be
protected by law.
</P>
<P>
These policies and guidelines have been formulated by the
Central People's Government after careful consideration of the
need to safeguard both the immediate interests of the Hong Kong
compatriots and the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation.
Their adherence serves Hong Kong, serves the entire nation and
serves the world as well. Therefore, there is no reason whatsoever
to change them. Here, I would like to reaffirm that "one country,
two systems," "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and "a
high degree of autonomy" will remain unchanged for 50 years. This
is a long-term basic principle of ours.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's success today is, in the final analysis, the work
of the Hong Kong compatriots. Their pioneering and enterprising
spirit has filled people around the world with deep admiration.
Our Hong Kong compatriots will certainly carry forward this
valuable spirit and bring about a better future for Hong Kong. As
Mr Deng Xiaoping rightly put it, "The Chinese in Hong Kong have
the ability to run the affairs of Hong Kong well and they should
be confident of that."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's success today is inseparable from China's
development and the support by the people on the mainland. After
the founding of New China, the Chinese Government has all along
given support for a socially stable and economically prosperous
Hong Kong. Since the beginning of China's reform and opening-up,
that support has become even more powerful and effective. Hong
Kong, as an important bridge linking China and the rest of the
world in economic, scientific, technological and cultural
exchanges, has benefited from it immensely. With the continuous
advance of China's modernization drive, Hong Kong's economic link
with the mainland will become even closer and its role as a bridge
will be increasingly enhanced. This in turn will give a stronger
impetus to Hong Kong's economic growth.

Thanks to reform, opening-up and the modernization drive, China
has witnessed tremendous changes in its economic and social life.
We owe all our achievements most fundamentally to the road of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics which we have
taken. We will unswervingly take economic development as our
central task, continue to deepen reform, open still wider to the
outside world and push for overall social progress. We will
unswervingly promote peaceful reunification of the motherland in
accordance with the principle of "one country, two systems,"
ensuring a smooth return of Macao and eventually resolving the
Taiwan question. We will unswervingly pursue the independent
foreign policy of peace, join the people of other countries in
maintaining world peace and promoting common development, and
contribute our share to the establishment of a fair and equitable
new international order of peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The advent of the 21st century has entered a countdown stage.
Our country is at an important historical juncture. Let the entire
Chinese people, our compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan and
the overseas Chinese included, get untied, let all patriots who
support China's reunification and care for its development get
united. Let us all work hard with one mind, seize the day, seize
the hour, keep abreast of the times and strive for the complete
reunification of the motherland and the overall rejuvenation of
the Chinese nation.

Our Hong Kong compatriots are known for their glorious
tradition of patriotism. They have made important contributions in
the struggle for national liberation and in the modernization
drive of the motherland. Hong Kong compatriots will surely display
greater love for the motherland and for Hong Kong, and take it as
their utmost honor to maintain long-term prosperity and stability
in Hong Kong and safeguard the fundamental interests of the
country and the nation.
</P>
<P>
To many foreigners living here, Hong Kong has already become
their home. It will remain their home in the future where they can
live and work in peace and contentment. In Hong Kong, everyone
will have the chance to compete on an equal footing and everyone
will be entitled to the rights and freedoms as protected by law,
regardless of race and color.
</P>
<P>
By achieving a negotiated settlement of the Hong Kong question,
the Chinese and British Governments have provided the
international community with an example of peaceful settlement of
historical issues between states. Here, I wish to express my
thanks to those British personages, both within and without the
government, for their contributions to the smooth transition of
Hong Kong. We are confident that the successful solution to the
Hong Kong question will help strengthen the friendship between the
two peoples.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, the first Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR),
delivered a speech here today at a grand celebration party marking
the establishment of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Following is the full text of the speech, entitled "A Future of
Excellence and Prosperity for All":
President Jiang,
Distinguished State Leaders,
Honored Guests,
Fellow Hong Kong Citizens and
Friends,
</P>
<P>
Today is a momentous day for China. Today is a joyous day for
all Chinese people. First of July, nineteen ninety-seven, marks
the return of Hong Kong to China after a long separation. It marks
the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
of the People's Republic of China. In the midnight hours behind
us, China officially resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong; the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was sworn in by
the Central People's Government. In peace and solemnity, Hong Kong
opens a new chapter in its history.
</P>
<P>
As Hong Kong proudly strides into the new era with a new
identity, our thoughts and remembrance go, with great reverence,
to the late Mr. Deng Xiaoping. There was a time in the early
1980's when Hong Kong people became increasingly concerned about
the uncertainties surrounding 1997. Despite rapid economic growth,
the mood in Hong Kong remained apprehensive due to the lack of a
clear direction on the future. Mr. Deng stepped forward decisively
and created a blueprint for Hong Kong after 1997, under the
imaginative concept of "One Country, Two Systems" and taking into
account the collective interests of China and the Chinese people.
The concept, widely accepted by all parties concerned, resolved
the uncertainties over Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
We should express our gratitude to President Jiang Zemin and
the entire leadership in China. During the sometimes turbulent
transitional period, they had worked tirelessly to smoothen the
path leading up to the handover, lay the ground for a better Hong
Kong, and ensure a smooth and successful transition. This is a
remarkable achievement.
</P>
<P>
We can now move forward, on the basis of the solid foundation
of past successes and under the guidance of the Basic Law, to lead
Hong Kong to a new height. The Basic Law provides the
constitutional framework for the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region. It has documented and institutionalized the "high degree
of autonomy" conferred upon us. It clearly prescribes the social,
economic and political systems in Hong Kong which are different
from those in the Mainland. It reaffirms the implementation of a
different system within one country. It protects the rights and
lifestyle of Hong Kong people and delineates our obligations.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is at present the freest and the most vibrant economy
in the world. Free enterprise and free trade; prudent financial
management and low taxation; the rule of law, an executive-led
government and an efficient civil service have been a part of our
tradition. All these factors which underlie our success have been
guaranteed in the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Leaders in China have said time and again that the prosperity
and stability of Hong Kong will contribute to the modernization of
our country. Furthermore, the successful implementation of "One
Country, Two Systems", "a high degree of autonomy" and "Hong Kong
people administering Hong Kong" is the first step towards the
ultimate re-unification of China.
</P>
<P>
Citizens of Hong Kong, this is our mission. There is before us
a heavy responsibility and a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
Our country has given us a high degree of autonomy, and her
full support. Now is the time for us to apply our intelligence and
work arduously for a better future.
</P>
<P>
Like most people in Hong Kong, I am not a passer-by. Our home,
our career, and our hope are here in Hong Kong. We have deep
feelings for Hong Kong and a sense of mission to build a better
Hong Kong. Today, I wish to share with you my thoughts on the
future development of the economy, education, housing and care for
the elderly, issues which are of great concern to the people.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong can be proud of its achievement over the past thirty
years. There is no question about this. Nevertheless, we have to
be alert to the challenges which lie ahead. We face keen
competition in trade and services, and our competitiveness is
threatened by persistently high inflation. We have to resolve a
series of social problems arising from a growing and aging
population, meet the pressing demand for more and better housing,
and deal with employment dislocation due to restructuring of the
economy. All these require urgent attention and careful handling.
Beneath the surface of prosperity, there are insidious threats
which are taxing our courage and determination.
</P>
<P>
Our foremost task is to enhance Hong Kong's economic vitality
and sustain economic growth. Only through the creation of wealth
can we improve the living of the people of Hong Kong, and continue
to contribute to our country. It is the responsibility of the
Special Administrative Region Government to create a good business
environment, plan for and train the necessary manpower, and uphold
the principles of free trade, fair competition and
non-interference in the market. We will strive to enhance Hong
Kong's position as an international financial center and a
cosmopolitan city. We will promote the services sector and
facilitate the development of value-added and high technology
industries. The world is entering an information era. We must
adopt positive measures to encourage investment in the information
industry and infrastructure, and nurture expertise in this area.
Only then can Hong Kong remain at the forefront of the new age
with vigor and vibrancy.
</P>
<P>
Education is the key to the future of Hong Kong. It provides a
level playing field for all, and the human resources required for
further economic development. Our education system must cater for
Hong Kong's needs, contribute to the country, and adopt an
international outlook. It should encourage diversification and
combine the strengths of the east and the west. We shall draw up a
comprehensive plan to improve the quality of education, and inject
sufficient resources to achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
The thrust of our policy will be to improve primary and
secondary education. To start with, we must have quality teachers
and principals with a strong sense of mission. We have to raise
the professional qualification of teachers. In the foreseeable
future, new teachers for primary and secondary schools should all
have a university degree and teacher's training. We will extend
full-day schooling to all primary schools and abolish floating
classes in secondary schools as soon as possible. We will raise
the standard of language training; formulate a comprehensive
policy on the application of information technology in education;
improve the system of examinations and school management; promote
diversification in the school system. We will encourage tertiary
institutions to develop areas of excellence. We will further
review the academic system in terms of the length of and the
interface between the various stages of education, so as to ensure
that our education system meets the long-term needs of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
We have to foster among our youngsters a sense of
responsibility towards the family, the community, the country and
the world; and to develop in them the strength of character, the
spirit of enterprise, and the versatility to cope with vagaries in
life. We will encourage our young people to have all-round
development covering ethics, the intellect, the physique, social
skills and aesthetics. To achieve this goal, the school, the
family and the community must work together and share the
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Owning one's home is an aspiration shared by the people of Hong
Kong. It is crucial for nurturing a sense of belonging and
maintaining social stability. Housing cost also has a strong
bearing on the economic vitality of Hong Kong. The crux of the
housing problem is inadequate supply, causing prices to soar and
creating opportunities for speculators.
</P>
<P>
The fact of the matter is: Hong Kong has enough land to meet
our housing needs. With unfaltering determination, it should be
possible to resolve the housing problem. We will draw up a
ten-year housing plan: to speed up reclamation and land formation;
extend the mass transit system and infrastructure development; and
increase the efficiency of housing production through a
comprehensive review of the existing organization and working
procedures. We will substantially increase the production of home
ownership flats, actively implement the sale of public rental
flats to sitting tenants, and address the needs of the "sandwich
class". We will increase overall housing supply at a target of not
less than 85,000 flats a year. The aim is to achieve a home
ownership rate of 70 percent in ten years. We will also speed up
urban redevelopment, clear all temporary housing areas and cottage
areas, rehouse the dwellers of bedspace apartments; and reduce the
average waiting time for public rental housing to three years.
</P>
<P>
Rampant speculation in the property market in recent months has
seriously affected our competitiveness and people's livelihood. We
will devise a range of anti-speculation measures and monitor the
market closely. We will take resolute action when it becomes
necessary to do so.
</P>
<P>
Our senior citizens have contributed to Hong Kong's success.
They deserve respect and care from the community. The Special
Administrative Region Government will develop a comprehensive
policy to take care of the various needs of our senior citizens
and provide them with a sense of security, a sense of belonging
and a sense of worthiness. We will set up a "Commission for the
Elderly" with wide community representation to formulate policies
and co-ordinate the delivery of services.
</P>
<P>
We will set up the Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme as soon as
possible. We will also carry out an in-depth review of the
Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme which aims to
assist the needy among our senior citizens and improve their
living. We will encourage families to live with their elderly
members through adjustment to the public housing allocation
policies; provide supporting services to carers of the elderly;
and increase the supply of housing and residential services for
senior citizens. We will also improve primary health care and
strengthen services for the chronically ill. Furthermore, we will
promote the physical and mental well-being of senior citizens and
encourage them to do voluntary work, so that they can continue to
contribute to the community.
</P>
<P>
Re-unification with China opens up new opportunities for Hong
Kong. Successful implementation of "One Country, Two Systems"
requires us to develop a better understanding of our country,
cultivate a congenial relationship with the Mainland, embrace a
distinctive set of values; safeguard the rule of law; protect our
freedoms; promote democracy; and establish a common long-term
purpose.
</P>
<P>
The interests of Hong Kong and the Motherland are intricately
linked and intertwined. Due to our long separation, there is a
general lack of understanding about China among the people of Hong
Kong. The re-unification has created a new environment and better
conditions for us to understand our country and our people, and to
love our country and our people. Only then can we firmly establish
our roots and make "One Country, Two Systems" a success. We must
strengthen the understanding and relationship between Hong Kong
and the Mainland, through mutual trust, mutual economic benefits,
cultural interaction, and mutual respect for each other's way of
life. We know Hong Kong and the Mainland will move forward
together, hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
Every society has to have its own values to provide a common
purpose and a sense of unity. Most of the people of Hong Kong are
Chinese, some are not. For a long time, Hong Kong has embraced the
eastern and western cultures. We will continue to encourage
diversity in our society, but we must also reaffirm and respect
the fine traditional Chinese values, including filial piety, love
for the family, modesty and integrity, and the desire for
continuous improvement. We value plurality, but discourage open
confrontation; we strive for liberty, but not at the expense of
the rule of law; we respect minority views, but are mindful of
wider interests; we protect individual rights, but also shoulder
collective responsibilities. I hope these values will provide the
foundation for unity in our society.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining and developing the legal system and the rule of law
in Hong Kong is immensely important. We will continue to ensure
that the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the
Government will operate independently. We will keep up our efforts
against corruption and maintain a clean society. We will ensure
equality before the law and provide an attractive environment for
investors and the people of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
We will preserve the existing freedoms and lifestyle, and
ensure that the people of Hong Kong will continue to enjoy the
freedoms of speech, assembly, association, the press and other
freedoms guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
Democracy is the hallmark of a new era for Hong Kong. The
Special Administrative Region Government will resolutely move
forward to a more democratic form of government in accordance with
the provisions in the Basic Law. We will provide opportunities for
every stratum of the society and legitimate political
organizations, and people with different shades of opinion, to
participate in the political process. The Special Administrative
Region Government will adopt an open attitude and be accountable
to the public.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has an outstanding and honest civil service. They
will have a crucial role to play under "One Country, Two Systems".
Together, we will serve the community and work for a better Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the history of Hong Kong, we now have the
opportunity to chart our own destiny. Under "One Country, Two
Systems", we will move forward with conviction, prudence and
determination. We will work together for a better future. Our
vision of Hong Kong is:
-- a society proud of its national identity and cultural
</P>
<P>
heritage;
-- a stable, equitable, free, democratic, compassionate society
</P>
<P>
with a clear sense of direction;
-- an affluent society with improved quality of life for all;
-- a decent society with a level playing field and fair
</P>
<P>
competition under the rule of law;
-- a window for exchanges between China and the rest of the
</P>
<P>
world;
-- a renowned international financial, trading, transportation
</P>
<P>
and communication center;
-- a world class cultural, education and scientific research
</P>
<P>
center.
</P>
<P>
Distinguished guests, my fellow citizens of Hong Kong:
</P>
<P>
In two years, the People's Republic of China will be
celebrating its fiftieth birthday. In two years, the world will be
greeting the beginning of a new millennium. And I know, in two
years, Hong Kong will achieve greater successes and a better life
for all, as we move into the next Century. Our nation will be
proud of us.
</P>
<P>
I invite you to join me in wishing China thriving prosperity;
</P>
<P>
I invite you to join me in wishing Hong Kong continuous
success.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Residents See PLA Troops Off to Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 200,000 people in
Shenzhen, a booming special economic zone bordering Hong Kong,
flocked to streets early this morning to see off the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) troops to be stationed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With colorful balloons in the air and large red lanterns hung
along the streets, Shenzhen looked exceptionally beautiful today.
The crowds gathered along the thoroughfares of the city, carrying
the Chinese national flags, regional flags of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), flowers and colorful silk
ribbons.
</P>
<P>
Some also carried streamers and posters, which read "Warmly see
the PLA troops off to Hong Kong to carry out their sacred mission"
and "The people's army is loved by the people and loves the
people."
</P>
<P>
At around 4 a.m., when the first military truck drove out of
the barracks, cheers immediately broke out from the long-awaiting
crowds. Waving flowers and silk ribbons, the crowds sent their
greetings to the soldiers aboard the trucks.
</P>
<P>
While the drums were beaten, many people started to perform the
Yangko dance, a traditional way for the Chinese to express their
jubilation on major occasions.
</P>
<P>
From the barracks of the PLA troops to ports of entry at Man
Kam To, Sha Tau Kok and Huanggang, a dozen kilometers of roads and
streets were turned into an ocean of crowds and flowers.
</P>
<P>
At six o'clock sharp in the morning, a rain fell suddenly and
soon became a downpour, but the mood of the crowds was not
affected at all.
</P>
<P>
Amid continued cheers, the military vehicles carrying the PLA
troops to be stationed in Hong Kong for defense crossed Man Kam
To, Sha Tau Kok, Huanggang and other ports of entry, and headed
for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the naval and air units of the PLA troops to be
stationed in Hong Kong also entered Hong Kong to shoulder the
responsibility of defense for the HKSAR.

<HEADLINE> Thai Judge Sacked for Granting Bail to Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A Thai senior judge who in February
freed on bail Li Yun Chung, a suspected heroin trafficker wanted
in the U.S., has been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Judicial Commission has found evidence indicating that
the judge, Somchai Udomwong, had committed irregularities in the
release of Li Yun Chung, who jumped bail and fled to Myanmar,
where he was later re-arrested, returned to Thailand and
extradited to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Somchai is expected to face criminal charges in connection with
the Li case.
</P>
<P>
A source in the Judicial Commission said on Monday that the
panel based its guilty verdict on two key pieces of evidence -- a
land deal between Somchai and Li's broker, and records of his
telephone conversations with people known to have close relations
with Li.
</P>
<P>
Li has been charged by a U.S. court with trafficking more than
400 kilograms of heroin into the U.S. in 1991.
</P>
<P>
A Justice Ministry panel reported that Li had asked his wife,
Mayuree, to give 20 million baht (800,000 U.S. dollars) to his
lawyer to arrange for the bail.
</P>
<P>
Mayuree was also found to have paid 10 million baht (400,000
dollars) to the broker, Narat Charoensuk, who later transferred
800,000 baht (3,200 dollars) to the account of the wife of the
judge.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Chinese in Portugal Celebrate HK's Return to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Overseas Chinese in Portugal held a
reception here today to mark the return of Hong Kong to China.
</P>
<P>
Choi Manhin, president of the Portuguese-Chinese Association of
Industry and Commerce, said at the reception that Hong Kong's
return to the embrace of the motherland wiped out more than 150
years of national disgrace and ushered in a splendid future for
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With Hong Kong's return, a big stride has been made in the
peaceful unification of China, which will be conducive to the
economic development not only in China, but also the Asian and
Pacific region and the world at large, Choi said.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the celebration, Choi said, the overseas Chinese
deeply cherished the memory of Mr. Deng Xiaoping, who put forward
the great concept of "one country, two systems," and the
principles of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high
degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
These concept and principles have provided fundamental
guarantees for Hong Kong's smooth transition and long time
stability and prosperity there. "We are confident that Hong
Kong's future will be more splendid," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Nuno Melo Egydio, president of the Portuguese-Chinese League of
Multi-Century Friendship and former governor of Macau, and other
friends in Portugal attended the reception.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Overseas Chinese in Portugal held a rally
here also today, marking Hong Kong's return to China.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Hopeful Of Increased Garment Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is hopeful of an increase
in quotas for garments from the European Union (EU), according to
Ministry of Industrial Development sources today.
</P>
<P>
This follows discussions between Minister of Industrial
Development C.V. Gunaratne and European Union Ambassador Ilka
Usitalo recently here.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Sri Lanka has sought an increased quota of a
million for ladies and girls blouses for Sri Lanka from the EU.
This would absorb the production of existing and proposed new
garment factories.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted the minister as saying that the garments
which are high value added will satisfy the sophisticated demand
of customers in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's quota for 1997 for ladies and girls garments was
only 14.5 million pieces and 38 percent of this has already been
exported to countries of the EU.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a large number of garment factories set up in
Colombo areas, the government has approved 45 new factories.
Increased quotas were therefore essential to keep these production
lines in full stream, the sources noted.

<HEADLINE> Berisha Concedes Defeat in Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha
today conceded the defeat of his Democratic Party in Sunday's
general election and called to restore order to the country which
was gripped by unrest and violence earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech, he said that he and his party will
respect the results of the vote and the choice of the voters.
</P>
<P>
But the president didn't say whether he will step down. He had
hinted on several occasions after the turmoil began in March that
he would resign if his Democratic Party should lose to leftists in
the election.
</P>
<P>
"Albanian voters yesterday seemingly voted that the Democratic
Party should be in opposition," Berisha said in the statement.

were released by the electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission announced complete returns in 11 of the
country's 115 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 constituencies, seven were captured by the opposition
Socialist Party and its allies and four are to go to run-off
rounds next week after none of the candidates was able to gain
more than 50 percent of the vote.

Socialist Party leader Fatos Nano urged Berisha to
resign. "Berisha should honor his commitments," Nano told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Berisha was elected president in 1992 and was reelected by the
Democrat Party-dominated parliament for a second term in early
March amid social unrest after the collapse of pyramid investment
schemes in which thousands of Albanians lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
Berisha was forced to name Socialist Bashkim Fino to head a
caretaker government and promise early elections.
</P>
<P>
Berisha's Democrats won last year's parliamentary election
which was boycotted by opposition parties.

Hong Kong can be proud of its achievement over the past thirty
years. There is no question about this. Nevertheless, we have to
be alert to the challenges which lie ahead. We face keen
competition in trade and services, and our competitiveness is
threatened by persistently high inflation. We have to resolve a
series of social problems arising from a growing and aging
population, meet the pressing demand for more and better housing,
and deal with employment dislocation due to restructuring of the
economy. All these require urgent attention and careful handling.
Beneath the surface of prosperity, there are insidious threats
which are taxing our courage and determination.
</P>
<P>
Our foremost task is to enhance Hong Kong's economic vitality
and sustain economic growth. Only through the creation of wealth
can we improve the living of the people of Hong Kong, and continue
to contribute to our country. It is the responsibility of the
Special Administrative Region Government to create a good business
environment, plan for and train the necessary manpower, and uphold
the principles of free trade, fair competition and
non-interference in the market. We will strive to enhance Hong
Kong's position as an international financial center and a
cosmopolitan city. We will promote the services sector and
facilitate the development of value-added and high technology
industries. The world is entering an information era. We must
adopt positive measures to encourage investment in the information
industry and infrastructure, and nurture expertise in this area.
Only then can Hong Kong remain at the forefront of the new age
with vigor and vibrancy.
</P>
<P>
Education is the key to the future of Hong Kong. It provides a
level playing field for all, and the human resources required for
further economic development. Our education system must cater for
Hong Kong's needs, contribute to the country, and adopt an
international outlook. It should encourage diversification and
combine the strengths of the east and the west. We shall draw up a
comprehensive plan to improve the quality of education, and inject
sufficient resources to achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
The thrust of our policy will be to improve primary and
secondary education. To start with, we must have quality teachers
and principals with a strong sense of mission. We have to raise
the professional qualification of teachers. In the foreseeable
future, new teachers for primary and secondary schools should all
have a university degree and teacher's training. We will extend
full-day schooling to all primary schools and abolish floating
classes in secondary schools as soon as possible. We will raise
the standard of language training; formulate a comprehensive
policy on the application of information technology in education;
improve the system of examinations and school management; promote
diversification in the school system. We will encourage tertiary
institutions to develop areas of excellence. We will further
review the academic system in terms of the length of and the
interface between the various stages of education, so as to ensure
that our education system meets the long-term needs of Hong Kong.

We will set up the Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme as soon as
possible. We will also carry out an in-depth review of the
Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme which aims to
assist the needy among our senior citizens and improve their
living. We will encourage families to live with their elderly
members through adjustment to the public housing allocation
policies; provide supporting services to carers of the elderly;
and increase the supply of housing and residential services for
senior citizens. We will also improve primary health care and
strengthen services for the chronically ill. Furthermore, we will
promote the physical and mental well-being of senior citizens and
encourage them to do voluntary work, so that they can continue to
contribute to the community.
</P>
<P>
Re-unification with China opens up new opportunities for Hong
Kong. Successful implementation of "One Country, Two Systems"
requires us to develop a better understanding of our country,
cultivate a congenial relationship with the Mainland, embrace a
distinctive set of values; safeguard the rule of law; protect our
freedoms; promote democracy; and establish a common long-term
purpose.
</P>
<P>
The interests of Hong Kong and the Motherland are intricately
linked and intertwined. Due to our long separation, there is a
general lack of understanding about China among the people of Hong
Kong. The re-unification has created a new environment and better
conditions for us to understand our country and our people, and to
love our country and our people. Only then can we firmly establish
our roots and make "One Country, Two Systems" a success. We must
strengthen the understanding and relationship between Hong Kong
and the Mainland, through mutual trust, mutual economic benefits,
cultural interaction, and mutual respect for each other's way of
life. We know Hong Kong and the Mainland will move forward
together, hand in hand.

We have to foster among our youngsters a sense of
responsibility towards the family, the community, the country and
the world; and to develop in them the strength of character, the
spirit of enterprise, and the versatility to cope with vagaries in
life. We will encourage our young people to have all-round
development covering ethics, the intellect, the physique, social
skills and aesthetics. To achieve this goal, the school, the
family and the community must work together and share the
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Owning one's home is an aspiration shared by the people of Hong
Kong. It is crucial for nurturing a sense of belonging and
maintaining social stability. Housing cost also has a strong
bearing on the economic vitality of Hong Kong. The crux of the
housing problem is inadequate supply, causing prices to soar and
creating opportunities for speculators.
</P>
<P>
The fact of the matter is: Hong Kong has enough land to meet
our housing needs. With unfaltering determination, it should be
possible to resolve the housing problem. We will draw up a
ten-year housing plan: to speed up reclamation and land formation;
extend the mass transit system and infrastructure development; and
increase the efficiency of housing production through a
comprehensive review of the existing organization and working
procedures. We will substantially increase the production of home
ownership flats, actively implement the sale of public rental
flats to sitting tenants, and address the needs of the "sandwich
class". We will increase overall housing supply at a target of not
less than 85,000 flats a year. The aim is to achieve a home
ownership rate of 70 percent in ten years. We will also speed up
urban redevelopment, clear all temporary housing areas and cottage
areas, rehouse the dwellers of bedspace apartments; and reduce the
average waiting time for public rental housing to three years.
</P>
<P>
Rampant speculation in the property market in recent months has
seriously affected our competitiveness and people's livelihood. We
will devise a range of anti-speculation measures and monitor the
market closely. We will take resolute action when it becomes
necessary to do so.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, the first Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR),
delivered here today a speech titled "A Future of Excellence and
Prosperity for All" at a grand celebration party marking the
founding of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that Hong Kong has opened a new chapter in its
history in peace and solemnity, and can now move forward, on the
basis of the solid foundation of past successes and under the
guidance of the Basic Law, to a new height.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have repeatedly reiterated that the prosperity
and stability of Hong Kong will contribute to the modernization of
the country, and that the successful implementation of "One
Country, Two Systems", "a high degree of autonomy" and "Hong Kong
people administering Hong Kong" is the first step towards the
ultimate re-unification of China, Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
He talked about challenges confronting Hong Kong, especially
about issues of great concern to people including the economy,
education, housing and care for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
"Our foremost task is to enhance Hong Kong's economic vitality
and sustain economic growth," he said, adding that the HKSAR
government will draw up a comprehensive plan and inject sufficient
resources to improve the quality of education.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government will also draw up a ten-year housing plan to
achieve a home ownership rate of 70 percent in a decade, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also announced a comprehensive policy of the SAR government
to take care of the various needs of senior citizens in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Describing Hong Kong's return to its motherland as a new
opportunity for Hong Kong's further development, Tung said that
the successful implementation of "one country, two systems"
requires Hong Kong people to develop a better understanding of the
motherland, cultivate a congenial relationship with China's
interior areas, embrace a distinctive set of values, safeguard the
rule of law, protect various freedoms, promote democracy and set a
long-term goal.
</P>
<P>
He said that due to the long separation, there is a general
lack of understanding about the motherland among the people of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong "has created a new environment and
better conditions for us to understand our country and our people,
and to love our country and our people", he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the understanding and relationship between Hong
Kong and the interior areas must be strengthened through mutual
trust, mutual economic benefits, cultural interaction, and mutual
respect for each other's way of life.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Hong Kong and the interior areas
will move forward together, hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
He said that the SAR government would continue to encourage
diversity in the Hong Kong society, but should also reaffirm and
respect the fine traditional Chinese values.
</P>
<P>
"We value plurality, but discourage open confrontation; we
strive for liberty, but not at the expense of the rule of law; we
respect minority views, but are mindful of wider interests; we
protect individual rights, but also shoulder collective
responsibilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the HKSAR would continue to ensure that the
executive, legislative and judicial branches of the government
operate independently, and would keep up efforts against
corruption and maintain a clean society.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR will also ensure equality before the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the SAR government would preserve the existing
freedoms and lifestyle of the Hong Kong people, and ensure that
Hong Kong people continue to enjoy the freedoms of speech,
assembly, association, the press and other freedoms guaranteed by
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
"The SAR government will resolutely move forward to a more
democratic form of government in accordance with provisions in the
Basic Law, and provide opportunities for every stratum of the
society and legitimate political organizations, and people with
different shades of opinion, to participate in the political
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would work together with the local civil service to
serve the community and help build a better Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in the history of Hong Kong, we now have
the opportunity to chart our own destiny," he said.
</P>
<P>
He finally described an ideal Hong Kong society in his vision
as having the following characteristics:
-- a society proud of its national identity and cultural
</P>
<P>
heritage;
-- a stable, equitable, free, democratic, compassionate society
</P>
<P>
with a clear sense of direction;
-- an affluent society with improved quality of life for all;
-- a decent society with a level playing field and fair
</P>
<P>
competition under the rule of law;
-- a window for exchanges between China and the rest of the

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Return Marks New Chapter in Hong Kong History, Jiang Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said here
today that the Hong Kong compatriots will truly become masters of
the region as it has now returned to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China and chairman of the Central
Military Commission, made the remarks at the celebration for the
establishment of the Hong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
"Since ancient times, our ancestors have lived and labored on
this land generation after generation. From the Qin Dynasty to
Emperor Daoguang's Reign of the Qing Dynasty, China exercised
jurisdiction and sovereignty over Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
In mid-19th century, however, after launching two Opium Wars,
Britain forced the corrupt and incompetent Qing Government to sign
the Treaty of Nanking of 1842 and the Convention of Peking of
1860.
</P>
<P>
And in 1898, Britain again coerced the Qing Government into
signing the Convention of the Extension of Hong Kong, thus
occupying the entire Hong Kong region.
</P>
<P>
Despite the prolonged separation, Jiang noted, the
flesh-and-blood bond between the people on the mainland and Hong
Kong compatriots had never severed, nor had their shared sentiment
for the well-being of the nation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese people have never recognized the
unequal treaties imposed on them, never forgotten the humiliating
state of Hong Kong under occupation and never stopped their
indomitable struggle for state sovereignty and national
emancipation.
</P>
<P>
"The rise of the first Five-Star Red Flag at Tiananmen Square
(in Beijing) showed the world that China had achieved national
independence and liberation and embarked on a road to socialism,"
and thanks to reform and opening-up, "a rejuvenated Chinese nation
has taken on a completely new look, and its international stature
has been greatly enhanced," Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It is under these conditions and against this historical
background that Hong Kong has finally returned to the motherland,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In these days of national jubilation for Hong Kong's return,
the Chinese people cherish with great admiration the memory of the
late Chinese leader, Mr Deng Xiaoping, he said.
</P>
<P>
Deng initiated, with exceptional wisdom and great
statesmanship, the creative concept of "one country, two systems,"
charting the correct course to resolve the Hong Kong question
through diplomatic negotiations and to maintain long-term
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang elaborated the policies of "one country, two systems,"
"Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and "a high degree of
autonomy."
</P>
<P>
These policies have been formulated by the Central People's
Government after careful consideration of the need to safeguard
both the immediate interests of the Hong Kong compatriots and the
fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Adherence to these policies serves Hong Kong, serves the
entire nation and serves the world as well. Therefore, there is no
reason whatsoever to change them," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that these policies, which have become one of China's
long-term basic principles, will remain unchanged for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also extended sincere congratulations to Tung Chee Hwa,
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
Government, who has been sworn in earlier today. He expressed
full confidence in the Hong Kong SAR Government under his
leadership and pledged full support to it.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region shall be observed not only in Hong Kong, but
also by all the departments of the Central Government as well as
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under
the Central Government, he noted.
</P>
<P>
No central department or locality may or will be allowed to
interfere in the affairs, which under the Basic Law, should be
administered by the Hong Kong SAR on its own, President Jiang
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Hong Kong's Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that the success of Hong Kong, in the final
analysis, is the  work of the Hong Kong compatriots and is
inseparable from the development of the motherland and the support
from the country's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The pioneering and enterprising spirit of the Hong Kong
compatriots "has filled people around the world with deep
admiration," Jiang said at the celebration for the establishment
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong compatriots "will certainly carry forward this
valuable spirit and bring about a better future for Hong Kong," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese in Hong Kong have the ability to run the affairs of
Hong Kong well and they should be confident of that," he quoted
late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that since the founding of New China, the Chinese
Government has all along given support for a socially stable and
economically prosperous Hong Kong, and the support has become even
more powerful and effective since the country began to implement
the policy of reform and opening-up in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
With the continuous advance of China's modernization drive,
Hong Kong's economic link with the mainland will become even
closer and its role as a bridge will be increasingly enhanced, he
said. "This in turn will give a stronger impetus to Hong Kong's
economic growth."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong's success today is also attributable to
a number of other factors, including its advantageous geographical
location, free port policy of complete openness, well-developed
legal system and highly efficient team of civil service, and
effective economic management and civic administration.
</P>
<P>
"These factors will continue to play a positive role after its
return," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong compatriots are known for their glorious tradition of
patriotism, who have made important contributions in the struggle
for national liberation and in the modernization drive of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong compatriots will surely display greater love for
the motherland and for Hong Kong, and take it as their utmost
honor to maintain long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong
and safeguard the fundamental interests of the country and the
nation, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
To many foreigners living here, Hong Kong has already become
their home, and it will remain their home in the future where they
can live and work in peace and contentment, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in Hong Kong, everyone will have the chance to
compete on an equal footing and everyone will be entitled to the
rights and freedoms as protected by law, regardless of race and
color.
</P>
<P>
By achieving a negotiated settlement of the Hong Kong question,
the Chinese and British Governments have provided the
international community with an example of peaceful settlement of
historical issues between states, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He thanked those British personages, both within and outside
the government, for their contributions to the smooth transition
of Hong Kong, and expressed confidence that the successful
solution to the Hong Kong question will help strengthen the
friendship between the Chinese and British people.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to reform, opening-up and the modernization drive, China
has witnessed tremendous changes in its economic and social life,
he said.
</P>
<P>
China will unswervingly promote peaceful reunification of the
motherland in accordance with the principle of "one country, two
systems," ensuring a smooth return of Macao and eventually
resolving the Taiwan question, Jiang added.

<HEADLINE> Mexico-U.S. Trade Up 60 Percent in Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Mexico and the
United States increased by about 60 percent in the past three
years as a result of the enforcement of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the local press today quoted experts as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Sidney Weintraub, an economist, believes that part of the
growth in trade was due to the continuation of pre-NAFTA
tendencies, but part was indeed due to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Weintraub, a political economist with the Center of
International and Strategic Studies, said U.S. exports to Mexico
resumed their upward trend last year after a decline in 1995.
</P>
<P>
U.S. sales to Mexico increased by about 24 percent from 46
billion U.S. dollars in 1995, a year of recession in Mexico, to
more than 57 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, U.S. exports to its southern neighbor have risen more
quickly, which enabled Mexico to become the second biggest market
for U.S. products in May.
</P>
<P>
Weintraub predicted that bilateral trade will exceed 150
billion dollars in 1997, which will make NAFTA one of the broadest
trade relations in the world.
</P>
<P>
Joseph McKinney, an economist and academic at Bayloy University
in Waco, Texas, said that the effects of the agreement on the
U.S. economy have been positive and relatively modest.
</P>
<P>
As for the controversial topic of whether jobs were created or
lost in the United States because of the NAFTA, McKinney denied
there is any correlation between general job levels and trade
deficits.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. economy generated a net increase of more than
8 million jobs since January 1, 1994, when NAFTA became
effective. The unemployment rate now is nearly 2 percentage
points lower than it was in 1993, he added.

<P>
The Chinese president said Deng initiated, with exceptional
wisdom and great statesmanship, the creative concept of "one
country, two systems," charting the correct course to resolve the
Hong Kong question through diplomatic negotiations and to maintain
the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Jiang elaborated the policies of "one country, two systems,"
"Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and "a high degree of
autonomy."
</P>
<P>
These policies have been formulated by the Central People's
Government after careful consideration of the need to safeguard
both the immediate interests of Hong Kong compatriots and the
fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Adherence to these policies serves Hong Kong, serves the
entire nation and serves the world as well. Therefore, there is no
reason whatsoever to change them," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that these policies, which have become one of China's
long-term basic principles, will remain unchanged for 50 years.

<HEADLINE> Seles Becomes 8th Women's Seed Casualty at Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Monica Seles of the
United States became the 8th women's seed casualty after losing an
astonishing match to unseeded French player Sandrine Testud at the
Wimbledon tennis championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Seles kicked off with great form by snatching the set 6-0,
giving her opponent on chance of gaining an upper hand. But
strong-willed Testud made a dramatic comeback by winning the
following two sets 6-4 8-6, throwing the major seed out of the
Championships.
</P>
<P>
"I was playing so well in the first set and at the beginning of
the second," Seles told a press briefing after the match. "I was
up 5-2 then I had the match point...I should never have let her
back into the match."
</P>
<P>
"I missed a couple of shots that she was out of contention of
getting and they were key shots a few times," Seles said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the other remaining women's seeds including Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, third seed Jana Novotna, Mary Pearce of France
and Mary Joe Fernadez of the United States entered the fourth
round by defeating their opponents in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast with the heavy casualties of women's seeds,
world number one player Pete Sampras, three times Wimbledon men's
champion Boris Becker and third seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov have
cruised into the next round after trouncing their opponents.

<HEADLINE> National Flag Raising Ceremony on First Day of Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A new day was dawning in the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The boiling Tian'anmen Square was beginning to get quieter
following an all-night celebration as the 100,000-plus crowd
were eagerly awaiting the appearance of the Five-Star Red Flag,
China's national flag.
</P>
<P>
Out of the giant gates of Tian'anmen, Liu Yaozheng, with the
huge flag on his shoulder, led a team of 36 armed police soldiers
and a 60-member band, all in full military attire into the square.
</P>
<P>
This was the 263rd mission of the 20-year-old soldier. "It's
the most special one," he said before the troops left the barracks
in a compound inside the Forbidden City. "I will say this to
myself repeatedly when I march out."
</P>
<P>
Liu was the flag-holder on the first morning when Hong Kong
shares the national flag with the rest parts of China. "The flag
is the symbol of our nation and sovereignty, I feel so proud that
I can carry and escort it today," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rank and file marched cross the Chang'an Avenue and reached
the base of a 30-meter-high staff, which was surrounded by the
waiting crowd. Closest to the staff was a ring of 56 young men and
women, all dressed up in ethnic-style costumes, symbolizing the
unity of the 56 nationalities of the nation.
</P>
<P>
At 4:50 sharp, Beijing time, when the sun sent out its first
ray over the eastern horizon, the flag began to rise while the
band played the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
All soluted. The 100,000 people sang "March of the Volunteers,"
China's national anthem.
</P>
<P>
Four hours and fifty minutes ago, the same flag rose for the
first time ever over Hong Kong, a territory ceded to the British
rule after the Opium War in 1842.
</P>
<P>
"Now I am home," said Simon Yong who flew from Hong Kong
yesterday specially for the Beijing celebrations." He felt so
emotional that tears welled up in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
Quivering with excitement, Zhai Xiurong, 63, told Xinhua that
he watched from afar the raising of the national flag at the
inauguration ceremony of the People's Republic 48 years ago when
Chairman Mao Zedong declared that the Chinese people had stood
up. Now I saw it right under it. It has convinced me that our
nation is becoming ever stronger."
</P>
<P>
After the flag was flying in the breeze, there was a
thunderous outburst of applause among the crowd that echoed over
the square.
</P>
<P>
Hand in hand, shoulder by shoulder, thousands of college
students waved flags, tossed colorful ribbons and danced in light
steps while singing "Ode to the Motherland", which starts with the
stanza "The Five-Star Red Flag is fluttering in the wind."
</P>
<P>
"There is a sure way to make our country strong," said Lin Wei,
an electronic engineering major from Beijing University. "Tomorrow
is ours. We rejoice over Hong Kong's return, but the reunification
of the whole nation is yet to be accomplished. It is up to us
young people to shoulder the sacred historical mission and
accomplish it."

<HEADLINE> Trial Begins on Germany's Biggest Bankruptcy Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The trial opened today in Frankfurt
of German real estate developer Juergen Schneider on several
charges of fraud and credit fraud in the multi-billion dollar
collapse of his company in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The trial came more than three years after Schneider, 63,
suddenly went missing in April 1994, leaving behind a company in
debts of about 5.4 billion marks (3.2 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Schneider and his wife Claudia were arrested in Florida, the
United States, in May, 1995 and extradited to Germany in February,
1996.
</P>
<P>
He was found to have cheated about 50 banks of loans for his
projects. The Schneiders were also charged with fraudulent
bankruptcy involving some 245 million marks which they allegedly
diverted to Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Schneider began his business in real estate in 1981. At the
prime of his career, he was involved in prime-location real estate
projects in 14 cities, building luxury hotels, office buildings
and shopping arcades. His company once owned 168 real estate
properties.
</P>
<P>
About 2.6 billion mark debts of his company remains now
uncovered despite the sale of most of these assets.
