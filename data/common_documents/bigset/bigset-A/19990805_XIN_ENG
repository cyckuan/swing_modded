<HEADLINE> Lukashenko: Russia Ignores Minsk' Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko said Wednesday that he had urged Russian President
Boris Yeltsin not to pull out nuclear weapons from Belarus hastily
but Yeltsin ignored his suggestion.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said he had warned Yeltsin that once the nuclear
weapons were out of Belarus, Eastern European countries would join
NATO. The last strategic nuclear missile left Belarus for Russia
in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Real life has shown that this is exactly what happened; as
soon as the missiles were withdrawn, Eastern Europe joined NATO,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Like Russia, Belarus is bitterly against the transatlantic
alliance's eastward enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said that at the time he had been under considerable
pressure from "(U.S. President Bill) Clinton on one side and
Yeltsin on the other," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He also complained that Russia ignored his appeals for a joint
policy toward NATO. "The result was military intervention by the
alliance in the Balkans."
</P>
<P>
"Maybe tomorrow you'll invite (Semyon) Sharetsky (former
Belarus parliamentary speaker in opposition to Lukashenko) to
Moscow as you've done (Montenegrin President Milo) Djukanovic?"
Lukashenko said in a barely veiled criticism of Russia's perceived
closer ties with Montenegro away from Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
"Where are the guarantees (that this will not happen)?" he
asked.

<HEADLINE> Relief Food Delivered to Besieged Angolan City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of urgently
needed relief food are being distributed to thousands of starving
people in the war-torn city of Malange in Angola, according to a
news released issued by the U.N. World Food Program (WFP).
</P>
<P>
The release available here Wednesday said that WFP staff, who
visited the besieged city last week, described the situation there
as "critical" with an estimated three to four people dying of
hunger each day.
</P>
<P>
The batch of some 245 tons of food arrived in the city by road
last week was given to non-governmental organizations there for
immediate distribution to child centers and a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
Francesco Strippoli, WFP Representative and Humanitarian Aid
Coordinator in Angola, was quoted as saying that "we plan to
transport a further 2,200 tons of food to Malange through August
but security is still very bad, both on the road and in the city."
</P>
<P>
Malange, like several other Angolan cities, has been under
continuous attack by the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) rebel forces in recent months, making it
impossible to deliver food either by air or road, according to
WFP.
</P>
<P>
At present, the WFP can deliver some 7,000 tons of food per
month, but in order to feed all Angolans, it would need to double
the supplies to 130, 000 tons a month, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Publish Anti-Malaria Guideline Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Health Ministry
has worked out a new guideline enabling the country to identify
and control malaria epidemic, the Ethiopian News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The guideline is designed to create conducive situations to
prevent malaria before the epidemic goes out of control, Daniel
Kebede, representative of malaria and other vector-borne diseases
control team, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The guideline, soon to be distributed to the various state
health bureaus, would also enable the public at large to actively
participate in the fight against the disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is a common disease in many parts of Ethiopia. Health
authorities in the country have been observing an anti-malaria
week for years to raise public awareness on malaria control
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide campaign is normally held from August 24 to 30
as August is a month suitable for malaria breeding in most parts
of the Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from early this month, anti-malaria chemicals are
being sprayed in parts of the country to preempt possible outbreak
of the epidemic.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Language Will Become More Important: German Scholar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese language will become a
more important speech for international communication, and in
future, Chinese will be taught in German schools as a normal
foreign language just like English and French, a German linguistic
scholar said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In 10 or 20 years, Chinese will be counted as a normal foreign
language (in Germany)," Professor Peter Kupfer was quoted as
telling the Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA) news agency. Kupfer is a
professor at University Mainz and chairman of Germany's Chinese
Language Professional Association.
</P>
<P>
According to Kupfer, who is due to host the Sixth International
Symposium for Chinese as Foreign Language, more German schools are
providing with Chinese language courses in recent years. The
symposium will begin on August 8 in the city of Hannover.
</P>
<P>
The ground for this development, said Kupfer, is the fast
expanding Sino-German ties, especially in economic fields.
</P>
<P>
"The language will creep into Germans' daily life gradually,
for example, through symbols written in Chinese inside an imported
refrigerator made in China," the professor said.
</P>
<P>
About 400 delegates from 35 countries are expected to take part
in the symposium, the first one ever to be held outside China.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, organized by the Chinese Language Professional
Association and China's International Society of Chinese Language
Teaching, is to show that a real understanding over the Chinese
culture and society is possible only with an understanding over
the Chinese language, said the German host to the symposium.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Supports Robertson as New NATO Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday expressed his support for British Defense Secretary
George Robertson to be the next secretary-general of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased that our NATO alliance has selected British
Defense Secretary George Robinson to be NATO's next
secretary-general," Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, the 19-member NATO named Robertson as its
secretary-general to replace Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
Robertson is "an extremely talented and dedicated public
servant," Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"He displayed extraordinary leadership during the Kosovo
conflict and has continued to lead in an effort to restore
stability there. I look forward to working with him as he guides
NATO into a new century," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also praised Solana for his contribution to the
alliance, especially during the 78-day air campaign by the allies
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary General Solana has done a superb job steering NATO
through conflict in the Balkans, ushering in three new members to
the alliance, reaching out to the security partners across Europe
and meeting other vital challenges," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement, U.S. State Department spokesman James
Rubin welcomed NATO's appointment of Robertson as the person to
replace Spain's Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
"He is an extremely able minister who has served his government
well, not only during the Kosovo conflict but also in the crucial
debates on NATO's future that preceded the (NATO) Washington
summit," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"He has impressed his alliance colleagues with his knowledge,
leadership abilities and diplomatic skills. These are qualities
which will serve him well as he leads the alliance into the 21st
century," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
Robertson is expected to take office in early October. Solana,
NATO's current secretary-general, will become the European Union's
foreign policy representative.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The sixth symposium on science and
 technology of Zimbabwe opened in Harare Wednesday to seek
solutions to the country's socio-economic problems through
research.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zimbabwe's Vice-President Simon
Muzenda appealed to the scientific community to find solutions to
the country's socio-economic problems through research.
</P>
<P>
He reassured the participants that the government was making
efforts to increase its funding for scientific research.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda said a bio-safety board had been formed to monitor
ethical problems, dangers and risks associated with bio-technology
such as the release of genetically modified organisms.
</P>
<P>
A food and nutrition council had also been set up to prepare
for the new challenges in the next millennium, he added.
</P>
<P>
A radiation and protection agency was under consideration and a
Zimbabwe Academic and Research Network was being installed, the
vice-president noted.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda took a swipe at the media for singling out Zimbabwe as
a country mostly affected by the AIDS pandemic in the world. He
called on the scientific community to continue searching for a
cure or vaccine.
</P>
<P>
About 200 experts attended the symposium which was organized by
the Research Council of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
This year's theme is "a century of science and technology --
challenges for the next millennium".

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has not decided to postpone her trip to the
Middle East this month despite there are differences between
Israel and the Palestinians over the implementation of the Wye
agreement, the State Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There's been no decision to delay the trip," spokesman James
Rubin told reporters. "We indicated that we expected to travel
this month and that remains our expectation."
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post and Na'aretz newspapers reported Wednesday
that Albright might postpone the trip due to disappointment over a
proposal by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to postpone the
implementation of the Wye agreement until Oct. 1, which was flatly
rejected by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
It would be the first trip by Albright to the Middle East
since last December.

EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion
Jan-Ove Waldner seemed not in his best form as he edged out unknown
Sergei Andrianov in the men's singles second round of the world table
tennis championships here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Swede conceded the third set and nearly lost the
fourth in his 21-17, 21-18, 18-21, 23-21 win over the Russian
qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Andrianov, undaunted facing the arguably the best ever player in
the world, hit a lot of forehand and backhand winners in the third set
while the Swede seemed to lose concentration.
</P>
<P>
Waldner led all the way in the fourth round until he served the
ball into the net to see the score tied at 21-21. Then two wayward
shots by the Russian sent Waldner into the third round.
</P>
<P>
Waldner has won so many titles that he lost count. In last world
championships, Waldner routed Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus to win
his second world singles championship since 1989.
</P>
<P>
The immensely talented Swede is the only player in the world to
have won a "Grand Slam" of the Olympic, world championship and World
Cup titles.
</P>
<P>
World No. 1 and top seed Samsonov also made the third round after
thumping Frenchman Nicolas Chatelain 21-19, 21-13, 21-12.
</P>
<P>
Dual Olympic champion Liu Guoliang's deceptively spinning serves
and follow-up attacks were just too much for Tho Von Scheele who lost
21-8, 22-20, 21-3.
</P>
<P>
Liu's Olympic doubles champion partner Kong Linghui also cruised
into the third round, beating South Korean Park Sang Joon 21-10,
21-8, 21-10.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Wang Liqin moved up with 22-20, 21-12, 21-12 thrashing of
Russian Andrei Mazunov.
</P>
<P>
Two-time World Cup winner Zoran Primorac of Croatia rallied to
subdue Frenchman Michel Martinez 16-21, 21-15, 21-14, 21-19, while

Sweden's Fredri Hakansson 14-21, 21-7, 21-14, 21-19.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria May Deploy Troops to Combat Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Following rising violent crimes
like armed robberies and assassinations nationwide, Nigerian
government may shortly deploy troops to some of the country's
states to stem the trend, according to a Nigerian newspaper
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Indications to this emerged yesterday as the police redeployed
its commissioners, assistant commissioners of police, chief
superintendent of police and 105 other officers in an apparent
attempt to curb the increasing violent crimes, reported This Day,
a major Nigerian daily.
</P>
<P>
Government is said to believe that the crime wave, which has
seen prominent citizens like renowned industrialist Chris
Ogunbajo, Presidential Adviser Alhaji Mahmud Wazri, former Sports
Minister Anthony Ikhazobh and others becoming victims, can no
longer be managed by ordinary policing methods.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a president source as saying that
President Olusegun Obasanjo may have been seriously considering
the option of bringing in the troops at least temporarily, at the
request of some state governors with whom he extensively spoke on
telephone.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the National Security Council will also discuss
the activity of armed bandits in the North-south and North-west
who launch cross border raids into Nigeria maiming and killing
villagers in those areas.
</P>
<P>
Source said that the activities of menacing secret cults who
recently killed four students of the Obafemi Awolowo University
at IleIfe would also be discussed by the council.

<HEADLINE> Egypt-Libya Summit Discuss Regional Issues, Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
met on Wednesday with visiting Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in
the Mediterranean town of Mersa Matrouh, 550 kilometers northwest
of Cairo, to discuss regional issues and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Egyptian Information
Minister Safwat el-Sherif said the two leaders dealt with key Arab
issues and efforts to clear Arab atmospheres and boost joint Arab
action, the country's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the Arab-African relations and
Libya's efforts to convene an extraordinary African summit in
Tripoli next month, el-Sherif said.
</P>
<P>
The talks dealt with the two North African neighbors' efforts
to seek ways of helping Sudan end the 16-year-old civil war and
reach national reconciliation, the Egyptian minister added.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's opposition National Democratic Alliance ended a
five-day meeting in Tripoli on Sunday. The alliance groups
northern Sudanese parties that are seeking democracy and the Sudan
People's Liberation Army, which has been fighting for autonomy for
the Christian and animist people of the south.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Gaddafi tackled the latest developments of the
Mideast peace process and the outcome of Egypt's contacts with the
parties concerned, el-Sherif said.
</P>
<P>
Hopes have increased of reviving the peace process after the
election of moderate Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in May. But
Barak's proposals to delay the implementation of signed peace
agreements have frustrated the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Libyan summit further reviewed the outcome of the
meetings between the two sides on means to boost cooperation in
various domains, el-Sherif said.
</P>
<P>
During Gaddafi's Egyptian visit in March, a number of
agreements were reached on setting up joint ventures in the
fishery industry and on land reclamation. But little has been done
for the implementation.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi crossed into Egypt's border town of Salloum earlier in
the day for the one-day visit. This was his first trip to Egypt
since April when the United Nations Security Council suspended
sanctions after Libya handed over two suspects of blowing up Pan
AM flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988. The explosion
killed 270 people, most of them American or British.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Killed in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 4 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi civilian was killed
and two others were injured on Wednesday in U.S. and British air
raids on civilian facilities in northern Iraq, an Iraqi military
spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 11:05 local time (0705 GMT), nine
formations of enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace
violated northern Iraqi airspace over the provinces of Dohuk,
Erbil and Neineva, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The warplanes attacked civilian facilities in the region,
causing the casualties, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back and forced the enemy
planes to flee to their base in Turkey, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
At 10:30 (0630 GMT) and 17:27 (1327 GMT), 16 formations of
U.S. and British warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases
violated southern Iraqi airspace over the provinces of Basra,
Misan, Muthana, Thi-Qar and Qadissiya, he said.
</P>
<P>
They were also forced back to their bases in Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait by Iraqi anti-air forces.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched airstrikes against Iraq
last December, their warplanes which have made more than 10,900
sorties over the northern and southern no-fly zones in Iraq, have
been regularly attacking Iraqi military and civilian targets,
causing severe civilian casualties and property damages.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south against
possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Delegation to Visit Congo Rebel-Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian delegation led by Eric
Silwamba, Minister in Charge of Presidential Affairs, is expected
in the territories controlled by the rebels of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Rwanda News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is to investigate the leadership wrangle rocking
the main rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD),
rebel sources were quoted as saying. But no exact date was given.
</P>
<P>
There has been dispute within the RCD over who should sign the
Lusaka cease-fire agreement on behalf of the RCD. The six
countries directly involved in the DRC conflict signed the
cease-fire agreement in the Zambian capital on July 10.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, RCD new leader Emile Illunga backed by Rwanda and
ousted leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba supported by Uganda, had
contended for the RCD signature.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Jean Pierre Bemba, the leader of the Congolese
Liberation Movement (MLC), also supported by Uganda, signed the
Lusaka peace accord but warned that he may withdraw his signature
if the RCD did not sign within a week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Kigali believe that the current wrangle within the
RCD is rather a reflection of the growing row between Rwanda and
Uganda, major backers of the two rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
Several clashes in Kisangani were reported between the Rwandan
troops stationed there and their Ugandan counterparts, but
officials of both countries continually denied that there was any
friction regarding their policy toward the conflict in the vast
central African country.
</P>
<P>
Disagreement between Rwanda and Uganda over the support to the
rebel movement grew bitter in May this year when after breaching
the regulations of the RCD, Wamba was removed in a special
convention and replaced by Illunga.
</P>
<P>
Illunga reiterated that his movement was still favorable to
signing the Lusaka protocol anytime, once it would have been
agreed that Wamba is just an individual like any other member of
the RCD.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and South Africa were also
involved in the mediation, which has so far proven fruitless.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday expressed his support for British Defense Secretary
George Robertson to be the next secretary-general of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased that our NATO alliance has selected British
Defense Secretary George Robinson to be NATO's next
secretary-general," Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, the 19-member NATO named Robertson as its
secretary-general to replace Javier Solana, who is to become the
European Union foreign policy representative.
</P>
<P>
Robertson is "an extremely talented and dedicated public
servant," Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"He displayed extraordinary leadership during the Kosovo
conflict and has continued to lead in an effort to restore
stability there. I look forward to working with him as he guides
NATO into a new century," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also praised Solana for his contribution to the
alliance, especially during the 78-day air campaign by the allies
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary General Solana has done a superb job steering NATO
through conflict in the Balkans, ushering in three new members to
the alliance, reaching out to the security partners across Europe
and meeting other vital challenges," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Newspaper Chief Ordered to Pay Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chief of an Iranian moderate
newspaper was imposed a fine of 23 million rials (about 3,000
U.S. dollars) by a special clerics court's verdict on Wednesday
for "disseminating untruthful and distorted news."
</P>
<P>
The court's verdict, reached after an open trial on July 25,
was handed down on Hojjatoleslam Seyyed Mohammad Khoeiniha,
managing director of the daily "Salam (Hello)".
</P>
<P>
The newspaper was ordered to close down after publishing a
"classified document" of the Intelligence Ministry on July 6.
</P>
<P>
The special clerics court found Khoeiniha "guilty of
disseminating untruthful and distorted news aimed at harming the
public opinion" and sentenced him to a 18-month imprisonment with
lashes according to Islamic Penal Code.
</P>
<P>
The verdict said, however, he has been made to pay the fine
instead due to his background during the pre- and
post-revolutionary period.
</P>
<P>
"And since the accused has also had similar instance of
charges brought against him earlier, he has been suspended
from taking any responsibility as managing director of a press
for a period of three years," the verdict said.
</P>
<P>
The court also ordered a ban of the popular newspaper for
five years.
</P>
<P>
Salam reported on July 6 that former Deputy Intelligence
Minister Saeed Emami (also famous as Islami), one of the
main agents behind serial political killings in the country,
has proposed to amend the country's press law in order to
control the press.
</P>
<P>
Emami, who was arrested for masterminding killings of several
Iranian dissidents, committed suicide in prison on June 19 by
taking depilatory substance while taking a bath.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Iran Nation Party Darius Forouhar and his
wife were stabbed to death at home while at least three
dissident writers were mysteriously killed in Tehran later last
year.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the paper, together with a newly-prepared press
law intended to clamp down on the press, led to Tehran University
students' recent protest, in which violent clashes erupted
between students and the police.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that seven students were killed, about 300
injured and 500 arrested in the clashes.

<HEADLINE> 80 Pct of Repatriated Tribals Rehabilitated in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 percent of the
repatriated tribals have been rehabilitated properly at their
once-abandoned homes and hearths in Bangladesh's three
southeastern hill districts as per government's 20-point package
of incentives, the national news agency BSS reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The process of rehabilitating internal refugees is at the final
stage, Dipankar Talukdar, chairman of the task force on
repatriated tribals and internal refugees rehabilitation affairs,
was quoted as saying in Rangamati district, 230 km southeast of
Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The non-tribals disturbed by insurgency and displaced
internally would be treated as internal refugees on production of
proper documents, he added.
</P>
<P>
A total of 152,000 families, of which 83,525 are tribals and
68,475 are non-tribals, from the three hill districts of
Rangamati, Khagrachhari and Bandarban have filled the government
supplied forms to be entertained as internal refugees.
</P>
<P>
A total of 64,609 tribals belonging to 12,222 families returned
home in different phases from six refugee camps in the Indian
state of Tripura, bordering the hill district of Khagrachhari.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government signed the Chittagong Hill Tracts
peace agreement on December 2, 1997, with the tribal rebels, which
ended over two decades of armed conflict in the three hill
districts. The repatriation and rehabilitation work started right
after the signing of the accord.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Accuse Opposition of Using Civilians as Human Shields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
Wednesday accused the anti-Taliban northern alliance forces of
using civilians as human shields in the latest fighting in
northern Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Taliban admitted that they have shifted
at least 1,800 families in Kapisa and Parwan provinces to the
eastern city of Jalalabad, sources from Kabul told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Kabul, Taliban senior official
responsible for information and culture Mulla Amir Khan Muttaqi
denied the opposition's claim that a large number of people have
been forcibly expelled from northern Afghan provinces by the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
These families have been shifted due to security reasons as the
opposition was using them as human shields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi added that the Taliban have made arrangements to
provide basic facilities to them including foods, water and
medicines.
</P>
<P>
But he denied the opposition's claim about the migration of
250,000 people from the northern areas of the country, saying that
the figure was "much exaggerated."
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi admitted the influx of refugees and displaced Afghans
in Kabul as well, but said they are living with relatives in the
city.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) in Kabul, Christopher Lodhe, said that the Taliban have
informed them of the arrival of a number of displaced persons into
Kabul and asked for help and assistance to them, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC, Lodhe said, is in touch with both the Taliban and the
opposition to provide help and assistance to the displaced Afghans
both in Kabul and the Panjsher valley, the stronghold of
opposition forces.

<HEADLINE> Over 600 Congo Rebels Surrender to SADC Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spokesman of the Zimbabwean Defense Forces Chancellor Diye said
here on Wednesday that the 617 surrenders were part of a group
that fought against the Zimbabwean National Army (ZNA) at Manono
Village, home village of DRC President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the surrenders follow another surrender of
80 rebels last week at Ankoro, situated along the Congo river.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that since the announcement of the amnesty by Kabila,
the rebels have been waiting for someone to take the lead and with
the situation like this we are expecting to see several thousands
of them responding to the amnesty offer," Diye said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila offered the rebels an olive branch, a week after the
July 10 Lusaka cease-fire agreement, in which was signed by all
the countries involved in the civil war in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
However, the rebels did not sign because of differences within
their ranks.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said all rebels who had surrendered were now
under the Allied Forces' protection, adding that there were
indications that more rebels were willing to surrender.
</P>
<P>
Since last August, Zimbabwean soldiers together with those from
Angola, Namibia and Chad have been in the DRC assisting Kabila's
embattled government to repel rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Basij Kicks off Military Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Basij militiamen, a military
reserve of Iran, began their annual military exercises in the
northeastern part of Tehran Wednesday to mark their role in the
war against Iraq in 1980s.
</P>
<P>
A total of 50,000 Basij militiamen took part in the maneuvers
to initiate the Week of Basij, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) is expected to play
a part in the military exercises by performing acrobatic show,
parachuting and parachute glider show, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
The Basij forces, which are in charge of Iran's internal
security and under the command of the IRGC, were formed by an
order of the late Iranian Supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini in the
early 1980s during the Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
The Basij volunteers had assisted the Iranian army and the IRGC
during the 1980-88 war by providing logistics, carrying wounded
soldiers, and even directly joining in battles.
</P>
<P>
Local reports alleged the Basij is associated with the
right-wing politicians in the country, hinting that it played a
role in the quenching of university students' call for more press
freedom early last month.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Tamil Rebels Agree to Open Supply Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka said Wednesday that
Tamil rebels have agreed to open a route for food convoys and
people into rebel-held areas in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
Wednesday sent a message saying that they have agreed to open a
supply route, said Military Spokesman R.P. Witana.
</P>
<P>
The security forces will clear land mines and anti-personnel
mines in the route area and open the route within a few days, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The lack of a supply route to the rebel-held areas have
stranded over 2,000 civilians for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had said more than half a million civilians faced
starvation because the military had closed a route by which relief
supplies were taken to people in the Wanni area under rebel
control.
</P>
<P>
The government has traditionally supplied food and other items
to civilians in rebel-held areas.
</P>
<P>
A route was closed in May when the army launched a fresh
offensive against the LTTE rebels, who have been fighting for a
separate homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east for minority
Tamils since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) launched a
mercy mission last Sunday to evacuate patients in the Wanni area
following reports that four people had died for lack of medicines.
</P>
<P>
During June 29-August 4, the army exchanged as many as 16
letters and messages through the ICRC to the LTTE regarding the
route, the spokesman said.

DAMASCUS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Defense Minister General
Mustafa Tlass Wednesday categorically denied his reportedly
insulting remarks about Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Tlass was quoted by local media as saying that "I didn't insult
Arafat personally or used any obscene words against him." He said
that he blasted Arafat's policies of concessions to Israel since
the signing of the Oslo accords in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Tlass was commenting on reports accusing him of insulting
Arafat in a speech delivered on Monday in Lebanon's eastern city

</P>
<P>
In his speech, Tlass criticized Arafat for "not announcing
Jerusalem a Palestinian capital" and said he "should better not
act as a chicken at the White House and dare say Jerusalem should
be the united capital of the future Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Tuesday urged Syria
to fire Tlass for scorning Arafat, saying "that person (Tlass)
cannot lead the Syrian army" and accused Tlass of having damaged
the fame of the Syrian armed forces and the fraternal ties between
the Syrian and Palestinian peoples.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has called on U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to help
end the "war and massacre of people in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the call during a telephone conversation with
Annan Tuesday night, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister expressed deep concern over the
continuation of conflicts in the neighboring country and
"intervention of foreign forces" there.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been supporting Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani,
now leader of the opposition forces, while Pakistan backed the
rival Taliban, which controls most of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to IRNA, Rabbani sent Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami, Chairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC), a letter lately, whose content was not revealed.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban fighters have scored another victory in an
offensive by taking an air base of the opposition forces recently.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi underlined the need to find a diplomatic solution to
the decade-old Afghan civil war instead of resorting to force and
military operations.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed the importance of negotiations between the
belligerent sides and vowed that he would continue his efforts
to cease the military operation in the war-torn country, IRNA
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief further called on Afghanistan's neighbors to
take initiatives in this regard and to exert pressure to end the
bloodshed and presence of foreign forces there.
</P>
<P>
As to the large number of refugees caused by the fightings,
Kharrazi stressed the need to dispatch humanitarian aid to
Afghanistan, a proposal welcomed by Annan, IRNA said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Zimbabwe to Cut State Borrowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Wednesday urges
Zimbabwe to cut its domestic borrowing so as to win the bank's 140
million U.S. dollars credit.
</P>
<P>
Resident representative of the World Bank Thomas Allen told
the Zimbabwe News Agency that the plan would involve a
reallocation of budgetary expenditures towards the social sector
and poverty reducing activities.
</P>
<P>
"The strategy can start a virtuous cycle of stabilizing the
currency, lower domestic borrowing costs, lower interest rates,
lower inflation and lower future deficits," Allen said.
</P>
<P>
He said a critical part of the program would be the
acceleration of the government privatization program.
</P>
<P>
The program, he said, aimed to bring in sufficient fiscal
revenues to help reduce the domestic debt to sustainable levels
and relieve the government of costly financial support to
inefficient parastatals.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank was finalizing with the government an
international development agency credit of 140 million U.S.
dollars to be disbursed over a period of six months, providing
budgetary support to the Zimbabwean government.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund Monday approved a 193 million
U.S. dollars standby credit for Zimbabwe to support the nation's
economic reform program over next 14 months.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent quarterly disbursements would be made available on
the basis of Zimbabwe's meeting performance targets.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on U.N. Presence in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday met in a closed-door session to discuss a report from
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who wants to see a bigger U.N.
presence in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation body heard the briefing by the U.N. special
representative for Sierra Leone, Francis Okelo of Uganda, who is
expected to speak to reporters Wednesday afternoon, a U.N.
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In his written report to the U.N. Security Council late Monday,
Annan recommended increasing a U.N. mission in Sierra Leone to 210
observers from 70 to help implement a recently signed peace accord
between the government and rebels, a U.N. official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A larger U.N. Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) would
be needed, depending on a division of labor to be worked out
between the United Nations and a large Nigerian-led West African
force, known as the ECOMOG, that has been supporting the Sierra
Leonean government, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The Peace Agreement, signed on July 7 in Togo's capital of
Lome, requires the UNOMSIL to perform significantly expanded as
well as new tasks in close coordination with the ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the major disarmament and demobilization effort,
implementation of the Lome agreement will require substantial
numbers of peacekeepers throughout the country and the deployment
of additional U.N. military observers, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The number of UNOMSIL military observers would increase to

<HEADLINE> Experts Asks U.N. to Deal With Destabilizing Effects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A group of government
experts Wednesday released a report on international efforts to
tackle the destabilizing and excessive accumulation and transfer
of small arms and light weapons now numbering more than 500
million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The report, produced by a group of more than two dozen experts
from around the world, underscored the fact that while small arms
and light weapons do not cause the conflicts in which they are
used, they do exacerbate and increase their lethality.
</P>
<P>
"Virtually every part of the United Nations system is dealing
in one way or another with the consequences of the armed
conflicts, insecurity, violence, crime, social disruption,
displaced peoples and human suffering that are directly or
indirectly associated with the wide availability of these
weapons," said the 33-page report.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, experts said the insecurity associated with the
wide availability of small arms can undermine efforts to promote
development and post-conflict reconstruction, as well as the
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants.
</P>
<P>
Among its recommendations, the report called for the
development of practical disarmament measures related to small
arms and light weapons collection in Kosovo, a Serbian province,
given the protracted nature of the crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
The experts also stressed the effect of these weapons on
children, saying that some 300,000 young people under the age of
16 are estimated to have been exploited as participants in the
conflicts using these arms.
</P>
<P>
In response, the report said that the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) and other relevant organizations should focus on the
special needs of affected children in post-conflict situations.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the important role played by civil society in
efforts to raise awareness of small arms and light weapons, and
its role in proposing solutions, the report called on the United
Nations to further cooperate with non-governmental organizations
towards these ends.
</P>
<P>
An international conference on illicit arms trade in all its
aspects, which the General Assembly has said should be convened in
2001, is also discussed at length in the report.
</P>
<P>
The group of experts was set up under a resolution of the
General Assembly in April 1996 to help the U.N. secretary-general,
Kofi Annan, prepare a report on the types of small arms and light
weapons being used in conflicts being dealt with by the United
Nations, the nature and causes of the excessive and destabilizing
accumulation and transfer of small arms and light weapons,
including their illicit production and trade.

<HEADLINE> EU Opens Autitrust Probe Into Dutch-Finnish Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Wednesday that it has decided to open an in-depth inquiry into the
public bid by the Finnish bathroom producer Sanitec Ltd Oyj Abp of
the Dutch company N.V. Koninklijke Sphinx Gustavsberg.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) executive body said the main area of
concern identified is the companies' combined strong position in a
number of ceramic sanitary ware products in the Nordic countries
including Norway, Finland, Sweden, Iceland and Denmark, where they
would account for over three quarters of the market, and in
Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, the Benelux countries,
where the concentration would lead to combined market shares above
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The EU's antitrust regulators believe the new merger would
violate the European Union's competition law. Both Sanitec and
Sphinx produce and market bathroom products, but the proposed
acquisition could apparently lead to creation and strengthening of
their dominant positions in a number of product and geographic
markets, the commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the new entity would obtain a very strong market
position with respect to several ceramic sanitary ware products in
the Nordic countries. In several products, the new entity would
have market shares between 10-20 times higher than its largest
competitors.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, given the two companies are market leaders now,
the commission believed the merger would eliminate the most
important competitors. It would also have strong position in a
number of ceramic sanitary ware products in the Benelux, the EU
executive body said.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission said it had to enter into a full
investigation based on current facts before approving the new
firm.

<HEADLINE> 2 Detained Turkish Soldiers to Be Released: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Ambassador to Turkey
Seyed Mohammad Hossain Lavasani said here on Wednesday that Iran
will release the two detained Turkish soldiers in Iran soon.
</P>
<P>
Turkish state-run TRT TV quoted Lavasani as saying that the
two detained Turkish soldiers, who entered the Iranian territory
on July 22, will be freed as quick as possible.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey told Iran in recent meetings between the two
countries that the continued detention of the two Turkish
soldiers who entered the Iranian territory by mistake was
creating unwanted tension in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"We have assured Iran that the two soldiers entered Iran by
mistake. Turkey does not have a hostile attitude towards Iran,"
said a Turkish senior government official, who asked not to be
named.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we respect Iran's sovereignty and territorial
integrity. It is out of the question for Turkey to violate
Iranian territory."
</P>
<P>
"Neither Iran nor Turkey want tension in ties, but the
continued detention of these two soldiers is creating tension. We
hope that this issue will soon be resolved," added the official.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two countries were strained when Iran claimed
on July 18 that Turkish warplanes hit an Iranian military post and
tents belonging to Iranian tribesmen.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the bombardment had killed five people
and injured 10 others in the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has said that the attack was aimed at the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which uses bases in northern Iraq
for hit-and-run attacks on Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has complained that Iran allowed the PKK to move into
Iranian territory after Turkey threatened to use military force to
oust PKK rebels from Syrian territory last fall. But Iran has
denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Conflicts between the
Turkish security forces and the PKK militants have claimed over
37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Sacks Corruption-Related Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Three officials of Cambodian
Mine Action Center were removed from office Wednesday for being
related to a corruption scandal in the organization which led to
the loss of up to 70,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"On August 2, 1999, Prime Minister Hun Sen made a request for
the appointment of Lt-Gen. Khem Sophoan as Director General of the
Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC) in replacement of Sam Sotha,"
a press release issued by CMAC Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has also signed a sub-decree moving Niem Chouleng from
his position of Assistant Director General to a temporary position
at the Governing Council of the CMAC.
</P>
<P>
Khem Sophoan has resigned from his position of Deputy
Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
A formal handover of responsibility from Sam Sotha to Khem
Sophoan will take place once the appointment decree has been
signed.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has also endorsed a decision to temporarily transfer Ek
Bolin from his position of Director of Finance to Assistant
Treasurer.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for the Cambodian government to dismiss
government officials associated with a corruption scandal since
the new government was formed last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the audits, CMAC has mismanaged 50,000 to more
than 70,000 U.S. dollars between 1996 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
CMAC is a government organization which was set up in 1992 for
the purpose of educating people, training its members and clearing
mines.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dow Chemical, Union Carbide to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Chemical Co. is buying
Union Carbide Corp. for 9.3 billion U.S. dollars, bolstering Dow
Chemical's position as the world's No. 2 chemical company behind
DuPont, said local press reports Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The merged company, which will operate under the Dow Chemical
name, will have 24 billion dollars in annual revenues, according
to an Associated Press report from Detroit, Michigan.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 jobs will be cut, leaving about 49,000 employees.
The two companies expect the combination to save 500 million
dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
"This transaction is a giant step in our strategy to transform
Dow into the world's most productive, best `value-growth' company
in the chemical industry," Dow Chemical President and Chief
Executive Officer William S. Stavropoulos was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Union Carbide shareholders will own about 25 percent of Dow
Chemical after the deal is complete, and Union Carbide Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer William Joyce will become vice
chairman of the Dow Chemical board of directors.
</P>
<P>
"This is the right move at a good time," Joyce said in a
statement. "In a consolidating chemical industry where fewer, more
powerful companies will exist, the combination of Dow and Union
Carbide now sets the gold standard for the industry."
</P>
<P>
Union Carbide shareholders will receive 0.537 shares of Dow
Chemical for each of their Union Carbide shares -- or 66.96
dollars based on Tuesday's closing price of Dow Chemical's stock.
The agreement also includes 2.3 billion dollars in assumed debt.
</P>
<P>
The merger depends on the approval of Union Carbide
shareholders and federal regulators. The companies expect it to be
completed by the first quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Dow Chemical, based in Midland, is a leading maker of plastics,
chemicals, hydrocarbons, and herbicides and pesticides. It earned
1.3 billion dollars on revenues of 18.4 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Union Carbide, based in Danbury, Connecticut, produces basic
and specialty chemicals. It had profits of 403 million dollars in
1998 on sales of 5.7 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Robertson as NATO Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
expressed its support for British Defense Secretary George
Robertson as a candidate for the secretary-general of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
In a statement, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin
welcomed NATO's selection of Robertson Wednesday as the person to
replace Spain's Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
"He is an extremely able minister who has served his government
well, not only during the Kosovo conflict but also in the crucial
debates on NATO's future that preceded the (NATO) Washington
summit," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"He has impressed his alliance colleagues with his knowledge,
leadership abilities and diplomatic skills. These are qualities
which will serve him well as he leads the alliance into the 21st
century," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
If approved, Robertson will take office in early October.
Solana, NATO's current secretary-general, will become the European
Union's foreign policy representative.
</P>
<P>
The approval by the United States, a leading member of the
alliance, is critical for the British secretary to succeed in
becoming chief of the 19-member NATO.
</P>
<P>
Britain has been very supportive in the U.S.-led NATO air
campaign against Yugoslavia. That's a major element for Robertson
to gain support from Washington in his bid for the post.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say Robertson's candidacy could easily be
approved by the members of the alliance.

<HEADLINE> Europe Must Learn Kosovo Lesson: Robertson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson, who has just been appointed as NATO secretary-general,
said Wednesday the lesson of the Kosovo conflict was that
Europe must enhance its own military capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"One of the clear lessons of the Kosovo conflict is the need
for Europe to enhance its military capabilities," Robertson told a
news conference in London held shortly after his appointment was
announced.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the need for the Western alliance to work
closely with Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Relations with Russia -- and with Ukraine -- are going to be
enormously important," he said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said the potential enlargement of NATO to include
countries of Eastern Europe would be an important part of his new
brief.
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of other applicant countries which clearly
have ambitions and aspirations to join and we've made it clear
that the door is not closed," he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO made Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic its new
members earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said he expected to take up the appointment later
this year when current NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana takes
up his new post as the European Union's foreign policy
representative.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Creates Timber Forest of 10,000 Hectares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh created a timber forest
on 10,593 hectares and a strip forest on 7,390 kilometers during
the last fiscal year ending on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Environment and Forest Minister Sayeda Sajeda Chowdhury told
the inaugural function of a nursery here Wednesday that
Bangladesh's 17.5 percent of land might go under water due to the
rising temperature and sea level, she said.
</P>
<P>
The natural disaster must be contained through massive
afforestation, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The government is determined to create new forests and plant
trees to maintain ecological balance, she said, adding that a
massive afforestation program is going on under 15 projects in the
country.
</P>
<P>
She called upon the people to participate in the country-wide
tree plantation program that began on June 15 and will continue
till September 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
In this South Asian country, forest covers less than 15 percent
of the total area, compared to a desirable proportion of 25
percent, and the forest acreage is declining at a faster pace. The
government has taken a series of measures including organizing a
three-month country-wide tree plantation drive every year to
maintain ecological balance.

YANGON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government and the
Australian Human Rights Commissioner (HRC) have agreed to
cooperate in the field of human rights, according to a government
statement issued here Wednesday.

LONDON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson,
looks forward to race in the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, has
presented his case for reinstatement to the International Amateur
Athletic Federation (IAAF) in the hope he will be allowed to
compete again.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who turns 38 in December, was stripped of his gold
medal following a positive test for the anabolic steroid
stanozolol after winning the 1988 Seoul Olympic 100 meters final
in world record time.
</P>
<P>
Five years later he was banned for life after a second positive
drugs test but the decision was overturned by a Canadian Court of
Arbitration last April. The court ruled that the Canadian
governing body had "failed to follow both IAAF procedures and its
own".
</P>
<P>
Johnson's lawyer had presented a submission to a special IAAF
sub-commission which will report to the IAAF council in Seville on

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Tugrik Rate Down Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian currency tugrik
continued the downward trend on the foreign exchange market
Wednesday, closing at 1,042 tugrik against the U.S. dollar, or
more than 30 tugrik over the rate in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the slump to government shake-up, political
instability, deepening financial crisis and the inability of some
banks to pay cash to depositors.
</P>
<P>
They also believed that the delayed disbursement of the loan
assistance from donor countries was also partly to blame for the
slip in exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Since the free floating system was introduced in 1993, the
exchange rate of tugrik has constantly declined due to a shortage
of foreign reserves. The recent drop in copper and gold prices on
the international market has led to a sharp fall in the country's
exports, a growing trade deficit and a further shrink of foreign
reserves.

BAGHDAD -- Iraq Wednesday criticized the U.N. Sanctions
Committee for blocking contracts Iraq signed with foreign
companies under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
A total of 457 Iraqi contracts worth 756 million U.S. dollars
signed under the fifth phase of the oil-for-food program are still
blocked by the U.N. Sanctions Committee, said an Iraqi Trade
Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman said in a statement carried by the Iraqi
News Agency that Iraq held American and British representatives in
the United Nations committee of responsible for hampering the
endorsement of those contracts.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the continuation of hampering the contracts
revealed the aggressive policy pursued by the United States and
Britain toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that those contracts comprise 95 for the industrial
sector and 72 for the health sector while the other contracts
cover the sectors of transport, oil, commerce, water and sewage,
irrigation, higher education and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to export limited
amount of oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the deal, the ceiling of the amount
of oil Iraq is allowed to export has been raised to 5.2 billion
dollars from 2 billion dollars for the first three phases. (Iraq-

JERUSALEM -- Israeli soldiers sealed off a divided Hebron in
West Bank Wednesday after two Jewish settlers were wounded in an
ambush possibly carried out by Palestinian militants overnight.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli soldiers imposed a curfew on the Israeli-controlled
part of the city and set up roadblocks around the city, barring
Palestinians from entering and leaving the city.

The soldiers also carried out home searches and questioned
people.
</P>
<P>
Two settlers were lightly wounded when unidentified gunmen
opened fire on them Tuesday night while they were driving through

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Pakistan Halved by Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Pakistan
slumped by 51 percent in 1998-99 due to the economic sanctions
imposed by the Western countries after its nuclear tests,
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of foreign investment declined to 403 million U.S.
dollars during the 1998-99 fiscal year from 822 million dollars in
the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Direct foreign investment plunged 37 percent to 376 million
dollars while portfolio investment fell 67 percent to a mere 27
million dollars, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain and Japan remain the leading
investors in Pakistan despite their sanctions against the country
following its nuclear tests in May last year.
</P>
<P>
But Western countries' sanctions inhibited international
financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank from providing fresh major loans to the South Asian
country.
</P>
<P>
The economic difficulties resulting from lacking of foreign aid
also kept the portfolio investors from the stock markets in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The power sector received 131 million dollars as the biggest
beneficiary, followed by mining with 69 million dollars and
chemical, pharmaceutical and fertilizers with 54 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> S. African Rand Recovery Stabilizes Money Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The South African rand
recovered on Wednesday from its sell-off earlier in the week,
serving as a stabilizer to the money market rates.
</P>
<P>
The rand gained some 8 cents against the U.S. dollar and was
traded at 6. 1380 rand per dollar from Tuesday's worst level of
6.2220 rand per dollar.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the recovery, the repo rate (central bank prime
lending rate) dipped to 13.620 percent Wednesday from 13.630
percent on Monday and Tuesday, as commercial banks under-bid for
the 12.9 billion rand (6.1 billion dollars) repos on offer after
the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) matched the estimated
liquidity requirement.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks only bid 12.435 billion rand (6 billion
dollars) for the 12.9 billion rand worth of repos on offer.
</P>
<P>
Since the liquidity requirement rose above 11 billion rand (1.8
billion dollars) on July 13 under-bidding has been frequent as the
commercial banks have run out of the collateral assets needed to
put in a bid for the SARB's repos.
</P>
<P>
Market sources said the recovery in the rand has eased jitters
that interest rates were headed higher, although they did rise
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"There are market jitters ahead of (former labour minister
Tito) Mboweni' s inauguration on Saturday, but I think they are
overdone. That is part of the reason why the rand recovered
today," one money market dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni will be inaugurated as SARB governor on August 7, after
current governor Chris Stals retires after 44 years with the SARB,
of which the last 10 years was as governor.
</P>
<P>
The first trading day after Mboweni's inauguration is August
10, as August 9 is a public holiday.

<TEXT>
<P>
EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Adham
Sharara was elected as President of the International Table Tennis
Federation (ITTF) in the ITTF General Assembly here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Following is factfile:
</P>
<P>
Sharara started playing table tennis as a young boy in Cairo,
Egypt, and immigrated to Canada in 1967, when he was still a
teenager.
</P>
<P>
He continued to improve his skills at the Chateauguay
Club, on the outskirts of Montreal. There, he began to coach young
players inlucding Mariann Domonkos, who became a 10-time Canadian
women champion. His early intention was to become a professional
electrical engineer, but soon changed his mind and decided to become
a good table tennis player.
</P>
<P>
In 1974 Sharara was a member of the Canadian contingent that
trained in Japan. Then he leaned from a famous European coach, Zlatko
Condas, how to improve several skills. When Zlatko left Canada in 1977,
Sharara had the opportunity to coach the Canadian teams at
international competitions including the Commonwealth and world
championships.
</P>
<P>
Sharara became the Technical Director for the Canadian Table
Tennis Association and in short time was promoted to the CEO
position. Up to this time his efforts and contributions were as a
volunteer. He re-organized the association with a masterplan and
developed a strategy to accelerate the functions of the
administrators and the technicians alike. He became a director for
the Canadian Olympic Association.
</P>
<P>
In 1988 Sharara was nominated to be the North American Council
member for the ITTF and seven years later he moved from Vice President
to Deputy President. He was elected as ITTF President in
one-candidate voting on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Buy Back National Debt for 1st Time Since 1972 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
said Wednesday that it is exploring buying back a portion of the
3.6 trillion dollar national debt held by the public.
</P>
<P>
In seeking ways to manage the government's finances in a new
era of budget surpluses, the Treasury Department released for
public comment a proposal that would allow it to take competitive
offers from bond holders on a voluntary basis to reduce the amount
of debt. The department said that after a 60-day comment period
they hope to establish final rules for the procedure by January.
</P>
<P>
"It is critically important that we manage the debt held by the
public as efficiently as we can in this new environment," Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The department has not bought back securities since 1972, when
a few existing bonds and notes held by the public were swapped for
new debt issues.
</P>
<P>
Because of huge budget deficits in the 1980s and early 1990s,
the national debt has exploded, climbing from less than 1 trillion
dollars to 5.5 trillion dollars currently.
</P>
<P>
Of that amount, 3.6 trillion dollars are in public hands and
the rest is held by government trust funds, the largest one being
the Social Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration last year enjoyed its first budget
surplus since 1969. And the administration and the Congressional
Budget Office are projecting continued surpluses over the next 15
years, assuming agreements to cut government spending are honored,
enough to totally eliminate the 3.6 trillion dollars in debt held
by the public in 2015.
</P>
<P>
This prospect is requiring the Treasury to explore ways to
better manage the massive Treasury securities market.
</P>
<P>
Up until now, it has been able to just reduce the size of new
borrowings rather than being required to buy back debt from the
public. But officials said they do not want to reduce current
offerings too much and believe they can save taxpayers money
through lower interest rates by buying back debt already held by
the public, much of it at higher rates than current offerings
received.
</P>
<P>
Summers told reporters that use of debt buybacks raises a
"number of complex issues that will need to be worked out."
</P>
<P>
Officials stressed that any government purchases would be on an
entirely voluntary basis. They would be done through a type of
reverse auction in which the government would announce the type of
securities it was interested in buying and accept the most
competitive bids from holders of those securities.
</P>
<P>
If bond holders wanted too much to sell their securities back
to the government, the Treasury would have the option of making no
purchases for that option.

HARARE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The allied forces fighting

<HEADLINE> Exports of India's Export Zones Up 22 percent </HEADLINE>

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Exports in India's 7 export
processing zones (EPZs) grew by 22 percent in the first quarter of
the current fiscal year compared with the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the commerce ministry, exports by the EPZs
amounted to 10.48 billion rupees (43 rupees=1 U.S. dollar) as
against 8.57 billion rupees recorded a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The EPZs are expected to achieve a total export turnover of 65
billion rupees in 1999-2000 as against 52.52 billion rupees in
1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
The impressive performance by the zones is largely due to a
series of steps taken by the commerce ministry to liberalize the
regulatory environment, focus on strengthening of infrastructure
in the zones and an improvement in the export outlook.

<HEADLINE> Germany To Keep Ban On British Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany is to keep the ban on
British beef despite the recent lifting of the worldwide ban.
</P>
<P>
British beef was banned globally in 1996 over fears of mad cow
disease. The 15-nation European Union, of which Germany is a
member, last month authorized exports to resume from August 1.
</P>
<P>
However, Germany's health minister Andrea Fischer told BBC
Radio 4's Today program that the German authorities wanted to make
sure that the UK's beef industry checks were working properly.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is also maybe in British interests that we take
some more measures of reinforcing trust in Germany in British
beef," said the German minister, a member of the Green Party.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment I think the German market is quite difficult for
British beef because people maybe would not want to buy it," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The decision -- only 48 hours after the EU's global export ban
was lifted -- shocked British farmers and provoked a frenzy of
activity in the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Elliot Morley told BBC, "If Germany is
going to unduly delay lifting the ban, then there is no doubt that
the Commission has the power to take legal action against Germany
and they have indicated they will do so."
</P>
<P>
National Farmers' Union deputy president Tim Bennett said,
"Quite frankly we are angry and exasperated by this delay. All we
are asking for is that the German consumer has the choice."

<HEADLINE> Interview: China Succeeds in Mobilizing Market Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China has been a successful
example of mobilizing market forces not only in solving the
housing problem but also making its companies internationally
competitive, a senior Sri Lankan official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Housing and Urban Development Indika Gunawardena
told Xinhua in an exclusive interview that Sri Lanka will also
mobilize market forces to solve its own housing problem.
</P>
<P>
"To develop and modernize, you have to use market forces," said
Gunawardena, who ended a 10-day tour early in July which took him
to the major Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an and
Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
It is the minister's second visit to China. He last traveled to
China in 1997 on a World Bank-funded study tour.
</P>
<P>
"China is mobilizing market forces in a very skillful and rapid
manner in developing Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "China today is a world power in construction, and
Hong Kong is very powerful in real estate development. Nearly one
third of current ongoing modern real estate construction in the
world is in China."
</P>
<P>
"As other major economies have been slowing down at this time,
China has been progressing very fast," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese companies have become major forces in financing and
implementing projects in China as well as in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, Gunawardena, on behalf of the Sri Lankan
government, proposed to the Chinese government to cooperate in
developing market-based real estate, housing and construction.
</P>
<P>
In Colombo alone, 51 percent of the city's population live in
under-served settlements such as slums and shanties but never had
the legal right to settle down in their encroachments.
</P>
<P>
Gunawardena has proposed a Sustainable Townships Program which
will rehouse all 66,000 households currently living in slums and
shanties.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, these households will get free new houses in
high-rise buildings while the ministry will get land for renewal
and future development.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 600 acres of encumbered prime land in Colombo will be
liberated to sell to developers to fund the program, Gunawardena
said, adding that Chinese companies and financial agencies are
welcomed to join the program.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese companies in Sri Lanka are doing many important
contracts," said Gunawardena, adding that they are delivering the
best quotations in tending and are very competitive.
</P>
<P>
"China has been a trusted and reliable friend of Sri Lanka," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister refuted the criticisms from other competing
companies and some funding agencies that Chinese companies are
incapable of carrying out the contracts.
</P>
<P>
"I know they are capable because I have seen what they have
done in China. The criticizers should go to China to see for
themselves," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt Agencies Prepared to Tackle Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Government agencies and state
enterprises in Thailand have made progress in tackling the Year
2000 problem, or Y2K, Minister of Science, Technology and
Environment Arthit Urairat said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There are nothing to be worried about as government agencies
and state enterprises had been making good progress in solving the
problem, the minister was quoted by the Thai News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem, or the millennium bug, is expected to hit
computers that still use two digits to represent years. There are
fears that once the year 2000 arrives, computers could mistake it
for 1900, thus causing them to produce flawed data or crash.
</P>
<P>
According to Arthit, some state enterprises, particularly those
in the energy sector, were now said to be 100 percent ready for
the bug.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
and the Petroleum Authority of Thailand among others.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri has
ordered all government agencies to submit their reports on
progress in preparation for the Y2K problem within 15 days.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Namibia Declares State of Emergency in Caprivi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) --Namibian President Sam Nujoma
declared Wednesday a formal state of emergency in the strife-torn
Caprivi Region in north-eastern Namibia following clashes between
government troops and secessionists.
</P>
<P>
Caprivi's secessionist attacked government facilities Monday
and triggered off confrontations with government troops, which
caused 13 casualties.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a statement that under state of
emergency, the security force were authorized to interrogate any
person and enter any place, search any person or place and seize
any property which could be used, among others, as evidence in
criminal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government had reportedly called on Denmark to
revoke the refugee status of Caprivi separatist leader Mishake
Muyongo and "treat him as the leader of a terrorist group".
</P>
<P>
The government accused Muyongo, who was granted asylum in
Denmark in May, of having "fled the country in order to engage in
insurrection".
</P>
<P>
According to other report, Namibian refugees at the Dukwe
refugee camp in Botswana Tuesday staged celebratory dances for the
possible suspension of their repatriation after watching fighting
between Namibian security operatives and Caprivi secessionist
rebels on television.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Hard Hit by Shortage of Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Only one in 30 new entrants
into South Africa's labor market would find jobs in the formal
sector of the economy, the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC)
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said estimations showed that 72 percent of the unemployed
were under the age of 40, and 40 percent of people older than 20
were illiterate or severely under-educated.
</P>
<P>
The study found that 30 percent of the people interviewed said
they could not get employment due to a lack of education, low
skills and inadequate work experience.
</P>
<P>
These figures were revealed in an HSRC study conducted between
October last year and January this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15 percent were aware of job creation programs, but
95 percent of the respondents were eager to participate in such
projects.
</P>
<P>
The research council said that more than half of the people
asked were willing to participate in job creation initiatives
unconditionally, while 21 percent of the respondents would first
want to know the conditions of employment.
</P>
<P>
It said 47 percent of those reluctant to participate in job
creation projects cited problems on the way the programs were
being managed, such as nepotism and not receiving wages for work
done.
</P>
<P>
About 28 percent of the respondents said a shortage of job
opportunities where they lived and too many people looking for
work constituted the main obstacles in finding a job.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,000 people were interviewed in the three
provinces with the highest incidents of unemployment -- the
Eastern Cape, Northern Province and KwaZulu-Natal -- and the three
provinces with the lowest incidents of joblessness, the Free
State, Gauteng and Western Cape.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 90 percent of the respondents were
prepared to take any job, and 84 percent of those interviewed
reported that they were actively looking for work.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that 46 percent of the women interviewed in
rural areas had worked before, compared with 54 percent of the men
in those areas. In urban regions, 61 percent of women had
previously been employed, compared with 68 percent of the men.

LONDON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The UK stock market suffered a
mixed and directionless session Wednesday, depressed by persistent
weakness in BT and other telecom stocks.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index closed down 15.2 points, or 0.2 percent, at
6,235.4 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was recording gains

British Telecom suffered from U.S. selling pressure, traders
said. A press report saying rival Telewest Communication is
expected to launch a high speed Internet service Thursday hit BT

<HEADLINE> U.S., Israel to Invest More Money for Laser Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Israel
will put more money to continue development of the Tactical High
Energy Laser weapon fur use against short-range projectiles like
the Katyusha rockets, the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense
Command said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gerda Sherrill, a spokesman for the command, said the program
has cost $130.8 million since it started in 1996. It ran into
problems with schedule delays and cost overruns that forced a
choice between halting the project or investing more.
</P>
<P>
TRW Space and Electronics Group of Redondo Beach, Calif, the
contractor for the Tactical High Energy Laser weapon, has
threatened to quit the project last spring unlest the government
put more money into it.
</P>
<P>
The contract was modified in June. And according to the
modified contract, TRW will pay half of the additional development
cost until it successfully shoots down a Katyusha rocket in flight
during field testing at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico,
while the U.S. and Israeli governments will pay the other half,
amounting to $46.6 million.
</P>
<P>
After a successful shootdown, TRW will pay one-quarter of the
remaining costs and the two governments will pay the rest.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The population of Romania is
shrinking, with birth rate plunging even deeper and mortality rate
becoming disquietly high.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's latest official statistics,
Romania's population is lower by 23.4 thousand people during the
first quarter of 1999, which lead to a negative increase of 4.2
per 1,000 inhabitants, from 2.9 per 1,000 during the same time
span, last year. Romania's population numbered 22.489 million at
the end of last year, a decrease of 37,000 from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Practically, between 1990-1998, Romania's population shrank by
700,000, the country scoring worst in Europe at many demographic
indicators.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of 1999, birth rate had dropped to
10.4 per 1,000 from 10.5 in 1998, one of the lowest in Europe. At
the same time, infant and general mortality remains quite high. In
this first quarter alone, the number of dead reached 81,087, 14.6
per 1,000, from 13.3 per 1,000, last year.
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality, the rate of children dying before their first
birthday, had dropped to 20 per 1,000 from 20.5 last year, but
remains one of the highest in Europe.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Embassies Still Vulnerable to Bomb Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Four out of five U.S.
embassies and consulates around the world are still vulnerable to
bomb attacks similar to those that blast embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania a year ago, because of their unadequate protective
measures, officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Kennedy, assistant secretary of state for
administration, said an assessment by a government commission
found that fewer than 50 of the 265 U.S. diplomatic outposts
meet the standard of a safety perimeter that would protect them
from large car bombs.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were
destroyed by car bombs, killing 226 people, including 12
Americans.
</P>
<P>
As the threat of a repeat attack continue, nearly 70
embassies had been closed for one day or more because of safety
concerns or specific threats since the bombings, said Peter
Bergin, deputy secretary of state for diplomatic security.
</P>
<P>
He said 4,000 new local security guards had been hired,
streets closed, perimeter property purchased and
counter-terrorism equipment installed at posts around the world
since the bombings.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, we've improved diplomatic security worldwide,
but there's more we will do," Bergin told a briefing.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia's leading regional leaders
and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov on Wednesday forged an alliance
aiming at winning the upcoming parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony in Moscow, Luzhkov signed papers forming a
coalition between his Fatherland party and the All Russia group of
regional leaders including the president of Russia's Tatarstan
region, Mintimer Shaimiyev.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to gaining a constructive majority in the
State Duma which will later allow the president to form his
cabinet on the basis of a parliamentary majority,'' Shaimiyev told
a news conference. The parliamentary race is scheduled for
December this year.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only way to eradicate the main cause of conflicts
between the branches of power," Shaimiyev said, in an apparent
reference to Russia's political landscape that saw four prime
ministers in the last year and a half and confrontation between
President Boris Yeltsin and the State Duma lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov, widely believed to harbor presidential ambitions, said
the new group would seek to recruit former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov. Primakov, 69, won praise during his nine-months as
premier for establishing political stability after Russia's August
1998 financial crisis. He was dismissed by Yeltsin last May.
</P>
<P>
"We have all known Yevgeny (Primakov) for a long time and
deeply respect him,'' the mayor said. "The political council of
the Fatherland movement is ready to put his candidacy at number
one in the national list of candidates for the State Duma.''
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov, a critic of the way economic reforms have been carried
out by Russia's changing governments, has said he could run for
president if he saw no other suitable candidate.

<HEADLINE> Former Deputy Minister Mastermind of Serial Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's former deputy intelligence
minister Saeed Emani was the mastermind of the serial murder of
Iranian dissidents last year, the judicial organization of the
country's armed forces concluded on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The judicial organization released for the first time a picture
of Emani, known as Eslami, who committed suicide in prison on June
19 by taking depilatory substance while taking a bath.
</P>
<P>
Emani is blamed for the mysterious deaths of leader of the Iran
Nation Party Darius Forouhar and his wife, and at least three
dissident writers in Tehran later last fall.
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy statement carried by the official Islamic Republic
News Agency (IRNA), the judicial organization said all principals
and internal agents involved in the murder have been identified.
</P>
<P>
The statement was produced on the basis of an all-out
investigation by "a group of highly specialized security
officers" under the supervision of Tehran's military court to
"identify the root cause" of the serial killings.
</P>
<P>
The investigation is still going on.
</P>
<P>
The statement detailed the design, plotting and execution of
the serial killings, and branded those agents involved as
attempting to "create crisis and insecurity in the society."
</P>
<P>
It said that five months prior to the first murder, the agents
embarked on identification of their subjects.
</P>
<P>
Documents available showed that in addition to those murdered,
other persons were also targeted for future operations.
</P>
<P>
The agents first planned a mass killing through bombing or
firing by a machine-gun at a gathering, but later changed their
mind and murdered their subjects individually in a cruel and
atrocious manner to provoke people's sentiments, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Forouhar and his wife were stabbed to death in their home.
</P>
<P>
Emami, after being arrested, admitted involvement in the
murder.
</P>
<P>
Another key agent accused said another motive behind the murder
was to provoke human rights agencies to demand permission to visit
Iran which would have been rejected and consequently Iran would
have been isolated in the international scene.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the agents had tried to wage a
mental war to blame either the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps
or the intelligence minister for the killings.
</P>
<P>
It said that 23 people were prosecuted, but a number of them
proved to have played no role in the murder were released on bail.
</P>
<P>
After six months, the inquiry showed that the Islamic system
had suffered great damage and irreparable blow, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that all information related to the case
would be offered to the public at a suitable time and that
all the data presented are based on legal documents.

<HEADLINE> Angola's UNITA Implicated in Namibian Unrest: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The rebel National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) is being implicated in
the rebel violence in the Caprivi Strip in northeastern Namibia,
South Africa's SABC television reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that 50 of the rebels, who Monday attacked
Namibian security forces in Katima Mulilo in the Caprivi, entered
Namibia from Angola, said SABC television.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, believed to belong to secessionist Caprivi
Liberation Army, launched an attack on the Katima Mulilo police
station, the nearby airport and occupied the offices of the
state-owned Namibian Broadcasting Corporation radio station.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were later suppressed by government forces. Fifteen
people were believed to have been killed in skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Mishake Muyongo, who is now in exile in Denmark,
said pressure on the Namibian government to give Caprivi greater
autonomy failed, forcing his men to take up arms.
</P>

In an interview with the SABC television Tuesday, he said
Caprivi has never been part of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Muyongo, who was former leader of Namibia's major opposition
Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, fled to neighboring Botswana last
October, days before the Namibian government claimed to have
uncovered a secessionist plot in the Caprivi. More than 100 armed
men followed him.
</P>
<P>
Muyongo was granted asylum by the Botswanan authorities in
February this year and was later resettled in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The SABC said calm returned to Katima Mulilo Wednesday with
curfew lifted and roadblocks removed and people going about their
regular business. Most government offices and businesses reopened.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Namibian government has called on Denmark to
revoke Muyongo's refugee status and treat him as a terrorist
leader, according to the SABC.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Hails Annan's Report on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday extended a welcome to a report by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, saying that the 15-nation body will "provide active
support" to the peace agreement, which ended conflicts in the
Western African country of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
Security Council, Martin Andjaba of Namibia, said, "Members of
the Council expressed their determination to provide active
support to the Lome Peace Agreement," which was signed in July
in Togo.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the Council met in a closed-door
session to discuss a report from Annan, who wants to see a bigger
U.N. presence in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation body heard the briefing by the U.N. special
representative for Sierra Leone, Francis Okelo of Uganda. The
Council president described the briefing as useful.
</P>
<P>
In his written report to the U.N. Security Council late Monday,
Annan recommended increasing a U.N. mission in Sierra Leone to 210
observers from 70 to help implement a recently signed peace accord
between the government and rebels.
</P>
<P>
A larger U.N. Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) would
be needed, depending on a division of labor to be worked out
between the United Nations and a large Nigerian-led West African
force, known as ECOMOG, that has been supporting the Sierra
Leonean Government, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the major disarmament and demobilization effort,
implementation of the Lome agreement will require substantial
numbers of peacekeepers throughout the country and the deployment
of additional U.N. military observers, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The number of UNOMSIL military observers would increase to
210," he said, adding the proposed U.N. mission would be well
above the current strength of about 50 and the authorized strength
of 70.
</P>
<P>
Once there is an understanding on the task, strengths and
mandates of ECOMOG and the U.N. special representative for Sierra
Leone, Annan said he will submit a more comprehensive report to
the Security Council.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from four
Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries are in
Lesotho to speed up the resolution of the country's political
problems, South African radio reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The four foreign ministers are from South Africa, Zimbabwe,
Mozambique and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho has still to hold elections since the unrest that led
to a SADC military intervention last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,500 South African and Botswana troops crossed into
Lesotho in September last year at the request of Lesotho Prime
Minister Pakalitha Mosisili, in a bid to restore peace and
stability after a mutiny in the Lesotho Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
The unrest followed allegations by the country's three major
opposition parties that the general election on May 23, 1998 had
been rigged in favor of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy,
which won 79 of 80 seats in parliament.

BUCHAREST, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Over 400 people have been taken
ill with meningitis since the beginning of last July in
northeastern Romania.
</P>
<P>
According to the Preventive Medicine Department in the Romanian
Health Ministry, 156 cases have been reported in Iasi county
alone. Of the 135 cases in Suceava county, 66 have been
acknowledged clinically, with the remaining 69 being diagnosed as
a combination of virosis and meningitis.
</P>
<P>
The causes of the epidemic have not been traced yet. Expert
teams of the ministry are assessing the situation on the spot, the
official Rompres news agency reported on Wednesday, adding that
Iasi and Suceava have set up an epidemic regime.
</P>
<P>
Experts at Bucharest's Ion Cantacuzino Institute and Iasi-based
Institute for Public Health collected samples to accurately assess
the diagnosis. Water samples and mosquitoes, which are believed to
carry the disease, have also been under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Meningitis has also occurred in other counties, as well as the
capital city of Bucharest. Efforts are being made to contain the
epidemic, trace the causes and treat the patients.

<HEADLINE> Research Finds Infant Under 6 Months Vulnerable to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A recent research study in Nigeria
has shown that children under six months old could suffer from
malaria, a situation which was previously considered unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
Scientists hold that children at that age and below were never
thought to have malaria parasites because it was assumed they were
protected from the disease by the immunity acquired at birth, the
Panafrican News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the study says that the discovery could assist medical
 practitioners to adequately treat infant babies who presented
vague symptoms of malaria.
</P>
<P>
The study, sponsored by the African Regional Office of the
World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the Nigeria
Institute of Medical Research, aims at ascertaining the current
trend of the malaria scourge among communities along the coastal
areas of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bamigboye Afolabi, who led a team of the researchers in
Ibeshe Island, an isolated coastal village in Lagos State, said
that about 30 percent of the 450 children seen in the first part
of the study had malaria parasite.
</P>
<P>
"This research will definitely lead to improvement in the tools
for diagnosis and treatment of malaria and its prevention," he
said. "Most importantly, it will not only reduce the severity of
the ailment among pregnant women and children, but reduce the high
mortality due to the disease."
</P>
<P>
Afolabi said that the detailed result of the study had been
forwarded to the WHO, adding that its findings could be applicable
to other parts of tropical Africa, as well as other malaria
endemic regions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 80 percent of the population of
sub- Saharan Africa are at risk of malaria.
</P>
<P>
According to Lateef Salako, Director-General of the Nigeria
Institute of Medical Research, "of the approximately 300 million
cases of malaria estimated to occur globally every year, over 85
percent are from Africa, and of the estimated two to three million
annual deaths, over 90 percent are in Africa."

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian presidential statement
said Wednesday that the World Bank has pledged to support the
country's economic restructuring programs.
</P>
<P>
James Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank, was quoted as
saying in his letter to Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo that
he was encouraged by the anti-corruption stance of Obasanjo and
ready to provide more help to the country's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said that all new World Bank financial assistance to
Nigeria would attract concessional interest rates of 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Payment of the principal will be over 35 years after an initial
10-year grace period and the terms will apply until Nigeria's
external financial position shows significant improvement, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has already offered
Nigeria a one- billion-U.S. dollar loan to help revive the economy
of the most populous African nation, dependent on agreement of a
stand-by arrangement to last a minimum of six months and maximum
of 12 months.

<HEADLINE> Most Tanzanian Public Firms Sold to Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian has sold 260
public firms to foreigners and 40 to domestic businessmen in the
privatization process, Minister of State in the President's
Office, Nassoro Malocho, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the National Assembly in central city of
Dodoma that the trend has shown that Tanzanians have insufficient
economic power to buy the parastatal institutions.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Malocho said Tanzanians
have made many bids for the purchase of parastatal enterprises
under the Presidential Parastatal Service Reform Commission, but
they often have difficulties in concluding the sales because they
don't have enough money.
</P>
<P>
Although the government is happy to see Tanzanians buy the
ailing public corporations, it is difficult to come to their
assistance, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the minister said that last year Tanzania sold 29
public firms, earning 57.38 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government had planned to divest 50 firms last year, but
sales agreement were concluded for only 29, Malocho said, adding
that the government will continue to divest the state-owned firms
through the reform commission at a rate of 50 a year.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that many firms are in the red, unable to pay
salaries to employees and have huge liabilities, which scares away
investors.
</P>
<P>
By last December, 270 out of 395 public firms scheduled for
divestiture had been sold and the remaining 125 were at different
stages of privatization.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to divest parastatal companies to create
more jobs and enhance national income.
</P>
<P>
The firms cover telecommunications, harbors, water and
sanitation, as well as petroleum refinery and railway sectors.
</P>
<P>
The government has agreed with World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund to remove 50 companies from government control
annually.
</P>
<P>
Between July 1997 and June 1998, a total of 52 companies and
nine non- core entities were divested, according to the figures
released by the Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform Commission.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises Japan's Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton said
Wednesday that the trends of Japan's economy are positive as it
recovers from its longest recession since World War II.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton also said he was not concerned about currency
fluctuations in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"In the last six and a half years, we've seen the currency
fluctuations _ they go up, they go down. I don't have anything to
comment about that," he said when answering questions during a
brief appearance after meeting his economic team at the white
house.
</P>
<P>
"I think that we do see some signs that Japan's economy is
beginning to grow and that Prime Minister Obuchi has formed a
coherent and strong and effective government, and has secured the
necessary support from the Japanese people to continue to move
forward," he told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
"So we will continue to consult with Japan about what we think
is important for their economic recovery, as we should, because
they're our partners and they're our friends and our allies and
their recovery is critical to Asia's recovery," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, who marked his first year in office last Friday, has
succeeded in pushing through a massive bank bailout and speeding
up the pace of reforms in the nation's moribund financial system.
</P>
<P>
But the ultimate measure of his administration -- whether he
can restore economic growth -- remains unclear, with recent
indicators giving conflicting signs.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. economy, Clinton attributed the sustained expansion
to his "new economic strategy founded on fiscal discipline,
investment in our people and expanded trade".
</P>
<P>
"America has come a long way in the last seven years; from
recession to recovery, from economic disorder to a fiscal house
finally in order," he said.

<HEADLINE> Barak Finishes Lineup of Expanding Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak finished the expansion of his cabinet Thursday by appointing
five new ministers from left and center coalition parties.
</P>
<P>
The 120-member Knesset, or parliament, approved the
appointments of the new ministers and eight deputy ministers by a
vote of 52-16 with eight abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Barak appointed Professor Yuli Tamir, a founder of the Peace
Now movement, as minister of immigration and absorption, making
her the second woman in the cabinet. As a Labor party member,
Tamir failed to reach a realistic spot on the party's Knesset
list in its primaries before the May election.
</P>
<P>
Former army chief of staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak of the Center
Party was appointed tourism minister. And former deputy chief of
staff Matan Vilnai, who joined the Labor Party before the
election, was named as minister of science, culture and sports.
</P>
<P>
Haim Oron of the left-wing Meretz party was named agriculture
minister. And Rabbi Michael Malchior, a member of the moderate
religious party Meimad, which formed an alliance with the Labor
party ahead of the election, was named minister in the Prime
Minister's Office for diaspora affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ousting right-wing Benjamin Netanyahu in the prime ministerial
race, Barak has managed to cobble together a coalition of seven
parties controlling 75 seats in the 15-faction Knesset, the
widest parliamentary majority in Israel in years.
</P>
<P>
He has sought to expand his 18-member cabinet, which took
office early last month, to accommodate demands of coalition
partners vying for governmental positions.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset last week approved a bill presented by the
coalition, allowing the sitting prime minister to decide the size
of his cabinet. The maximum number of cabinet ministers was 18
under the previous law.
</P>
<P>
Barak also named Arab Israeli Knesset member Nawaf Massalha of
the Labor Party as deputy foreign minister. This is the highest
position ever held by an Arab Israeli in the government.
</P>
<P>
Arabs account for 18 percent of the Israeli population, which
is about 6 million, but they have felt discriminated in every
field. Barak has been criticized for failing to break a long-time
taboo which excludes Arab Israeli from the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet expansion has spurred criticism both in the
coalition and in the opposition bloc. Critics have blamed Barak
for wasting millions of public funds in order to pay off his
coalition partners for their support in the elections.

<HEADLINE> Iran Threatens Power Against Taliban Over Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran threatened here on Thursday
to act with power if the Taliban fails to identify and punish the
killers of its diplomats and correspondent in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We will not rest until we get a satisfactory answer," Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said while speaking to the
victims' families on the first anniversary of their deaths.
</P>
<P>
Eight Iranian diplomats and a correspondent of the official
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) were killed a year ago when
the Taliban troops took over Mazar-e-Sharif, a strategic town in
northern Afghanistan, from opposition forces.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi insisted that Iran's demand of identifying and
punishing the perpetrators of the massacre should be met.
</P>
<P>
Iran was outraged by the killings last year and massed nearly
200,000 troops along the border to put pressure on Taliban, which
brought most of Afghanistan under control in the fighting with its
opposition forces.
</P>
<P>
The massing of troops "was a show of power and if the Taliban
fails to heed our demands, then we will act with power and will
force them to abide by our demands." Kharrazi was quoted by IRNA
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that through combined efforts, including international
pressure, diplomatic prowess, and display of military might on
the border, Iran had succeeded in forcing the Taliban to return
the bodies of the killed and free other Iranians who were
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
These "were great accomplishments," Kharrazi said, adding
Iran's handling of its relations with Afghanistan was prudent and
wise.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran should follow the developments in the neighboring
country carefully and stay vigilant in defending its own national
interests.

WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said
Thursday that the number of new claims for unemployment benefits
edged up last week after hitting their lowest level in two years
the week before.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department's report, 279,000 people filed new
claims for jobless benefits for the week ending July 31, up by
4,000 from the previous week. Last week's level was the highest
since July 17 when claims were at 315,000.
</P>
<P>
The four-week moving average for claims, which smoothes out
week-to-week volatility, was down a little to 295,000 last week.
That was the lowest level since March 27 when claims were at
293,750.
</P>
<P>
Last week's increase was slightly less than some economists
expected but still kept claims at a level indicating the nation's
job market remains healthy.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said Thursday that for the week ending
July 24, six states and territories reported increases in jobless
claims, while 47 had decreases. The state data lag a week behind
the national figures.
</P>
<P>
The state with the biggest increase in applications for jobless
benefits was Ohio, up 6,286, while Michigan recorded the biggest
decrease, 22,777, which was attributed to fewer layoffs in the
automobile industry.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy to Grow 2-3 Percent: Lehman Brothers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Thai economy is likely to
grow between two and three percent this year before jumping to 5.5
percent next year, Thai News Agency quoted the leading U.S.
investment bank Lehman Brothers as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lehman's projection exceeds that of the Thai government's
growth target of one percent for this year, after the economy
suffered an eight percent contraction last year.
</P>
<P>
Jasjit Bhattal, Lehman Brothers' new chairman for the Asia
Pacific region, said that the improved outlook of the Thai economy
was a result of the government's expansionary fiscal policy and
low interest rates that boosted domestic consumption and consumer
confidence.
</P>
<P>
An Increase in manufacturing production, which the company
forecast at 10-20 percent of growth this year, a rise in share
prices and stronger exports also supported the country's economic
recovery, he said.
</P>
<P>
The renowned investment bank also projected that the Thai baht
would strengthen to 33 against the U.S. dollar by the end of this
year while the stock market will continue to rise as a reflection
of the positive trends of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The company forecast Thailand's inflation this year will be
minus one percent before it moves higher to positive one percent
next year.
</P>
<P>
Bhattal also praised the Thai government for its success in
reducing short-term external debts and in acquiring continual
capital inflows.
</P>
<P>
He said that although non-performing loans in Thailand's
banking sector stood at about 50 percent it was no surprise to
investors.
</P>
<P>
However, he suggested that the Thai government continue efforts
to reform the country's banking system to reduce problem loans,
thereby encouraging banks to resume lending.

investment, tourism and joint border development on the Eighth
Thailand-Malaysia Joint Commission to be officially inaugurated
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
A plenary meeting of senior officials of the two neighbors was

SHENZHEN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Shekou Harbor, in south China's
coastal city of Shenzhen, is to open nighttime ferry services to
Hong Kong in the middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
The number of people from Shekou entering and exiting Hong Kong
in 1998 surpassed 800,000, double the figure in 1990. More
employees of foreign-funded companies in Hong Kong have bought
housing in Shekou, and need to travel frequently between the two
areas, and a nighttime ferry service will help to relieve the
congestion.
</P>
<P>
There are 24 two-way ferry trips a day between Shekou and Hong
Kong, with the last one leaving at 18:30. The two nighttime ferry
trips will operate from 18:30 to 22:30.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Holds Record Number of International Exhibitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- This, China's leading industrial
city and financial center, has sponsored a total of 63 large
international exhibitions in the first seven months of this year,
up 1.5 times over last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Shanghai Customs said the figure indicates
that his city opened a large international exhibition every three
days, on average.
</P>
<P>
The official said that, apart from traditional trade fairs and
exhibitions featuring industrial products, the international
exhibitions also covered the fields of resources, environmental
protection, insurance, nuclear industry and information.
</P>
<P>
He said the International Automobile Fair held in June alone
attracted over 300,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that the large number of international
exhibitions probably means that the other Asian countries have
begun to recover from their financial crises, and domestic
economic growth is witnessing steady growth.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that Shanghai's promotion of its economic
exchanges worldwide is another important reason.
</P>
<P>
So far, Shanghai arranges over 40 regular international
exhibitions annually, involving automobiles, computers,
electronics, telecommunications, domestic electrical appliances,
ships, flowers, advertising, food and other industries.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the boom in international exhibitions is
also encouraging the development of local transportation,
telecommunications, hotels and advertising.

<HEADLINE> Communications Circles Denounce Lee's Splittist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China's communications circles
today denounced Lee Teng-hui's "two-states" statement, accusing
him of placing new obstacles in the way of the "three exchanges"
across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Communications Huang Zhendong told a seminar that
Lee's splittist remarks have severely damaged the relations
between the two sides of the straits, and once again undermined
endeavors to push forward cross-strait exchanges of direct mail,
trade, and air and shipping services.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the direct shipping service between Xiamen and
Fuzhou ports in Fujian Province and Kaohsiung Port in Taiwan since
1997 has been widely welcomed by trade, shipping and other
business circles on both sides of the straits.
</P>
<P>
The direct shipping service has not only boosted cross-straits
container shipment, but also benefited the development of
Kaohsiung Port, which is now the third-largest container port in
the world, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
"A steady development of cross-straits relations and the 'three
exchanges' is in keeping with the fundamental interests of the
people on both sides," Huang added. "Under the principle of 'one
China', the Ministry of Communications is prepared to make
unceasing contributions to the development of the 'three exchanges
' and the peaceful reunification of China."

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia will introduce
tele-medicine (computer link treatment) by the year 2000, a
professor said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a two-day national workshop, Legesse Zerihun,
associate dean of the Addis Ababa University Faculty of Medicine,
said that Ethiopia had been selected to serve as a tele-medicine
center for East African sub- region.
</P>
<P>
Following the introduction of computer technology, Ethiopians
living in remote areas would be able to get medical consultancy
services from health centers in towns through a software link,
Legesse predicted.
</P>
<P>
He said the technology would enable health professionals
working in rural parts of the country to treat patients within
their respective areas.
</P>
<P>
Opening the workshop, Vice Minister of the Health Ministry
Lamisso Hayisso said the application of the technology in Ethiopia
would help it curb the problems of health care services it is
facing.

Ethiopia, with a population of 62 million, currently has about
100 hospitals, 3,000 medical centers and clinics throughout the

<HEADLINE> Thai Army May Shut Down Weapon Systems to Minimize Y2K Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's military forces will
shut down all computer-controlled weapon systems which fail to
pass the Y2K test before the end of this year to avoid damage or
even disaster, Deputy Army Comptroller Major General Van Anand
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Van admitted that there are delays in the upgrading of the
military's computer systems, but added that the army should not be
blamed.
</P>
<P>
"Y2K correction processes of the Armed Forces' weapons are to
be completed in time before the year 2000 starts if we have
adequate funds," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Army had given priority to fixing its flying and
satellite operations and seven other significant systems, Van
said.
</P>
<P>
Van made the remark after Deputy Prime Minister Trairong
Suwannakhiri warned that an air defense system malfunction might
cause missiles to strike civil aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Trairong said that little was known about the Defense
Ministry's preparedness for the Year 2000 problem and that 65
percent of state agencies had yet to report their progress in
updating computer systems to overcome the problem.
</P>
<P>
Problems are feared at the turn of the new year, because
computer programs written to recognize only the last two digits of
the year might read the digits "00" as 1900 instead of 2000,
causing disruptions from food delivery to power and water
distribution and banking services.
</P>
<P>
The government, especially the Budget Bureau, has been asked to
allocate more funds to government agencies to solve the problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan
Mudenge Thursday condemned Namibian guerrilla leaders fighting for
the independence of the remote Caprivi region.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge told the Zimbabwe News Agency that the actions by the
guerrillas were not acceptable because Namibia was a sovereign
state.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly condemn the actions because they are threatening a
country' s integrity and sovereignty. We will never support
that," Mudenge said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe would continue to support the Namibian
government since it was the only recognized government in the
country.
</P>
<P>
About 100 guerrillas led by secessionist Mishake Muyongo
attacked a military base and a television station Monday in
Caprivi's capital Katima Mulilo, killing 15 people in a
street-by-street fighting before being suppressed by the Namibian
army, the news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Muyongo was a senior member of the ruling Swapo party during
its exile years but he was expelled from the party in 1980 after
being accused of plotting to topple the Swapo leadership under
current President Sam Nujoma.
</P>
<P>
Caprivi, a 400 km sliver of land wedged between Angola and
Zambia to the north and Botswana to the south, is home to about
100,000 of the country's 1.6 million population.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Angolan ambassador to the United
Nations said Thursday that the Angolan Government has made a
"positive endorsement" for the UN presence in the southwest
African country.
</P>
<P>
Afonso Van-dunem made the statement in an interview with the
National Radio of Angola, announcing that the Angolan government
has delivered a letter Wednesday to UN Secretary-General Koffi
Annan, "expressly notifying the decision of the government."
</P>
<P>
Van-dunem added that some issues on UN's "physical presence" in
Angola are currently discussed.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador stressed that the Angolan government has been in
favor of a "not so big" UN presence, in correspondence with the
reality of the situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government, then considering UN as a shield for the
 rebellious National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), demanded a pull-out of the United Nations Observer
Mission in Angola (MONUA) in January, when the government troops
encountered some setbacks in battle fields in the central
provinces of Huambo and Bie.
</P>
<P>
MONUA formally pulled out from the var-torn country on March 1.
 Meanwhile, the UN expressed a will to maintain a mediatory
organization in Angola.
</P>
<P>
But the Angolan government insisted that this kind of
organization should be established in New York, where the UN
headquarters locate.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Inspects Rescue Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada on Thursday inspected the ongoing rescue and relief work
at a landslide-hit subdivision in Antipolo city, central
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"It's very unfortunate but I'd like to acknowledge the help,
the response given by the people of Antipolo. The assistance
extended by the people here shows that in times of crisis,
Filipinos help each other," he told reporters after the
inspection.
</P>
<P>
The president said he is considering granting assistance to
victims who paid for their houses which were destroyed in the
disaster, Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The disastrous landslide which happened Tuesday night at the
Cherry Hills, Antipolo of Rizal province, hit a subdivision,
killing 26 people, devouring 50 houses and leaving more than 50
buried in the debris -- feared to be dead.
</P>
<P>
A committee charged with tracing out the root cause of the
landslide has been established, mandatory to submit its report to
the Philippine president within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
The subdivision was allegedly built on a patch of loose ground
at the foot of the hill, also a construction jeopardizing the
environment in the surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
"This is a lesson to all of us, that before we give a permit,
we see to it that all kinds of requirements will be complied with.
We have to preserve our mountains," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that he would meet Friday with officials of the
Housing and Urban development Coordinating Council to discuss the
terms of payment.

BANGKOK, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan Thursday urged the members of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to express their
opinion on the world future development.
</P>
<P>
Surin, briefing the diplomatic corps in Thailand on the
preparations for the 10th UNCTAD, asked the members to present
their blueprint for the world development in the next 50 years to
the headquarters of UNCTAD in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will host UNCTAD from February 12-19 next year, which
will be the first global conference of the 21st century and the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The conference will review progress made in the past 50 years,
set developmental strategies for the next 50 years into the 21st
century, consider a design for the new global financial
architecture and equitably integrate developing and least
developed countries into the international economic system, Surin
said.
</P>
<P>
Two historic documents, the Bangkok Declaration and the Bangkok
Plan of Action, will be signed at the end of the conference.
</P>

ULAN BATOR, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The recent state visit to
Mongolia by Chinese President Jiang Zemin is of historic
significance for promoting the development of relations between
the two countries in the 21st century, Mongolian President
Nachagyn Bagabandy said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with outgoing Chinese Ambassador Qi Zhijia,
Bagabandy said that developing good neighborly relations with
China is a top priority of his country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The president said he is satisfied with the all-around

Treaty on Friendly Relations and Cooperation and the 1998 Sino-
Mongolia Joint Statement.

<HEADLINE> International Conference on Security Ends in Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A three-day international
conference on security in a changing world ended here on Thursday,
calling for international cooperation based on new concept of
international security.
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed that with the change in international
situation and the disappearance of the "bipolar" world, a new
concept of security unlike that during the Cold-War era has
appeared.
</P>
<P>
They held that the concept of international security today
covers not only military security but also a range of other issues
such as economy, the environment, population, transnational crimes,
drugs and epidemic diseases.
</P>
<P>
These issues are difficult to be tackled by a single nation,
they noted, but require concerted efforts of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Chinese delegate Pang Sen said at the conference that the
international community must have a new concept of security if
they want to safeguard security. They should first of all abide
by the objectives and principles of the U.N. Charter, particularly
the five principles of peaceful coexistence that govern the
relations between nations.
</P>
<P>
They must also respect the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of different countries and in particular refrain from
intervening in the internal affairs of other nations and resorting
to force to settle international conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He said that security can not be secured by expanding military
alliances or intensifying arms race. The proper way to safeguard
security is to strengthen international cooperation and dialogues,
enhance mutual understanding and trust and solve differences by
peaceful means, he added.
</P>
<P>
About 60 delegates from the United Nations and more than 30
countries, including China, Russia, the United States, France and
Britain, attended the conference, which was jointly sponsored by
Mongolia and the United Nations.

BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A service network has been set up
in China for the first time, offering prompt service in paying
medical fees and other services for its members.
</P>
<P>
The network, set up by the Orient Zhongbao Science and

<HEADLINE> China Maps Out Judicial Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 5 (Xinhua)-- China will take steps to promote
judicial reform in the next five years in an effort to ensure the
sound functioning of the people's courts and accomplish the
strategic goal of establishing "the rule of law."
</P>
<P>
China's top judge, Xiao Yang, revealed the draft plan here
today at a forum attended by presidents of the country's higher
people's courts.
</P>
<P>
The plan touches upon the reform of trial procedures, court
restructuring, the improvement of the people's jury system, and
supervisory mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The overall objective of the reform is to create a fair, open,
effective, honest and well-functioning judicial system, train
qualified judges and perfect the socialist judicial system with
Chinese characteristics, said Xiao, president of the Supreme
People's Court.
</P>
<P>
The reform should be based on the three principles of upholding
the Chinese Communist Party's leadership, the People's Congress
system, and the integration of the country's judicial system, Xiao
said.
</P>
<P>
The top judge stressed that the reform encourages bold steps in
accordance with the Constitution and laws, and opposes judicial
independence and supremacy, which exist in many Western countries.
</P>
<P>
"Court reform represents a major part of China's reform of the
judicial system and political restructuring. The essence of
judicial reform is judicial fairness, which is crucial to the
country's rule of law," he said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Sets Up Economic Surveillance System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) has set up an economic surveillance system
designed to avert future financial crises and encourage the
members to reform their economies.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, ministers and officials of the ASEAN members
would exchange data and share opinions on economic trends and
macroeconomic policies in the region, ASEAN Secretary-General
Rodolfo Severino said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A unit in the ASEAN Secretariat was established early this year
to manage the process, with support from the Asian Development
Bank (ADB), in which a counterpart unit operates, he told
reporters in Pulau Pinang, northern Malaysia, after the opening of
a regional conference on a common currency for East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian national news agency Bernama quoted him as saying
that data and analysis collected by the unit would be forwarded to
ASEAN financial ministers to look at and they would seek ways to
prevent economic crises in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
The unit and the ADB earlier issued the first report which
included measures to stimulate finance, protect the poor, mobilize
additional resources for economic recovery and improve the
reformation of the financial sector. It will issue another report
sometime in September, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the common currency for ASEAN, Severino said ASEAN has taken
steps to cooperate in the financial area short of creating a
common currency and has been encouraging the use of ASEAN
currencies in the settlement of intra-ASEAN trade.
</P>
<P>
This is to be done largely through bilateral payment
arrangements and Malaysia and the Philippines have concluded one
such arrangement while others are under negotiation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that to have an ASEAN currency, the regional economies
have to be sufficiently integrated, rivalries and mutual
suspicions lingering from history have to be overcome and
questions of sovereignty have to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's leaders have called for the development of capital
markets in the region so as to reduce ASEAN's dependence on
developed countries, and have decided to cooperate in improving
the regulation and transparency of the financial system.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 participants comprising academicians, researchers,
policymakers, representatives of governmental and non-governmental
organizations from ASEAN countries, China, South Korea and Japan
are attending the three-day conference.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Urged to Advocate Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Falun Gong cult took
advantage of people's desire for good health to spread
superstition and defraud people, including women. With the
deepening struggle against Falun Gong, more women now have a clear
understanding of the true purpose of this illegal organization,
and have broken away from it, a Xinhua commentator said today.
</P>
<P>
The Falun Gong incident makes us realize that it is an
important duty of women's organizations to help women improve
their overall quality and establish a right viewpoint, which is
also a long-term task for Chinese women's activities, the
commentator points out.
</P>
<P>
"Women should arm their minds with scientific theories and
knowledge, and play key roles in advocating science and fighting
against superstition," continues the commentator.
</P>
<P>
Science is always opposite to superstition, and attitudes
toward science and superstition can decide the fate of a nation.
Only by advocating a scientific spirit can we improve our overall
national strength and provide a solid base for a socialist system
with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"Women's fate is always closely connected with that of their
country," notes the commentator. The two decades since China's
opening to the outside world proves that women emancipated
themselves only by having confidence in the leadership of the
Communist Party, Marxism, and science.
</P>
<P>
It is the ultimate role of women to uphold science and break
away from superstition, and also their glorious mission.
</P>
<P>
Women account for half of China's population, and are a vital
force for pushing forward economic development and social progress.
</P>
<P>
The commentator points out that women play an irreplaceable
role in families. "If every family can employ a civilized and
healthy lifestyle, and reject all superstition, all of society
will form an atmosphere which will advocate science and reject
superstition."
</P>
<P>
The All-China Women's Federation issued a circular recently
calling on all women to take action and break away from Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the diligent, brave, and intelligent Chinese
women have enthusiasm to study modern science, uphold modern
culture, and make contributions to the country's bright future",
the commentator concludes.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Postpones Repatriation of Alien Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign workers in 18 types of
businesses in Thailand's 37 provinces are allowed to work in the
country for three more months before being replaced by local
labors, Labor and Social Welfare Minister Wuth Sukosol announced
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
About 86,000 alien workers are eligible to extend their working
service in Thailand thanks to a recent cabinet resolution, the
Thai News Agency quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the 90-day extension period starting from Thursday,
governors and employment officers in the 37 provinces are
requested to launch fact-finding missions to seek first-hand
information on the employment situation of the alien workers.
</P>
<P>
Alien workers may be allowed to work after the 90-day period
expires provided that their employers report to provincial
authorities that their businesses are shunned by Thai workers and
the claim is verified, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Since the financial crisis in mid 1997, Thailand has been
trying to alleviate the worsening unemployment situation by
repatriating alien workers and replacing them with local ones.
</P>
<P>
However, few local laborers were willing to take the relatively
harder-working and less-paid jobs, like carrying rice packs. In
August last year, the government had to postpone the repatriation
of foreign laborers for one more year till August 4 this year.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 200,000 Thais have come up to register at
provincial employment offices, who can then replace alien workers
to be repatriated after the three-month postponement, Wuth said.
</P>
<P>
He added that illegal alien workers, if arrested, would be
immediately and unconditionally sent back to their home countries
after August 4.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 2 million people in Thailand are
out of job as a result of the two-year-old financial and economic
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Euro-Zone Economic Confidence Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s 11-
country euro-zone showed clear improvement in business and
consumer confidence in July this year, a survey published on
Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
The consumer confidence indicator rose in the euro-zone in July
while remained constant in the 15-nation European Union as a whole,
said the survey conducted by the EU's executive branch, the
European Commission.
</P>
<P>
"This can to a large extent be attributed to the important
improvement observed on the consumer confidence in most countries
and to the fact that consumers are more optimistic about the
general economic situation in the future," the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Confidence in the industrial sector rose consistently in both
the euro-zone and the EU, following the positive trend beginning
in March, said the survey, noting that France, Italy and Germany
in particular contributed to this improved situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, capacity utilization in industry maintains a similar
level with the two previous quarters, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Managers expect the capacity constraints to decrease
appreciably and the outlook for new orders and exports is
optimistic, it said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the construction confidence indicator was
stable for the EU and slightly increased for the euro-zone,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey also pointed out that there have been less
optimistic data from other countries, especially from Italy,
Greece and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the survey concluded that the economic confidence
indicator for July shows a significant increase for the euro-zone
and a slight improvement for the 15-member EU region.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Judge New NATO Chief by Deeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Thursday that it would
take further foreign policy steps toward NATO and its new
secretary-general, George Robertson, after judging them "by their
concrete deeds."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said Moscow
regards Robertson's appointment as an internal affair of the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
He said Robertson is well known in Russian military-political
circles mainly due to contacts with him when he was the British
defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Russia already noticed Robertson's
statement on the importance of a business-like relationship
between NATO and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment Russian-NATO cooperation is limited to
international peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and Bosnia while
all other spheres of cooperation remain frozen," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
As for the future of Russia-NATO contacts, he said Moscow
speaks of "straightening out relations under certain conditions,"
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Moscow "wants primarily that the Yugoslav tragedy connected
with the military operation of the alliance in the Balkans never
to be repeated, that new dividing lines will not be drawn in
Europe as a result of the implementation of NATO enlargement plans,
that the alliance fully takes into account our lawful interests
and concerns and strictly follows the provisions of the Russia-
NATO founding act," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming Robertson's statement on the importance of
ties between NATO and Russia, Moscow was concerned by his
announcement that NATO's eastward enlargement will be the
cornerstone of his work as the political leader of the alliance.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition Claims Big Gains in Counter Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan opposition Thursday
claimed to have recaptured half of the area they had lost and
inflicted heavy casualties on the ruling Taliban militia in a
dramatic overnight counter offensive.
</P>
<P>
No comment from the Taliban was available.
</P>
<P>
Opposition spokesman Abdullah (only one name) said their forces
recaptured Jabul Saraj, Charikar and Gulbahar north of the capital
Kabul in a surprise strike on Wednesday night and Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
At least 250 Taliban fighters were killed while dozens of
prisoners were taken, said Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
However, General Sayed Husain Anwari, a commander from the
Harakat-i-Islami faction of the northern opposition alliance,
alleged that between 400 and 500 Taliban troops were killed in the
surprise offensive.
</P>
<P>
Among the 250 dead were large numbers of Arabs and Pakistanis,
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdullah, the opposition troops had moved out of
the heavily fortified Panjsher valley late Wednesday night and
taken Gulbahar near the western entrance of the valley before
advancing west to the Northern Highway at Jabul Saraj.
</P>
<P>
After taking Jabul Saraj at 8 a.m. Thursday local time, they
moved southwards and circled around Charikar and cut the exit
route before taking the capital of Parwan province at around 10:30
a.m.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban were asleep when we moved in," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan opposition forces were now at the crossroads of the
New Roads and the Old Roads to the west of the strategic Bagram
air base, some 50 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The opposition said it expected to recapture the Bagram air
base soon which was now under attack from two positions.
</P>
<P>
In a separate operation, opposition troops attacked the town of
Nejrab, to the south of the Panjsher valley, from the province of
Kapisa, sources from Kabul said.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan sources said the Taliban also lost a substantial
number of men in these battles.
</P>
<P>
Controlling nearly 90 percent of Afghanistan, the Taliban
launched the long-awaited summer offensive last Wednesday and
captured a number of strategic points like Nejrab, Bagram,
Charikar and Jabul Saraj during the past week.

<HEADLINE> Pavarotti to Hold Concert in Bucharest on Eclipse Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The famous Italian tenor
Luciano Pavarotti is to hold a concert in Bucharest on August 11,
the total solar eclipse day.
</P>
<P>
"It was not at all difficult for me to make up my mind and come
to Romania and I am quite delighted I am to hold a concert in
Bucharest," the famous Italian tenor told the local Ziarul
Financiar Daily on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was not only this impressive phenomenon that made Pavarotti
give up his holiday and come to Romania but also the fact that "
the Romanian musicians are very talented and generous and the
Romanian audience are warm and open."
</P>
<P>
The Italian tenor also praised the strong cultural and social
ties between Romania and his country and was touched with the fact
the Romanians spoke Italian very well. Pavarotti loves Romania for
another reason --- it creates great musicians and soccer players.
</P>
<P>
To build a high stage where Pavarotti is to sing, more than 230
tons of metal are to be used by around 200 workers to put up the
whole scaffolding. As many as 22,000 chairs will be set there,
and 16,000 of them will be specially bought for this concert, seen
as a great musical event.
</P>
<P>
The Eclipse on August 11 can be best seen from Romania's
territory, although it is to be visible from no less than 16
countries. The Eclipse's climax will be also in Romania, nearby
southern town of Ramnicu Valcea.
</P>
<P>
The Eclipse will attain its widest visibility stripe measuring
about 112 km. Bucharest is to be the only capital city in the
world right in the middle of the eclipse's shadow stripe.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM to Visit US Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit is expected to pay an official visit to the United States
in September.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources here said Ecevit will hold talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton and other top U.S. officials on the
situation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. has dispatched warplanes to bombard the facilities in
northern Iraq from the Incirlik Air Base in Adana, southern
Turkey, since the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Their talks will also focus on the Cyprus issue and the need
for improved relations between Turkey and Greece, both members of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
U.S. National Security Council Spokesman David Leavy has said
that "resolving Cyprus is a key priority for the administration,"
and Washington is encouraged by both sides' willingness to hold
negotiations this fall.
</P>
<P>
After a call by the group of seven most industrialized
countries and Russia (G8) issued in June, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan appealed to Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas to resume the deadlocked
Cyprus talks in October in New York.
</P>
<P>
Denktas has been insisting that the Cyprus talks, which has
been stalled since 1997 with the start of accession talks between
Cyprus and the European Union (EU), could resume only on a
state-to-state level -- a demand tantamount to asking for
recognition of the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, who was then the Turkish prime minister in 1974,
ordered the Turkish troops to invade Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, during Ecevit's visit to the U.S., the two leaders
will also discuss the situation in the Balkans and the growing
role of Turkey in the region.

<HEADLINE> EU: "Yellow Rice" to Prevent Vitamin A Deficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Thursday that scientists for a project funded by the European
Union (EU) has created a kind of "yellow rice" which will help
prevent severe vitamin A deficiency in countries relying on rice
as a staple food.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive body said that under the so-called "Carotene
plus" project, scientists have succeeded in modifying rice through
genetic engineering to make it produce beta-carotene which is
converted to vitamin A by humans.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the carotene content, the rice turns yellow.
This kind of rice can be considered as a functional food -- a new
category of food products providing specific health benefits, the
commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The rice contains enough beta-carotene to meet total vitamin A
requirements in a typical Asian diet, it added. It means that
Asian countries would benefit from the rice in their bid to
prevent vitamin A deficiency.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that vitamin A deficiency is a public health
problem in 118 countries. It not only causes xerophthalmia, the
leading factor of childhood blindness in developing countries, but
also has broader consequences in terms of child morbidity and
mortality by leading to greater susceptibility to various diseases
such as respiratory infections, diarrhea and measles.
</P>
<P>
Between 140 and 250 million pre-school children are deficient
in vitamin A worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.

<HEADLINE> Better Donor System Urged for Kidney Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- More people in Canada than ever
before are suffering from kidney failure, prompting renewed calls
for bettering the country's "fragmented" donor transplant system,
a newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Canadian Institute for Health Information, the "
National Post" said that the dialysis population is rising by up
to 14 percent a year, a 200 percent increase since 1981.
</P>
<P>
Only 14.4 donors per million Canadians donate their organs, in
contrast with 31 donors per million in Spain, the newspaper said,
adding that the number of Canadians on the waiting list for a
kidney transplant exceeds 2,800, at a growing rate of 12-14
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Kidney disease is reported to become the sixth leading cause of
death in Canada, with a daily average of eight new patients
diagnosed with renal failure.
</P>
<P>
"Elderly patients accounted for most of that increase," the
institute sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statistics put pressure for the establishment of a Canadian
transplant network, covering donor consent, determination of brain
death of donors and national standards for tissue safety, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Health Minister Allan Rock is expected to make a
decision on a national program in September in response to a
Commons committee report on organ and tissue donation tabled in
April, according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Warns of Danger of Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 5 (Xinhua)-- Indonesian president B.J. Habibie
Thursday warned the public of the danger of forest fires resulting
from the El Nino weather phenomenon which is now occurring
according to shorter cycles and accompanied by prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
In the past, El Nino was happening once every 30 or 50 years
but now it is doing so at a higher frequency, Habibie said in
Samarinda, capital of East Kalimantan province, Antara news Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said that at least 99 percent of forest fires occurring
in Indonesia were man-made with 33 percent of them caused
specifically by burning cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
He urged the people to learn a lesson from these facts and act
more responsibly to prevent forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Reports said smoke from forest and plantation fires has begun
to darken the skies over some parts of Riau in Sumatra and
Kalimantan islands in Indonesia since the dry season began in
July.
</P>
<P>
In Pekanbaru, provincial capital of Riau province, smog became
thicker Wednesday, causing visibility in the city to drop to only
100 to 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
Some experts said this year's forest fires may be bigger than
that in 1997 when forest fires raged in many parts of the islands
of Sumatra and Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 fires destroyed about 5 million hectares of forest in
the country with an economic loss of about 4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
East Kalimantan Governor Suwarna Adulfatah said the weather
phenomena in 1997-98 had caused 520,000 forest fires and 124,000
hectares of crop failures.
</P>
<P>
In addition, in 1999, there were 48,250 families in East
Kalimantan still living under the poverty line, he said.
</P>
<P>
According another report, the Japan International Cooperation
Agency has sent a team to help put out the forest fires raging in
Riau.

The French leader said in Paris while meeting the visiting
Nigeria's Kaduna State Governor Ahmed Makarfi for the various
policies put together in the state which would have a spill-over
effect on the growth of the Peugeot Automobile Nigeria (PAN)
plant, a French-Nigerian joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper reported Thursday that
PAN Managing Director, Francis Gouyon, who performed a decoration
ceremony Wednesday at the State House, said: " The president of
the French Republic and French ambassador to Nigeria have
mandated me to carry out an unusual diplomatic assignment.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, in his speech, commended the level of cooperation
received from successive governors and administrations in the
state, "culminating today in a democratically-elected governor
helping to sustain Nigeria's auto manufacturer, PAN."
</P>
<P>
Chirac also stated that an award had been decided by the French
 authorities "in recognition of what the governor and the Kaduna
State Government have done to assist a French-related industry,
PAN."
</P>
<P>
The award, the Legion d'honneur title was established in 1803 by
Emperor Napoleon and was originally awarded to distinguished
warriors for valour on the battle field. It was later extended to
deserving individuals whom France wanted to recognize
exceptionally at home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Legislation on Voluntary Service by Youngsters Passed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
Guangdong Provincial People's Congress today passed legislation
detailing stipulations for voluntary service by young people.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, titled "Regulation on Voluntary Service by
Young People of Guangdong Province," is the first of its kind in
China. The regulation will become effective as of September 20,
said local sources.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, young volunteers should be aged
between 16 and 35, and should first be registered in young
volunteers associations set up in various localities.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary that young volunteers be identified by the
organization they represent before they provide volunteer services.
Youngsters aged 16 to 18 are encouraged to offer up to 100 hours
of volunteer service.
</P>
<P>
Young volunteers associations will also bear civil
responsibility in cases of any damages caused by the young
volunteers from their associations, and compensation for
deliberate or major damage can be recovered.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, those with a history of voluntary
service will be given priority in employment and enrollment for
advanced studies.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, in the forefront of China's reform and opening-up
drive, was one of the first regions in the country to institute
voluntary service.
</P>
<P>
One million young volunteers in this south Chinese province
have offered voluntary services ranging from major events and
poverty relief in the countryside to neighborhood labor since 1987,
when Guangzhou, the provincial capital, opened a hotline for
middle school students by which young teachers were made available,
free of charge, to help troubled middle school students.

<HEADLINE> China Kicks Off National Survey of Petroleum Products Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China has formally launched a
national survey of the quality of petroleum products processed by
small refineries.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Administration of Petroleum and Chemical
Industries (SAPCI), the small refineries being checked are those
with an annual crude processing capacity of less than one million
tons. The products quality inspection of the first group of
refineries, including 57 small refineries, began on August 2 and
is scheduled to last until the end of September. The second group
to be examined will include 23 refineries, and that inspection is
expected to be completed before the end of October.
</P>
<P>
An official with SAPCI said that during the inspections, the
quality of major petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel,
asphalt, solvent oil, and lubricating oil, will be checked in
compliance with State standards. Those found to be producing
substandard products will be closed down.
</P>
<P>
The survey is being conducted by the Center for Petroleum
Quality Inspection which operates under the China Petrochemical
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
This national survey is part of China's move to create a
regulated petroleum product distribution sector to replace the one
which has long been plagued by products of inferior quality. The
closing down of substandard refineries will, on the other hand,
help build a more competitive petrochemical industry, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China had 166 small refineries,
accounting for 75 percent of the national total. However, their
combined crude processing capacity was 30.8 million tons a year,
making up less than 12 percent of the country's total.

</P>
<P>

Finance have appropriated 117 million yuan and over 9,000 special
tents for disaster relief.

<HEADLINE> HK to Build Asia's Key Trade Information Internet Web-site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC) has launched a multi-million dollar campaign to
build Asia's key trade information Internet web-site, in a bid to
help Hong Kong become Asia's cyber trade hub.
</P>
<P>
In his address to a seminar on small and medium-sized
enterprises Thursday, Victor Fung, chairman of TDC, said Hong Kong
is now faced with a major challenge to replicate in cyberspace,
the current gateway function Hong Kong provides for trade in the
physical world.
</P>
<P>
"Just as Hong Kong handles 40 percent of all physical trade
moving to and from the Chinese mainland, so must we strive, in the
future, to handle a significant share of the world's 'cyber trade'
with the mainland," Fung noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the TDC has invested 180 million HK dollars (23 million
U.S. dollars) in upgrading its IT infrastructure -- putting in
place more sophisticated computer systems and software.
</P>
<P>
In the past couple of years, the TDC moved market intelligence
and economic information to the web site, and opened online trade-
matching services to global participation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's ability to compete in this new world will depend
on how successfully we leverage, in cyberspace, our existing
skills as the chief intermediator of trade and investment in Asia,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the TDC will offer strategic links to other key
sites in Hong Kong and the region, making it more attractive for
global business partners to enter Asia's cyberspace through Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We will expand and deepen the market intelligence we gather
from TDC's global network of 50 offices," he said. "We will
liberalize access to our database of trade contacts and liberalize
our fee structures, so that customers will no longer pay to use
our standard Internet-based services, including trade inquiries."

<HEADLINE> Canadian Farmers Reported on Brink of Worst Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Canadian farmers say they're in
for the worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s
because of sluggish commodity prices, high expenses and wacky
weather, CTV said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The farmers appeal for government support while federal
agricultural officials say that they are not there to bail out the
farmers, who are suffering drought in the east and excessive rain
in prairie, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture demanded
Ottawa and the provinces commit to developing a permanent disaster
assistance program to avoid a rural meltdown.
</P>
<P>
Bob Friesen, president of the federation, warned at a news
conference "Canada is going to lose a lot of farmers, a lot of
jobs and see many of its rural communities disintegrate over the
next five years without a firm commitment of long-term support."
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada has warned that net farm income will be cut
by almost half this year, dropping to 1.78 billion Canadian
dollars (about 1.19 billion U.S. dollars), as compared to an
annual average of 3.33 billion (about 2.23 billion U.S. dollars)
between 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
A national safety nets advisory committee was reported to look
into the issue at meetings slated for Thursday and Friday in
Ottawa.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Kills 23 in S.Lanka as Emergency to be Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Defense Ministry said
Thursday that 23 people were killed in fresh clashes between
government troops and Tamil rebels, as the state of national
emergency is set to be extended by another month.
</P>
<P>
A special task force truck was blasted on Wednesday by a female
suicide bomber of Tamil rebels near the northern town of Vavuniya,
the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said 14 people were killed in the explosion,
including 12 military personnel, one civilian and the suicide
bomber. Another 25 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday in northeastern Trincomalee District, rebels of
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) exploded a claymore mine,
killing one civilian and injuring six others, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The army killed eight rebels in separate clashes in the north
of the country, it said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte asked
parliament Thursday to vote to extend the state of national
emergency by another month following the recent attacks on
civilian and military targets by LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
The extension of emergency regulations is set to be passed,
since the government has the required number of votes in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting since 1983 for a Tamil homeland in
Sri Lanka's north and east, have been blamed by the government for
carrying out a suicide bomb attack which killed leading Tamil
lawmaker Neelan Thiruchelvam in Colombo last week.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Parliament President Asked to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- By an unanimous vote, Nigerian
House of Representatives Wednesday asked Senate President Evan
Enwerem to step aside, for an unimpeded probe of allegations of
stealing currently dogging his heels.
</P>
<P>
The heat on the Senate president also intensified, with a call
by Alliance for Democracy (AD) that he resigns, reported the
Guardian, a Nigerian Newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Allegations were made in the latest edition published this
week's Tell, a Lagos based magazine, saying that the Senate
president was convicted for stealing in 1945 while serving as a
revenue clerk under the British colonial government and variously
falsified his age for public office.
</P>
<P>
Enwerem has consistently denied the allegations and described
it as part of a campaign to "bring me down and ridicule the
office".
</P>
<P>
Like a replay of political currents that swept former House of
 Representatives Speaker, Alhaji Ibrahim Salisu Buhari from
office, representatives Wednesday held that because the National
Assembly's integrity was at stake, Enwerem will do well by
allowing his deputy, Alhaji Haruna Abubakar, preside over the
Senate's affairs "until the grave allegations are cleared."
</P>
<P>
Besides, the legislators directed the committee on ethics and
privileges; national security and intelligence; judiciary, human
rights and legal matters to investigate and ascertain the truth of
the matter and submit its findings to the house within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Members held a closed door session for one and a half hours
Wednesday before the house began formal proceedings. A member said
it was to enable the legislature address "emergency house
matters" and tighten loose ends on the motions on notice.
</P>
<P>
Moving the motion for Enwerem to step aside, Hon. Adams Jagaba
(Kachia/ Kagarko; Kaduna) prayed the house to consider the option
"in view of the allegations leveled against the Senate president
in the current issue of Tell magazine, which not only question the
integrity of the National Assembly, but can also endanger the
political life of this administration."
</P>
<P>
The legislator argued: "We are our brother's keepers in the
National Assembly," saying the House needed to demonstrate
considerable concern in whatever is happening in any of the
legislative houses.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's motion was amended upon the insistence of some
legislators, led by Hon. Nduka Irabor (Ika; Delta) to include the
investigation of "all other (similar) matters within a reasonable
time."

<HEADLINE> Nepali Carpet Export to U.S., Britain Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's carpet export to the
United States and Britain increased markedly in fiscal 1998/99,
raising hopes that these two countries would become potential
export markets for Nepalese carpet in the future, the Kathmandu
Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said data compiled by the Carpet and Wool
Development Committee show that carpet export to the United States
and Britain grew by 26.3 percent and 24 percent respectively in
the 1998/99 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Germany remained the largest consumer of Nepal-made woolen
carpets and imported nearly 2 million square meters of woolen
carpets in the year, accounting for 76 percent of Nepal's total
export.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain consumed only 9 percent and 3
percent of the total export respectively. Belgium was the third
largest export destination for Nepal's carpets, taking 4 percent
of the total carpet export.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, Austria and the Netherlands are other major buyers
of Nepal's carpets.
</P>
<P>
Diversifying export destinations is a long cherished dream of
Nepali carpet exporters. With the rising export growth to the
United States and Britain, Nepali carpet exporters and
manufacturers are one step further near this goal, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Woolen carpet has remained the largest exportable item of Nepal
for the last decade. During 1998/99, carpet export earned over 149
million U.S. dollars for Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Karachi Stocks Down 2.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KARACHI, Pakistan, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Karachi stocks plunged
Thursday by 2.26 percent due to the news that the chief of Hub
Power Company (Hubco) was leaving Pakistan without holding any
meeting with the government officials.
</P>
<P>
The news depressed the market which resulted in panic selling
as people felt that the power tariff dispute between the largest
private power producing company and the government will need
longer time to resolve, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The 100-share price index of Karachi Stock Exchange plummeted
by 28.62 points to 1,234.24 points from Wednesday's 1,262.86
points.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Article Refutes "Two States" Statement (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A signed article today refutes
Lee Tenghui's "two states" statement claimed by Taiwan authorities
to be a combination of continuity, pragmatism, and creativity.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities claims that there has been no change in the
island's policies towards the Chinese mainland, a claim even
Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui himself might not believe in, says the
article, written by Hong Fan.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that at the end of the 1980s, when Lee just
assumed office, he emphasized that "One China is the supreme
principle." By February 1991, Taiwan authorities began defining
cross-Straits relations as "One China, two equal political
entities."
</P>
<P>
After Lee redefined cross-Straits relations as "state-to-state"
on July 9, some political dignitaries in Taiwan echoed this by
claiming that the "two states" statement is "a major change in
policies" and "just a beginning."
</P>
<P>
The article points out that Lee Teng-hui has been marching
forward on the road of splittism, and that the "two states"
statement only exposes the fact that Lee continues with separatism.
</P>
<P>
Lee's "two states" statement has aroused great indignation
among Chinese worldwide, and has been criticized by many countries.
Even pro-Taiwan U.S. congressmen said they could not support
Taiwan's provocation, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of the "peaceful reunification and one
country, two systems" principles, cross-Straits trade and
personnel exchanges have been expanding, and political dialogues
have been underway.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Report: Sanctions Severely Affect Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 5 (Xinhua) -- An international report has
revealed that the mortality of Iraqi children under five exceeded
12.2 percent due to the nine-year U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the U.N. Children Fund said malnutrition of
mothers caused a birth rate of under-weight infants at more than
23.8 percent last year, the Iraqi News Agency reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that 14.7 percent of infants suffer from
malnutrition diseases, 11.7 percent from chronic malnutrition and
8.2 percent from acute malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the embargo caused an increase of congenital
deformity, infection diseases and high fever due to shortage in
necessary treatment.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that so many Iraqi families are always
worried about how to feed their children because food provided
under the oil-for-food program covers needs of the Iraqi people
only for 20 days every month.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to export limited amount of
oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
The embargo deprived the Iraqi children of enjoying the widest
opportunities of education and practicizing their games and
possessing books compatible with their mentalities and physical
capabilities, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said the social care programs in Iraq have suffered from
many hardships in the past nine years due to the U.N. sanctions
imposed the country following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The 1991 Gulf War and the continuation of embargo led to the
destruction of a number of state orphanages and several
educational and nutritional services offered by the social care
institutes, the report added.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Article Criticizes Li Hongzhi's Fallacies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the "
People's Daily", will carry a commentator's article tomorrow to
further criticize the fallacies of Li Hongzhi, head of the illegal
organization Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Li has used two important methods to run the Falun Gong cult
and its organizations which include poisoning practitioners' minds
with fallacies and controlling practitioners through various
levels of organization, the article points out.
</P>
<P>
Though the fight against the Falun Gong cult has mitigated the
bad effects of the fallacies of Falun Gong or Falun Dafa, the
pernicious influence of Li Hongzhi and his fallacies is still
alive among some of his followers, and needs to be eradicated, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
The article stresses that we should help those who are still
following the fallacies of Li Hongzhi including some Communist
Party members, cadres and intellectuals, to analyze how they went
astray, find the ideological reasons for this, and provide them
with education and instructions accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The process of refuting the fallacies of Li Hongzhi is also a
process of promoting education in Marxist materialism and atheism,
and the basic principles and guidelines of the Chinese Communist
Party, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The fight against Falun Gong will not only help the Falun Gong
practitioners, but the Chinese people as a whole to improve their
political awareness and their immunity against fallacies all kinds.
</P>
<P>
Party organizations at all levels should recognize the
importance and difficulty of the serious ideological and
theoretical combat against Falun Gong, and try to improve Party
members' ideological and theoretical studies.

<P>
However, Lee's statement has cast a heavy shadow over relations
across the Taiwan Straits. Stock markets in Taiwan have plunged
and polls show a sharp decline in Lee's popular support in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We see no pragmatism in Lee's statement, but rather the
cheating side of the Taiwan authorities," the article says. They
argued that the mainland treated Taiwan as "a renegade province,"
which forced them to respond with the "two states" statement. "
This is purely nonsense," says the article.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan officials claim that in cross-Straits talks, the
mainland belittled them with the concept of One China. "They are
actually making a false charge," the article says.
</P>
<P>
"We have to admit the 'creativity' in Lee's 'two states'
statement. Regrettably, Lee's desire is not to create happiness
for the Taiwan people, but rather to bet the security and
happiness of 21 million Taiwan people on this dangerous splittist
game," it notes.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin said that under the principle of "One
China," the two sides can talk about anything. But the Taiwan
authorities argued recently that only when "two states" relations
are defined, can the two sides do that.
</P>
<P>
This kind of creativity is tantamount to a formal declaration
that the door to "peaceful reunification" has been closed. "We'd
like to admonish Lee Teng-hui that it is in your best interests to
restrain yourself in your perverse acts of 'creativity' and the
abnormal inflation of careerism," the article concludes.

<HEADLINE> HK Youths to Attend Dragon Project for New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong youths will join the
mainland Chinese young people in demonstrating their determination
and commitment to meet the challenges of the new millennium
through the "Dragon at the Great Wall" project.
</P>
<P>
Jointly organized by the All-China Youth Federation of China
and "Dragon at the Great Wall" Hong Kong Committee, and sponsored
by the Home Affairs Department and the Hong Kong Federation of
Youth Groups, the Dragon project is one of the major events to
celebrate the advent of the new millennium, which happens to fall
on the Year of the Dragon, the most auspicious of the 12 signs of
the Chinese zodiac.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the large-scale youth project at a press conference
Thursday, Secretary for home affairs David Lan said: "With the
approach of the Year of the Dragon, it is particularly timely to
organize the 'Dragon at the Great Wall' project in 2000. As it not
only signifies the unity and solidarity of the Chinese youth, but
also provides a vision into the new millennium which would help
prepare for the future development of the youth."
</P>
<P>
The project comprises three parts, namely the Dragon Dance at
the Great Wall, the Youth Conference on Meeting the Challenges of
the New Millennium and the Dragon Foundation.
</P>
<P>
In February 2000, 10,000 Chinese youths from the mainland, Hong
Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas will gather to raise a 10,000
foot long dragon at the Ba Da Ling section of the Great Wall. It
is expected to set a new world record which will be televised live
around the world.
</P>
<P>
The Youth Conference, also to be held in February 2000, will be
attended by Chinese participants from the mainland, Hong Kong,
Macao, Taiwan and overseas to identify the trends of global
development in the next century, paying special attention to
issues that directly affect young people.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the "Dragon at the Great Wall" project, a variety of
spectacular and colorful celebrations will be organized from
December 1999 to mid-2000, including the Millennium Extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Extravaganza will kick off on New Year's Eve and
continue throughout the night to early hours of the New Year's Day
at Hong Kong's Happy Valley Race Course.
</P>
<P>
One of the highlights will be an impressive pyrotechnic
display. The 1,400-meter long pyrotechnic display, which might
gain a new entry in the Guinness Book of World Records, will light
up the whole venue to mark the beginning of a new era for the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region.

<HEADLINE> Change or Not, Lee Teng-hui's True Separatist Nature (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Under strong criticism from
Taiwan and the rest of the world for his "two states" remark, Lee
Teng-hui has repeated that the Taiwan authorities have not changed
their mainland policy, a point also echoed by Koo Chen-fu in his
recent written speech.
</P>
<P>
But if it is true that the Taiwan authorities have not changed
their mainland policy, why did Lee hastily make his "two-states"
statement, which is only one step away from betraying the country
and has greatly hurting the hearts of the Chinese people, said a
Xinhua News Agency commentator today.
</P>
<P>
The commentator said social practice is the standard by which
to judge whether the policy is changed or not. Anyone who knows
the relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits can
perceive that Lee Teng-hui kept changing the "one China" policy,
running in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee has not changed in his attempt to sperate Taiwan
from China and create "two Chinas," as well as destroy the
development of the cross-Straits relationship, said the
commentator.
</P>
<P>
Lee definitely expressed a "one China" policy during the first
news conference after he assumed office in February 1988. But he
began to deviate from this principle in May 1990, when he said "
one country, two governments are the reality."
</P>
<P>
In February 1991, Lee defined the relationship of the two sides
of the Straits as "one China, two political entities." During a
talk with Japanese writer Shiba Ryotaro at the end of March 1994,
Lee said openly that he would build "a state of Taiwanese."
</P>
<P>
In a book published this May, Lee Teng-hui put forward the idea
of separating China into seven parts. On July 9, he said that
cross-Straits relations should be "state-to-state" or at least "
special state-to-state relations."
</P>
<P>
This statement has unveiled his true separatist attempt. People
can perceive that Lee has all along intended to abandon the "one
China" principle.

<TEXT>
<P>
The "two-states" remark is one step on Lee Teng-hui's
separatist road, and it indicates a fundamental change in Taiwan
authorities' "one China" principle, said the commentator.
</P>
<P>
The form of Lee's mainland policy and destruction of cross-
Straits relations was changed somewhat, but his separatist nature
has not changed. For a long time, Lee advocated a series of
separatist ideas to damage cross-Straits economic and trade
development, deny the exchange of postal service, trade, and air
and shipping services, and control personnel exchange between the
two sides of the Straits.
</P>
<P>
In brief, Lee's aim, attitude, stand and methods in interfering
with cross-Straits relations have not changed for years, according
to the commentator.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Lee has supported "Taiwan independence" in the
name of establishing "democratic politics." At the same time, he
ganged up with anti-China forces in Western countries to realize "
Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
Lee set his mind on adjusting military strategy and localizing
the army. During the 11 years since Lee took office, his attempts
to create an "independent country" have been constant, the
commentator said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities have changed the content of the "one China"
principle over and over again, and their mainland policy has been
changed to bring about the separation of China.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue has existed for 50 years, and all Chinese,
including those in Taiwan, can distinguish who is developing cross-
Straits relations and promoting the reunification of China, and
who is destroying these efforts.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan authorities intend sincerely to promote the
dialogue between the Association of Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits and its Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchanges
Foundation, it must abandon the separatist road with the "two-
states" statement at its core, and maintain the "one China"
principle, which is the political basis for the peaceful
reunification of China, the commentator concluded.

<HEADLINE> Overuse Of Groundwater Causing Subsidence In North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The excessive use of
groundwater in north China has caused depressions in the land in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
A provincial water control official says that 11 such "funnels"
have been found not far beneath the surface of the earth in Hebei
Province over 9,000 sq.km. of ground. The water table has been
sinking at an annual rate of one to two meters since the 1980s,
causing further depressions over some 30,900 sq.km. of land.
</P>
<P>
Water shortages get most of the blame for this situation, as
Hebei has 17 billion cubic meters of usable water, compared with
an average annual demand of 20 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The falling water levels may cause the ground to crack, sink
more, and ultimately cave in. So far, more than 200 crevices have
been found on the plains of Hebei, some running for thousands of
meters and as deep as ten meters.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials say this situation is dangerous, and point
to the past when sinking ground damaged buildings, drainage
systems, and dikes.

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive index fell down
by about 43 points Thursday on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) due
to heavy bull unloading despite fresh purchases from Foreign
Institutional Investors.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-30 share sensitive index opened firm at 4,669.78, to
the intra-day high of 4,688.99.
</P>
<P>
However, bulls later resorted to unloading their long
positions, adversely affecting the sentiment and as a result, the
sensex dropped to a low of 4,588.96 before closing at 4,601.19 as
against Wednesday's close of 4,644.07, netting a loss of 42.88
points or 0.92 percent.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-100 index dropped by 18.23 points to 2,018.20 from the
previous close of 2,036.43.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 and the Dollex were quoted remarkably down at
459.26 and 176.18 compared with the previous close of 463.28 and
177.89 respectively.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Urges Parties Concerned to Expand Positive Factors on Korean Peninsular Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Qian Yongnian
urged here Thursday the parties concerned to strive to expand
positive factors, minimize and remove destabilizing factors so as
to bring the Korean Peninsula closer to stability.
</P>
<P>
"Positive and destabilizing factors coexist on the peninsula,"
Qian, who chairs the current five-day meeting, said in the keynote
address to the sixth plenary session of the Four-Party Talks on
the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from China, the United States, the Democratic
Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Republic of Korea (ROK) initiated
the Four-Party talks in Geneva in late 1997 to discuss the
establishment of a peace regime on the Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
As positive factors, Qian recalled, the DPRK and the U.S. have
maintained their dialogue and contact, and the DPRK and ROK have
recently resumed their talks at the vice ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
"Although no progress has been made in the talks, the frank
exchange of views itself on relevant issues between the north and
the south is useful for better communication and understanding,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, "the destabilizing factors on the
peninsula warrant our attention," adding that the standoff between
DPRK and ROK warships on the Yellow Sea in June, which escalated
to armed clash and caused casualties, put the peninsula under
great tension once again.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that relevant parties could learn useful
lessons from the current situation on the peninsula, strive to
expand the positive factors, minimize and remove destabilizing
factors so as to bring the peninsula closer to stability," Qian
said.

<P>
EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Damien
Eloi played an extremely aggressive game to beat Chinese star Wang
Liqin convincingly at the world table tennis championships here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 21st-ranked Eloi, known for playing well in the clutches,
handed a 21-13, 21-18, 21-17 defeat to the player hailed as
champion-elect by Chinese media.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua was so angry with Wang's loss that
he billed his best student as a "choker".
</P>
<P>
"How could he play like this? His brain must have got stuck," Cai
said.
</P>
<P>
Wang could not cope with the whirlwind at the other end of the
table as Eloi blasted winner after winner and finally hit yet
another brilliant forehand on match point to enter the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
Wang stormed out of the court after the match and begged Shanghai
reporters not to interview him at this moment. Wang is also from
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"I am not in the mood for interview, please leave me alone," Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
Later Wang told reporters that he could not find rhythm during the
match and his poor returns to Elois' serves cost him dearly.
</P>
<P>
Eloi's forehand attack is as strong as his mentality. He had
stretched Chinese star Wang Tao to five sets in the 1995 world
championships, and extended the Chinese to 29-29 in the 1995 world
championship team final which was won by China.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus edged out Dutchman Danny
Heister to join defending champion Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden in the

<HEADLINE> CAAC Blasts Lee Teng-hui's Splittist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The General Administration of
Civil Aviation of China (CAAC) today blasted Lee Teng-hui of
Taiwan for his splittist remarks.
</P>
<P>
"Lee's 'two-states' statement has severely undermined relations
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits," and "endangered the
motherland's peaceful reunification," CAAC officials said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that there is only one China in the world
and Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's sacred territory. "
Though the two sides have not re-united, Taiwan's status as part
of Chinese territory has not changed at all," they said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Chinese mainland has made unremitting
efforts for the relaxation of relations between the two sides and
the promotion of the process of eventual peaceful reunification of
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Civil aviation circles on both sides of the Straits have also
contributed greatly to this effort in order to realize direct
flight between the two sides at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Lee's "two-states" statement has seriously undermined the basis
of contacts and exchanges between the two sides, hurt the feelings
of the entire Chinese nation, and cast a heavy shadow over the
realization of "three exchanges": exchanges of direct mail service,
trade, air and shipping services, the CAAC said.
</P>
<P>
It is the general wish of the entire nation to solve the Taiwan
issue, realize the "three exchanges," and bring about the eventual
peaceful reunification of the motherland, they noted.
</P>
<P>
"We call on our counterparts in Taiwan to contribute to the
maintenance of and adherence to the 'One China' principle, and to
the promotion of the process of eventual reunification of the
motherland," they said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Inflation Remains at 5.7 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' year-on-year
inflation rate stood at 5.7 percent in July, unchanged from the
previous month, mainly due to lower food prices, the National
Statistics Office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The July figure brought the country's inflation rate in the
first seven months of this year to 8 percent, well within the
government target range of 8 percent to 9 percent for the whole
year, the office said in a report issued here.
</P>
<P>
"The inflation rate for food alone moved down to 3.2 percent in
July from 3.3 percent in June. Lower rates were posted in the
prices of rice, 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent; cereal preparations,
3.9 percent from 4.5 percent; dairy products, 3.3 percent from 3.4
percent..." the office said.
</P>
<P>
The office noted that the rates for housing and repairs slowed
down to 9.3 percent in July from 9.6 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it said, the rates increased for services to
11.1 percent in July from 10.7 percent in June, and fuel, light
and water rose to 5.7 percent from 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the office, the country's month-on-month inflation
in July rose by 0.2 percent, compared to 0.8 percent registered
for June.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of the Philippines said that the unchanged
year-on-year inflation rate in July has reinforced its position
that there is more room for interest rates to fall.
</P>
<P>
At present, the central bank's overnight borrowing rates have
been lowered to 9 percent and 11 percent respectively, the lowest
in the last two years.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Meets Congolese Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Monday met Congolese rebels of the Congolese Rally for Democracy
(RCD - Goma faction) in the rebel stronghold of Goma, rebel
sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
''It's true we had fruitful discussions with the Ugandan
president,'' Moise Nyarugabo, RCD Vice-President, told Rwanda News
Agency in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
He said that RCD officials explained to the Ugandan president
the process in which former RCD leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba was
removed from power and replaced by Emile Ilunga.
</P>
<P>
''He seemed to be convinced by our explanations. We handed him
documents relating to Wamba's removal and we hope that they will
be examined seriously,'' Nyarugabo further said.
</P>
<P>
''At the end of the discussions, we noted that President
Museveni had been given a false report,'' Nyarugabo underlined.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been supportive of Wamba since he was ousted from
power in May 1999. Wamba continued to claim to be the legitimate
leader of the rebel movement and contended with his rival for the
signing of the Lusaka cease- fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The RCD officials said they were ready for endorsing the accord
once the issue of Wamba whom they say represent only himself and
not the movement will have been solved.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a Zambian delegation led by the
Minister in Charge of Presidential Affairs, Eric Silwamba, is
expected in Goma and Kisangani where it will investigate on the
balance of power between the so- called Goma and Kisangani
factions.

BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China strongly resents and firmly
opposes a recent bill submitted by a few U.S. congressmen in
support of "one China, one Taiwan" and "the independence of Taiwan,
" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao here today.
</P>
<P>
In response to a journalist's question, Zhu said that the
Chinese side has already made a serious representation with the U.
S. government concerning that bill, and has urged the U.S. to take
concrete actions to prevent its passage.
</P>
<P>
"China demands that the U.S. congressmen immediately stop their
actions of interfering in China's internal affairs and infringing
upon China's sovereignty and territorial integrity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu described the bill as "a serious infringement of China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, a gross interference in
China's internal affairs, and an open provocation against all the
Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that "there is only one China in the
world. The government of the People's Republic of China is the
sole legitimate government representing China and Taiwan is an
inalienable part of the Chinese territory," adding that this is
universally acknowledged by the international community, including
the U.S. government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Australian Scientists Fight Against Mice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua)-- Scientists from China and
Australia will cooperate in a campaign against mice, which will
greatly benefit agricultural and stock breeding in both countries.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was signed recently between the Wildlife and
Ecology Institute of the Australian Common Wealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organization (CWSIRO) and the Institute of
Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Their
collaboration will focus on the development of a bacteria that
will sterilize mice.
</P>
<P>
The patterns of disasters caused by mice and their forecasting
also will be studied. Scientists indicate that this joint effort
will greatly contribute to the fight against mice in both China
and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Mice can cause great damage to agricultural and stock breeding
anywhere in the world. In China, about 24.7 million hectares of
farmland and 37.3 million hectares of pasture are destroyed by
mice every year, causing the loss of 10 billion kilograms of grain
and 20 billion kilograms of herbage.
</P>
<P>
Plagues caused by mice frequently occur in India, Pakistan, and
several countries in Southeast Asia, while in China, more than 100,
000 people are affected by epidemic diseases caused by mice each
year.
</P>
<P>
Experts indicate that the use of chemical poisons to deal with
these problems is not effective in the long run, and can cause
environmental pollution. So the development of a mice-control
bacteria has drawn some attention all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Zoology of the CAS began research on mice DNA
in 1995. And the Wildlife and Ecology Institute under Australia's
CWSIRO has achieved a breakthrough in developing a bacteria to
control house mice.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Oil States Demand More Revenues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Commissioners of finance from
Nigeria's oil producing states Wednesday called for the federal
government to feed back at least 50 percent of the oil revenue to
their states.
</P>
<P>
The commissioners, who started a meeting in Benin, a southern
city in the oil-rich west African nation at the weekend, also
called for the constitution of the revenue mobilization,
allocation and fiscal commission, reported the Guardian, a
leading Nigerian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to them, pursuant to section 162 of the 1999
Constitution which came into effect on May 27, accruals to oil
producing states on the minimum 13 per cent derivation should take
effect from the same date.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the comparably small part these
states get from the oil income contributes to the poverty and
social unrest in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The communique issued at the end of the meeting by Finance
Commissioners of Rivers state Ngozi Amahr, Akeodi Oyaghiri, Clem
Ehebha of Edo and their colleagues also decried the level of
unemployment and other social vices in the oil producing areas,
describing these as clear indication of lack of infrastructure in
these areas.
</P>
<P>
The commissioners asked the government to practice true
federalism but lauded the decision to wind up the Petroleum Trust
Fund (PTF) and the Oil Minerals Producing Areas Development
Commission since these agencies did not live up to their billing.
</P>
<P>
On the Niger Delta Development Commission, they urged the
government to ensure that its membership, management and control
are exclusively drawn from the Niger Delta area.
</P>
<P>
Finance commissioners from the states of Imo, Rivers, Edo,
Ondo, Delta and Abia attended the meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- As heat waves hit many parts of
China this summer, the Tibetan Plateau is experiencing pleasant,
cool weather, blue skies, and fresh air.
</P>
<P>
According to the local weather bureau, the temperature in Tibet
has been remained between 10 and 20 degrees centigrade since the
beginning of the summer due to the plateau's high altitude and
plentiful rainfall.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, temperatures in Beijing and other parts of
northern China have been as high as 40 to 42 degrees centigrade,
causing many people to suffer from heatstroke.
</P>
<P>
Lots of rain this year has make the plateau much greener this
summer, and even the usually barren hills have turned green,
making it easier for livestock to thrive in the grasslands.
</P>
<P>
The pleasant temperatures have also attracted more tourists
from home and abroad, particularly from inland cities.
</P>
<P>
"It's so nice to go out and enjoy nature here. In Beijing, I
just stay in my air-conditioned room all day long," one visitor
from the capital told Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> Howard Confident of Republic Referendum Being On Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Thursday played down chances that the country's republic
referendum could be delayed if the Labor Party and the Democrats
Party tried to change the wording of the question.
</P>
<P>
Howard told reporters that he expected more talks on the issue
with the Democrats but remained confident that the referendum
question would pass through parliament in time.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to keep my word on that and if anybody tries to stop
me keeping my word, well, it will be on their head, not on mine,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The only people who can stop me doing that is the Senate and I
don't think it will do that," he added.
</P>
<P>
An all-party committee has recommended that the referendum
question spell out how a president will replace the queen as the
head of state.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats will hold a party room meeting on Monday to
formalize their stand. The Labor Party is expected to support the
revised question.
</P>
<P>
The parliament has to agree with the form of the question by
the end of next week for the referendum to go ahead on November 6.
</P>
<P>
Howard also repeated earlier comments that he was not concerned
that several ministers, including Treasurer Peter Costello and
Industrial Relations Minister Peter Reith, continued to disagree
over the republic move.
</P>
<P>
"As individuals, my ministers, senior or otherwise, have a
right to express their views," he said.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Repeats with Correction China Chairs Sixth-round Talks on Korean Peninsula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Qian Yongnian
opened the sixth plenary session of the four-party talks on the
Korean peninsula here Thursday by expressing hope that the current
round would result in substantive development.
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the sixth plenary, Qian said in the keynote
address that much progress has been made since the representatives
of China, the United States, the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) and the Republic of Korea began to discuss the
establishment of a peace regime on the peninsula in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the five previous plenaries and the three preparatory
meetings, the parties elaborated their respective positions on
tension reduction, establishment of peace regime and realization
of lasting peace and stability on the peninsula, set up two
subcommittees for the purpose and held useful discussions on
substantive issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he noted, the progress has been falling far
short of the aspiration and expectation of the peace-loving people
in the region and around the globe.
</P>
<P>
"It is still far from reaching the talks' ultimate objectives,"
Qian said. "What is more worrying is that in the process of the
talks, incidents of military conflict have cropped up from time to
time on the peninsula, adding new destabilizing factors there."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Criticizes BBC, VOA for Destabilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
strongly condemned the activities of the Hausa services of the BBC
and the VOA, describing both stations as "agents of
destabilization and enemies of our nascent democracy".
</P>
<P>
Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity,
Doyin Okupe, expressed the anger of the government against these
stations on Wednesday in Kaduna, northern Nigeria, according to a
New Nigerian report on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said, "it is unthinkable that these, otherwise respectable
organizations, should allow themselves to be used so readily by
those who want to destabilize Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
Okupe, spokesman for the presidency, said that "we are
convinced that these stations are deliberately out to create
anarchy in the country."
</P>
<P>
It was unfortunate that rather than assisting the nation in the
 difficult tasks ahead, the Hausa broadcasts created and
propagated confusion and give access only to those who fanned the
ember of ethnicity and religion, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The normal ideals of journalism, which encourage fairness and
balancing of the views, should be respected, the spokesman said,
but there is lack of balance in BBC and VOA Hausa news programs.

SHANGHAI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign banks are now allowed to
handle Chinese yuan-based business in China's Jiangsu, Zhejiang,
Guangdong and Hunan provinces, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, a spokesman with the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank
of China, the country's central bank, announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Restrictions on the use of the yuan in interbank lending and
the organizing of consortia by foreign banks have also been
loosened, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Previously, foreign banks could only deal in the yuan in the
cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen, on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
Local experts called this move a new step by China toward
opening its financial sector to the outside world, adding that it
also provides good business opportunities for overseas banks.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, there were 253 representative offices
of overseas banks and 173 operational overseas banking
institutions in China, with aggregate assets of 34.2 billion U.S.
dollars.

PARIS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- According to a survey published on Wednesday by the state
statistics and economics study institute INSEE, the morale of
French households has reached its highest in 12 years. The French
consumers showed in the monthly survey made in July that they are
confident about employment, financial situation and the capacity
of saving money.
</P>
<P>
-- Belgium has been greatly moved by an open letter found on
the two young Guineans who were killed by coldness during their
flight to Europe in a landing train of an Airbus of the Belgian
Sabena air company early this week. The two teenagers, Yaguine
Koita and Fode Tounkara, appealed to the "excellent misters, the
members and leaders of Europe" to help Africa out of war, disease
and poverty.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- George Robertson, a 53-year-old Scottish Highlander, was
nominated on Wednesday with unanimity by the council of
ambassadors of the 19 NATO member countries to be the new
secretary general of the alliance. Robertson, a protege of British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, won the post because of his
intransigent and unconditional support to the "Lonely Ranger"
operation against Iraq and the NATO operation over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
-- Eritrea has been heavily enrolling women into its army in
the fratricide war with Ethiopia. Women, who now make up 30
percent of the Erytrean army, have been forced to fight in the
trenches in the civil wars of Ethiopia in the past 30 years,
including the war against the regime of Mengistu, "the red Negus,"
which led to the independence of Eritrea in 1991.

</P>
<P>
Any person could fax information directly to the country's
president by the two numbers during 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on any day of
the week, the Presidential Secretariat said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Bribery Commission which was set up with wide-ranging
powers to investigate allegations of corruption proved to be
unduly slow, completing only five investigations in a period of
three and a half years," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said the commission had also failed to prosecute
successfully a single case of corruption between December 1994 and
August 1997.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the commission has now been embroiled in
internal problems which have paralyzed all its actions.
</P>
<P>
As an interim measure, the government has decided to let the
public directly inform the president of any suspicion or knowledge
of corruption at any level of public authority in the country,
including ministers, deputy ministers, members of parliament,
public officials, the armed forces and the police.
</P>
<P>
The fax machines will be maintained under strict security
conditions and the information received will be treated strictly
and confidentially, the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientists to Conduct Tests During Solar Eclipse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists will carry
out a host of experiments during this millennium's last total
solar eclipse (TSE) on August 11.
</P>
<P>
Among the experiments, the Indian Institute of Astrophysics
(IIA) in Bangalore would conduct one to know why solar corona is
many times hotter than the sun's surface, a fact that is puzzling
scientists for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
"The experiment will be carried out at a place 400 kilometers
away from Teheran in Iran where the duration of totality is about
two minutes and the sky is expected to be the best," IIA Director
Ramanath Cowsik said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A highly sophisticated instrument indigenously developed by the
institute was set up at Teheran a week ago and scientists were now
fine-tuning it, he said.
</P>
<P>
The instrument, called imaging photometer, will be used to
probe the solar corona, the upper rarefied solar atmosphere which
becomes visible around a dark sun during the TSE.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Deny Surrender of Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Congolese rebels fighting to
remove President Laurent Kabila from power have dismissed reports
that over 1,000 rebels surrendered to government forces in Katanga
Province in southeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
''This is absolutely false, no such massive surrender took
place,'' said Commander Jean Pierre Ondekane, deputy president of
the main rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), who
told Rwanda News Agency in a telephone interview from the rebel
stronghold of Goma Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ondekane accused Kabila of capitalizing on lies all along the
one-year old conflict as a weapon to boost the morale of his
forces.
</P>
<P>
''This is mere propaganda by Kinshasa aimed at hoodwinking the
national and international opinion about the course of war,''
Ondekane underlined.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Kinshasa had also claimed that 3,000 rebel soldiers
had surrendered to loyalist forces in Kabila's home town of
Manono, in Katanga.
</P>
<P>
The RCD rebels had refuted the claims and said that only 41
prisoners of war out of 250 captured early in the fighting had
vanished in villages while they were being evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Ondekane strongly condemned the bombing of areas under Jean
Pierre Bemba' s control which allegedly claimed over 500 lives.
</P>
<P>
''This shows what kind of a man Kabila is. He is an outlaw who
never respects his word,'' he said, adding that the RCD will only
trust the leaders of countries who signed the Lusaka cease-fire
agreement, and not President Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Lee's Remarks Victimize Cross-Straits Trade, Economic Cooperation: Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Shi Guangsheng, minister of
foreign trade and economic cooperation (MOFTEC), said here today
that Lee Teng-hui's "state-to-state" remark has hurt trade and
economic cooperation across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Shi said at a seminar attended by a dozen mainland trade
officials, trade experts, and leaders of major export companies,
that cross-Strait trade and economic cooperation has become a
victim of Lee's remark.
</P>
<P>
"Lee Teng-hui's 'state-to-state' statement has severely
undermined the social stability and economic development of Taiwan,
as it has worsened cross-Strait relations and intensified the
situation," Shi said. "As a result, booming economic cooperation
and trade across the Straits have been victimized."
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that the "one China" principle is the
basis and prerequisite for all exchanges between the two sides of
the Straits, including economic and trade sectors.
</P>
<P>
It is the common understanding of people in both places that "
reunification benefits both while splitting harms both," Shi noted.

<HEADLINE> Lee's Remarks Victimize Cross-Straits Trade, Economic Cooperation: Official (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "state-to-state" or "special state-to-state" remarks by Lee
have greatly damaged the healthy development of cross-Strait
relations, and therefore have been opposed by many people in the
industrial and commercial sectors of Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Lee to stop immediately all splitting remarks and
actions, while pledging that all legitimate rights and interests
of Taiwan investors on the mainland will be protected "whatever
the circumstances."
</P>
<P>
The mainland will continue to adopt pragmatic and flexible
measures under the "one China" principle to promote cross-Strait
economic cooperation and trade, and to encourage Taiwanese
investment on the mainland, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cross-Straits trade volume was 147.6 billion US dollars between
1979 and June 1999, at which time the number of Taiwanese-invested
companies established on the mainland had reached 42,653,
involving 42.8 billion US dollars in contractual volume and 22.6
billion US dollars in realized volume.
</P>
<P>
The mainland remains the most favored place for investment from
Taiwan, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Other trade officials and entrepreneurs said at the seminar
that the past 20 years have proved that the development of trade
and economic cooperation across the Taiwan Straits is in accord
with the tide of history and the common interests of the people in
both places.
</P>
<P>
They said that any backward trend in cross-Strait economic
cooperation and trade should be stopped.

<HEADLINE> China Chairs Sixth-round Talks on Korean Peninsula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Qian Yongnian
opened the sixth plenary session of the four-party talks on the
Korean peninsula here Thursday by expressing hope that the current
round would result in substantive development.
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the sixth plenary, Qian said in the keynote
address that much progress has been made since the representatives
of China, the United States, the Democratic Republic of Korea (
DPRK) and the Republic of Korea began to discuss the establishment
of a peace regime on the peninsula in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the five previous plenaries and the three preparatory
meetings, the parties elaborated their respective positions on
tension reduction, establishment of peace regime and realization
of lasting peace and stability on the peninsula, set up two
subcommittees for the purpose and held useful discussions on
substantive issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he noted, the progress has been falling far
short of the aspiration and expectation of the peace-loving people
in the region and around the globe.
</P>
<P>
"It is still far from reaching the talks' ultimate objectives,"
Qian said. "What is more worrying is that in the process of the
talks, incidents of military conflict have cropped up from time to
time on the peninsula, adding new destabilizing factors there."

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Expected to Grow 6.6 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in China's consumer
goods market is expected to grow by some 6.6 percent this year,
according to a report released today by the State Administration
of Internal Trade (SAIT).
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that retail sales of the whole society in the
first six months registered an increase of 9.9 percent in real
terms adjusted for deflation.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shouzhong, an SAIT official, said that the market situation
will be much better in the latter half of this year, as the market
enters a traditionally more brisk season, and government measures
to stimulate the economy, such as expanding investment, boosting
exports, and increasing incomes, begin to take effect.
</P>
<P>
Although the oversupply situation of most products remained
basically unchanged, sales of household electric appliances,
garments, food, telecommunications products and automobile
products still kept a hefty growth, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
Sales of these products will increase by a larger margin in the
latter half of this year, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
The report also reveals that the total sales of major
department stores in China hit 41.95 billion yuan, up 8.8 percent
from the same period last year. This was the first time since 1997
that department stores outpaced overall retail sales.
</P>
<P>
Chain stores continued to maintain an upbeat growth momentum
during the period. Currently, the number of chain stores in China
exceeds 1,500, and their sales surged in the first half by 31.7
percent over the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's King to Visit Lebanon for Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Abdullah Bin Hussein
is expected to make a two-day visit to Lebanon on September 14 to
seek ways of advancing the Middle East peace process, Lebanese
foreign ministry sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The king will hold talks with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud,
House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Salim Hoss over the
prospects of the peace talks between Arabs and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
His visit carried "special significance" in light of the
imminent resumption of peace negotiations under Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak who has promised to resume all tracks of peace
talks during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
The king will also discuss the resettlement of Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon with Lebanese leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has publicly rejected the resettlement
of the estimated 360,000 Palestinian refugees in the country for
fear the delicate sectarian balance would be disturbed.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Syria are among the countries that host a total of
nearly 4 million Palestinians who had fled their homeland since
the establishment of the Jewish state in 1948.
</P>
<P>
In addition to political issues, the two countries' leaders
would examine ways to bolster cooperation in various spheres, the
sources added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Animated Film Welcomed in Chinese Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- "Lotus Lantern," the first major
domestically produced animated film in China, has received a warm
welcome in this Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Although the film has been in theaters for less than a week,
about 17 thousand tickets have been sold at the Capital Cinema
alone.
</P>
<P>
"Ticket sales are much better than they were for Mulan, the
animation hit produced by Disney last year," said Xu Zhongren,
manager of the Capital Cinema.
</P>
<P>
Like the Disney film, Lotus Lantern is also derived from
traditional Chinese folklore, and describes how Little Chen Xiang
went down Huashan Mountain and saved his mother.
</P>
<P>
However, compared to other relatively inexpensive animated
movies, Lotus Lantern had a huge budget of 12 million yuan (about
1.44 million U.S. dollars). The producer, Shanghai Animated Film
Studio, spent four years making the film.
</P>
<P>
Many well-known film and screen stars including Jiang Wen, Ning
Jing, Chen Peisi, and Liang Tian were invited to be the voices of
the movie's characters, the first time this had been done in a
Chinese animated film.
</P>
<P>
Lotus Lantern was the result of a national call for domestic
animated films, which have long been cold-shouldered by Chinese
viewers in favor of foreign-made films which were flooding the
market.
</P>
<P>
"With the production of Lotus Lantern, we have come to a third
spring for Chinese cartoon movies, " said an official from the
State Administration for Radio, Film and Television. Chinese
animated movies had one prime in the late 1950s and early 1960s,
and another in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bonded Zone Lures Overseas Talent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ningbo Bonded Zone in the
coastal city of Ningbo in east China's Zhejiang Province will
introduce more talent from abroad as part of its effort to
maintain rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
Executives and experts in high-tech areas are especially
welcome to the zone, said Yao Li, director of the zone's
administration committee.
</P>
<P>
According to Yao, more than 40 people from overseas have
already applied for executive positions since the zone sent out a
public invitation for applications early this week.
</P>
<P>
The Ningbo Bonded Zone, established in 1992 with the approval
of China's State Council, is the only zone of its kind in the

<HEADLINE> Police in Northern China Uncover Stolen Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Police in north China's
Hebei Province have uncovered 114 pieces of stolen relics in one
of the province's counties and have arrested two suspects.
</P>
<P>
The relics, dating back to the Warring States period (475-221 B.
C.) and the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), were found some days ago
in a mini-bus as the two men were driving across Shexian County in
Hebei on their way to east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The two apparently stole the relics in north China's Shanxi
Province, next to Hebei, and were trying to smuggle them into
Shandong's port city of Weihai, police said.
</P>
<P>
This operation was part of a police campaign to crack down on
smuggling and ensure safety in the province.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Continued Falling Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China's retail prices have been
declining for 22 months, and more than 80 percent of all major
commodities are involved in this downward trend, according to the
State Information Center (SIC).
</P>
<P>
While the decline in retail prices covers a wide range of
commodities over a long period of time, some products are simply
undergoing normal price adjustment, said SIC.
</P>
<P>
Declining food prices may account for this round of price
decline, and except for some short-term rebound in the prices of
grain and eggs, food prices have been locked in this downward
trend.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute declining prices to redundant production and
the slow increase in market demand, and they expected the decline
to continue in the second half of this year.

<HEADLINE> UAE Lifts Ban on Belgian Dairy Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
has lifted a ban on Belgian dairy products and derivatives.
</P>
<P>
But other Belgian products, including poultry, eggs, beef and
fodder, will remain embargoed till further notice, said Dr. Amin
Mohammed Yousif, director of the Food and Environment Control
Center of Abu Dhabi Municipality.
</P>
<P>
According to a decision made by the General Secretariat of UAE
Municipalities on Monday, dairy products from Belgium can now be
imported on submission of a certificate declaring that the
products are not contaminated by dioxin, a highly toxic chemical
that can cause cancer when absorbed by the body, the Khaleej Times
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The certificate must be issued by the Belgian government and
attested by the UAE embassy in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
"Following new developments in the Belgian food industry and
on recommendations of the the UAE Technical Committee for Food
Quality, the General Secretariat of Municipalities has decided to
lift the ban on Belgian food products made of milk and its
by-products," the decision said.
</P>
<P>
The ban imposed on poultry, eggs, beef and fodder will remain
in effect, it added.
</P>
<P>
The General Secretariat issued an order on June 5 banning
import of Belgian poultry, eggs, beef products and fodder,
following reports that food products in that country were
contaminated by dioxin.
</P>
<P>
Another order issued on June 6 extended the ban to include
dairy products.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Launches Web Site to Counter Negative Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Thursday launched a
Web-site called "My Malaysia" aimed at promoting nation-building
among Malaysians and countering negative reports about the
country.
</P>
<P>
"My Malaysia" web-site was created because negative reports
about the country disseminated through the Internet could
undermine efforts to revive the economy, attract tourists and
bring about prosperity to the people, its Chairman Awang Had
Salleh said.
</P>
<P>
"Negative reports can poison the people's minds and turn them
to be anti-establishment," he was quoted by the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
The web-site launched by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in
Miri, Sarawak, East Malaysia, formed part of efforts to counter
lies and provide an alternative channel to the various slanders
existing in web-sites, Awang said.
</P>
<P>
The web-site, located at http://www.mymalaysia.com.my, provides
a one-stop channel for users to gather accurate information and
facts on Malaysia, focusing on politics, economy, tourism, human
&AMP; social rights, as well as science, technology &AMP; environment.
</P>
<P>
Its main highlights are "Topics of the Week" and "News Trends"
which cover write-ups on selected weekly topics of discussion and
comments on current Malaysian issues.

CANBERRA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Sydney Olympics marketing
chief John Moore quit on Thursday as the organisers are taxing
their brains to meet its sponsorship target for next year's Games.
</P>
<P>
Moore's leave came when the Sydeny Olympic organising committee
(SOCOG) is still some A$150 million short of its target, a
shortfall the organisation has partly blamed on recent Olympic
corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
Moore resigned to become the Asia-Pacific chief executive of
duty free retailers Nuance, a subsidiary of Swissair parent SAir
Group, said SOCOG.
</P>
<P>
Moore had been praised for his efforts and talent in helping
SOCOG raise marketing revenues of more than A$650 million (US$430

<HEADLINE> China Stepping Up Gas Development and Utilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China plans to double its gas
production capacity to 30 billion cubic meters by 2005 as part of
a major strategy to develop energy resources.
</P>
<P>
Experts here estimate that China's gas production capacity will
reach 100 billion cubic meters by 2020, equivalent to 100 million
tons of crude oil. By then, gas utilization in the country's
energy structure will be enhanced to eight percent from the
present two percent.
</P>
<P>
China's gas production capacity has huge potential, the experts
say. Through years of vigorous development, three large-scale gas
production areas have taken shape in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia
region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the northwest
and Sichuan Province in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
In the central part of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, total
gas reserves of 230 billion cubic meters have been verified. Total
gas reserves of 160 billion cubic meters have also been confirmed
in the eastern part of Sichuan. While in Xinjiang, total gas
reserves of around 200 billion cubic meters have been located, in
addition to the discovery of a group of new gas-bearing structures.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the Sebei area of northwest China's Qinghai
Province, a large gas field with proven reserves of 50 billion
cubic meters has been identified.
</P>
<P>
China has vast markets for gas utilization, say the experts,
adding that the country's annual gas utilization will top 100
billion cubic meters simply by fueling 80 percent of the oil-
fueled large enterprises with gas, half of the country's thermal
power generators, and 80 percent of its medium-size cities.
</P>
<P>
They also stress the importance of giving priority to
developing gas pipelines. Recently, China completed a long-
distance pipeline extending from Shaanxi Province in the northwest
to Beijing, and construction of other major pipelines in eastern,
northern, and northeastern parts of the country, as well as in the
delta areas of the Yangtze River, is now under consideration.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government plans to
start dredging the Pasig River in Metro Manila in a week's time to
minimize the chances of flash floods in the area and nearby
provinces in the future.
</P>
<P>
A press statement released Thursday quoted President Joseph
Estrada as saying that this is one of the initial steps that the
government will implement to ensure flash flood not to wreak havoc
on the lives of residents again.
</P>
<P>
The Pasig River rehabilitation project includes flood control
program for the area of the lower Sanjuan River area. The
government will pursue a wide-scale reforestation and tree
planting program as part of its long-term solution to the flooding
problems.
</P>
<P>
The overflows due to rise of riverbed have reportedly
contributed to the disastrous flash flood, which has killed at
least 52, submerged some 300 villages and affected more than
111,519 families or 564,596 persons in central Luzon.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the project will get support from
the Overseas Economic Development Fund of Japan.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Not to Visit Yasukuni Shrine on August 15 </HEADLINE>

<P>
TOKYO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi said Thursday he would not visit Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine on
August 15, the 54th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War
II.
</P>
<P>
"Taking the current circumstances into consideration, I will
not make a visit," Obuchi told reporters at his official residence.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka and eight other
cabinet ministers also said they would not visit the shrine.
</P>
<P>
"While understanding toward Yasukuni has not advanced in
neighboring countries, I will refrain from visiting on the 15th (
of August) so as not to cause unnecessary misunderstanding and
irritation as a member of the government," Nonaka told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura, Justice Minister Takao
Jinnouchi, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazwa, Education Minister
Akito Arima, International Trade and Industry Minister Kaoru
Yosano, Defense Agency chief Hosei Norota, Home Affairs Minister
Takeshi Noda and Economic Planning Agency chief Taichi Sakaiya
also have made clear that they would not visit the shrine.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eight ministers including Environment Agency chief
Kenji Manabe and Transport Minister Jiro Kawasaki, however,
expressed their intention to visit the shrine, a bastion of the
wartime government-sponsored Shintoism and symbol of militarism in
Japan before and during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The shrine houses the memorial tablets of 14 class-A war
criminals, including wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, and some
2.4 million Japanese military personnel and officials who died
since 1853 in Japan's various wars.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers' visits to the shrine have drawn criticism
from Asian countries and are also controversial because Japan's
postwar Constitution stipulates separation of the state and
religion.

<HEADLINE> Anti-nuclear Conference Closes in Hiroshima </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A three-day international anti-
nuclear conference ended Thursday in Hiroshima, western Japan,
with the adoption of a declaration calling for a nuclear-free 21st
century, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
About 280 anti-nuclear activists, including 60 people from 20
countries, attended the conference, hosted by the Japan Council
Against A and H Bombs (Gensuikyo).
</P>
<P>
The declaration called on all nuclear weapons states to commit
themselves to the elimination of nuclear weapons, renouncing the
policy of first use of such weapons, and stopping nuclear tests,
research and development.
</P>
<P>
It called for the "establishment, expansion and strengthening
of nuclear-free zones" in the world and also "making countries,
municipalities, ports and harbors nuclear-free."
</P>
<P>
The declaration also objected to expanded military alliances in
the world represented by new laws related to the updated Japan-U.S.
defense cooperation guidelines and a new strategic concept adopted
by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which allows
NATO to intervene in conflicts outside of its member countries.
</P>
<P>
"These developments represent a dangerous departure from the
concept of the 'defense of allies,' which used to be the premise
of these military alliances," it said.
</P>
<P>
The conference urged the government of Japan -- the only
country to experience an atomic bombing in the world-- to "take
the initiative in ridding the world of nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
The gathering was the first of Gensuikyo's series of anti-
nuclear events until August 9 to commemorate the 54th anniversary
of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Has Diplomatic Ties With Over 70 Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has established diplomatic
ties with 78 countries all over the world and has opened 29
embassies, two permanent missions and two consulates-general in
various parts of the world, according to the first-ever Diplomatic
Handbook published by the Myanmar Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The newest Myanmar embassies were opened in South Africa and
Brazil, the first Myanmar diplomatic missions in Sub-Sahara Africa
and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the obligations of a member of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), into which Myanmar was
integrated in July 1997, the country has embassies in all ASEAN
member countries. Likewise, all ASEAN countries have resident
embassies in Yangon, the handbook says.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to strengthen regional cooperation, Myanmar also
joined in August 1997 the BIST-EC, a regional economic grouping
initially comprising Bangladesh, India, Sri-Lanka and Thailand.
With the inclusion of Myanmar, the grouping was then renamed as
BIMST-EC. The five countries all border the Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar has been a U.N. member since 1948.
</P>
<P>
The handbook added that Myanmar's independent and active
foreign policy has served so well its national interest and the
policy would continue to be the pillar of the foreign relations of
the country.

...bargaining for."
</P>
<P>
The millennium's last general election tends to be a fierce
battle between the BJP led by Vajpayee and the Congress Party
headed by Sonia Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
For the Congress, it is the first chance to pit the untried and
untested Sonia Gandhi against a veteran politician who promised a
lot but palpably failed to deliver due to factors both within and
outside his rank.
</P>
<P>
For the BJP, it is the opportunity to sing paeans to the
caretaker prime minister who, the party asserted, led the country
to push "the intruders from Pakistan" out of Kargil and weaned
away the United States from Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Gearing up for the elections, the results of which are highly
unpredictable, the two rivals have stepped up attacks against each
other for nearly everything ranging from the recent Kashmir
conflict to telecommunications arrangements, from social problems
to political stability, and from past experiences to future
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
With no very big margin in strength for both sides, suave
advertising and public relations executives, glib spin-doctors and
shrewd party managers have come together to invent new images for
the two leaders and their parties.
</P>
<P>
In what promises to be a hi-tech election campaign, the
Congress has engaged three leading advertising agencies -- Sony,
Madison and Concept -- to drive home the message that it is the
best bet to run the country.
</P>
<P>
Its media strategy is expected to remind the people that the
BJP coalition was unstable from the day it came to power in March
last year, that the nuclear tests in last May had rendered South
Asia unstable and neutralized India's superiority over Pakistan,
that the Vajpayee government resorted to bombing in Kargil the day
Sonia took back her resignation as Congress president, thus
insinuating that it delayed taking action against "intruders"
because of political reasons.
</P>
<P>
With nothing matters more than Sonia Gandhi, the Congress'
media strategists hope to emphasize on her family lineage and
charisma, and describe the party's rejuvenation to her leadership.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the BJP is divided over hiring advertising
professionals to design its campaign and, insiders said, it has a
headstart over others because of the "feel good" factor and
obviously it plans to exploit Kargil for its electoral war against
the Congress.
</P>
<P>
BJP spokesman Arun Jetley claimed that the country had
appreciated the party and Vajpayee's performance, more so in
Kargil.
</P>
<P>
"Feel good" or not, insiders said that the BJP would launch a
scathing attack against Sonia Gandhi and her party, highlighting
her inexperience and her party's long legacy of corruption.
</P>
<P>
However, the Congress said, Kargil would be a major issue in
the elections and would have a negative impact on the BJP and its
allies.
</P>
<P>
As the two major parties entering into rivalry, Indian
corporations also face hard choices for either paying the bill for
or refusing contributions to the parties for their political
campaign, which will cost up to billions of rupees.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources here said, these parties were finding that
companies had drastically scaled down their contributions to their
campaign because of frequent general elections, possibility of
political uncertainty and a downturn in the industry over the last
three years.
</P>
<P>
"The industry seems to be tired of frequent elections and
coalition governments which are not able to take bold economic
decisions due to pulls and pressures from their constituent
parties," a Congress leader said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the election will be going on according to the
schedule announced last month by the Election Commission, which
made some minor changes in the original arrangements Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the new schedule, the first phase of polling would
now be held on September 5 instead of September 4 and the new
house will meet by October 21 as the dissolved Lok Sabha last met
on April 21 due to constitutional stipulation that the gap between
house sittings can not exceed six months.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Major Parties Gear Up for Coming Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Following the just-ended armed
conflict in the disputed Kashmir with neighboring Pakistan, major
parties in India have now geared up for another fierce struggle --
a campaign for the next general elections to the Lok Sabha, the
Lower House of parliament in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), winner of the last elections
in February 1998, is all set to formally launch its campaign here
on Sunday with a rally to be addressed by its steerer, the
caretaker Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
The BJP announced its first list of 138 candidates Tuesday,
which included three big men of the party: Vajpayee, Home Minister
L. K. Advani and Human Resource Development Minister Murli Manohar
Joshi.
</P>
<P>
BJP's rival the National Congress Party seems to be waiting for
the BJP's list of candidates before announcing its own one
following separate meetings of the Central Election Committee
(CEC) of both of the two parties Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The BJP's list includes 78 members of parliament of the
dissolved 12th Lok Sabha with only 11 women while the Congress'
CEC is expected to meet continuously for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Both the BJP and the Congress have been trying to sell a
stability plank following the two-month long conflict in Kargil of
Kashmir and, observers here said, the handling by the Vajpayee
government of the issue might affect the electoral prospects of
both parties.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Congress President Sonia Gandhi attacked the
Vajpayee government for "total failure" and "messing up of things"
particularly during the last three months, saying that Kargil and
the "stability factor" would be main election issues of her party.
</P>
<P>
While the Congress' manifesto and publicity campaign, being
given the final touches at present, promote the party's record of
providing stable and performing governments, the BJP is also not
lacking behind in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Despite heading a multi-party alliance of diverse ideologies,
the BJP is taking steps to dispel the impression that a coalition
can not run its full five-year term and provide a stable
government.
</P>
<P>
Following the downfall of its coalition last April, the BJP
managed to tie itself up with its ruling allies in a set-up called
the National Democratic Alliance (DNA) and has ever since tried to
project it as a cohesive entity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after its failure to form a multi-party government
last April due to disagreement among the opposition, the strength
of the Congress further weakened in the following month when it
expelled three of its senior leaders for their objection against
Sonia Gandhi as the prime minister candidate because of her
Italian origin.
</P>
<P>
The coordination committee of the NDA decided last weekend to
issue a common manifesto which would promise to amend the
constitution to provide for a full five-year term for yet another
coalition government if it comes to power in October.
</P>
<P>
Aware of the BJP's attempts, the Congress has already started
attacking what was termed as "inherent weakness" of the NDA which,
it said, suits only for incoherent governance in return.
</P>
<P>
To a certain extent, what the Congress said might be reasonable
for the emergence of the first major trouble in the NDA on
Wednesday when muscle-flexing by BJP and its allies over
seat-sharing in the lower house elections came to the fore.
</P>
<P>
Hardly no smaller party in the NDA does not ask or hope for
more seats in the house with Samata Party led by Defense Minister
George Fernandes, which alongwith Lok Shakti has merged into
Janata Dal recently, demanding 55 seats.
</P>
<P>
A Samata spokesman said that it had one-fourth of the BJP's
strength and "we are asking for one-seventh of its strength now
(in the house), you can imagine what we are bargaining for."

<HEADLINE> Zambia-Namibia Border Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Namibia has closed its border with
Zambia at Katima Mulilo near Sesheke in Zambia's Western Province
following conflict in the area between the Namibian government and
a rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Zambia also closed its border a day after the Namibian
government closed the other side, Zambia Daily Mail newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa confirmed the closure. He
said the border had been closed because Namibia had earlier closed
its side of the frontier.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa explained that every border has two sides and closure
of the Zambian side was a consequence of the Namibian side being
closed.
</P>
<P>
"It's not from our side and we have nothing to do with what is
going on there, we closed the border because our side could not
function with the other side closed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister acknowledged the clashes that had taken place on
the Namibian side and said the Zambian government was studying the
situation.
</P>
<P>
He advised Zambians living around the border area not to panic
because the government had taken measures to ensure their
security.
</P>
<P>
The government had not received reports on any Zambian joining
the conflict on either side of the border, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also there had been no refugees received from Namibia by
Wednesday as a result of the conflict that erupted two days ago.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Probes Wrangle in Congolese Rebel Factions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) --A Zambian delegation is in Goma in
the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to investigate
the wrangle within rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD).
</P>
<P>
The delegation is led by Minister of State House Eric Silwamba,
the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation, reported.
</P>
<P>
Due to the power struggle within the rebel movement, all the
rebel groups fighting to topple Congolese President Laurent Kabila
did not sign the cease-fire agreement, which was endorsed on July
10 by all the six warring countries involved in the one-year
conflict in Congo.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese Rally for Democracy split into two factions in
May this year -- one led by Emile Illunga and the other by Ernest
Wamba Dia Wamba who founded the RCD.
</P>
<P>
The RCD and the Movement for the Liberation for Congo (MLC) did
not sign the agreement then because of disagreement on who would
sign the deal on behalf of the RCD.
</P>
<P>
MLC leader Jean-Pierre Bemba later signed the cease-fire
agreement here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In May Ilunga ousted Wamba and was named by his supporters as
new leader of the RCD. After the wrangle broke out, Wamba moved
from Goma to Kisangani, the third largest city of Congo in the
north, and has been insisting that he is still the leader of the
rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Uganda backs both the faction led by Wamba and the MLC while
Rwanda backs the RCD faction led by Emile Illunga.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Police Arrest 130 Foreign Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Police in Kenya's capital Nairobi
have arrested 130 Somalis and Ethiopians in a major crackdown on
illegal aliens, the Kenya Times newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The foreigners were suspected to be involved in criminal
activities including armed robberies, carjackings and drug
peddling, Nairobi Provincial Police chief Peter Mbuvi said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were arrested in their hide-outs in a raid which
started at 2 am and ended 9 am Wednesday morning, Mbuvi added.
</P>
<P>
The police were sorting out the suspects with a view to
arraigning them in courts before they are repatriated to their
respective countries.
</P>
<P>
Mbuvi also revealed that police discovered two pistols and 60
rounds of ammunition from the aliens during the swoop.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that increasing crime rate was of great concern,
Mbuvi said regular patrols have been intensified across the city
to ensure that all suspected criminals are brought to book.
</P>
<P>
The police chief said the operation will be extended to other
parts of Nairobi until the confidence of city residents is
restored on their safety and security.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Office in Nairobi has warned its visitors
against walking in the center of the city at night even for the
shortest distance.

<HEADLINE> Cloudy Weather Forecast for Eclipse Day in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Solar eclipse watchers in
Belgium were given another blow to their fully-intrigued hobby
when local meteorologists forecast cloudy weather for the days
leading up to their day of August 11.
</P>
<P>
The meteorologists of the Royal Institute of Meteorology of
Belgium predicted cloudy weather for the next five days right
prior to the total solar eclipse day next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As local transport authorities are preparing to cope with the
coming traffic congestion on local road systems prior to and on
the day of the eclipse, a rare phenomenon occurring at an interval
of 370 years on average, the solar eclipse watchers have to think
a second time before setting out for southern Belgium, where the
total eclipse was predicted to be visible.
</P>
<P>
Local eclipse watchers were already treated an earlier blow
when some 1,000 pairs of anti-retina burn glasses with defects
were found in Belgian shops.
</P>
<P>
The solar eclipse-oriented glasses, together with another 2,000
pairs for sale, were found to be defective after being imported
from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Local health authorities appealed to the buyers of the
defective glasses not to use them on August 11 while witnessing
the solar eclipse.
</P>
<P>
Looking into the solar eclipse without protective glasses or
with defective glasses can cause serious eye problems such as
retina burns that may cause lasting damage, eye specialists warned.
</P>
<P>
Sales of solar eclipse glasses picked up a week ago when local
people started to prepare for the coming solar eclipse on August
11.
</P>
<P>
Solar eclipse watchers in Belgium were suggested to go to the
south of the country, especially to a town known as Virton to have
a better view of the rare phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
A solar eclipse happens when the moon travels right in between
the sun and the earth, blocking the view of the sun from the earth.
</P>
<P>
The August 11 solar eclipse is estimated to be visible in whole
or in part to around 2 billion residents of this planet.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Inflation up by 2.4 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Zambia has risen by
2.4 percent in July compared to the June increase of 1.9 percent
with the metropolitan low and high income group indices up by 1.8
percent and 3.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the Central Statistical
Office (CSO) available here Thursday, the sector that contributed
to observed inflation in July was the transport and communications
group.
</P>
<P>
The release said the transport and communications sectors
registered increases of 13.0 percent and 6.1 percent for the
metropolitan low and high income indices respectively which saw
year on year inflation increasing to 28.4 percent representing a
rise of 0.9 percentage points over the June figure.
</P>
<P>
The non metropolitan group transport index increased by 7.9
percent which saw an increase in coach fares whereas the price of
petroleum products, diesel and engine oil were up by 10 percent on
average nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The increase in petroleum products and subsequently came as a
result of the gutting of Indeni Oil Refinery in Ndola, Copperbelt
Province, a move which resulted in fuel shortage.
</P>
<P>
This has led to the government importing petrol, diesel and
other petroleum products from Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The fuel situation is expected to return to normal after the
completion of the 10-month renovations of the Ndola-based
refinery.
</P>
<P>
The release said the rent, fuel and lighting group recorded
increases of 3.5 and 2.1 percent for the metropolitan high and low
income groups respectively.

<HEADLINE> University Reforms Urged to Speed up in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has ordered the speedy execution of university reforms
recommended by a Presidential Task Force, the Presidential
Secretariat said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although steering committees were appointed in each university,
the progress of implementation of the reforms was very slow, the
secretariat said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Task Force appointed in May 1997 has
recommended key reforms, including the establishment of career
guidance units, restructuring of courses and examinations,
facilitation of cross disciplines and faculty combinations and the
introduction of new subject areas.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations also include the establishment of formal
links with research institutions and industrial and commercial
institutions for the development of undergraduate studies and
research collaboration.
</P>
<P>
The new curricula and courses should focus on the development,
economic and social needs of the country, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with university and educational officials, the
president stressed the importance of in-course assessments,
project work, tutorials, and staff development programs in all
universities.
</P>
<P>
At present there are 12 universities in Sri Lanka. Early in the
year, the government approved of establishing one more university
in the North Western Province.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Prisoners Threaten Hunger Strike Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Over 500 prisoners on treason
charges in Luzira Maximum Security Prison, the biggest prison in
Uganda, have threatened a hunger strike if their cases could not
be dealt with soon.
</P>
<P>
They are protesting against being kept on remand beyond the
mandatory 360 days and some of them have spent over two years on
remand without trial, the Monitor paper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In their letter to the Commissioner of Prisons Joseph Etima,
the inmates said that their hunger strike would begin from August
9. But it did not say how long the strike would last.
</P>
<P>
They argued that the government should free them if it could
not prosecute them in accordance with the Constitution provisions.
</P>
<P>
Etima admitted Wednesday that the prison has over 1,000 inmates
who have been on remand for between two and four years without
trial.
</P>
<P>
Those on treason charges were arrested in 1997 from West Nile
region in the northwestern part of the country and neighboring
countries while fighting the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners in this prison first staged a strike on July 22
this year and only relented after top prison authorities
intervened.

<HEADLINE> People In Eastern China Criticize Lee's Separatist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- People in Jiangsu Province, which
has close economic and trade ties with Taiwan, have expressed
their indignation over the recent separatist remarks of Lee Teng-
hui.
</P>
<P>
Yu Meilan, the vice president of the Jiangsu Provincial
Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, told a forum here that
Taiwan has been a part of Chinese territory from long ago and that
Li's redefining of cross-straits relations as "state-to-state"
greatly hurt the feelings of all Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Haijiang, the general manager of the Hongdou Industry Co.,
Ltd., said at another meeting that Lee's remarks reveal his
intention to separate Taiwan from China and to undermine the
foundation of cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
Chu Fuxiang, a scientist, said that Lee's "two states"
statement is a severe challenge to the "one China" policy and runs
counter to the fundamental interest of the Chinese and that the
Chinese people will not accept it.
</P>
<P>
Peng Hui, the vice president of the Jiangsu Provincial Youth
Federation, said that the Chinese expect to develop cross-straits
relations and to reunify the motherland and that anyone who
attempts to hinder this is over-estimating his ability and is
doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
Economic, cultural, educational, scientific, and technological
exchanges between Jiangsu and Taiwan have been on the rise for the
past two decades and Taiwanese investors have contracts worth more
than 11.2 billion U.S. dollars in Jiangsu.

<P>
YANGON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has established diplomatic
ties with 78 countries all over the world and has opened 29
embassies, two permanent missions and two consulates-general in
various parts of the world, according to the first-ever Diplomatic
Handbook published by the Myanmar Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The newest Myanmar embassies were opened in South Africa and
Brazil, the first Myanmar diplomatic missions in Sub-Sahara Africa
and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the obligations of a member of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), into which Myanmar was
integrated in July 1997, the country has embassies in all ASEAN
member countries. Likewise, all ASEAN countries have resident
embassies in Yangon, the handbook says.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to strengthen regional cooperation, Myanmar also
joined in August 1997 the BIST-EC, a regional economic grouping
initially comprising Bangladesh, India, Sri-Lanka and Thailand.
With the inclusion of Myanmar, the grouping was then renamed as
BIMST-EC. The five countries all border the Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar has been a U.N. member since 1948.
</P>
<P>
The handbook added that Myanmar's independent and active
foreign policy has served so well its national interest and the
policy would continue to be the pillar of the foreign relations of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Leader Accuses Kabila of Breaking Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Congolese President Laurent
Kabila has been accused by a rebel leader of breaking the
recently-signed Lusaka cease-fire accord when a Sudanese plane
allegedly bombed two northern fishing towns in the country
Wednesday, killing more than 500 people.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Bemba, a millionaire businessman who heads the
Uganda-backed Congolese Liberation Movement, said this attack
shattered the peace deal he had signed just three days earlier,
the New Vision daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One Russian-built Sudanese Antonov plane dropped 18 bombs on
the two rebel-held towns of Makanza and Bogbonga on the Congo
River about 800 kms northeast of the capital Kinshasa, the rebel
leader was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of those killed were civilians. About 134 rebels fighting
to out Kabila were also killed in the surprise attack, he noted,
adding that he had already informed Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba, who mediated the peace accord, of the attack.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Bemba endorsed a peace pact worked out in the
Zambian capital last month which was agreed by six African
governments involved in the year-old war.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China's National Bureau of
Statistics is reporting summer grain yields this year of 118.49
million tons, the second highest figure in its history.
</P>
<P>
The bureau says that this summer grain output shows an annual
increase of 4.7 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute this good grain crops to good weather for
the latter growth period, bringing increases in per-hectare yields.
</P>
<P>
Because of dry spells last winter and new grain distribution
regulations, the amount of land sown in summer grain is 780,000
hectares less this year than in last year. The amount of land sown
in rapeseed has increased 3.4 percent to 6.39 million ha. and
yields are up 18.2 percent to 9.33 million tons, the bureau says.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 5 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province plans to develop new measures to encourage consumer
spending.
</P>
<P>
Some existing policies that hinder consumer spending will be
taken off the books, according to a local official who says that
the province will try to increase consumer spending on housing,
tourism, and education.
</P>
<P>
The province had 13.4 percent growth in retail sales of
consumer goods from January to June and expects a rise of 11.5
percent for the year. The new measures are expected to help offset
the negative impact of falling exports. Guangdong only exported 32.
26 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods in the first six months, a
drop of 12.2 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
But, the province still had a GDP of 367.6 billion yuan from
January to June, up 9.6 percent. The growth is largely attributed
to growing domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Huang Weihong, director of the Provincial Development Planning
Commission, says that Guangdong's fixed assets investment will go
up around 10 percent this year. A total of 104.5 billion yuan was
spent on fixed assets in the first six months, a 21.5 percent
increase over the same period last year.

of Li spending 116,000 yuan (14,000 US dollars) on the house in
1994. He also had another house being built in the same city.
Police also found a 29-inch Sony color TV, a set of super acoustic
equipment, a luxury genuine leather sofa, seven high-quality
watches, and modern office facilities.
</P>
<P>
There were also large quantities of medicines and hospital
invoices in the house. Police examined a ledger of Li's that
showed that he received 116,649 yuan (some 14,000 US dollars) on
May 4th, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi also planned to build a "Falun Research Center" in
Huailai County in north China's Hebei Province on 60 hectares of
land.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches Export Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Export Development Board of
Sri Lanka in collaboration with the private sector has launched a
concerted program to ensure export growth, Trade Ministry sources
here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis of the program will be in several key markets
including the U.S., the European Union ad Japan, which account for
72.8 percent of the total exports. The United States which is the
country's largest export market accounts for 40 percent of the
total exports, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that although there was a stable export market in
the U.S. and European Union countries till the year 2000, there is
an urgent need to promote and publicize export items in these
countries to ensure future growth.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sri Lanka has identified Latin America, the Baltic
region and the South Asian region as new export destinations.
</P>
<P>
A business delegation of leading exporters is to visit Latin
America soon to identify business partners for joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
At present Sri Lanka has about 4,000 entrepreneurs, exporting
over 3,000 products and services the world over.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Sri Lanka earned 4.7 billion U.S. dollars from
exports, a 2-percent increase over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Czech Car Export Doubles in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic exported 402,
000 cars in 1998, a 102 percent increase compared with that of
1997, showed the latest figure from the Ministry of Industry and
Trade.
</P>
<P>
The car export totaled 66.1 billion Czech Koruna (34 Koruna =
one U.S. dollar) last year, and increased by 53 percent over 1997.
The car, which made up 7.8 percent of the total export volume last
year, has become Czech's competitive products for foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Germany was the biggest importer of Czech cars in 1998,
followed by Slovakia and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for Skoda Car Plant said that the cheap but good
Skoda brand cars continued to be in great demand, adding the
company sold 199,000 Skoda cars in the first half of this year, a
10.6 percent rise over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Skoda car export to Germany and Britain in the first half of
this year increased by 40.4 and 67.5 percent respectively over the
same period of last year. The export to the central and east
European countries also grew sharply this year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, only 39,000 Skoda cars were sold at home,
dropping 12.6 percent. The economic recession and sagging domestic
demand is blamed for the decline.

<HEADLINE> Epizootic Experts Meet in Bulgaria on Blue Tongue Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- International epizootic experts and
relevant officials from the EU, Bulgaria and Greece met in the
Bulgarian city of Bourgas on Wednesday to discuss ways of
controlling the animal epidemic of Blue Tongue Disease found in
southern Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The meeting called for a two-year ban on Bulgaria's export of
live animals, which does not include milk and dairy products.
</P>
<P>
The disease, originated in Africa, spreads through blood
contamination and turns the tongue of an affected animal into blue.
It normally does not affect human beings but the meat of an
affected animal is unedible.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria registered its first ever instance of Blue Tongue
Disease in the south-eastern Bourgas area last month. Within three
weeks, the disease was found to have spread to southern regions of
Yambol and Haskovo. More than 500 sick sheep have so far been
killed.
</P>
<P>
Experts fear that the epidemic may spread to neighboring Turkey
and Greece, and then to other European countries.

<HEADLINE> Andorra Passes New Laws Against Cigarette Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Andorra has adopted new laws to
further curb once-rampant smuggling of cigarettes out of the
European principality, the European Commission (EC) said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation includes a law on frauds in customs matters,
a law on the control of sensitive goods, and one modifying the
Penal Code by introducing smuggling as an offense.
</P>
<P>
The new laws are regarded as further legal steps to fight
against smuggling of cigarettes out of the country. In 1996, the
small, 468-square kilometer country situated between France and
Spain was identified as one of the main sources of smuggled
cigarettes in the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The EC, executive organ of the EU, said it had close
consultations with Andorra before the latter took the legal steps.
</P>
<P>
For some time, large quantities of cigarettes have been
smuggled out of Andorra. As a result, EU countries lost 400
million euros (428 million U.S. dollars) in 1997 alone.
</P>
<P>
However, thanks to the effective legal and administrative
measures taken by Andorra, and collaboration with its neighboring
countries, cigarette smuggling decreased markedly in 1998, the EC
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Cigarette smuggling has been carried out on large scales by
international criminal rings. Smuggled cigarettes have markets in
Andorra's neighboring countries and even in Britain and Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Argentina to Eliminate Protectionist Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem promised here Wednesday that his government would eliminate
resolution 911, which regulates the application of trade
safeguards.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of eliminating the safeguards, which were enacted
by the Latin American Association of Integration ALADI) against
imports from Brazil, is to defend the interests of the regional
bloc of the South American Common Market (Mercosur) comprising
Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. Menem said,
</P>
<P>
The new ruling, which was made between the presidents of
Argentina and Brazil in July, will take effect on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the face of losses provoked by the devaluation of the
Brazilian currency, the real, the Argentine government adopted the
resolution, which established safeguards against Brazilian exports
of textiles, footwear and electronic equipment in order to protect
its national industries.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the resolution, however, brought protests from
the Brazilians.

<HEADLINE> Orlando Set to Deal Penny Hardaway to Phoenix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Penny Hardaway appears close
to getting his wish to leave the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
According to a local radio report, the Phoenix Suns are on the
verge of acquiring the disgruntled All-Star guard from the Magic
for forwards Danny Manning and Pat Garrity and a pair of first-
round draft picks.
</P>
<P>
However, a Suns official said today the Magic have not agreed
to the reported deal.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway had three years left on his current contract with
Orlando before exercising a clause that made the four-time All-
Star a free agent. As a result, the Magic would have to re-sign
Hardaway first and then deal him to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
Chicago pulled the same ploy with Scottie Pippen last year when
it sent him to Houston.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway had become a lightning rod for criticism over the
Magic's limited success since the departure of superstar center
Shaquille O'Neal. He averaged 15.8 points, 5.7 rebounds and 5.3
assists per game during the lockout-shortened regular season, his
seventh in the league.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Hardaway spent most of the regular season
feuding with veteran coach Chuck Daly over handling the point
guard duties. He made no secret of his disdain for the media,
which he felt made him the scapegoat for the team's struggles.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway is in Orlando's top five of every all-time statistical
category with the exception of fouls committed. For his career, he
has averaged just over 19 points, just under five rebounds and
more than six assists per contest.
</P>
<P>
A first-round selection of the Golden State Warriors in 1993,
Hardaway was acquired by Orlando in a draft day deal involving top
overall pick Chris Webber. He teamed with O'Neal to lead the Magic
to the NBA Finals in 1995, when they were swept by the Houston
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
The Suns appear more than willing to deal two reserves after it
was believed they needed to give up forward Tom Gugliotta in any
trade to acquire Hardaway. Gugliotta averaged a team-leading 17
points and 8.9 rebounds a game last season.

WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- American star sprinter Dennis
Mitchell received a two-year suspension Tuesday for a failed drug
test but still is eligible for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, a local
report said today.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell contended that last year's positive result for high
levels of testosterone stemmed from drinking five beers and having
sex four times the night before the test, but an International
Amateur Athletic Federation arbitration panel rejected his appeal.
</P>
<P>
His retroactive ban from April 1, 1998, to March 31, 2000,
keeps the U.S. 100-meter champion from competing in this month's
world championships in Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
In Monte Carlo, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, stripped of his
gold medal and 100-meter world record for a positive steroid test
at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, was suspended for life in 1993 after a
second positive test.

victory over American Chanda Rubin at the 520,000 U.S. dollars TIG
Tennis Classic in San Diego.

while trailing 4-6, 7-5, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, the second seed and 1997 champion, fell behind 2-4 in
the opening set before breaking back in the next game. Hingis'
surprising 6-2, 6-0 loss to Australian teenager Jelena Dokic in
the first round at Wimbledon was her worst Grand Slam result in
five years and came on the heels of her setback to Graf in the
final of the French Open.
</P>

Hingis has won four titles this season, including the
Australian Open, and improved to 44-7 overall with the last win.
</P>

Graf also was competing in her first event since her loss to

<HEADLINE> Sotomayor Confirmed Positive on Dismal Pan Am Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The 13th Pan American
Games on Wednesday saw its first high-profile athlete failing a
drug test and having his gold medal stripped off.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's high-jumping world record holder Javier Sotomayor has
been confirmed here today to test positive for Cocaine following
his fourth Pan Am gold medal on last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The world and Olympic champion became the third athlete of the
Winnipeg Games to give a positive result following Canada's roller
hockey goaltender Steve Vezina and Dominican woman high jumper
Juana Rosario Arrendel, and obviously the most sensational one.
</P>
<P>
But the world and Olympic champipon himself said through the
Cuban delegation that he is totally innocent and would appeal the
Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) decision to withdraw the
gold medal from him.
</P>
<P>
Cuba acted defiantly by declaring Sotomayor is "an innocent and
dignified man" who has never taken any banned drugs and accusing
there exists some kind of sabotage and conspiracy against the
Cuban athletes.
</P>
<P>
The Sotomayor Affair overshadowed today's Pan Am arena where
the hosts Canada racked up a total of eight gold to surpass the
seven from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Their men's field hockey team thrilled the whole country by
upsetting the defending champions Argentina 1-0 in the final to
capture the gold.
</P>
<P>
In the men's beach volleyball final, the Canadian duo of Jody
Holden and Conrad Leinemann Brazil also did it a hard way,
toughing out a 12-8, 11-12, 13-11 win over the mighty Brazilian
pair of Adriano and Lula.
</P>
<P>
The women's field hockey title went to the defending champions
Argentina, who cruised to a 5-2 easy win over the United States,
while Brazilian pair of Behar and Bede thrashed American
partnership Jennifer Pavley and Marsha Miller 12-5, 12-0 to
triumph in the women's beach volleyball final.
</P>
<P>
Brazil made a big splash in the Pan Am Pool here today as a
pair of Games record fell to them (Fernando Scherer of men's 100m
freestyle and Leonardo Costa of men's 200m backstroke) on Day
Three of the swimming competitions.
</P>
<P>
The United States continued to occupy the top spot of the
medals standings with a total of 83 golds, with inspired Canada (
47) edging close second-placed Cuba (49).

<HEADLINE> Clinton Again Vows to Veto Republican Tax Cut Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
vowed again on Wednesday to veto a Republican tax cut proposal of
792 billion U.S. dollars, but indicated he was open to a
compromise deal.
</P>
<P>
"If they conclude this plan and send it to me I will have to
veto it," Clinton said of the plan worked out by a committee of
House and Senate Republicans on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I will refuse to sign any plan that signs away our commitment
to America's future, Social Security, Medicare, paying down the
debt," he told reporters in the White House Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and most Democrats have said that any cut over 300
billion dollars would be unacceptably risky to the nation's
economic future.
</P>
<P>
The Republican plan for the deepest tax reduction since 1981
would cut taxes by 792 billion dollars over the next 10 years,
compared to a Clinton proposal for 250 billion dollars in tax cuts
over a decade.
</P>
<P>
The White House has said the Republican plan is too large and
would require either steep budget cuts or raids on money set aside
for Social Security. Clinton has repeatedly vowed to veto it.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was still willing to seek an agreement with
Congress, Clinton said, "I hope we can reach an agreement. I'm
willing to work for it and hope we can achieve it."
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders said the vote would come up for final
passage this week but the plan would not be sent to Clinton for
signature until after the August congressional recess.

<HEADLINE> Sotomayor Fails Drugs Test, Gold Medal Taken Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Cuban high jump world
record holder Javier Sotomayor tested positive for banned drugs
cocaine and would been stripped of gold medal won in the Pan-
American Games last week, officials at the Pan American Games
revealed here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The news means Sotomayor cannot go defend his crown at the
World Championships in Seville, Spain, later this month.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Pan American Sports Organisation (ODEPA),
Mario Vasques Rana, said Sotomayor, 31, will face a two-year
suspension from competitions.
</P>
<P>
Primo Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation (IAAF), said: "I can't understand it. I feel bad for
him."
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor, 31, regarded as one of athletics' greats, won the
world title in 1997 and took the Olympic crown in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He also won gold at the the 1993 world championships and took
silver in the 1991 and 1995 events.
</P>
<P>
His world record stands at 2.45 meters.
</P>
<P>
Pan Am high jump gold medals instead go to Canadians Kwaku
Boateng and Mark Boswell, with Charles Clinger of the United
States taking the bronze.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Anti-flood Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to increase its
investment in water conservancy projects this year, creating flood-
control projects along its major rivers downstream and erosion-
control projects upstream, a leading water official said.
</P>
<P>
Following last year's drastically increased expenditure on
Yangtze embankments, which has already shown some remarkable
benefits during this year's flood season, the central government
is considering adding 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion U.S.
dollars) in funds earmarked for the construction of water
conservancy projects, Minister of Water Resources Wang Shucheng
was quoted by Thursday's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The additional funds are scheduled to be allocated soon after
this year's flood season, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will increase funds in river embankment
consolidation projects in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui
provinces this year, and reinforcement projects along the Yangtze
river are to be completed in three to five years.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, part of the investment will be used to
intensify efforts to control soil erosion, China's top
environmental issue plaguing over two thirds of the country's
territory, particularly the worsening erosion of the upper reaches
of major rivers.
</P>
<P>
The deterioration of soil erosion, partially caused by
excessive logging on the upper reaches of the rivers, has been
blamed as one of the major factors causing last summer's
devastating flooding along the Yantse in the south and the Songhua
River in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
Wang urged localities to further intensify their erosion-
control by "seizing the opportunity of the central government's
strong financial support this year to build 'a beautiful Northwest
China,' as President Jiang Zemin has instructed."

JAKARTA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net foreign reserves
decreased to 16.11 billion U.S. dollars in the week ending July
30, from 16.14 billion dollars in the previous week, Bank
Indonesia said in its latest weekly report.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the decrease in the country's net
foreign reserves to the repayment of foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Net international reserves were still above the 14.7-billion-
dollar target set by the International Monetary Fund, the report
was quoted by The Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gross international reserves -- net foreign exchange reserves
plus outstanding foreign exchange contracts -- also decreased by
31.5 million dollars to 26.59 billion dollars, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Simplifies Investment Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Wednesday decided to drastically simplify investment procedures
and offer wide ranging incentives, including provision of tax
holidays, to attract capital investment, especially from overseas.
</P>
<P>
"President B.J. Habibie fully supports the moves to be taken by
state minister for investment, and has called them very
progressive and very revolutionary," Information Minister Yunus
Yosfiah said after a cabinet meeting on economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has witnessed a sharp drop in investment levels of
both domestic and overseas investors following the prolonged
social unrest that has engulfed the country since the fall of
former president Soeharto in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The recently concluded peaceful, free and transparent general
elections seem to have failed to attract fresh investment capital.
</P>
<P>
The new investment policy will then be embodied within a new
presidential decree set to issue in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The proposed decree provides tax holidays as well as authorizes
Indonesian embassies and consulate general offices overseas to
issue preliminary approval to investors wishing to invest capital
in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investors are now free to come directly to the
Investment Coordination Board office, or to Indonesian embassies
and consulate general offices located overseas," Yunus was quoted
by The Indonesian Observer Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The provincial and regional investment boards will also be
authorized to issue permits to would-be investors, domestic and
overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
"President Habibie has also decided that presidential approval
is not needed for new investment as was previously the case," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also disclosed the presence of critical views
raised by other ministers during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Farid Anfasa Moeloek said, for example, that
new investment should be environment friendly, and should not
cause damage to those living near investment sites.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Development Supervision and State
Administrative Reform Hartarto suggested that in view of the
population density of the Java island, any new investment policy
should aim to promote investment outside Java where areas remain
relatively sparsely populated and lacking in investment.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China's Forests expected To Recover Within 50 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A massive forest protection
campaign of the Ministry of Forestry is expected to help forests
in China's Greater Hinggan Mountains to return to normal in about
50 years, according to Dai Wanchun, deputy general manager of the
Timber Group.
</P>
<P>
Heavy logging has taken a toll on this part of northeast China.
Over 100 million cubic meters of timber have been felled for the
state since 1965, a tenth of the nation's total timber output, and
the rapid growth in population there has reduced forest resources
from over 520 million cubic meters to just some 170 million cubic
meters now.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that the area will add another million hectares of man-
made forests, increasing forest coverage from 74 percent now to 83
percent in 2010 to provide healthier forest resources by mid-21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The central government began an ambitious forest protection
project after last year's heavy flooding on the Yangtze, Nenjiang,
and Songhua rivers, limiting or stopping logging of State-owned
forest areas along the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze and
the Yellow rivers.
</P>
<P>
And 75 percent of the over six million hectares in the Greater
Hinggan Mountains were included in the project's first-phase,
reducing timber output to 2.14 million cubic meters by the end of
2000, or 38 percent less than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Central government and the commercial banks will also
allocate funds to help the 220,000 lumbermen in forest areas
change their work to afforestration, forest protection, and other
industries.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The heat wave hitting the
Midwest and the East in the United States has led to the death of
at least 263 people since July 19, government officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 21 states have registered heat-related deaths. There
have been 120 deaths in Illinois, followed by Missouri and Ohio
with 56 and 14 deaths respectively.
</P>

On Tuesday, U.S. President Bill Clinton earmarked 55 million U.
S. dollars in federal aid to help residents of nine Southern and
Midwestern states cope with the heat.
</P>
<P>
The money, provided under a program that is used more often to
help low-income people pay for heat during the winter, may be used
to buy air conditioners, fans and other relief.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Hold Trade Fair in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will hold a trade fair in
Bangkok, Thailand from August 11 to 14, aimed at stimulating trade
between the two countries, official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Trade Fair'99, sponsored by the country's
Cooperative Department and the TTF Co. of Thailand, will be
attended by a total of 134 delegates from nine cooperatives and 15
private companies.
</P>
<P>
They will put on display their products of gems, rattan,
electrical goods, furniture, gold and silver tapestry, silk salon,
Thanakha (Myanmar traditional cosmetic) and soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
In last December, a first Thai trade exhibition, sponsored by
the Department of Export Promotion of the Thai Ministry of
Commerce in collaboration with its Myanmar counterpart, was held
in Yangon under the Myanmar-Thai economic cooperation promotion
program.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar-Thai bilateral trade,
 including border trade, stood at 434.9 million U.S. dollars in
the fiscal year 1998-99 which ended in March, of which Thailand's
export to Myanmar amounted to 358.8 million dollars, favoring
Thailand in the balance of trade.

<HEADLINE> Manila Imposes Price Control Amid Flash Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
imposed price control on basic commodities in flood-hit Metro
Manila and nearby provinces for 60 days to curb market blackmail,
the newspaper Malaya reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The move came after Wednesday's convention of the National
Price Coordinating Councils, which was chaired by Trade Secretary
Jose Pardo.
</P>
<P>
The trade secretary said prices of basic commodities will be
based on the prevailing prices prior to the onset of the calamity.
</P>
<P>
Aside from Metro Manila, areas covered by the price control are
provinces of Rizal, Pampanga and Pangasinan, all of them having
been declared under a state of calamity.
</P>
<P>
Teams will be established to monitor prices, ensure adequate
supply, and intensify the price tag law and price ceilings, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
Reports said prices of fish and vegetables in Metro Manila have
risen by 20 pesos (about 0.5 U.S. dollar) per kilogram. Things
were even worse in some nearby provinces as some basic commodities
have increased by 100 percent.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft's New Dictionary Released in Print </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft, the world's
computer software giant, has released its new dictionary into the
world of print.
</P>
<P>
Print versions of the Encarta World English Dictionary were
available Wednesday in Britain, the United States and Australia.
The dictionary is also available in an electronic version.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said that its dictionary takes a global perspective,
emphasizing how the Internet has helped make English a world
language, since the majority of Web sites are written in English.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 experts from 20 English-speaking countries used
computer and Internet technology to compile the lexicon, which was
three years in the making. Microsoft said that it is the first
newly compiled dictionary released in the United States in 30
years, and the first time that print and electronic media have
been used together to develop a work of this kind.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), widely regarded
as the ultimate authority on the English language, has launched a
worldwide appeal for words as it prepares to go online to mark the
new millennium with the most comprehensive lexicon ever.
</P>
<P>
Overwhelmed by a flood of new words, phrases and technical
terms coined in the last 50 years, the OED is asking anyone who
speaks or reads English to submit new words and documentation to
lexicographers working on the first complete revision in the work'
s 120-year history.
</P>
<P>
The revision is scheduled to be completed by 2010, but the
latest edition published in 1996 will be available online next
March and is expected to be updated every six months with incoming
contributions. Because the dictionary will be online, it will
have no limits.
</P>
<P>
U.S. online medium Nando commented Wednesday that the appeal
for new words is no mere marketing gimmick. "Published evidence
must accompany the words or phrases submitted to the OED, so
contributors will have to do research," Nando said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Conducting Combat Training in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.S. military personnel
are carrying out combat training in the jungle area in eastern
Ecuador, near the shared border with Colombia, said an Ecuadorian
military sources on Wednesday who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The sources declined to reveal the number of the North
American "Jungle Brigade" and denied that the training in the
Ecuadorian Jungle Warfare School formed part of a U.S. plan of
intervention in Colombia to help fight the guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadorian defense ministry kept silent when the Colombian
newspaper "El Espectador" published an article earlier, which said
that the special forces from the United States were being prepared
for jungle warfare for future combat against the Colombian
guerrilla forces.
</P>
<P>
But the sources revealed that military personnel from Brazil,
Colombia, Bolivia, Central American countries and the United
Kingdom also received the same kind of training at the same school,
adding that their presence is only temporary and the trainees will
return to their countries of origin when the training is completed.
</P>
<P>
He said that this type of training has been taking place since
the armed conflict between Ecuador and Peru in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Sotomayor Confirmed Positive in Sample B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But the world and Olympic champion himself said through the
Cuban delegation that he is totally innocent and would appeal the
Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) decision to withdraw the
gold medal from him.
</P>
<P>
"I am very sad to come here to give you sad news, " PASO
president Dr. Mario Vazquez Rana told the reporters at a news
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The Pan Am Games laboratory in Montreal had been "carefully and
thoroughly" analyzed the urine samples from the Cuban athlete and
traces of Cocaine were found in both A and B samples, Dr. Rana
said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Eduardo de Rose, chairman of the PASO Medical Commission,
said the amount of Cocaine in Sotomayor's urine is what is usually
found in a person who takes this kind of drugs and it is a very
recent case which must have taken place in the last four or five
days.
</P>
<P>
Now it is up to the International Amatueur Athletics Federation
(IAAF) to decide the sanction of Sotomayor.
</P>
<P>
Cocaine is a stimulant drug which is very easy to be detected
and whose time of stimulation is very short. It was put at the top
of the banned drug lists of the International Olympics Committee (
IOC) since they began to conduct drug tests in 1967.
</P>
<P>
At another news conference later, Cuba acted defiantly by
declaring Sotomayor is "an innocent and dignified man" who has
never taken any banned drugs and accusing there exists some kind
of sabotage and conspiracy against the Cuban athletes.
</P>
<P>
"Javier Sotomayor is a complete sports gentleman. He
participated over 60 games and all the test results have been
negative." said Mario Granda, chief doctor of the Cuban medical
group.
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor was very "surprised" and "upset" at the positive
results and totally rejected them, Dr.Granda said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about how to explain the traces of Cocaine in the
urine sample, he said:" We have no explanation. But we're sure
that this athlete has not in-taken this substance."
</P>
<P>
He went on to say there is a "manipulation" and "clear
intention to damage Cuba" in the Sotomayor case.
</P>
<P>
It would be impossible that a herbal tea, which contains a
large amount of Cocaine and which is often used by Cuban athletes
as a helpful medication, was responsible for Sotomayor's positive
results as some media outlets indicated, Dr. Granda said.
</P>
<P>
Because the medical group have analyzed everything which was
given to him in Cuba in the last ten days and found nothing could
be responsible for the positive results, Dr.Granda said.
</P>
<P>
There must have been something given to the athlete in his food
during his stay here in the athletes village accountable for the
Cocaine traces.
</P>
<P>
"He was in a trap, " Dr. Granda said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about whether the Cuban delegation has taken some
special measures to check the food in the next couple of days to
avoid what they called the sabotage against Cubans, the reply was
no.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have special measures. We don't blame anyone or any
organization." He said.
</P>
<P>
"Sotomayor is the example of the world-wide sports. He is not
only admired by athletes, by his own people, but by everyone
associated with the sports.
</P>
<P>
"He is completely innocent; for many years he has proved
himself trustworthy and we completely trust him." Dr. Granda said.
</P>
<P>
It seems incomprehensible that Sotomayor, an experienced
athlete who set the world record of 2.45 meters in 1993 and has
been the top man in the sport for over 12 years, made such a
simple and obvious mistake.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it's a big surprise." the PASO chief Dr. Rana said,"
It might be the mistake from his physician."

<HEADLINE> Latin American Economic Growth Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Latin American economic growth
slowed down in 1998 due to the influence of the international
financial crisis and natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and
the Caribbean region (ECLA) said Wednesday in a report that
regional economic growth fell from 5.4 percent in 1997 to 2.3
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
will recover in the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Foreign capital earnings shrank to 68 billion U.S. dollars in
1998 from 85 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the region hovered around 60 billion
dollars in 1998, but bonds, bank loans and stock shares suffered a
steep decline.
</P>
<P>
The majority of South American countries registered a fall in
GDP. The economy of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay,
Peru and Venezuela fell between 3-4 percent in 1998 compared to
1997, ECLA said.
</P>
<P>
The regional inflation rate was about 10 percent in the 12
months until June of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's inflation rate reached 31 percent and Ecuador's was
more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The average unemployment rate increased from 7.5 percent in the
first half of 1998, to 8.5 percent in the same period in 1999, the
highest one in the decade.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The border zone between
Panama and Colombia has been placed under police control,
Panamanian Minister of Government and Justice Mariela Sagel said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government has sent a contingent of frontier
police to the eastern province of Darien, close to the border,
following complaints from the Colombian military authorities that
the border zone between the two countries has become a transfer
area of weapons, supposedly coming from Central America.
</P>
<P>
Sagel admitted that there had been shootings between the
Panamanian police and armed groups, but he did not confirm whether
or not the shootings involved paramilitary or guerrillas from the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
Press reports on Wednesday said there were violent clashes
between the Colombian Army and the FARC in the Colombian province
of Uraba, close to the Panamanian border. Between 15 and 40
guerrillas were killed in the clashes.

<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay will make specific
proposals at the South American Common Market (Mercosur) meetings
for resolving commercial disputes within the bloc, the local press
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Didier Opertti said that his country will
suggest setting up a technical secretariat for Mercosur to avoid
protectionist measures and coordinate the macroeconomics policies
in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayan proposal was first raised last December and has
been accepted by other Mercosur members -- Brazil, Argentina and
Paraguay, which have also agreed to introduce mechanisms to avoid
frequent unilateral measures.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of the trade war between Argentina and
Brazil, Uruguay, the ad interim president of the bloc, has called
for a meeting of the Ministers Council, the highest political body
of Mercosur, scheduled for Thursday and Friday of next week.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The number of Austria's unemployed
people in July dropped by 9.5 percent from the same month last
year with the national jobless rate down to 5.3 percent from 5.9
percent a year ago, according to statistics released by the labor
market service Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of jobless came to nearly 180,000 at the end of July,
down 9.5 percent from the figure in July last year and down 1.5
percent from the figure last month.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health, Labor and Social Affairs Lore Hostasch
attributed the plunge in unemployment to the success of the
government's job policy, which she said brought jobs to more
people, especially women, young people and people above the age of
50.
</P>
<P>
Some experts credited the favorable employment situation on the
surge in business investment in Austria and seasonal reasons.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrani Wednesday differentiated the war against drug
trafficking and that against the guerrillas in the country during
his meeting with the U.S. Chief of the "South Command," General
Charles Wilhelm.
</P>
<P>
"Colombia is facing two distinctly different wars: the war
against drug traffickers, who are not only threatening the country
but also the world, and the conflict with the guerrilla movement,
which imperils social order," elaborated the president.
</P>
<P>
He said that "it is possible to hold a dialogue with the
guerrillas to construct a third phase of democracy to untie the
principal knots of social order and put an end to the political
violence."
</P>
<P>
Wilhelm, who is on an official visit to Colombia, attended a
ceremony to create a "river brigade" of 3,000 members, which is
divided into five river battalions and one special forces unit.
The ceremony was held on Wednesday in the southern city of Puerto
Leguizamo.

<HEADLINE> Christie: "I'm Completely Innocent" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- English sprinter Linford Christie
insisted Wednesday he was "completely innocent" and vowed to clear
his name after UK Athletics revealed he had failed a drugs test.
</P>
<P>
The sport's governing body revealed that Christie tested
positive for the banned substance nandrolone at an indoor meeting
in Dortmund on February 13.
</P>
<P>
Christie has been suspended pending a disciplinary hearing but
The British 100 meters gold medallist at the Barcelona Olympics in
1992 vowed to "clear his name one way or another" and called for
an investigation into the current drug-testing system.
</P>
<P>
"I am completely innocent of any wrongdoing and any case
against me will be vigorously defended," said 39-year-old Christie.
</P>
<P>
"I have consistently opposed the use of banned substances by
athletes and it is ridiculous to imagine that I would take them
after my retirement.
</P>
<P>
"I agree that there should be a full investigation into the
numerous cases where metabolites of nandrolone have been found in
urine samples to establish how this could happen without the
knowledge of the athlete.
</P>
<P>
"They are test results. If they say they found something, they
found something. I can't dispute that.
</P>
<P>
"Some people are asking me where does it come from? I can't
tell you where it comes from."
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not upset about it because I'm innocent. If I was
guilty, then I would be upset and worried about it.
</P>
<P>
"But at the end of the day, I'm going to clear my name, one way
or another. Mistakes have been made. When I first heard it was a
quite shock but the truth will come out in the end. I've never
done it (take drugs) and I never will do it."

MEXICO CITY, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Mexico and
Venezuela renewed on Wednesday the San Jose Agreement on
providing petroleum under favorable terms to 11 nations in Central
America and the Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
In their respective capitals, Mexican Presidents Ernesto
Zedillo and his Venezuelan counterpart Hugo Chavez signed the
documents for the renewal of the agreement, officially named the "
Program of Energy Cooperation for Central America and the
Caribbean."
</P>
<P>
The San Jose Agreement has been renewed on an annual basis ever
since it was formulated on August 3, 1980, in the Costa Rican
capital from where it took its name.
</P>
<P>
Both Mexico and Venezuela supply 80,000 barrels of petroleum
under favorable terms on a daily basis to Barbados, Belize, Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua,
Panama and the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
Some of the crude supplied to these countries under the San
Jose Agreement receives 20 to 25 percent subsidies.

<HEADLINE> American Retailers Feeling E-commerce Bite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A new report released
Wednesday shows that traditional brick and mortar retailers in the
United States will begin to feel the bite from e-commerce soon.
</P>
<P>
Less than 10 percent of e-commerce revenue in 2002 will be from
incremental sales, according to the report from U.S. research firm
Jupiter Communications. This means that the bulk of the growth in
e-commerce will come from sales that would have taken place
off-line.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11.9 billion U.S. dollars in online commerce Jupiter is
predicting for 1999 in the United States, only 720 million
dollars, or six percent, will come from sales that would not have
otherwise taken place.
</P>
<P>
Jupiter estimates that the percentage of incremental sales will
grow only slightly, to 6.5 percent, or three billion dollars of
the expected 41 billion dollars, by 2002, with growth dependent on
merchants' ability to target offers and promotions.
</P>
<P>
The new research urges traditional merchants to build unified
ventures that take advantage of their off-line assets -- an
existing customer base, a trusted brand name, customer data, and
sales and distribution infrastructure. Otherwise, the research
firm said, they will risk losing sales to Internet-only merchants.
</P>
<P>
"With a few notable exceptions," the research firm said,
"traditional merchants' Internet strategies have been paralyzed by
indecision, and the merchants continue to watch Web upstarts seize
the early momentum."
</P>
<P>
Jupiter said that companies need to accept the Internet as
another channel for their business or risk losing sales to
competitors. "Building a Web site isn't really an option for
traditional merchants. It's something that they've absolutely got
to do," the research firm said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Corn Growers Call for Action to Address Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 4 (Xinhua) -- American farmers Wednesday
called on the government to take action to address their economic
concerns.
</P>
<P>
The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) chronicled in a
statement the decline in corn prices over the past few years, from
3.24 U.S. dollars per bushel for 1995, to 2.71 dollars for 1996,
2.43 dollars for 1997, 1.95 dollars for 1998, and a projected
1.65-2.05 dollars for 1999.
</P>
<P>
NCGA quoted its chairman Ryland Utlaut as saying that the U.S.
farmers continue to support a market-oriented approach to farm
policy -- an approach that allows farmers to make the basic
production decisions for their operations. But "There are other
factors that need to fall into place."
</P>
<P>
He cited affordable, effective crop insurance tools, access to
world market, research efforts and an efficient transportation
system. "Given the current state of the farm economy, there's
clearly a need for assistance," Utlaut said. "Farmers need
immediate aid to help them weather the current crisis."
</P>
<P>
Among the actions NCGA urged the government to take are
short-term relief, changes to the marketing assistance loan
program to ensure that a producer's full production is eligible
for loan deficiency payments, efforts to build export market
including reform of U.S. sanctions policies and China's admission
into the WTO.
