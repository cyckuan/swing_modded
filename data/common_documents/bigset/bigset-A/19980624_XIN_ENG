<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Leader Calls for Permanent MFN to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A top business representative of
the United States pledged here Tuesday to resist a "growing
isolationism" in the U.S. Congress while urging greater market
access for U.S. products and services in China and throughout
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Donohue, president and chief executive officer of the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who is on a three-day visit to Hong Kong
for talks with government and business leaders, made the comments
during a luncheon speech organized by the American Chamber of
Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is a powerful Washington-based
business lobby representing 3 million companies and organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The American business community is waging a strong battle
against those who would shut the United States off from world
markets," Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
"We oppose unilateral sanctions and support permanent
most-favored nation trading status for China. We want to see China
assume membership in the World Trade Organization under
commercially viable terms."
</P>
<P>
The chamber chief forecast that MFN for China "will, after the
normal noisy debate, be renewed again this year" -- setting the
stage for a push to make it permanent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Donohue emphasized, Asian economies,
including China, "must move more swiftly to open markets, increase
access to American products and services and reform economic
institutions."
</P>
<P>
"That's the key to economic revival in the region and it is
essential for maintaining positive and constructive relations with
the United States," he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his AmCham speech, Donohue will meet with Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region and other government officials and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I want to convey the message that American business greatly
values its relationship with a strong and viable Hong Kong. The
SAR is our 12th largest export market with two-way trade reaching
25 billion U.S. dollars annually. Our country has 16 billion U.S.
dollars invested here and nearly 50,000 Americans live here. Hong
Kong is our gateway to southern China and Southeast Asia," Donohue
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. chamber president also said his organization is
leading the effort in Washington, D.C., to provide 18 billion U.S.
dollars in funds to the International Monetary Fund to help
stabilize Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
Despite current economic problems, Donohue expressed confidence
in Hong Kong's economic future. "Hong Kong will reign as a global
business capital in the 21st century because the fundamentals here
are so strong," Donohue concluded.

<HEADLINE> Pudong Development Bank Moves Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong Development Bank
officially moved its headquarters today to one of the oldest bank
buildings on Shanghai famous Bund, the building formerly occupied
by the Shanghai Branch of Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank's first day of business in the new location included
granting loans of 550 million yuan for an oil tank farm project at
the Pudong Airport and the Tianjin Road Project.
</P>
<P>
The bank also relent 45.1 million U.S. dollars in foreign
government loans and export loans for a Huangpu River tunnel
project and an environmental protection project in the Pudong New
Area. It thus became the first commercial bank in China offering
relending services.
</P>
<P>
The building, which was constructed in 1923 and is famous for
both its architecture and functionality, served as the
headquarters of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government after
the founding of the new China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The government office moved in June 1995 to facilitate the
urban reconstruction program designed to restore the Bund's former
glory as a major financial center.
</P>
<P>
The bank plans to undertake an expensive refurbishing program
to transform the building into a modern banking facility.

KIEV, June 23 (Xinhua) - The rainstorms sweeping across the
middle and western Ukraine are expected to seriously damage the
grain and beet crops of the country this year, said Supikhanov,
the minister of Ariculture-Industry Complexes.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 150,000 hectares of plants had been seriously damaged,
among which 70,000 hectares might face a total crop failure,
estimated Supikhanov when interviewed by Interfax news reporters.
</P>
<P>
Recent natural disasters will most probably smash the
country's targets of producing 35 million tons of grain and 2.5
million tons of beet this year.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Wants More Say in Russia-NATO Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia wants to have more say in
its relations with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
a senior defense official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
General Leonid Ivashov, head of the Defense Ministry's main
directorate for international cooperation, told reporters that
Moscow is against NATO attempts to discuss only general issues with
it.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to speak about the character and scope of
military exercises, on training NATO armed forces, on the system
of their combat readiness, to learn about the modernization of the
NATO infrastructure," the Interfax news agency quoted Ivashov as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is prepared to disclose its plans related to all the
above issues, including on its defense policy and military
doctrine, on an equal basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, Russian defense minister Igor Sergeyev
complained to Henry Shelton, chairman of U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff, that he was misled over NATO's air exercises over Albania
and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The war games were seen as a show of force by NATO to pressure
Yugoslav President Solobodan Milosevic on its Kosovo region, where
ethnic Albanians are demanding independence.
</P>
<P>
Moscow recalled its military envoy to NATO following the
exercises. The Interfax news agency, quoting a source with the
Defense Ministry, said it was a protest against the maneuvers,
although Moscow gave no official reason for the recall.
</P>
<P>
Russia and NATO signed a Founding Act last year.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov said mutual suspicion has considerably decreased since
the signing of the document and the establishment of a Joint
Permanent Council.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO at first wanted to turn the council into a
decorative body that would allow NATO to avoid discussing with
Russia any serious issues of European security while demonstrating
"wonderful relations" between NATO and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The general listed three goals in Russia's cooperation with
NATO.
</P>
<P>
The first is to work together with NATO in changing the
approaches to building the European security system by giving top
priority to political measures and legal obligations rather than
the use of force.
</P>
<P>
The second goal, Ivashov said, is to prevent those nostalgic
for the "Cold War" from "taking us back to those times".
</P>
<P>
"Such forces do exist, and they are more numerous in NATO than
in Russia," he added.
</P>
<P>
The third goal is to use its cooperation with NATO to ensure
the security of Russia and other European countries, including
nations other than NATO members.
</P>
<P>
"If Russia is allowed to participate in NATO's activities, this
participation should be serious, constructive and fair," Ivashov
said.

<HEADLINE> Hungary's Industry on Upward Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's industrial output was
up 12.9 percent in the first four months of the year, the Ministry
of Industry, Commerce and Tourism said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As shown by official statistics, the growth was mainly the
result of a 59.4 percent upsurge in the country's machine-building
sector and a 44.8 percent rise in exports.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the four-month period also witnessed a 2.1 percent
increase in domestic industrial sales.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that the positive returns followed a 11.1
percent expansion in industrial output, a 1.2 percent decline in
domestic sales and a 34.5 percent boom in exports last year.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's industry was on a downward slope in 1990 through
1992. However, it took an upturn in 1993 and since then has
registered annual growth rates ranging from 4 to 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Malawi University Looking at New Ways to Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The University of Malawi is
looking at unusual ways ranging from embarking on industrial
production to privatizing some of its services in a bid to raise
money after the government cut its funding to the institution.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Agency Tuesday quoted Professor Brown Chimphamba,
vice-chancellor of the university, as saying in an interview in
Blantyre Monday that the time has come for the state-funded
university to follow in the footsteps of foreign universities
which fund themselves through minor industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor College, a constituent college of the university,
will set up a starch processing firm with the aim of generating
revenue for the cash-strapped institution, he sai.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the College of Medicine has embarked on
embalming bodies at a fee to raise money for its laboratory and
for the purchase of teaching facilities.
</P>
<P>
Other income-generating projects on the cards for colleges of
medicine and nursing are the running of paying wards and private
clinics.
</P>
<P>
Instead of letting the university campus lie idle during
holidays, its various facilities will be allowed to be hired for
local as well as international conferences, said Chimphamba.
</P>
<P>
It is also being negotiated within the rank and file of the
university that some course programs be run by correspondence
from diploma to degree level, especially those courses that do
not need laboratory work such as law and humanities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the university will start admitting students from
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region,
especially in the College of Medicine, who will be paying their
fees in foreign currency, said the vice-chancellor.
</P>
<P>
The university also considers to privatize some of its
departments to reduce funds it spends on these departments,
especially the catering and maintenance departments.
</P>
<P>
Other fiscal measures recommended to the university by the
Malawi Institute of Management, the consulting firm that is hired
to find ways to bail the country out of its financial crisis, is
the introduction of scholarships.
</P>
<P>
Students who do not get scholarships will be required to get
loans from banks and other financial institutions, while others
will have to get their fees from their parents or guardians,
according to Chimphamba.

<HEADLINE> Italy Advance with 2-1 Victory over Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAINT-DENIS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Italy advanced into the second
round as group winners after scratching to a 2-1 victory over Austria
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian coach Cesare Maldini surprisingly rested Roberto
Baggio who was the key to Italians' victory over Cameroon and
started Alessandro Del Piero.
</P>
<P>
But the Piero-Vieri combination didn't work well in the first
half while at the same time the Austrians fought hard and created
several chances of scoring.
</P>
<P>
After the goalless first half, the Italians took a 1-0 lead at
the 49th minute as Vieri headed home a cross from Piero.
</P>
<P>
The goal also put Viero on top of the scorers' list together
with Argentine striker Batistuta with four goals each.
</P>
<P>
Reborto Baggio replaced Piero at the 73rd minute and his
combination with another second-half substitute Filippo Inzaghi
seemed better.
</P>
<P>
Baggio beat the Austrian off-side trap with a cross which sent
Inzaghi clear. Inzaghi returned the ball to Baggio who made no
mistake in shooting at the 90th minute.
</P>
<P>
Just one minute later, the Austrian team were awarded a penalty
and Andreas Herzog converted the shot from the spot to narrow the
gap to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
The victory put Italy on top of Group B with 7 points. Chile,
which were held by Cameroon to a 1-1 draw, also qualified with 3
points from three draws.
</P>
<P>
Chile will take on Group A leaders Brazil in the round of 16
while Italy play second qualifiers from Group A.

NEW DELHI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming Colombo summit
of the South Asian countries would enable India and Pakistan to
decide on how to proceed further with the stalled bilateral
dialogue, said Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said in a letter to his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz
Sharif, on June 14 that the presence of the two prime ministers in

to develop a stable structure of cooperation between the two
neighbors, according to the letter made public here Tuesday by a

</P>
<P>
Prime ministers of the two countries are scheduled to meet at
the Colombo summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) which is scheduled to open on July 29.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Vajpayee urged Pakistan to engage in dialogue with

<HEADLINE> Greece, Macedonia Oppose Military Intervention on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece and the Republic of
Macedonia, a former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), have
agreed on peaceful means rather than military option to resolve
the crisis raging through the Serbian southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said after talks with
his FYROM counterpart Blagoj Handziski that they had lots to gain
with a peaceful resolution and much to lose with military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Handziski, who is on a two-day trip in Greece
starting on Monday, said the two nations shared the same view on
the crisis of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians seek independence
from Belgrade and integration into Albania.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has stripped the autonomy in early 1990s from ethnic
Albanians who make up 90 percent of the Kosovo population and has
built up military presence for crackdown on break-away Albanians
in the province.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people, most of whom women, children and the
elderly, have died this year in fighting between Serb forces and
ethnic Albanians since the tensions escalated in February.
</P>
<P>
The tour of Handziski is the first by such a high-ranking
representative of the FYROM and follows a visit to Skopje by
Pangalos last year.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have improved in recent
years, but both sides remain divided over a final name for the
FYROM.
</P>
<P>
Greece believes any use of the name "Macedonia" implies claims
on the northern Greek province of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said both sides have agreed on keeping the examination
of the name issue within the framework of the United Nations,
while Handziski said efforts were made to achieve a desired result
through reciprocal compromise.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Launches Plan for Humanitarian Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland formally launched
Tuesday its plan for a humanitarian fund to combat poverty,
violence and human rights abuses but the plan would have to await
Swiss voters' consent.
</P>
<P>
The planned Solidarity Foundation will be open for public
comment until mid-September with a view to submitting draft
legislation to parliament before the end of the year, the Swiss
Finance Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss will vote in a referendum to decide on amending the
constitution and abolishing Switzerland's gold backing for the
Swiss franc. This would provide around 4.7 billion U.S. dollars of
gold for the fund and some 6.7 billion U.S. dollars for other
purposes.
</P>
<P>
After the plan to halve gold reserves was approved on May 27 by
the cabinet, Swiss Finance Minister Kaspar Villiger told reporters
that he hoped the parliament would pass the plan by the end of
this year and that a referendum could follow in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
Villiger said that Switzerland could not start selling half of
its gold reserves before late 1999 or early 2000.
</P>
<P>
To avoid disrupting prices on world gold markets, Villiger
said, the selling of roughly half of Switzerland's gold reserves
would probably be spread over five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to set up the Solidarity Foundation was announced
in March 1997 by the then Swiss president Arnold Koller.

<HEADLINE> WFP Seals Deals with Zambia in Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) signed here Tuesday two agreements with the Zambian
government totalling about 25 million U.S. Dollars in food aid to
support the country's nutrition and food-for-work activities.
</P>
<P>
At a signing ceremony held at the Ministry of Finance, WFP
representative Techeste Zergaber said the assistance is part of
the five-year commitment of 31.9 million Dollars under the new
country program approved last October by the WFP executive board,
according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
He said 47,723 tons of food aid and essential non-food items
will be provided under the agreement for the implementation of
the supplementary feeding and urban food-for-work activities.
</P>
<P>
The supplement will boost the nutrition status of
malnourished children, expectant and breast-feeding mothers,
orphans and the chronically ill, and patients suffering from
tuberculosis (TB).
</P>
<P>
Zergaber said 30,136 tons of maize meal, sugar, pulse, dried
skim milk and high energy protein supplement is targeted for
228,000 malnourished under-five children, 60,000 pregnant and
lactating women and over 52,000 orphans.
</P>
<P>
Under Zambia's urban food-for-food work program, more than
17,500 tons of maize meal, vegetable oil, pulse and salt will be
distributed to 45,000 food insecure low-income residents in the
unplanned urban settlements.
</P>
<P>
David Diangamo, acting permanent secretary of Ministry of
Finance who signed on behalf of the Zambian government, praised
WFP for the initiative and commitment in the funding of the two
programs which are ready for implementation.
</P>
<P>
He described the assistance as "timely", adding that it will
help improve the social conditions as well as raise the standard
of living of the Zambian people.

This decision came despite a car bomb blast and a grenades
explosion went off here in the capital in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of the ban was announced by its embassy in Beirut
in a statement, which says the U.S. allows its airlines to sell
tickets for trips to Lebanon and transport baggages for its
citizens and foreigners to Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imposed the ban on its airlines after a suicide truck
bombing in 1983 killed 241 U.S. servicemen and separate attacks on
U.S. embassy and citizens in 1984 in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. has removed the ban on its citizens
travelling here last year and the ban concerning airlines, it
still refuses to reopen direct flights to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of States Madeleine Albright has warned that
Lebanon is still a dangerous place to visit.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, three rocket-propelled grenades exploded only 500
meters away from the U.S. Embassy in the eastern part of Beirut,
causing no damage to people and the compound.
</P>
<P>
Three days earlier, a booby-trapped car exploded in the
capital's commercial area, claiming two persons' lives.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese politicians said these incidents, which are under
investigations, were intended to hurt the stability of Lebanon
which is recovering from the devastating 1975-1990 civil war.

<HEADLINE> EU Disburses Funds for Research Activities in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A grant of 4.5 million U.S.
Dollars from the European Union (EU) to finance research and
training activities for small-scale growers has been disbursed to
the cotton and coffee association in Zimbabwe to date, an
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
EU economic advisor Jose Leandro told the Zimbabwe News Agency
that more money was available for the current financial
difficulty as long as the trust that deals with the issue decided
on the activities to be financed.
</P>
<P>
"We have disbursed most of the money, and we are still waiting
for budgetary requirements for coffee growers," Leandro said.
</P>
<P>
The two boards that represented coffee and cotton growers had
to identify specific training and research activities needed to
be funded for more than 900 small scale farmers.
</P>
<P>
The EU had been funding coffee and cotton activities in
Zimbabwe since 1992. Communal growers are now producing 70
percent of cotton in the country.

<P>
Jose Sierra blasted a curvy, booming free kick into the upper right
corner of the goal in the 21st minute to put Chile 1-0 ahead for the

The Indomitable Lions rallied strongly and equalized four minutes
later on a Patrick Mboma header.

<HEADLINE> World Grain Prices at Levels 5 Years Ago: IGC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- As a result of two successive large
world harvests, grain prices were back almost to their low levels
five years ago, the International Grains Council (IGC) announced
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the volume of trade in 1998/99 would probably show
little change, world demand was continuing to expand, but at a
slower pace particularly in Pacific Asia, the IGC said.
</P>
<P>
Assisted by the recent moderate rebuilding of stocks, the
council estimated an approximate balance between total grain
supply and demand in 1998/99 would be achieved.
</P>
<P>
At its latest semi-annual session, the council said the members
exchanged views on the possible grains trade implications of the
Biosafety Protocol being negotiated under U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the council requested the Secretariat to begin
to monitor government decisions in both exporting and importing
countries concerning approvals of genetically modified cereals in
production and trade.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Argentina, the council decided that it
will hold a Special Grains Conference on 2 December 1998 in Buenos
Aires on the theme "Facing the new century challenges for grain
markets."
</P>
<P>
Participants will focus on the next WTO negotiations, the
development and enlargement of regional trading arrangements, and
the prevailing market perspectives for different sectors of the
world grains economy, the IGC added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations between the
Zimbabwean government and the Civil Service Employees Association
(CSEA) over increases in the cost of living adjustment and other
allowances have come to a deadlock, CSEA officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The association's assistant executive secretary Christopher
Gwatidzo said representatives of the government and the
association met last week but could not reach an agreement as
there was a big gap between the government's offer and the civil
servants' demands.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was adjourned after civil servants representatives
requested to consult with the workers, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Gwatidzo said the civil servants are demanding a 30 percent
cost of living adjustment. But the government is offering
between nine and ten percent.
</P>
<P>
The government is also proposing to increase transport and
housing allowances by 30 and 40 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
CSEA President Kudakwashe Sinyoro said his association will
hold a meeting with the government representatives on Wednesday
and, if no agreement is reached, civil servants will go on strike
any time from next Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- For the year ending 30 June 1998,
shipment under the Food Aid Convention were estimated to total
over 5.4m. tons compared with 5.7m. in the previous year, the Food
Aid Committee announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The shipments therefore remained slightly abover members'
combined minimum obligation of 5.35m. tons, the committee said in
its statement released here.
</P>
<P>
The committee noted that, because of increases in other forms
of assistance to countries in Asia, Australia was obliged to
reduce its minimum annual commitment from 300,000 tons to 250,000
tons with effect from 1 July 1998.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that cereals production in many countries was
likely to remain above trend in 1998. However, several countries
were facing food emergencies, largely because of EI Nino related
floods or droughts.
</P>
<P>
The Food Aid Committee said that lower international wheat
prices were reducing the food import bills of many developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, import costs for a number of least developed countries
had increased because of their larger requirements.
</P>
<P>
The committee expressed great concern at the worsening food
situation in some countries in Far East Asia, especially
Indonesia, where food prices were escalating beyond the reach of
many of the poorest people.
</P>
<P>
The committee confirmed its intention to bring a new Food Aid
Convention into effect on 1 July 1999. To this end, it will aim to
complete the substantive negotiations by the time of its next
session.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests against Turkish Nuclear Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot parliament has
protested against Turkey's plan to build two nuclear reactors on
its southern coast, near the divided Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
In a letter released to the press Tuesday, President of the
Cypriot House of Representatives Spyros Kyprianou told his
counterparts of Mediterranean and European Union countries that
Turkey's plan is "causing a lot of uneasiness and anxiety to the
people of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reportedly decided to construct two nuclear reactors
this year in the earthquake-prone area of Akkuyu on its southern
coast, about 185 kilometers north of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot people have "legitimate concerns about the impacts
on life, health and environment emanating from such reactors,"
Kyprianou said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Cyprus' strong objection to the materialization of
the Turkish plan and demanded that all possible measures be taken
so that Turkey refrain from going ahead with its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
He quoted results of independent studies as saying that the
proposed venue of the reactors is close to the Akkuyu fault, an
active seismic zone, which makes the selection of this particular
area an extremely dangerous and risky option.
</P>
<P>
He said the proximity of Cyprus to Akkuyu, its small size, and
prevailing wind patterns and sea currents "are serious parameters
that will exacerbate the magnitude of the impact" in case of an
earthquake, malfunction, poor operation or even under normal
operating conditions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
troops and took over the northern third in the wake of a failed
coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Congress to Take Over if Government Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader of Congress said
Tuesday that his party would not hesitate to "discharge its
responsibility" to form a government at the center in the event of
the fall of the government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP).
</P>
<P>
"In case the Vajpayee government collapses under its own
weight, Congress party will definitely discharge its
responsibility," Arjun Singh told reporters following a four-hour
meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC).
</P>
<P>
Former Indian Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar Monday accused the
BJP-led government of failure on all fronts and asked Congress to
take the initiative to unite all secular forces for the ouster of
the government.
</P>
<P>
Singh, a CWC member, declined to comment on Shekhar's
statement, but he said suggestions made at the CWC meeting for the
formation of an alternative government were noted.
</P>
<P>
Congress has already made its stand clear that it would provide
constructive opposition to the government in matters of national
interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are, however, aware of the fast deteriorating situation in
the country -- political, economic and otherwise," Singh said,
adding that consolidation of secular forces "remains an important
issue for us."
</P>
<P>
Congress would keep a close and constant watch on the
developing situation in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the CWC meeting, Singh said it expressed serious concern
over the rising prices of essential commodities which have caused
acute hardships to the masses.
</P>
<P>
The "government does not seem to have any rational program to
meet the situation," he charged.

<HEADLINE> Italian Delegation in Somalia in Peace Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A three-member high level
delegation from the government of Italy is now in the Somali
capital Mogadishu for a reported new assessment regarding
Somalia's peace process.
</P>
<P>
The delegation led by General Luka Rabiola, arrived here late
Monday afternoon and was escorted by heavily armed militiamen to
the part of the city controlled by faction leader Ali Mahdi
Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
According to the top officers of Ali Mahdi Mohamed, Rabiola
and his delegation has met Ali Mahdi Mohamed and senior officials
from his faction at his residence Monday night and discussed
about several issues concerning the political and socio-economic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The scope of the visit by the delegation is said to be related
to a new assessment by Italy regarding Somalia's peace process
and the political settlement in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said the delegation is trying to find
possible ways in which Italy could help in the re-establishment
of Mogadishu's public services including the health, water,
electricity and road communications sectors.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Ali Mahdi's office also said the delegation,
which will also meet other faction leaders in the capital, is
aimed at consolidating an earlier agreed tentative in which a
strong police force will be established for Mogadishu with the
help of the Italian government.
</P>
<P>
Italy has agreed upon the maintenance of a 5,000-strong police
force for the capital and its surrounding areas at this
particular moment when Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein Mohamed
Aidid could be characterized as very close allies for the first
time since the civil war broke out in Somalia, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi's officials have characterized the meeting as
cordial and fruitful.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, in collaboration with some Somalis, is also
trying to normalize a strained relation between some of north
Mogadishu subclans and Italy following the arrest of a Somali
man, Hashi Omar, in Rome on January 12 this year for allegedly
involving in the killing of an Italian journalist, Elaria Alpi
and her camera man, in Mogadishu in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Giuseppe Cassini, Italy's former special envoy to Somalia,
took Hashi Omar from Mogadishu together with a group of Somalis
as testimonies for the Italian troops' human rights violations
during their stay in Somalia as part of the UNOSOM forces.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the north Mogadishu politicians have
managed to calm down the relatives of Hashi Omar before the
Italian delegation arrived Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest level Italian delegation that visits
Mogadishu since the visit of the Italian Under Secretary of State
Rino Serri on July 29 last year, when the diplomacy of Italy has
failed to bring together Mogadishu's faction leaders on a common
luncheon sponsored by Cassini.

<HEADLINE> Arab League to Discuss Jerusalem Expansion Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) will hold a
meeting Thursday to discuss the impacts of an Israeli plan to
expand the authority of Jerusalem, the Middle East News Agency
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, at the level of permanent delegates to AL and to
be held at Palestinians' request, will come up with measures to
deal with the critical situation in the Mideast peace process,
Palestinian delegate Mohamed Sobeih told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that he reported the preliminary information on
Israel's plan during a meeting of permanent delegates, and handed
a note to AL chief Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Monday, outlining
the Israeli expansion scheme of the holy city.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet Sunday approved the expansion plan, which
will set up an "umbrella authority" for the Jerusalem municipality
over eight West Bank Jewish settlements to the north, east and
south of the city.
</P>
<P>
Under agreement signed between the Palestinians and Israel, the
issue of Jerusalem will be negotiated in the final status talks
and neither side should take unilateral actions to change the
status of the city.
</P>
<P>
Should the expansion plan be implemented, Israel will increase
the area of Jerusalem to 600 square kilometers from 108 square
kilometers, the Palestinian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government is paving roads leading up to Jerusalem
which incurs forfeiture of more Palestinian property and lands and
the isolation of Arab suburbs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem in the
1967 Middle East War. Relevant United Nations Security Council
resolutions stipulate that East Jerusalem is part of the occupied
Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their
future independent state.

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Increase Fishing Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Namibia said Tuesday it
would increase fishing quotas because stocks along the country's
coast have recovered.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by the Chamber of Commerce and
Industry in the port-city of Walvis Bay, 389 kilometers west of
the capital, Windhoek, the Southern African Broadcasting
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Stefan Hrywniak, president of the chamber, said a report by
fisheries experts has confirmed the revival of depleted marine
resource.
</P>
<P>
Hywniak said the renewal of the industry will make up losses
suffered during poor fishing seasons in the recent years.
</P>
<P>
The city of Walvis Bay, whose port is the deepest in southern
Africa, is 70 percent dependent on fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
Catches of different fish species was cut last year due to bad
weather condition, which drastically reduced Namibia's fish
stocks.
</P>
<P>
Fishing is one of Namibia's key economic sectors, accounting
for at least 11 percent of total export earnings per year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa arrived Saudi capital Riyadh Tuesday for a session of the
Joint Egyptian-Saudi Higher Committee due later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and his Saudi counterpart Prince Saud Al-Faisal will
co-chair the meeting. Egypt's ambassador to Saudi Arabia Helmi
Bdeir said the talks will focus on ways of promotion of bilateral
ties and latest developments in the Arab and Islamic worlds.
</P>
<P>
Bdeir was quoted by the Kuwait News Agency as saying the
discussion will also cover issues related to the stalled Middle
East peace process and current efforts to hold an Arab summit to
counter Israel's anti-peace policy.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Gulf region and the development of
relations with Iran will also be tackled by the two foreign
ministers, Bdeir said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said a preparatory meeting was held to
finalize the agenda for the session of the Joint Higher
Committee. Abu Zaid, Moussa's aid, said they discussed economic,
trade and investment cooperation, bilateral agreements and
protocols.
</P>
<P>
Deals on oil, health and technical cooperation, encouraging
tourism and the establishment of a free trade zone were also
discussed in the preparatory meeting, Abu Zaid said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests against Turkish Nuclear Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot parliament has
protested against Turkey's plan to build two nuclear reactors on
its southern coast, near the divided Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
In a letter released to the press Tuesday, President of the
Cypriot House of Representatives Spyros Kyprianou told his
counterparts of Mediterranean and European Union countries that
Turkey's plan is "causing a lot of uneasiness and anxiety to the
people of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reportedly decided to construct two nuclear reactors
this year in the earthquake-prone area of Akkuyu on its southern
coast, about 185 kilometers north of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot people have "legitimate concerns about the impacts
on life, health and environment emanating from such reactors,"
Kyprianou said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Cyprus' strong objection to the materialization of
the Turkish plan and demanded that all possible measures be taken
so that Turkey refrain from going ahead with its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
He quoted results of independent studies as saying that the
proposed venue of the reactors is close to the Akkuyu fault, an
active seismic zone, which makes the selection of this particular
area an extremely dangerous and risky option.
</P>
<P>
He said the proximity of Cyprus to Akkuyu, its small size, and
prevailing wind patterns and sea currents "are serious parameters
that will exacerbate the magnitude of the impact" in case of an
earthquake, malfunction, poor operation or even under normal
operating conditions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
troops and took over the northern third in the wake of a failed
coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Brent Crude Futures Celebrate 10 Years of Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Petroleum
Exchange's (IPE) biggest contract, Brent Crude futures, celebrates
its 10th birthday here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Brent futures form part of the Brent Blend complex, which acts
as the pricing benchmark for two thirds of the world's
internationally traded crude oil supplies in the Middle East,
Europe, North and South America, Africa and the Far East.
</P>
<P>
The IPE said Brent is among the top three most actively traded
energy futures contracts in the world. The success of the contract
has helped the IPE to evolve into a truly global institution of
offering risk management facilities to companies all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
This year has been the most successful yet for the contract. So
far this year volumes traded have reached 6,622,927 lots (more
than 6.6 billion barrels). This represents a 40 percent increase
on the same period for last year.
</P>
<P>
On average Brent futures have traded almost 57,000 lots a day
in 1998 (57 million barrels a day). This is equivalent to about 75
percent of daily world oil consumption.
</P>
<P>
Lynton Jones, chief executive of the IPE, said, "The rapid
expansion of the IPE's business over the last 10 years has been
largely due to the success of Brent Crude."

<HEADLINE> WFP Expands Operations to Supply Food to Hungry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
said Tuesday that it has decided to establish and expand
alternate transport and logistics arrangements to ensure the
delivery of urgently needed humanitarian food aid to
approximately 4.3 million vulnerable people in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
A news release issued here by Justin Bagirishya, WFP country
director in Ethiopia, said the measures are taken in response to
the ongoing conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea which diverts
from Eritrean ports of Massawa and Assab to the port of Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
According to the news release, WFP negotiated this week with
Ethiopian officials, Djibouti seaport representatives and
transport companies to ensure that over the coming months 240,000
metric tons of much-needed food aid will be regularly processed
through the port of Djibouti and safely delivered by rail cars
and trucks.
</P>
<P>
WFP is also in the process of hiring some 200 commercial
trucks to ensure that once food aid is released from the port, it
can be quickly delivered to the needy, the release added.
</P>
<P>
The 240,000 tons of food aid were contributed to Ethiopia by
WFP, the European Union and others.

<HEADLINE> EU, Israel Hold Talks on Promoting Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
Israel Tuesday held talks here on promoting the economy of the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation headed by EU Middle East peace envoy
Miguel Moratinos included British Ambassador to Israel David
Anning and other senior EU officials.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli side, General Director on Economic Affairs of
the Foreign Ministry Victor Harel and some senior officials from
the Labor Ministry and Finance Ministry took part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
During the session, Harel briefed the EU officials on the
latest developments in the Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry, more
Palestinians have been allowed to work in Israel since the
beginning of this year. And the number of Palestinian businessmen
operating in Israel also increased.
</P>
<P>
The EU officials said that they hope Israel would continuously
improve the employment situation for the Palestinian workers and
give more freedom of movement to Palestinian businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that
the Palestinian economy has been improved after his government
imposed less sanctions against the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
But the EU argued that the Israeli government should take
more positive measures to lower restrictions on the Palestinian
economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moratinos also briefed the Israeli officials on
his recent visit to Syria, saying that Syria wants to resume
the peace talks with Israel which have been stalled since 1996.
</P>
<P>
But Syria, he noted, insists on its condition that the peace
process between Syria and Israel would be revived only after the
Israeli government accepted the principle of returning the Golan
Heights in exchange for peace.

<HEADLINE> British Paper Stands by S. African-Libyan Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- London's Sunday Telegraph
newspaper stuck to its weekend report of a secret
500-million-U.S. dollar arms-for-oil deal between South Africa
and Libya, despite denials by the South African government, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Con Coughlin, the newspaper's foreign editor who wrote the
story, said he "stood behind the story 100 percent," SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Coughlin said in a statement faxed to SAPA that he was
surprised at the vehemence of the South African government's
denial, given that the deal had been negotiated when South
African President Nelson Mandela visited Libya last year.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to check the story with South African authorities
proved futile "because of their desire to keep details of the
arrangement secret," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly I cannot reveal my sources on such a sensitive
subject. To do so would be to place them in peril."
</P>
<P>
Mandela's office said in a statement Monday that the paper
should at least try to verify its information with
representatives of the South African government.
</P>
<P>
"What is utterly disgusting about this article is that it is a
pure fabrication invented by the newspaper and its unnamed
sources," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Coughlin denied the South African government's claim that the
purpose of the story was to sabotage the country's democracy.
</P>
<P>
"I covered the 1994 elections for the Sunday Telegraph and
greatly admired the manner in which Present Nelson Mandela
conducted himself during the campaign."
</P>
<P>
Coughlin reported on Sunday that Mandela had approved a deal
to supply Libya with weapons and military spare parts in return
for cut-price oil in violation of United Nations sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The statement of the South African side said neither Mandela
nor the government and its agencies had entered into any talks --
let alone concluded any deals -- with Libya on arms for oil.
</P>
<P>
If such a decision was ever taken, the government would
publicly declare its intentions and fully state its reasons for
doing so, it said.
</P>
<P>
An arms embargo and flight ban were imposed on Libya after the
1988 Lockerbie air crash over Scotland, in which two Libyans were
suspected to have bombed the Pan Am aircraft.
</P>
<P>
South Africa maintains close relations with Libya, which was
accused by the West of sponsoring terrorism. Mandela visited
Libya twice in October last year.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Says Arab Reconciliation on Bumpy Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said Tuesday that the Arab reconciliation process is still on a
bumpy road, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the ruling National Democratic Party members of the
newly-elected Shura Council, Mubarak noted that the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 torpedoed all efforts to effect Arab
reconciliation which was "within reach in that year."
</P>
<P>
"At the time, the Arab leaders were about to agree on meeting
for regular summits every November," he added.
</P>
<P>
"But now Arab reconciliation is facing some obstacles," the
Egyptian leader said.
</P>
<P>
Citing the differences which preceded the June 1996 pan-Arab
summit in Cairo, Mubarak said convening an Arab summit now is "not
so easy as it requires reconciling all orientations and interests."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president made the comments as the Arab countries
are holding consultations on the possibility of holding an Arab
summit to hammer out a unified position in the deadlocked Mideast
peace process. But differences have been reported on the venue,
timing and agenda of the summit proposed by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been stagnated since Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Arab economic cooperation, Mubarak said Egypt is
seeking to set up free trade zones with a number of Arab countries
with a view to facilitating the project of an Arab Common Market.
</P>
<P>
"However, no development is possible without stability, which
in turn would not be achieved without peace," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated his initiative to free the Middle East
from all weapons of mass destruction. In this connection, he
highlighted his proposal to convene an international conference
under the United Nations on phasing out nuclear weaponry from the
whole world between 15 and 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"The countries of the world are convinced that there is a
danger posed to humanity and this can not be controlled in view of
the arms race as happened in India and Pakistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that Egypt does not intend to possess nuclear arms.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Opportunity for Developing Sino-U.S. Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- In a few days' time,
U.S. President Bill Clinton will be in China for nine days, making
himself the first U.S. head of state in Beijing in nine years.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it will be President Clinton's first overseas tour
dedicated to a single nation ever since he assumed the White House
presidency more than five years ago. The travel arrangement alone
reflects the priority given by the Clinton administration to
pushing ahead U.S. relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's visit to China is in return to Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's tour of the United States last October, during which
they agreed to initiate the process of building a constructive and
strategic Sino-U.S. partnership oriented toward the 21st century,
thus bringing the bilateral ties onto a new stage of growth.
</P>
<P>
Since President Jiang's U.S. tour, the momentum has been
building up for positively moving ahead the Sino-U.S. relations,
shown firstly in increased high-level exchanges of officials
nourishing their mutual understanding and coordination in
bilateral and international affairs; and secondly in expanded
channels for bilateral cooperation, including putting a 13-year
agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy into real practice
in March and subsequently allowing U.S. companies to compete on
the China market for supplying nuclear power facilities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, recent months have witnessed the two sides signing
agreements to establish a consultation mechanism for maritime
military safety and open up a presidential communications link
between Beijing and Washington, working more closely to fight
international drug trafficking rings, and exploring the avenues
for cooperation in areas such as environmental protection, energy
industry, and financial and insurance services.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, despite the Asian financial turmoil, economic
relations between China and the United States have been further
expanding, with their bilateral trade on the continued rise. And
confident about the sustainability of a healthy Chinese economy,
U.S. companies are enthusiastic about investing in China.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, both sides are taking positive steps to handle their
differences. On March 14, the Clinton administration announced
that it would no longer co-sponsor a resolution against China at
the United Nations conference on human rights in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Fifthly, on the issue of Taiwan, Clinton administration
officials have repeated, on different occasions, their commitment
not to support the concept of "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan," and not to back Taiwan's attempt for independence or
entry into the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Sixthly, the two countries have stepped up their consultation
and coordination on world affairs. One example was the June 4
meeting of foreign ministers from the five permanent member countries
of the U.N. Security Council in Geneva to curb a potential nuclear
arms race in South Asia. It was jointly proposed by China and the
United States, and chaired by China.
</P>
<P>
Noticeably, due to their different social systems, cultures and
historic backgrounds, China and the United States do hold
different views on certain issues. And the development of their
bilateral ties still has to face up to interference from some
forces within the United States. By submitting an anti-China
proposal prior to Clinton's visit to China, some lawmakers in
U.S. Congress were attempting to block and disrupt the improvement
of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
However, the expansion of Sino-U.S. relations is the trend of
the time and the call of the two peoples. It is increasingly a
collective will of most Americans to maintain and better friendly
cooperation with China. On his part, President Clinton recently
told a group of U.S.-based Chinese journalists that he would
continue to stick up to his China policy of engagement and do his
best to defeat any legislation in Congress that would undermine
the ability of his administration to pursue the interests of the
United States and the interests of the American people in
developing a partnership with China and the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
From the "Ping-Pong diplomacy" in the early 1970s to the
commitment to a constructive and strategic partnership,
Sino-U.S. relations have not always been on a smooth development
path. While China is the world's largest developing country and
the United States the largest developed one, their relations are
crucial not only for the interests of the two countries and the
two peoples, but also for the peace and stability of Asia and the
world as a whole. With the end of the Cold War era and the shift
of the world towards multipolarization, interests shared by China
and the United States have not decreased, but rather increased. As
stated by Clinton in his meeting with Chinese journalists, current
cooperation between his country and China is more important than
any previous year's.
</P>
<P>
A recent public opinion poll in the United States suggests that
78 percent of Americans questioned favors Clinton's visit to
China, hoping that the two countries will further expand
cooperation. A number of American personages, including senior
officials in both present and former U.S. administrations, have
pointed out that Clinton's planned China tour is in line with the
interests of the United States. Noting that the two countries
share common interests in many ways, they have stressed that the
two sides should try their best to expand cooperation and reduce
divergences.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that President Clinton's visit to China would
help push forward the process initiated by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin for establishing between the two countries a constructive
and strategic partnership oriented toward the 21st century.

Eritrean ports of Massawa and Assab.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ethiopian News Agency Tuesday reported that
regions and various sections of the society in the country have
contributed so far over 42 million Birr (6 million U.S Dollars)
in support of the defense force and persons displaced by the war.
</P>
<P>
Data compiled by the agency indicate various regions donated
over 42 million Birr (6 million U.S. Dollars) up until June 22
and the figure does not include the salary pledged by civil
servants, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Urged to Get Used to Drinking Milk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma Tuesday called on citizens to get accustomed to
drinking milk which has not been habitual in the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
"Drinking milk is good to your health," Juma said while
inaugurating the Dairy Week exhibitions at Mnazi Mmoja grounds in
Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the speech, Juma inspected a procession of farmers,
dairymen and veterinarians who came from different parts of the
country to take part in the event, scheduled from June 23 to 27.
</P>
<P>
He also urged farmers to pay greater attention to quality than
quantity in cattle raising, saying too many large herds of cattle
are detrimental to the environment.
</P>
<P>
"Let us follow Botswana's style," he said. "The cattle are
kept in a few number but in high quality."
</P>
<P>
Juma suggested the application of modern techniques which he
said is the only solution to improving the quality in cattle
raising.

"Improve your quality so that the milk can meet the demand of
exports," he said to the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Vice-President said the government plans to
grant loans to local dairymen and urged them to form societies so
that they can be easier in getting loans.
</P>
<P>
Considering loans security, he said, it is difficult for the
government to grant loans to individuals who are not financially
strong.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Exhibitions Committee, Ngweshani Mbonde,
in his welcoming speech, prayed the government to exempt animal
husbandry from the Value Added Tax (VAT) as the industry is still
young.
</P>
<P>
Mbonde told reporters Monday that apart from the exhibitions,
participants will learn modern ways of farming and discuss how to
solve common problems.
</P>
<P>
This week's program includes distributing milk in different
dispensaries and hospitals in the city as a way of encouraging
milk drinking.
</P>
<P>
"It is shameful for a country like ours to have children
starving while we have so much milk only because milk drinking is
unaccustomed," he said.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Assures Residents of Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Tuesday assured the people of Fort Portal in the west and Uganda
in general of the government's determination to provide them with
security.
</P>
<P>
He made the assurance while visiting the Kichwamba Technical
College in western Kabarole district where over 80 students were
burnt to death and more than 100 others abducted by rebels of the
Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) on June 8, Radio Uganda reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said although there are some laxities in the army
which were held partly responsible for the massacre, the
government is trying to arm the army with better equipment
against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The president paid his deepest condolences to the families of
the dead and abducted as well as to all the people in Kichwamba,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to ADF rebels to lay down arms and surrender and
warned that this is the only way out for them. With the
modernization of the army, he said he believed the rebels will
have no chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, the president arrayed fears that rebels
have been gaining in strength, saying that some 300 rebels active
in the north have surrendered under the mounting pressure from
the government.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 ADF rebels staged a surprise pre-dawn attack at the
Kichwamba Technical College on June 8. Over 80 students in three
dormitories were killed in an inferno and more were abducted to
reinforce the rebels.
</P>
<P>
This relentless act of terror triggered fast fire from all
walks of life in Uganda and from the international community,
making the rebels' lonely base in the border area more isolated.

NANTES, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Cameroon coach Claude Leroy on Tuesday
said the disallowed goal by Francois Omam Biyick was a good one.
</P>
<P>
"I've seen the replay; there wasn't even a shadow of a foul on that

We would accept being eliminated, but not like that," said the coach

He added, "It has been a two-month long adventure. The team has
been great. They played really well against Austria. It's a shame they
scored a goal towards the end."
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman said, "This has been a tremendous World Cup,
organized in an excellent way... We must let bygones be bygones. It's
the end of the road for me here."

<HEADLINE> Demirel: Turkey to Advance Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
said here Tuesday that Turkey attaches great importance to the
advancement of the Middle East peace process, which has been
deadlocked for 15 months.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with visiting Palestinian Minister of
Higher Education Hanan Ashrawi, Demirel said in a written
statement that Turkey will continue to make contributions to the
peace process in the Middle East and to the peace and prosperity
of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
On her part, Ashrawi, who arrived here on Monday for a two-day
visit, said that she had informed Demirel of the latest
developments in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi said she believed that Turkey will make contributions
to pushing forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will pay an official visit
to Turkey soon, she added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry
Tuesday said that "the Israeli decision to expand Jerusalem will
not contribute to stability and peace in the Middle East, although
it is said that the plan is based on just reasons."
</P>
<P>
It stressed that Turkey is opposed to unilateral modifications
in the status of Jerusalem, which is the core issue of the peace
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is concerned with the present state of the Middle East
peace process. Turkey demands that the obstacles in the way of the
peace process be lifted and the Oslo Agreement be obeyed," said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been deadlocked since March
last year over Israel's settlement building in East Jerusalem and
long-delayed withdrawal from the West Bank. Israel has rejected
a U.S. proposal on further redeployment, which was accepted by
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Turkey enjoyed close relations with
Israel. The military cooperation between the two countries has
sparked anger among Arab countries, particularly Syria who
believes it is the target of Turkish-Israeli military ties.

Nesta is injured and will undergo an MRI scan in the next 24 hours
to determine the extent of the injury. We are sad to report that he

<HEADLINE> White House Unveils New Measures to Protect Medicare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
unveiled Tuesday new measures for protecting some 38 million
beneficiaries of Medicare -- the federal health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
The new rules require health plans to guarantee that Medicare
patients have access to specialists, keep medical records
confidential and provide interpreters to those who need them. The
rules are scheduled to be published Friday and take effect 30 days
later.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the announcement in the Rose Garden. He hoped his
action would push Congress to approve legislation guaranteeing
such rights to all Americans.
</P>
<P>
"This marks the most significant change in Medicare in three
decades. It shows what we can do when we put progress over
partisanship," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The Medicare regulations, designed to set "uniform national
performance standards," are tighter than those governing private
health insurance companies in many states. Congress agreed to most
of the new protections as part of last year's balanced-budget act,
which also cleared the way for a wider variety of private health
plans to serve the elderly starting next year.
</P>
<P>
Switching to a private plan won't be mandatory, but officials
predict that by 2005, 30 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries
will choose to join one.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most senior citizens just have their medical bills
sent directly to Medicare, which pays them one by one. Lawmakers
think Medicare can save money by instead paying a fixed price to
insurance companies willing to take on the financial risk that
some people will need more care than others.
</P>
<P>
The rules also allow women beneficiaries to demand "direct
access to a women's health specialist" for routine services.
</P>
<P>
Patients with complicated problems must also be permitted to go
directly to specialists in some circumstances, and a health plan
must rule on a patient's request for services within 14 days in
most cases or 72 hours in urgent cases.
</P>
<P>
The new rules also require health care plans to provide
services "in a culturally competent manner" to all Medicare
patients, including those with limited English or reading skills.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, health maintenance organizations must pay
for the treatment of any condition that "a prudent lay person"
would regard as an emergency.

<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China plans to tighten controls
over the management of administrative charges and fines in a move
to rectify state financial order and improve administrative and
law enforecement departments.
</P>
<P>
A regulation issued today stipulates that items and criteria
for administrative charges must be strictly carried out in
accordance withe relevant directives issued the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China and State Council. Departments are
prohibited from setting charge items and raising charges on their
own.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also calls for strengthening management over
notes, requiring public security departments, procurators, courts
and industrial and commercial administrative departments at all
levels to unifying notes issued by central and provincial
financial departments.
</P>
<P>
Decisions related to fines and payments of fines must be
separated. The regulation also stipulates that fines
should be remitted to institutions entrusted by financial
departments.
</P>
<P>
Administrative charges and fines must be deposited with
national treasury or in special capital account beyond the
financial budget, according to the regulation.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stipulates that departments of finance, planning
and discipline inspection at all levels must introduce special
rectification programs related to existing charge items and
criteria with concerned departments. All rectified charge items
must be open to the general public for supervision.

<HEADLINE> Australia, EU Sign Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Australia and the European Union
(EU) Wednesday signed an agreement to boost their trade.
</P>
<P>
The Agreement on Mutual Recognition in Relation to Conformity
Assessment, Certificates and Markings (MRA) was signed by
Australian Industry, Science and Tourism Minister John Moore and
Vice President of the European Commission Leon Brittan.
</P>
<P>
Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer
and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer were present at the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The agreement "will also slash costs by as much as 10 million
Australian dollars (6 million U.S. dollars) for Australian
exporters and up to 40 million Australian dollars (24 million U.S.
dollars) for European exporters," Moore and Brittan said in a
joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows testing, inspection and certification of
products traded between Europe and Australia to be done in the
exporting country.
</P>
<P>
This is an alternative to carrying out checks at the
destination.
</P>
<P>
"Two-way trade covered by the agreement is currently 8 billion
Australian dollars (4.8 billion U.S. dollars annually) and today's
signing will lead to an opening up of markets which have
previously been rendered uneconomic by regulatory costs,"
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The document covers simple pressure equipment, machinery, low
voltage electrical equipment and medical devices,
telecommunications terminal equipment, electromagnetic
compatibility and automotive products.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique issued Wednesday by the two parties said the
European Union has around 155 billion Australian dollars (93
billion U.S. dollars) worth of investment in Australia, which has
invested about 40 billion Australian dollars (24 billion U.S.
dollars) in total in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
During the signing ceremony, Brittan called on Australia and
the EU to deepen their relations, saying the EU market would be
the largest one in the world with a population of 370 million
after the introduction of a single European currency, the euro, on
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming introduction of the euro and current Asian
economic downturn "imply that it is in the interests of Europe and
Australia for us to deepen the relationship between us,
economically and politically," Brittan was quoted Wednesday by The
Australian, one of the leading newspapers in Australia, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It's shown Australia that you can't put all your eggs in the
Asian basket," he added.
</P>
<P>
To date, about 60 percent of Australia's annual export of goods
and services goes to Asian market.

NANTES, France, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia, fresh from their
2-2 draw with powerhouse Germany, will have their momentum going to
crush long shot United States here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia need only a draw in the last group F game to enter the
last 16 in the World Cup finals and their opponents have been
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Coach Slobodan Santrac said, "If we want to be a good team we have
to be consistent, and that is what I am trying to tell my players."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia have several injury worries, with striker Darko
Kovacevic suffering a thigh injury, midfielder Zelkjo Petrovic nursing
a strained leg muscle and Miroslav Djukic having a right calf problem.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid striker Predrag Mijatovic, who scored a goal against
the Germans, said his team should have a correct attitude towards the
game.
</P>
<P>
"We are staying cool-headed. Our aim is to reach the second round
and it will be a match like any other when we play the United States,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Americans failed to repeat their feat of qualifying for the
second round four years ago but they still have a point to prove.
</P>
<P>
Coach Steve Sampson said, "We are out of the tournament but we have
shown we know how to play football. We've been unlucky, but we've also
missed a lot of chances in front of goal.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim against Yugoslavia is to show we can compete against one
of the best teams in Europe."

<HEADLINE> China Witnesses Slower Growth in Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The financial crises in Southeast
Asia has affected the implementation of China's budget over the
past five months, according to Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng.
</P>
<P>
"The financial situation is packed with comparatively severe
possibilities," said Xiang in comments at the third meeting of
the Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC).
</P>
<P>
State revenues grew by 7.7 percent and expenditures by 12.8
percent during the January-May period when compared to last year's
same period, said Xiang.
</P>
<P>
He added that the severe financial situation has been the
result of lax taxation, insufficient domestic demand, sluggish
economic growth and the poor operations of state-owned businesses
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said China will pour more funds into infrastructure,
education and science and technology in order to ensure
fulfillment of the eight percent economic growth target set by
central authorities.
</P>
<P>
Central authorities will also allocate special funds for grain
purchases, invest more into central and western regions of the
country and old industrial bases, support laid-off workers and
promoted the expansion of exports.
</P>
<P>
Xiang called for a crack down on violations of the taxation law
and regulations.
</P>
<P>
With regard to final accounting for revenues and expenditures
for 1997, Xiang said that 1997 revenues reached 483 billion yuan
(58 billion US dollars), up 13.3 percent on the previous
year. Expenditure hit 538.917 billion yuan, up 10.6 percent. The
nations also recorded a financial deficit of 55.8 billion yuan,
down 1.16 billion yuan when compared to the budgeted figure.
</P>
<P>
"The budget approved at the fifth meeting of the Standing
Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress was implemented
effectively," according to Xiang.
</P>
<P>
State revenues have accounted for a greater portion of GDP in
recent years. Central authorities have effectively curbed
expenditures, and investments in education, science and
technology, grain reserve funds and poverty-stricken areas have
increased significantly, said Xiang.

<P>
The project is supplementary to the communication network
agreement signed by Al-Hujailan last December, which has been

<HEADLINE> NATO Urges Rugova to Resume Talks With Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana on Wednesday urged ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to resume
talks immediately with the Yugoslav government without conditions.
</P>
<P>
Solana delivered the message in a 30-minute meeting with ethnic
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova at the NATO headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official, who declined to be named, quoted the NATO
chief as telling Rugova that ethnic Albanians' attempt to gain
Kosovo's independence from Belgrade was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary general made it clear to Rugova that he should
return to the negotiating table immediately without conditions and
resume the search for a negotiated solution," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Though the NATO did not support the status quo in Kosovo,
Solana said, the international community definitely did not
support independence for the breakaway province of Yugoslavia.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif has sent a letter to his Indian counterpart, Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, hoping to discuss with him all issues between the two
countries in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
</P>

Sharif expressed the hope that he and Vajpayee would hold a

the sole root cause of tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
The letter was sent on June 23, according to an official

In keeping with its constructive approach over the years for
resolving all outstanding issues between Pakistan and India, the
statement said, Islamabad has once again shown its readiness to
engage in a meaningful and result-oriented dialogue with India

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Strengthen Implementation of State Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Auditor-General Li Jinhua today
called for strict supervision over implementation of the state
budget and tax collections.
</P>
<P>
Li, auditor-general of the National Audit Office, pointed out
that the lax taxation enforcement of many localities has burdened
the nation with heavy financial losses. Li made the remarks at
the third meeting of the Standing Committee of the Ninth National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"Judicial departments should punish law violators in this
regard in accordance with the revised Criminal Law," said Li.
</P>
<P>
All departments directly under the State Council must strictly
abide by the state budget and practice thrift, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his office will strengthen audits of bank
accounts opened by government departments, and added that "secret
accounts must be prohibited."
</P>
<P>
Budget implementation in 1997 was generally sound, said
Li. However, relevant departments should still standardize their
management over budgetary receipts and strictly implement
financial and tax regulations.
</P>
<P>
The National Audit Office has audited the central government
budget implementation for the past two years and the State Council
ordered related ministries to rectify all violations.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Taxation and the General
Administration of Customs collected overdue taxes totalling 3.3
billion yuan (400 million US dollars), with other departments
remitting an additional 1.96 billion yuan to taxation authorities.
</P>
<P>
The National Audit Office has also audited the operations of
relief funds of 592 poverty-stricken counties throughout the
country in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Some poor counties have illegally used funds totalling 2.191
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Audit departments had recovered 810 million yuan in funds
misappropriated by poor counties by the end of 1997 and turned 17
corruption cases to judicial departments.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao, general
director of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters, monitored the flood situation in east China's Fujian
and Jiangxi provinces and sent letters to the respective
provincial leaders on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He urged the two provinces to closely monitor weather and flood
conditions and prepare to protect important cities and towns,
railways and the property and well-being of local residents.
</P>
<P>
Wen stressed that the disaster relief effort should be expanded
and arrangements should be made for production and ensuring living
conditions for local residents.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains have hit Fujian and Jiangxi since June 1, with
various parts of the two provinces hit by the heaviest flooding on
record, according to the flood control headquarters which today
sent telegrams to the areas expressing appreciation for related
flood relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
Wen also urged that concrete measures should be adopted to
increase this year's agricultural output and maintain social
stability in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
During a fact-finding tour of north China's Hebei Province
between June 22-23, Wen said the nation's agricultural economy has
performed smoothly and noted that a good summer harvest has been
achieved despite severe natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that priority should be placed on the following
areas in order to increase the agricultural production and output
for the year:
</P>
<P>
-- Increasing this summer's area under cultivation, optimize
the planting structure, promoting the use of agro-technology and
preparing to control either severe flooding and droughts;
</P>
<P>
-- Implementing reform of the nation's grain marketing system
and protecting the enthusiasm of farmer for grain production by
purchasing all grain at subsidized prices and selling grain at
market prices;
</P>
<P>
-- Reducing burdens on farmers and increasing their income, and
serverly punishing those responsible for illegally increasing
related financial burdens.

BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a bridge linking
Zhuhai of south China's Guangdong Province with neighboring Macao
is scheduled to start on June 29, an official of the Hongkong and
Macao Affairs Office of the State Council said here today.
</P>
<P>
Xie Houhe, director of the office's Macao affairs department,

</P>
<P>
The Gongbei Customs now serves as the only passageway between
Macao and the mainland, and is often crowded with customers as
trade and economic exchanges there increase.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is designed to be 1,500 meters long and 22 meter
high, with six traffic lanes. It will be built at a cost of 200
million yuan and completed by the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Dialog on Smart Partnership to Be Held in Namibia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Mihaela Smith, chief executive of
the Commonwealth Partnership for Technology Management, said
Wednesday that the second dialog on smart partnership would be
taking place in Namibia next month.
</P>
<P>
She made the statement after meeting with Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe in Harare.
</P>
<P>
"Many developments have taken place since the last meeting on
smart partnership, but on the other hand the financial crisis
that took place in Asia has impacted on many economies," she
said, adding "The forthcoming meeting in Swakopmund, Namibia,
next month will look at some of these issues."
</P>
<P>
According to Smith, this year's dialog is a very important one
for emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
She added that results of smart partnership for Zimbabwe in
particular included the setting up of the national economic
consultative forum which had seen a number of task forces formed
as a way to improve dialog between the private and public sector.
</P>
<P>
"Smart partnership" is an innovative concept of cooperative
competitiveness which brings the government, labor unions,
private sector organizations and individuals to work together for
a long mutual gain.
</P>
<P>
The partnership dialog, for which President Robert Mugabe was
founder in southern Africa, alongside other four presidents in
the region, would be taking place from July 26 to 29 in Namibia.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions on Pakistan "Counterproductive": Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, JUNE 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina has expressed her appreciation of Pakistan's
position on nuclear tests, saying the sanctions imposed on
Pakistan in the wake of the tests are "counterproductive."
</P>
<P>
According to a Pakistani Foreign Ministry press release
Wednesday, Hasina, who arrived here on a one-day visit, made her
remarks during the formal talks with her Pakistani counterpart,
Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh prime minister said she did not approve of the
economic sanctions on Pakistan as "these are invariably
counterproductive."
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions would fail to promote the objectives of the
countries which imposed them," she added.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said she fully understood the compulsions that lay
behind Pakistan's decision to undertake the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
She further expressed apprehension at the prevailing tensions
which affected not only India and Pakistan but all countries in
the South Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Hasina informed Sharif, however, that India had clearly ruled
out the possibility of mediation by any third party in the process
of resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute which is the sole
root cause of tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Sharif briefed Hasina on the grave security
threat faced by Pakistan as a result of India's nuclear tests,
saying that "in view of India's hostility Pakistan had no choice
but to exercise the nuclear option."
</P>
<P>
Sharif noted that the member states of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) desired to promote
mutual trust and understanding which are essential for the social
and economic uplift of this region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the agreement reached at the Ninth
SAARC Summit, that a process of informal political consultations
be instituted to promote mutual trust and understanding, would be
operationalized by the forthcoming SAARC summit in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Sharif underscored the need for an enabling environment of
peace and security which, he said, is "a sini qua non for the
exploitation of the full potential for economic cooperation in the
region."
</P>
<P>
He further noted that the P-5 (five permanent members) of the
U.N. Security Council and the G-8 have recognized the Jammu and
Kashmir dispute as the root cause of tension in the region which
must be addressed and resolved in accordance with U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Sharif stressed that Pakistan has always been prepared to enter
into a "meaningful dialogue" with India which would address in a
substantive and specific manner the question of peace and security
as well as the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
However, in view of the sterility of the bilateral dialogue it
is essential that the international community should remain
engaged in the process of facilitating a just solution to the
Kashmir dispute, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the two prime ministers
expressed their satisfaction at the state of their two countries'
relationship and exchanged views on measures needed to be taken to
further strengthen the ties.
</P>
<P>
During her stay here, Hasina was also received by President
Rafique Tarar.
</P>
<P>
Hasina, accompanied by Foreign Minister Abdul Samad Azad, was
the first foreign leader to have visited Pakistan since its
detonation of nuclear devices at the end of last month. Hasina
visited India last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Board of Airline
Representatives of Zimbabwe will hike international passenger
fares from Zimbabwe by between 10 and 20 percent with effect from
July 1, the board announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>

class.
</P>
<P>
All regional fares from Africa will also be increased by 10
percent, said the board which did not give reasons for the
increases.
</P>
<P>
However, the increases are likely to have been precipitated by
the recent hike in the price of aviation fuel.

ISLAMABAD, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange
(KSE)-100 Index Plunged Wednesday to its lowest level of 911.43
points on negative developments on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Wednesday, the lowest index recorded was 911.44 on
June 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The market opened Wednesday on a negative sentiment on news of
a fresh outbreak of violence in the southern port city in which
six members of the Karachi-based Muttehida Qaumi Movement party
were killed overnight.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by news that the government had decided not
to negotiate with the Hub Power Company management over the issue
of tariff reduction. Punters were hopeful before that discussion
between the government and the company would help resolve the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
News that the U.S.-based Parametric Fund has decided to
liquidate its 2 million U.S. dollar fund to Pakistan also affected
the sentiments in the already depressed market.
</P>
<P>
KSE Chairman Tasin Lakhani said the reason for the record low
at the KSE on Wednesday was the deteriorating law and order
situation in the city.
</P>
<P>
The KSE-100 Index dropped 56.24 points Wednesday to close at
911.43 against Tuesday's close of 967.67 points.
</P>
<P>
A total volume of 72.6 million shares was traded Wednesday
against 52.52 million shares traded in the previous trading day.

Analysts said they expect the market to recover slightly
Thursday as the bourse recovers from its new lows.

<HEADLINE> HK Remains Top of List for Luxury Goods: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong remains on top of the
list for shoppers seeking luxury goods at value-for-money prices,
according to the results of a recent survey on retail pricing of
luxury brand products in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted under the auspices of the Association of
Retail and Tourism Services (ARTS) by Duty Free Shops Group Ltd.,
focused on retail pricing of luxury brands throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
For the 12 brands covered in the survey, which include leather
goods, ready-to-wear clothing and cosmetics products, the overall
results reveal that, for most products surveyed, Hong Kong offers
shoppers lower prices than neighboring cities, with an average
price advantage of as much as 29 percent over Tokyo, 14 percent
over Bangkok, 12 percent over Seoul, 10 percent over Taipei and 2
percent over Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Jim Hurley, chairman of the ARTS, said there is a general
misconception that visitors to countries and regions suffering
from the effects of currency devaluation will be able to purchase
goods at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, while luxury brand vendors would normally review
their prices only once or at most twice a year, the currency
instability has forced vendors in some countries to adjust prices
upwards as many as three times over the past six months," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The survey results show that Hong Kong's competitive position
among major Asian cities for luxury brand-name merchandise looks
likely to be consolidated," Hurley said.
</P>
<P>
"These pricing benefits, combined with the widespread efforts
within the local retail industry to upgrade service and customer
care, mean that Hong Kong is now even more attractive as a
shopping destination," he declared.

<HEADLINE> Over 21,000 Myanmar Refugees Stay in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 21,661 Rohingya refugees
of Myanmar are now staying in two refugee camps in Bangladesh
awaiting repatriation to their homeland, Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government, after necessary verification, has given
clearance to 7,134 refugees for their repatriation, Azad told the
Jatiya Sangsad, the country's parliament.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the refugee camps has improved and interest of
the refugees to return to Myanmar has increased, he said.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of the refugees depends on favorable weather,
efficiency in running the refugee reception camps and situation in
the camps, said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that voluntary repatriation of the refugees in Cox's
Bazar, Southeast Bangladesh, would resume soon.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Rohingyas crossed the Bangladeshi border in 1991
and about 230,000 of them have been repatriated under joint
supervision of the Bangladeshi and Myanmar governments and the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation process has remained stalled since July 1997
reportedly as a result of the refugees' refusal to return.

<HEADLINE> International Firms in HK Confident of Future: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Over 90 percent of the foreign
companies in Hong Kong believe that their performance will be
positive over the next three years, a survey of business
confidence shows.
</P>
<P>
The survey, whose results were released here Wednesday, was
conducted by Hong Kong's international business community between
March and early June this year in the midst of the Asian financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that 80 percent of the 928 respondents
are positive about the Hong Kong business environment over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
The survey, titled "Business Survey'98," was carried out by
International Hong Kong, an informal group of 23 international
chambers of commerce and business associations in Hong Kong, in
cooperation with the Better Hong Kong Foundation (BHKF).
</P>
<P>
The survey sought to gauge the level of business confidence in
Hong Kong in view of the rapidly changing business environment in
the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
While a number of chambers of commerce and business
associations in Hong Kong regularly conduct surveys of their
members, this survey is the first comprehensive study of a large
cross-section of the international business community.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the results of the survey, BHKF's Chief Executive
George Yuen said this survey demonstrates that the international
business community takes a long-term view of economic
opportunities and development.
</P>
<P>
"The members of our business community know Hong Kong best.
They believe that Hong Kong will emerge from the current crisis
stronger than ever, as the case has been many times before," Yuen
continued.
</P>
<P>
Of the respondents, 70 percent listed Hong Kong as their
regional headquarters and 88 percent of those companies indicate
that they plan to maintain this status during the next three

<HEADLINE> S. Korea: Imported Blood Plasma Contaminated With Hepatitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Food and Drug
Administration said Wednesday some blood plasma imported from the
United States was found contaminated with the hepatitis C virus.
</P>
<P>
The finding, in five of the 270 blood plasma units taken as
inspection samples from an unidentified local pharmaceutical
company, prompted the government agency to take swift action.
</P>
<P>
As the samples were in a batch of 8,335 liters, or 21,000
packages, of blood plasma imported in April, the local company was
ordered to stop manufacturing blood products with the entire batch.
</P>
<P>
Under an investigation of the administration, including safety
inspection on 2,300 liters of unused plasma, the sampled units
were screened for HIV, hepatitis B and C and syphilis viruses.
</P>
<P>
The administration, however, acknowledged that the batch of
plasma in question was tested negative for the hepatitis virus
when it was shipped by a U.S. company into the country.
</P>
<P>
Blood plasma is used to make drugs, such as Albumin, for
patients with liver malfunction. If administered contaminated
products, chances are high that a patient will contract hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, some 60,000 liters of blood
plasma were transported into South Korea, mainly from the United
States and the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Control Over Polluters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China's top environmental official
said here today that China has taken strict measures on some
110,000 polluters over the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Environmental Protection
Administration, said at a news conference held by the Information
Office of the State Council that China spent more than 28 billion
yuan (3.37 billion US dollars) on controlling the pollution of
50,000-plus factories and shut down some 65,000 small plants with
serious pollution during the 1991-1997 period.
</P>
<P>
"China has scored remarkable achievements in pollution control
in its major valleys including the Huaihe river, Taihu and Dianchi
lake valleys. It had forced all the industrial polluters in the
Huaihe river valley to meet the discharge standards by the end of
last year," Xie said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a decline trend has occurred in the industrial
pollutants discharged by factories above the county level, and the
heavy metal pollution has been basically put under control thanks
to the effective measures adopted.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the daily average amount of the total suspended
particles in the air has lowered, and the environmental quality in
some cities has been improved," he added.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that in addition to increasing spending, China has
promulgated six laws on environmental protection and nine relevant
laws on resources protection.
</P>
<P>
"The clause of `crime against protection of environment and
resources' has been written into the amended Criminal Law," he
added.

tax rebates; appropriately increasing the issuance of treasury
bonds to finance public utilities; and establishing a government
purchasing system.
</P>

to alleviate the burden on enterprises, and for the first time
issued special treasury bonds valued at 45 billion yuan.

a bid to guide enterprise, individual and foreign investment to
energy, transportation, telecommunications and various other
infrastructure projects.

original 34.9 billion yuan to 45 billion yuan, and the highway

Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng pointed out that China's
fiscal macroeconomic control effort offers great potential and
noted that good revenue growth mechanisms have been introduced
with an annual increase in revenue of over 100 billion yuan. He
added that the State Treasury's capability for guaranteeing

However, he also pointed out that China's current fiscal
strength is subject to further development and noted there will be
limitations on the effects of fiscal macroeconomic control. Xiang

</P>
<P>
Experts agree that the government should employ more fiscal
measures to support economic growth.

that successfully controlling the overall economic scale will
require China to readjust its economic structure to adapt to
development of the market economy.

<HEADLINE> China to Collect More Fees from Industrial Polluters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China's environment watchdog has
decided to levy more fees upon industrial polluters to raise funds
for pollution control facilities.
</P>
<P>
The fee-collecting standard will be raised higher than average
cost of treatment of industrial wastes. Enterprises will get
policy and financial supports from the government in controling
pollution, according to Xie Zhenhua, director of the State
Environmental Protection Administration.
</P>
<P>
Pollution fees paid by enterprises are a major source of the
450 billion yuan, the total investment planned for the country's
pollution-control work in the 1996-2000 period, Xie told a news
conference held by the Information Office of the State Council
today.
</P>
<P>
Areas in 27 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities,
which are responsible for overproduction of sulphur dioxide and
for related acid rain, will have to pay a special fee, he
announced.
</P>
<P>
China plans to build 52 waste water treatment plants along the
seriously-polluted Huaihe River in the next three years at a cost
of more than five billion yuan (602 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
More funds are needed for pollution control facilities in the
Liaohe and Haihe rivers, and the Taihu, Dianchi and Chaohu lakes,
also the key polluted areas in China.
</P>
<P>
The government and banks will provide part of the funds, but
enterprises must pay too, said Xie.
</P>
<P>
He added that China is to attract more overseas loans in this
field, even though it has got over two billion US dollars as a
result of a program which aims to seek four billion US dollars of
foreign loans before 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investors will have more opportunities to directly
invest in China's environmental protection market, and will be
surely benefited," Xie said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The great cause of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics provides a vast arena for
young people of all ethnic groups to fully exhibit their
competence, according to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, also
general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks today during a meeting with the new
leadership of the Communist Youth League of China and some
deputies to the 14th National Congress of the CYL which closed on
Tuesday. The leadership and some 60 deputies representing the
nation's 56 ethnic groups attended the meeting at Zhongnanhai,
headquarters of both the government and CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Party has always attached great importance to the younger
generation and regards them as the future of the motherland and
the hope of the Chinese nation. Generations of young people
through different periods have contributed greatly to the Chinese
nation and the the magnificent history of the Party in the 20th
century. The younger generation has been entrusted with a mission
to bring China into the 21st century and write an even more
magnificent song of youth, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"China will basically have traqsformed itself into a modern
powerful, democratic, and civilized socialist country by the
middle of the next century. You will be my age when that
happens. As youngsters, we participated in the struggle to
overthrow the reactionary rule and worked for the founding of New
China under the leadership of the Party. Chinese youth of today
are also striving for the realization of the modernization
blueprint," according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Young people should cultivate lofty ideals and firm convictions
in the process of building the country and revitalizing the
Chinese nation, said Jiang. He called Chinese youth to adhere to
the Party's basic theory and basic line in following the socialist
road with Chinese characteristics, and to volunteer to work under
difficult conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Competition amongst nations is virtually competition for
professionals and the ability to create new things. You should
continue to learn while in your prime time," said Jiang, adding
that the prosperity of youth to a great extent means the
prosperity of the nation. Therefore, the Party and the public as a
whole should exhibit great concern for the healthy development of
young people who will safeguard China's long-term stability and
prosperity.
</P>

The league's new leaders and various deputies reported on their
work and life, with a number of deputies inviting the general

<P>
A source at the Iraqi Foreign Ministry told the INA that under
the memorandum of understanding, Iraq and Iran will cooperate to
ensure smooth implementation of a mechanism which will bring about
a final and quick solution for the exchange of POWs and detainees
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The source said the two sides held a series of in-depth and
constructive talks here last week, which led to the sealing of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will meet again at border cities to implement the
agreement, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Iran recently stepped up their efforts to resolve the
issue of POWs, which has been preventing the two countries from
resuming normal relations since the end of their eight-year war in
1988.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, the two countries carried out the largest
round of repatriation of POWs and detainees since 1991, in which
Iran released nearly 6,000 Iraqi POWs and Iraq in return set free
about 400 Iranian POWs and civilian detainees.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains Pelt Mogadishu, Killing 22 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Somali capital Mogadishu
and its neighboring region of Lower Shabelle are floating above
waters Wednesday as it started to pelt with heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
The rain which started pouring at 2:00 am local time has
turned Mogadishu's streets into running rivers.
</P>
<P>
At least 22 people, mainly children, are known to have died
and 11 others wounded after their houses collapsed on top of them
in different areas in the capital Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As many as 100 houses are destroyed as a result of the heavy
rains in the districts of Huriwa, Bondhere, Yaqshid, Hodon, Hamar
Jajab, Hawlwadag and Wardhigley.
</P>
<P>
Groups of young volunteers have begun evacuating children and
the elderly from the water-threatened houses in various districts
early in the morning. Abdulaziz Mohamed Omar, one of the 30
volunteers who operated in Huriwa district of the capital said
they have rescued more than 80 children in 60 houses in their
area.
</P>
<P>
As the waters have created pools and lakes in Mogadishu,
thousands of families have fled their houses to the relatively
safer areas and to their well-off relatives for shelter and food.
</P>
<P>
The poorest built houses are those make-shift huts built for
the internally displaced refugees. At least one child had died
in the Trebunka refugee camp in Hodon district and most of the
one hundred huts are also washed away by the rain waters.
</P>
<P>
A two-story building in Hodon district and a chemist' in
Hararyalle area of the capital are also destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The rain has seriously affected the movement of the city by
making all the roads almost impassable. All public transport
buses, taxis and privately owned vehicles are out of circulation
in the capital Wednesday. Most of the markets are also closed
down due to the rains.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains were also reported in the port town of Merca, 100
km south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed has called on the Somalis to
help each other at this crucial moment. He also appealed to the
international community to lead a helping hand to the Somalis.
</P>
<P>
This seasonal showers in the Deyr season has usually been
light, quick to pour and quick to let up, creating no problems.
It was in 1965 when the Deyr rains had been so heavy that
Mogadishu had been washed away by the waters, but the city was
not as large.

<HEADLINE> Study of Deng Xiaoping Theory Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Leading officials at all levels
were called on today to conscientiously study Deng Xiaoping Theory
and improve their efficiency at Party building because the theory
is crucial to the country's future success.
</P>
<P>
The call was issued by Hu Jintao, member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party, in a meeting at the Great Hall of People
with nearly 200 officials engaged in theoretical work and Party
building.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also China's vice president, said that China has withstood
all domestic and foreign tests in the nearly 20 years of opening
to the outside world and reform and has made continuous progress
in modernizing the country "basically because of the guidance of
Deng Xiaoping Theory".
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping Theory is and will be the correct guidance for
our new victories at present and in future, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hu emphasized the importance of studying Deng's Theory on Party
building, an importance component of the late leader's theory,
saying that it is a development of theories of Marx, Lenin and Mao
Zedong regarding building of the Communist party.
</P>
<P>
The most important to studying Deng Xiaoping Theory is to learn
to master Deng's scientific attitude, creativeness and
revolutionary style in solving new problems cropping up in Party
building with Marxist stand, viewpoints and methods, he said

<HEADLINE> Hungarian PM Designate to Form Tripartite Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian prime minister
designate Orban Viktor signed on one more party Wednesday to form
a tripartite coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The latest ally of Viktor, of the Federation of Young
Democratic-Hungarian Civic Party (Fidesz-MPP), was the Independent
Small-holders' and Peasants' Party (ISPP).
</P>
<P>
A day before, for the same purpose, the right-wing leader
signed an agreement with the Hungarian Democratic Forum (HDF),
said a report of the Hungarian Telegraph Agency.
</P>
<P>
Under these arrangements, the eastern European country thus
will have a tripartite administration, with 12 cabinet seats going
to Fidesz-MPP, four to the ISPP and one to the HDF.
</P>
<P>
Holding different views on a range of issues, negotiations
between Fidesz-MPP and ISPP were quite tough. On one occasion,
Orban said he had no choice but to form coalition with the ISPP.
</P>
<P>
Orban's Fidesz-MPP won 148 out of the 386 seats of the
unicameral National Assembly, or parliament, in Hungary's
two-round legislative elections in May.
</P>
<P>
The ISPP and the HDF netted 48 and 17 seats respectively.

<HEADLINE> China And Air Pollution Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China has worked out weekly air
pollution reports and worked to prevent sulphur dioxide emissions
and acid rain, according to Xie Zhenhua, director of the
State Environmental Protection Administration.
</P>
<P>
He said today that 46 Chinese cities now issue a weekly report
on air pollution, and Beijing, Shanghai, and 3 others give daily
reports. Big cities like Beijing and Shanghai have begun to use
unleaded gas, and Hainan Island in southern China will become the
country's first province to ban the use of leaded gas.
</P>
<P>
China has stopped building coal-fired power plants in major
cities and controls the mining of coal with a sulphur content
greater than 3 percent, Xie says, explaining that these are some
of the measures to control air pollution in areas seriously
polluted by sulphur dioxide and acid rain, which fall on 11.4
percent of China's landmass.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution in China consists of smoke from burning coal with
sulphur dioxide, and smoky dust, and some 30 percent of China's
land area suffers from acid rain.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that less smokes were exhausted in China recent years,
but still more sulphur dioxide. In 1997, there was 18.7 million
tons of smoke particles emitted, a million less less than in 1995,
while 23.46 million tons of sulphur dioxide were exhausted, over a
million more than that in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Guilin in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, is known for its scenery and history
which dates back more than 2,000 years to Qin Shihuang, founder of
the Qin Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The city, which covers 560 sq.km., hosts over 8.5 million
tourists annually, with most tourists coming from areas throughout
China.
</P>
<P>
Longsheng, Xing'an, Ziyuan, Sanjiang and Rongshui have been
designated close to Guilin as tourist areas offering the distinct
traditional practices and customs of ethnic minorities, typical
rural scenery, water conservancy, and temples which date back over
2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The city is undergoing a facelift which includes widening
narrow streets and bridges. Outdated brick, tile and wood
structures along the streets have been replaced by modern
buildings. Four large bridges cross the Lijiang River which
meanders through the city.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the process of building the Greater Guilin Tourist
Area which we hope to transform into a pioneering tourism-oriented
economic region," according to a senior local official.
</P>
<P>
Guilin has abundant water resources, with the Lijiang River
alone stretching some 426 kilometers and covering a drainage area
of 19,605 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Guilin enjoys a mild climate featuring a 309 day frost-free
period and is free of blistering heat in summer and extreme cold
in winter.
</P>
<P>
Favorable natural conditions make Guilin the ideal home for
gingko trees, clouded leopards, yellow-breasted tragopans,
pangolin, masket civets, giant salamanders and numerous other
species of flora and fauna.
</P>
<P>
The city also features abundant mineral resources such as
bloodstone, talcose rock, lead, zinc, common pyrite and high
quality marble.
</P>
<P>
The tourist industry represents one of the most important
sectors in Guilin's economy.
</P>
<P>
The southern city has the capacity to host over one million
foreign and 10 million domestic tourists annually. A total of
400,000 local residents work in enterprises directly related to
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Guilin's tourism industry generates an
annual income of three billion yuan, or more than 15 percent of
the city's to GNP (gross national product).

<HEADLINE> Dollar Hits 141 Yen in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar jumped more than 2 yen
to top 141 yen temporarily in Tokyo on Wednesday as investors bought
dollars and sold yen because of continuing anxiety about Japan's
sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 140.34-37 yen at 5 p.m. (local time), up
from 139.60-62 yen at 9 a.m., and from 139.20-30 yen late Tuesday in
New York.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said a definite bullishness for the dollar carried over
from overseas markets because of the market's skepticism that Japan
will act swiftly to shore up its economy.
</P>
<P>
After topping 140 yen, fears of intervention eased and market
players, particularly Japanese institutional investors, pushed the
U.S. currency over 141 yen, they said.
</P>
<P>
But a late afternoon wave of dollar-selling pushed the dollar back
below 140 yen and sparked market players to square their currency
positions.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislature Discusses Village Committee Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China's National People's Congress
is discussing a law that guarantees the rights of 900 million
farmers to deal with present-day problems in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Today, members of the Ninth NPC's Standing Committee discussed
the Organic Village Committee Law, which has been tried out for a
decade.
</P>
<P>
It allows villagers to directly elect village leaders,
something that was unheard of before the 1980s. It also provides
for the public availability of village financial affairs,
construction plans, and land contracts.
</P>
<P>
Feng Zhijun said that "democratic rights" specified in the law
need to be stated more specifically and that village committees
should be chosen by democratic election and major affairs settled
after villagers' opinions are sought.
</P>
<P>
The content of village affairs and the democratic supervision
by villagers should also be specifically stated, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Wenquan, the vice-chairman of the Shandong Provincial
People's Congress Standing Committee, said that supervisory rules
should be included in the law for greater supervision of village
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Bai Shangwu, of the NPC Agriculture and Rural Affairs
Committee, said that the law should reduce farmers' burdens.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee plans to further standardize the
democratic management of village affairs in China's nearly one
million villages. According to Civil Affairs Ministry sources,
more than 900,000 villages have had three direct elections in the
past decade.

centers and a network of garbage transfer stations.
</P>
<P>
A special treatment program has transformed the Lijiang River
into one of the world's best protected urban rivers.
</P>
<P>
Guilin's per capita public landscaped area stands at 6.1 sq.m.,
with greenery covering 35.8 percent of the city's total area.

<HEADLINE> Iran Need to Beat Germany to Qualify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTPELLIER, France, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran have to beat former
world champion Germany in Mosson Stadium here Thursday evening in
order to have a chance of reaching last 16 in the World Cup finals for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians took streets to celebrate back home after Jalal
Talebi's squad defeated the United States 2-1 on Sunday, but their
opponent this time was not ordinary side.
</P>
<P>
Having won the cup three time before, the Germans showed their
unparralled experience and fighting spirit by rallying from two goals
down to tie Yugoslavia 2-2.
</P>
<P>
Talebi said, "If we beat Germany there will be an even bigger party
back home."
</P>
<P>
It is of course Iran's best bet to stake their hope on the three
players who know Germany well.
</P>
<P>
Striker Ali Daei and midfielder Karim Bagheri play for Arminia
Bielefeld while Khodad Azizi is with FC Cologne.
</P>
<P>
Striker Azizi said, "If we want to go through to the second round
we have to beat Germany. Nothing is impossible in this world."
</P>
<P>
They will also hope the attacking midfieler Mehdi Mahdavikia,
scorer of the second goal against the Americans, will bring luck again
to the Middle East country.
</P>
<P>
Germany, who need only a draw to go through, have taken discretion
by fielding a much older line-up in a game they could not afford to
lose.
</P>
<P>
Lothar Matthaeus, 37, has shown his value again in his fifth finals
when he turned the game around against Yugoslavia as a second-half
substitute and is expected to start against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Matthaeus, who came on as a substitute against Yugoslavia and
helped turn the match around, will extend his record of World Cup
games to 23. He is expected to take on the libero role with Thon
moving into midfield.
</P>
<P>
More experienced Olaf Thon and Thomas Helmer may start in replace
of the younger Dietmar Hamann and Jens Jeremies.
</P>
<P>
Germany have only once failed to get past the first round in 1938
when the tournament was last held in France.
</P>
<P>
Coach Berti Vogts is likely to field a team with only three players
under 30 in Michael Tarnat, Joerg Heinrich and Christian Woerns.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I was forced to change things around against Yugoslavia
because the performances from some of the players were not good,"
Vogts said. "I know certain players have a mental problem. I know who
I can rely on."

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Helicopter Deal Yet to Be Decided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Defense of
Singapore stated Wednesday that no deal has yet been struck with
anyone on its much-reported helicopter purchase.
</P>
<P>
Tenders were still being evaluated and one of the top
contenders is the type of the American-made Apache attack
helicopter, the ministry said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after Reuters reported that Singapore wanted
to buy American-made military helicopters, missiles and other
high-tech aircraft equipment worth 620 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has been trying to upgrade the equipment of its Armed
Forces and an earlier report said the Defense Ministry might
complete the market survey of attack helicopters and make an
announcement by the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the U.S.-made Apache and South
African-made Rooivalk were in close race for the profitable deal.
</P>
<P>
One of the AH-64d Apache type, which is armed with an array of
sophisticated missiles, rockets and automatic cannons and can be
used as frontline "tank busters" and reconnaissance platforms, was
flown to Singapore and displayed at Paya Lebar Air Base for
special demonstration in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Rooivalk is also a type of high-tech attack helicopter.
Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defense Tony
Tan Keng Yam inspected the Rooivalk type in November 1997 when he
visited south Africa.

<HEADLINE> China Works to Ease Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China is extending great effort to
ease pollution problems, especially air pollution in Beijing, at
the earliest possible date, according to Xie Zhenhua, director of the
State Environmental Protection Administration.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's press conference sponsored by the State
Council Information Office, Xie said the Chinese capital will
reduce pollution resulting from the use of coal by adjusting its
energy structure, promoting the use of high quality coal and
expanding the use of central heating systems.
</P>
<P>
He said that management of construction sites in the city will
be improved and the use of mechanized street cleaners and water
trucks will be expanded to reduce dust in the air.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will use over 700 million sq.m. of natural gas by the
2000 in order to improve the local energy structure, said Xie.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will tackle exhaust emissions by tightening controls
over motor vehicles, both in terms of the market and actual use.
Automobiles failing to meet emission standards will not be
allowed to enter the market, and vehicles already in use will be
required to install emission control equipment. In addition, the
city will closely monitor the system for junking old vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"Beijingers have expressed dissatisfaction with the air
quality," said Xie. "However, I firmly believe that existing
measures and other control plans set for implementation will
improve the air quality."
</P>
<P>
He said that moving the Capital Iron and Steel Group, widely
recognized as one of the major polluters in the capital, is
unfeasible due to the size of the enterprise. However, the group's
production scale will be controlled to reduce pollution discharge
levels. Nearby power plants will also be required to reduce
pollution levels.
</P>
<P>
Beijing ranks at the top of the list of Chinese cities with air
pollution problems, with main problems centering on the total
volume of suspended particles, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.
</P>
<P>
The city's normal air quality is rated at the third level
(light pollution) and sometimes drops to the fourth level (medium
pollution), according to weekly air quality reports of major
Chinese cities released by China Environmental Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to raise the city's air quality to the second level
within five years, but will require substantial funding to do so,"
said Xie, adding that the municipal government has adopted a goal
for controlling pollution within five years and has assigned
experts to draft the city's long-term environmental protection
program.

<HEADLINE> Half of Australian Graduates Fail Literacy Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Up to half of Australian
university graduates failed literacy tests given by prospective
employers, a new study has found.
</P>
<P>
Graduates who achieved quite acceptable results in their
university course were being pulled up for poor use of grammar and
inadequate spelling, the AAP Wednesday quoted a report on the
study as saying.
</P>
<P>
AC Nielsen Research Services, which conducted the study for the
federal government, warned in the report that the failure of
graduates to maintain decent literacy standards was costing them
jobs.
</P>
<P>
"It is disturbing to reflect that, according to anecdotal
evidence, up to half of graduates who are achieving adequate
academic results can be rejected by employers after testing for
literacy and numeracy," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Poor use of grammar is one complaint by employers, while
inadequate spelling is another. Use of word processors has led to
reliance on them, but this can lead in practice to the
substitution of quite the wrong word in context."
</P>
<P>
Numeracy was less of a problem but there were concerns that use
of calculators had removed the ability to do even simple mental
arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
The Research on Employer Satisfaction with Graduate Skills
interim report was based on group discussions with employers,
government recruiters, industry associations and graduates.
</P>
<P>
The skills sought in graduates included literacy, numeracy,
time management skills, written business communication skills,
inter-personal skills and problem solving skills.
</P>
<P>
But literacy, numeracy and computer skills should have mostly
been developed at school and not university.
</P>
<P>
"Employers are concerned at the decline of basic skills, such
as oral and written communication and numeracy, and directly
relate this deficiency to declining standards of education," the
report said.

<HEADLINE> US Electronics Leader to Invest More in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- US Seagate Technology, a world
electronics leader, will increase its investment in Shenzhen, a
special economic zone in south China, to 122 million US dollars in
three to five years, from 20 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
A contract on increasing assests for Shenzhen Seagate
Co. Ltd. was signed today at the Great Hall of the People. This is
one of the important Sino-US economic cooperation programs signed
on the eve of US President Bill Clinton's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
The increased investment will be used mainly to purchase
production equipment and related facilities.
</P>
<P>
US Seagate Technology and China Electronic Industrial
Corporation jointly set up Shenzhen Seagate Co. Ltd. in 1992. The
joint venture, with about 1,700 employees, has turned out more
than 16 million hard discs, thus being regarded as one of the most
efficient subsidiary of Seagate.
</P>
<P>
Seagate is very confident about China's macro-economic
environment and expansion of its own business in the country, said
an official with Seagate, who added that more investment will
still be poured into another hard disc producer invested by
Seagate in Wuxi, a city in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Global sales of Seagate surpassed nine billion US dollars in
1997. Shenzhen Seagate took the lead in China's foreign-funded
enterprises in exporting nearly 940 million US dollars worth-of
products last year.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from the State Development Planning Commission
and Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation attended
today's signing ceremony.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said here Wednesday that he had "meaningful" talks with his
Bangladeshi counterpart, Sheikh Hasina, on bilateral and regional
issues.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the issues concerning South Asia," Sharif told
the media after holding talks with Hasina, who arrived here
Wednesday morning on a day-long visit at the invitation of Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said the international community fully appreciated
Pakistan's security concerns in the wake of India's nuclear tests
on May 11 and 13.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows that we were left with no choice but to
conduct nuclear tests to safeguard our national interests," said
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan's point of view is well registered all over the
world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hasina described her talks with Sharif as
"excellent." She said they had "good discussion" on bilateral and
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
However, both Sharif and Hasina did not disclose details of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Hasina is the first prime minister to visit Pakistan after the
country exploded its nuclear devices in May. She visited India and
held a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
last week.
</P>
<P>
She has expressed the hope to play a mediatory role to reduce
tension between Pakistan and India and establish peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Her visit to Pakistan is regarded as a part of the diplomatic
efforts to reduce the tension between Pakistan and India following
their nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
During her stay here, Hasina is also expected to call on
President Rafiq Tarar.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Arafat Accepts Entire Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat Wednesday avoided a no-confidence
motion against his cabinet in the legislative council by
announcing the mass resignation of his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
A new administration will be formed within two weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) Wednesday decided to
cancel a no-confidence vote against Arafat's cabinet, said a PLC
statement faxed to Xinhua from Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The PLC had scheduled to discuss the no-confidence vote on
Thursday over the alleged corruption by a number of PNA ministers
and the poor performance of their ministries.
</P>
<P>
The council decision was made after PLC Speaker Abu Ala
received a letter from Arafat announcing the resignation of the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"The resignations of all ministers have been accepted and
consultations (on forming a new cabinet) are still going on and a
list of the new government members will be presented to the PLC
within two weeks," Arafat said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Several PLC members had threatened to launch a no-confidence
vote against Arafat's cabinet last year, charging there were
corruptions by some cabinet ministers and mismanagement of their
ministries.
</P>
<P>
The accusations against the cabinet gathered momentum by the
end of last May, as 28 PLC members submitted a motion to the PLC,
urging Arafat to reform his administration or face a no-confidence
vote in the PLC.
</P>
<P>
These lawmakers also accused the cabinet for its delay and
unreasonable allocations of the 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
The PLC decided on May 31 to give two weeks' time to Arafat to
reshuffle his cabinet and resubmit the budget to the PLC for
consideration with changes as asked by the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Facing the charges from the PLC, Arafat decided to reshuffle
his cabinet and on June 15, he asked the PLC to give him 10 more
days to finish this work.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Arafat started his political consulations with
leaders of other Palestinian parties and factions over the issue
of the cabinet reshuffle, even asking them to join the new
administration as part of the national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's political consulations have received wide support from
the other political factions, which they believe could help all
parties concerned to form a united front against Israeli
occupation and realize the Palestinians' right of
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Arafat in his letter asked for two more weeks to fulfill his
task and conduct more consulations with other parties.
</P>
<P>
But foreign diplomats here pointed out the it is hard for
Arafat to form a multi-party administration because other parties
do not support the peace process and the Oslo Accord.

<HEADLINE> Interview: "One Country, Two Systems" Working Well: Indian Chamber Leader By Feng Xiuju </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- "One country, two systems" has
been working well in Hong Kong since it returned to China last
July, says M. Arunachalam, chairman of the Indian Chamber of
Commerce in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua at his office here,
Arunachalam said the past one-year practice shows that the concept
 of "one country, two systems" is "good and practicable."
</P>
<P>
Arunachalam, who has been doing business in Hong Kong for more
than 20 years, said that before Hong Kong returned to China, many
people doubted whether this concept would be implemented or not,
but now, nobody is worried about it because Hong Kong is operating
well.
</P>
<P>
The Central government follows a non-interference policy
towards the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I would say without the least hesitation that the Central
Government of China has scrupulously adhered to the concept of
'one country, two systems'.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has certainly been governed by Hong Kong people
since July 1997. It remains a city with a free economic policy,
good infrastructure and communications, and convenient
transportation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The recent Hong Kong Legislative Council elections have
further reinforced this process and I am confident the people of
Hong Kong will be left free by the Central Government to rule
themselves in the years to come," he added.

BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China has
started pilot projects in 10 counties to improve rural credit
cooperatives to reduce financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Bank sources say that this will give the rural credit
cooperatives more standardized management that is more

Rural credit cooperatives have a more than 50-year history in
China and have provided reliable support for agriculture, rural
economic development, and rural household development.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Cuts Fleet Size </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL),
struggling through the gravest financial crisis in its 57-year
history, has been forced to reduce its fleet size from 54 to 14
aircraft, a senior PAL officer said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a must for us to dispose of our excess aircraft if we
are to survive," said PAL chief financial officer Jaime Bautista.
"It makes no sense for us to keep paying lease charges on these
airplanes if we are not using them."
</P>
<P>
Bautista said PAL will pre-terminate leases on 27 airplanes and
sell off 13 other aircraft it owns as part of a rehabilitation
plan to nurse the ailing flag carrier back to financial health.
</P>
<P>
PAL currently leases 30 of the 54 aircraft in its fleet, for
which it pays about 30 million U.S. dollars a month in lease
charges.
</P>
<P>
However, Bautista said PAL did not expect to realize a gain
from the disposal of its own aircraft. "We expect the proceeds
from the sale to just be enough to service our obligations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
PAL went into a financial tailspin when its 620-strong pilots
went on strike nearly three weeks ago. The work stoppage brought
a daily loss of 150 million pesos (3.75 million U.S. dollars) to
PAL.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, our daily collections are not even enough to cover
variable expenses. On top of this, we have fixed expenses of 60
million pesos (1.5 million dollars) a day, which we still have to
pay for even if we don't operate," Bautista said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the rehabilitation plan the airline submitted to
the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 19 was the only
hope for PAL to stay aloft. The commission has formed a five-man
committee to oversee the rehabilitation program for the flag
carrier.
</P>
<P>
The proposed plan calls for, among others, a significant
reduction in fleet size, disposal of excess assets, restructuring
of the route network, lay-off of personnel, outsourcing of some
airline functions, giving up routes and frequencies to strategic
alliances and obtaining the support of creditors and unions.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to fully implement all the various elements of
the rehabilitation plan. If one of the elements is missing, the
entire plan will be unsuccessful," Bautista said.
</P>
<P>
PAL has already obtained the support of its creditor banks, who
have agreed to reschedule the airline's debt.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Looks to Salvage Pride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea, who is yet to win a single
match in the soccer World Cup finals after qualifying for four
consecutive times, will attempt to salvage some pride when they face
Belgium at Parc des Princes on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A 5-0 loss to the Netherlands on Satuday doused their hope to reach
the last 16 and led to the sacking of coach Cha Bum Kun, but
replacement coach Kim Pyong-Sok is expected to play a more attacking
game.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make some changes, we're going to reinforce the
midfield and both flanks because the Belgians are likely to take
advantage of any weaknesses there," said Kim.
</P>
<P>
Pohang Steeler's teenager striker Lee Dong Gook, known as "Ronaldo
of Korea", may lead the attack with Choi Yong Soo.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Belgium needs to repeat their 2-0 over the
Koreans in the 1990 finals in Italy in order to qualify for the last
16 here.
</P>
<P>
But their fate is not entirely in their own hands, as they have to
pray that Dutch neighbours should beat Mexico.
</P>
<P>
If the Netherlands tie Mexico, Belgium must win by at least three
goals to go through.
</P>
<P>
Belgium has two points after two draws, two points behind the group
leaders Dutches and Mexicans both at four points.
</P>
<P>
Much will rely on Enzo Scifo to create opportunities for strikers
Luc Nilis and Luis Oliveirar and midfielder Marc Wilmots, the scorer
of both goals in the 2-2 draw against Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Nico Van Kerckhoven will replace injured winger Danny Boffin while
goalkeeper Filip De Wilde is an injury doubt with a groin strain and
coach Geroge Leekens may have to play Philippe Van De Walle.
</P>
<P>
Veteran captain Franky Van der Elst is also doubtful.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Joins Five Intellectual Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has joined five
intellectual property treaties of two international organizations
to keep pace with the trade globalization and protect its
manufactures from both internal and external infringements.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from the Ministry of Industries and Trade
said these treaties are the Nice (France) Agreement concerning
the international classification of goods and services for the
purpose of registration of marks, the Patent Cooperation Treaty
(PCT) of 1970 and the Madrid Agreement concerning the
international registration of marks of the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO), Stephen Mtetewaunga, the acting
registrar with department of registrations, commercial laws and
industrial licensing, has said.
</P>
<P>
The other two are the Harare Protocol on Patent and
Industrial Design and the Banjul Protocol on Marks of 1993 of the
African Regional Industrial Property Organization (ARIPO), local
press reports quoted Mtetewaunga as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
By adopting these treaties, Mtetewaunga said, Tanzanian
manufacturers could register their goods in any member country by
using one language and registration fee.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania must reform various intellectual property laws under
the trade related aspects of intellectual property (TRIPS)
agreement which is part of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
conventions of 1994," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mtetewaunga explained the reasons for delaying to adopt the
treaties as financial constraints as the government was not
setting up funds.

<HEADLINE> African Countries to Launch Anti-Malaria Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 46 African countries will
launch a new initiative next year, aiming at reducing illnesses
and deaths due to malaria, the Guardian newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new initiative, tagged "African initiative for malaria
control in the 21st century (AIM)", is the brainchild of the
World Health Organization (WHO) African Region.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to reduce to the barest minimum mortality and
morbidity associated with malaria over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal of the program is to ensure that by the year
2030, "malaria will neither be the major contributor to mortality
and morbidity nor of significant socio-economic consequence", the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the initiative is designed to reduce illnesses
and deaths resulting from malaria by 50 percent by the year 2010,
30 percent by 2015 and by another 20 percent by 2025.
</P>
<P>
The key features of the implementation of the initiative will
be early treatment of malaria cases, promotion of the use of
insecticide and impregnated nets, prevention, detection or
containment of epidemics, and strengthening of the capacities of
countries and communities to combat the disease.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is the leading health problem in Africa, and the
sub-Sahara region in particular. Almost all the 550 million
people in the region run the risk of malaria.
</P>
<P>
The disease, according to WHO, attacks between 270 and 480
million people and kills between 1.5 and 2.7 million in the world
yearly.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the direct and indirect losses due to
malaria in the region rose from 800 million U.S. Dollars in 1987
to more than 2,000 million U.S. Dollars last year.

HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks rose 77.10

trading.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index edged up a minor 7.8 points to hit 8,227.47

Japanese yen's renewed weakness erased 52.03 points, or 0.63
percent, off the index at the finish of the morning session.

The losses were recovered in the afternoon trading on the back
of a strong overnight performance on Wall Street.

Trading was quiet with turnover dropping to 4,240 million HK

<HEADLINE> Macao Airport Controls Bird Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Macao International Airport has
adopted a series of measures to reduce possible bird strike on
planes, and bird appearance near the airport has become evidently
rare.
</P>
<P>
Rui Balaco, vice-chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of
Macao, told Xinhua in a recent interview that bird presence at the
 airport has dropped substantially since the beginning of this
year after the airport and the authority took "active" and
"passive" measures.
</P>
<P>
As an active measure, the airport has installed five gas
cannons since late last year along the runway of the airport,
which was built on land reclaimed from sea. The cannons fire
automatically at intervals to drive birds away. The airport is
also buying electronic devices that can flare sounds to frighten
birds away.
</P>
<P>
The "passive" measures include stepped-up cleaning at the
airport, keeping garbage and passenger disposals away from birds,
which were often attracted to look for food. The airport also
trims the lawn around the runway at a certain height so that birds
cannot hide in it.
</P>
<P>
In addition, at times when migratory birds flock, the airport
sent out patrol vehicles to drive them away. This measure was
described by Balaco as "most effective."
</P>
<P>
All these measures have been proved effective for a certain
period of time, but no single method can produce long-term effects
as desired, said Balaco.
</P>
<P>
"The gas cannons, for instance, are good for the migration
birds, but not so useful for the resident birds because they get
used to it," said Balaco. "The ideal is all these measures working
together."
</P>
<P>
Inaugurated in November 1995, the airport has reported three
incidents of bird strikes, with two serious ones, inflicting
damage to the engines.
</P>
<P>
Bird strike on planes is a universal problem at all airports
around the world. It can cause serious damage to the plane engines
if the striking bird is large and hits the plane during taking
off, said Balaco.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Takes Measures to Promote Film Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government announced a package of
measures to promote the further development of film industry as
the Hong Kong International Film Market (FILMART '98) opened here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the event's opening ceremony at the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center, Secretary for Information
Technology and Broadcasting Kwong Ki Chi said that the SAR
government would work in parallel to simplify government
procedures by such measures as cutting bureaucratic red tapes and
making it easier for film crews to obtain the necessary approvals
to do location shooting.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the
three-day FILMART '98 is supported by the Hong Kong, Kowloon &AMP; New
Territories Motion Picture Industry Association Ltd. and the Movie
Producers and Distributors Association of Hong Kong Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Kwong said that Hong Kong is still as dynamic and as open as
ever. "Out 6.5 million people continue to enjoy the freedom of
speech and of the press. Out film-makers and film distributors
continue to make and show films of their liking and choice," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A Film Services Advisory Committee comprising leading
personalities from the film industry and other supporting
organizations had been set up to support the continuing growth of
the film industry, Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
The event has attracted 62 film and television companies from

<HEADLINE> Jacquet Announces Starting Line-up Against Denmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LYON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- French manager Aime Jacquet has
announced his team's starting line-up in the match against Denmark
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jacquet will send in Christian Karembeu, Frank Leboeur and Patrick
Vieira, all three haven't played a match at the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
But the French team will still be weakened in the match due to
Zinedine Zidane's suspension and Christophe Dugarry's injury.
</P>
<P>
"For this third match against Denmark, the situation will
therefore be more complex, since we will have to deal with these
absences, and take into account the fact that certain players were
booked in the two previous matches." said Jacquet.
</P>
<P>
Jacquet said:"The team must be aware that a defeat against
Denmark would mean losing the first place in our group. Our goal is
to come out in front and that's why I emphasised the need for
concentration and determination among the players." said Jacquet.
</P>
<P>
France have already qualify for the top 16 with two wins over
South Africa and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Bo Johansson, coach of the Danish team, said"This match against
France will be very interesting. I thought about several line-ups
because we have to get one point to be sure to go the next round."
</P>
<P>
"This won't be an easy match but we'll fight to get a good
result. Anyway, I'm willing to accept sharing points with the
French." said Johansson.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hong Kong's Financial System Withstands Regional Turmoil (1) by Wang Qun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- While the regional financial
turmoil is dragging the Hong Kong economy into a painful phase of
adjustment, the well-established Hong Kong banking and financial
system has stood firm in the severe test.
</P>
<P>
And the linked exchange rate, the cornerstone of Hong Kong
monetary and financial stability, has been well preserved, making
the Hong Kong dollar the only freely convertible currency in the
region that has survived unscathed in the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Prudent macro-economic policies, a rule-based monetary system,
a sound regulatory framework and robust financial infrastructure
are viewed as the best guarantee for the stability of the Hong
Kong dollar, while the mainland authorities' clear commitment of
not to devaluate Renminbi lending a forceful support to the local
currency.
</P>
<P>
However, mounting evidence showed that the year 1998 will be a
very difficult one for Hong Kong banks, which have to contend with
the blows to confidence from continuing regional upheavals, most
recently the political unrest in Indonesia and the weak Japanese
yen.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with an economic slowdown -- as indicated by a negative
GDP growth for the first quarter of this year, "it is not
surprising that the banks in Hong Kong are going through more
difficult times," said David Carse, deputy chief executive of the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), when addressing the impact
of the regional financial turmoil on Hong Kong banking sector.
</P>
<P>
"The severity of the Asian crisis is a once-in-a-lifetime event
and no banking system in the region can hope to be unaffected by
it. There is bound to be an impact on the banks' funding and
liquidity, loan growth, asset quality and ultimately their
profitability," Carse told a conference on Pacific Basin business,
economics and finance in May.
</P>
<P>
The combination of regional difficulties and domestic slowdown
inevitably led to some deterioration in asset quality. In the
first quarter of the year there was a noticeable rise in loans
overdue for more than 3 months. But as a percentage of total
loans, the figure for the local banks -- less than 2 percent -- is
still reasonable by international, let alone, regional standards.
</P>
<P>
Further deterioration can be expected in the coming months,
although not to the extent seen in other parts of Asia, Carse
said. However, even deterioration occurs, banks have very
substantial protection from continued operation profits, existing
bad debt provisions, collateral and high capital adequacy ratios.
</P>
<P>
It is important to keep in mind that the local banks are still
making money so far this year, though generally lower against
1997. "While lower profitability is by no means welcome, it is
not, by itself, a cause for concern in terms of the stability of
the banking system," Carse noted.
</P>
<P>
"The year 1998 will be a tough year, but I am confident that
the banks have the fundamental capital strength to manage their
way through it," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
At a time when Southeast Asian economies have suffered a
setback and will take a few years to recover, Hong Kong can make
itself an even more important business and financial center, said
Davies, who is also Standard Chartered Bank's group executive
director for Hong Kong, China and Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland is drawing lessons from the regional
crisis seriously and major reforms are being implemented. "These
are going to open up new business opportunities for Hong Kong,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of Hong Kong's flexibility and dynamism, a
pro-business environment, and a strong, capital-intensive and
orderly institutional framework, all of which are "grounds for
optimism" that Hong Kong will emerge stronger from the storm.
</P>
<P>
And the banking system "forms an integral part of this
institutional setup" and "has proved itself as one of the most
trustworthy pillars of the local economy," Davies noted.
</P>
<P>
"The strength of the banking system in Hong Kong is also a key
factor underlying the territory's resilience in the face of the
strains of the Asian turmoil," Davies stressed.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that his association, grouping all the licensed banks
in Hong Kong, will continue to work closely with the authorities
to ensure that the banking system remains sound and stays ahead of
developments in international financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The strength of Hong Kong financial system got recognition of
the regional and international community. The June 2 edition of
the Asian Wall Street Journal commented: "As the Asian doom and
gloom spreads, it is important to remember that Hong Kong is a
thriving financial center, not a domino. Its physical and human
infrastructure makes it one of the world's premier places to
conduct business. The banking sector is fundamentally sound and
the currency stable. On top of that there's Hong Kong's role and
potential as banker to the juggernaut next door: China."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Welcomes Investment in Dams Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania expressed its
welcome to foreign and private investment in building power
generation dams on four major rivers to ease the acute shortage
of power across the country.
</P>
<P>
Manju Msambya, Deputy Minister of Energy and Minerals, told
the on-going parliamentary session in the new capital city of
Dodoma Tuesday that dams are needed on the rivers of Malagarasi,
Mara, Rufiji and Ruvuma to support the two hydro-power plants on
rivers of Mtera and Kidatu which face frequent water shortages.
</P>
<P>
Local media Wednesday quoted the deputy minister as saying
that while concentrated on building dams on five other rivers,
the Tanzanian government is currently unable to carry out the
four projects due to financial constraints.
</P>
<P>
"The government will conclude five hydro-power plants on the
rivers of Lower Kihansi, Upper Kihausi, Masigira, Rumakali and
Ruhudji proposed to end in the year 2010 in accordance with a
Power Master Plan," said Msambya.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's annual
consumer inflation increased to 5.1 percent in May from five
percent in April, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The figures released Tuesday by the Central Statistical
Service show that month-on-month rise in the consumer price index
(CPI) was 0.4 percent from April.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the inflation rate was in line with
market expectations, but this could be the last good figure
before a sharp rise next month because of an increase in mortgage
rates.
</P>
<P>
The index, which tracks the price of a typical basket of
goods, was hiked mainly by an unexpected sharp increase in food
prices of 0.8 percent, resulting in year-on-year food inflation
being slightly higher at 6.7 percent.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has removed the
world's oldest human footprints from a lagoon and airlifted them
to safety, local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Eve's Footprints", the 117,000-year-old fossil was
moved Tuesday to the South African Museum in Cape Town to protect
against vandalism as well as erosion.
</P>
<P>
Resin was poured into the fragile sandstone and allowed to
dry. A highly-powered diamond drill cut a portion of the rock
away. And the fossil was encased in an aluminium box.
</P>
<P>
The fossil was discovered last year in the Langebaan lagoon,
about 80 kilometers northwest of Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The footprints are believed to be those of a woman, dubbed
"Eve" by scientists because of the growing belief that humans had
their origin in south or southwestern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Only four such footprints were discovered so far in the world,
all in Africa, according to South African Broadcasting
Corporation (SABC) television.
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope that more prints could be found in the
vicinities of the lagoon.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Push Through Tourism Program in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will push through an
agreed tourism development project of Mountain Kumgangput in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea(DPRK) despite a submarine
incident, said a spokesman of South Korean President Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government's policy of separating economic
issues from politics is of mutual benefit to both sides of the
Korean peninsula, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
During his eight-day visit to DPRK, Chung Ju-yung, South Korean
Hyundai Group's founder, reached an agreement last week with the
DPRK to develop tourism resources of Mountain Kumgang by bringing
1,000 South Korean tourists every day to the mountain area
beginning from September this year.
</P>
<P>
However, one day before Chung's formal announcement of the
tourism agreement, a DPRK submarine was caught by South Korea
after it was found entangled in a fishing dragnet some 11 miles
off South Korean northeastern city Sokcho.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK's Korean Central News Agency said Tuesday the small
sub was wrecked while on a training mission and DPRK was searching
for the vessel and its crew.

But, the South Korean military authorities said the sub was
infiltrating into its waters and it was drifting there due to
engine failure as the DPRK described.
</P>
<P>
South Korean opposition Grand National Party, the majority in
the parliament, urged the government to dismiss
Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek for his "inadequate response" in
dealing with the sub incident.

<HEADLINE> More Nigerian Troops in Liberia Move to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian contingent to the west
African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) has begun to pull out from
Liberia into Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to lead to the anticipated relocation of
the ECOMOG headquarters from Monrovia, capital of Liberia, to the
Sierra Leonean capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian military said that the pull-out was to beef up
the troop strength in Freetown to flush out elements of the
ousted military junta and allied rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, sources said the departure of the Nigerian troops in
Monrovia is also connected with the continued tension between the
peacekeepers and the State Security Services (SSS) of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Relations between ECOMOG and Liberian President Charles Taylor
have been sour for sometimes as the warlord-turn president has
reportedly asked the force to leave his country after it helped
him gain the power.
</P>
<P>
Confrontations between ECOMOG and SSS men who are also known
as the bodyguards of Taylor also happened repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
The latest took place last Sunday night when a SSS man
refused to allow the passenger vehicle he was in to be searched
by ECOMOG soldiers at a checkpoint in Monrovia, according to
ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Timothy Shelpidi.
</P>
<P>
The SSS men's attack against an ECOMOG soldier led to
hostilities between the soldiers and a group of 30 SSS men who
came later, the commander said, quoted by the British
Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional force has complained to the government but
the government has said nothing, the report said.
</P>
<P>
West African leaders sent ECOMOG to Liberia in 1990 to help
end the bloody civil war in that country. The force created
security for the country's first post-war election last year,
with Taylor becoming the president.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG also interfered in the situation in Sierra Leone after
a coup ousted the country's civilian government in May last year.
It overthrew the junta last February and is mopping up the
remnants in the eastern and northern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the biggest contributor to ECOMOG, has about 6,000
troops in Sierra Leone which will be joined by more soldiers from
other west African countries, according to Nigeria's defense
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Chiefs of Defense Staff meeting held in Accra,
Ghana, last April "identified that about 10,000 troops would be
needed" to flush out the remnants of Sierra Leone's junta and
allied rebels, said Godwin Ugbo, acting director of defense
information Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ghana, Gambia and Nigeria are among countries which have
pledged to contribute more troops in support of ECOMOG's cause,
according to Ugbo.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Volkswagen Gearing Up for Increased Business In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The world's 4th largest automobile
manufacturer, Germany's Volkswagen AG, will accelerate development
in China by increasing cooperation with Chinese partners, building
an effective sales system, and improving research and development
here.
</P>
<P>
Stefan Jacoby, vice-president of VW's Asia-Pacific Region, said
at a news conference here Tuesday that this will help Volkswagen
maintain its lead in China in sedan market share, and will help
the group reach its goal of turning its joint ventures in China
into multi-functional companies that can compete globally.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the group had sold 1.3 million cars in
China. Volkswagen's two joint ventures in China -- in the cities
of Shanghai and Changchun -- occupy more than half of China's car
market.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Volkswagen's sales are expected
to rise 7.1 percent from the same period of 1997, to 153,000, or
58 percent of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Chinese clients have much higher expectations and
greater wants than before, and are catching up to people in the
West, Jacoby said, and a more efficient sales system in China is
the key to a successful business.
</P>
<P>
A VW-funded automobile research and development center is
expected to be built at a cost of one billion yuan (120 million US
dollars), next year in Shanghai. The center will meet the growth
needs of China's automobile industry and is expected to boost
Volkswagen's presence in China, he says.
</P>
<P>
China's automobile industry is changing from a seller's to a
buyer's market and Volkswagen will develop new car customers in
China and pay special attention to the rapidly-growing number of
private car buyers, Jacoby added.
</P>
<P>
Private owners account for 22 percent of China's car buyers at
present, in contrast to 15 percent three years ago.
</P>
<P>
At the ongoing 5th Beijing International Automotive Industry
Exposition, Volkswagen, along with Audi and Skoda, has a
full-range of products on display, including its Passat, Golf, and
Sharan brands.

<HEADLINE> One in Five Namibian Adults HIV Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- About 20 percent of Namibian
adults between the ages of 15 and 49 are infected with the HIV
virus, a United Nations report said.
</P>
<P>
The UNAIDS report, to be presented at the United Nations' 12th
World AIDS Conference in Geneva next week, says that 150,000
people in Namibia are HIV positive, the South African Press
Association reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS country program director, Mary Delaney, said that
HIV/AIDS is the single most important macroeconomic variable for
the country for the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The cost of hundreds of sick people and their eventual deaths
would overwhelm the country's health care system, Delaney
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Namibia was ranked among the top 10 AIDS-infected countries in
a report by the Namibian Health Ministry in December, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder for President's Clinton's China Trip: Shanghai: Simultaneous "Dialogue" with International Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 24 (Xinhua) - Shanghai is able to be in
simultaneous "dialogue" with the international business world,
from trade to financial industry, said Minmin Zhong, president of
the U.S. CitiBank Shanghai Branch in explaining why the firm chose
to move its China area headquarters here from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, the debut of the Pudong Economic Development
Zone heralded the integration of the Chinese economy with the
world.
</P>
<P>
The city's infrastructure ranging from transportation and
energy to communications have transformed the skyline in the last
decade. Most of the pilot programs authorizing foreign banks to
engage in the Chinese currency yuan-based business and other
financial reforms in China have been initiated in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
It is not only China's largest manufacturing base, but also is
becoming an international financial and trade center.
</P>
<P>
In this tiny portion of China's territory, 145 million
U.S. dollars worth of goods are exported every day; 7.58 billion
yuan (about 913 million U.S. dollars) of stocks are traded; and
nearly 10,000 people enter or leave China daily.
</P>
<P>
It is now a hub of domestic and international monetary,
commodity, technology, human resources and information movements.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's economic strength is its foundation for its
"dialogue" with the world economy.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai is the key to modern China," a professor at the
University of Maryland prophesied nearly 40 years ago. The saying
is now being validated by financial brokers and industrialists
from throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Half of the globe's top 100 companies have investments in
Shanghai. Under such a strong influence, Shanghai is now playing
host to 17,500 overseas-funded businesses with contracted
investment exceeding 30 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among the top 50 banks in the world, 80 percent have branch
offices in the city. Total assets of foreign financial
institutions add up to 17.51 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac led a trade mission to Shanghai
last year that he called the largest in France's foreign trade
history.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's dependency rate to the international market has
reached 40 percent. It has official friendship connections with 41
cities in other countries. Two-thirds of all countries with
diplomatic ties to China have consulates in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
With such channels, the city is well-equipped to have a
dialogue with the world.
</P>
<P>
In the past five months, the municipal government has received
more than 50 ministerial trade delegations. Of these delegations,
80 percent had entrepreneurs in their entourage. Statistics also
show that 98 percent of foreign businesses in Shanghai are
successful.

<HEADLINE> China Bank Promises Financing for Telecommunications Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC) signed an
agreement with the China Unicom today, promising to heavily
finance the second telecommunications giant between 1998 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to a letter of intent the two sides signed today, the
bank will first issue 1.5 billion yuan (180 million US dollars) in
loans to China Unicom to support the company's GSM digital and
mobile telecommunications project in northern Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Other than the financial support in terms of bank loans, bill
acceptance and discounts, and guarantees, the bank is also
expected to act as the financial adviser and conduct settlements
for the company.
</P>
<P>
Most of the financing will go to the China Unicom projects in
GSM digital mobile telecommunications, long-distance
telecommunications and digital telecommunications in provinces
such as Liaoning, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
As another indication of the BOC's prior support to large and
profitable enterprises, the bank has signed similar agreements
worth over 23 billion yuan (2.77 billion US dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1994, China Unicom is the second Chinese
telecommunications service company ever formed after China
Telecom.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks' Outlook Still Gloomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares ended higher
Wednesday but off early peaks in a muted reaction to Wall Street's
117 point rise overnight.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 10.2 points up at 2,592.8, all
industrials gained 18.0 points to 4,519.4 and all resources put on
4.1 points to 1,043.3.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said Wednesday's generally touchy trading, despite a
strong performance from U.S. and European markets, reflected the
switch in focus to Asian markets rather than more traditional
indicator markets.
</P>
<P>
"It was a very skittish market which goes to show the
volatility as we switch from the former influences of the northern
hemisphere markets to the Japanese and Hong Kong markets," Peake
Lands Kirwin broker Bill Richmond said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Nikkei index climbed 68.0 points to 15,123.0 over the
day while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index had drifted 32.2 points to
8,187.4.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the mixed Asian performance reinforced the
considerable skepticism about the strength of Wednesday's minor
rally and cited the underperformance of the June Share Price Index
(SPI) contract traded on the Sydney Futures Exchange as evidence.
</P>
<P>
Overall 365.2 million shares changed hands worth 1.126 billion
Australian dollars (686.86 million U.S. dollars) with falling
stocks just shading rising stocks by 583 to 574.
</P>
<P>
The main mover for the day was Foster's Brewing which jumped 26
cents to 3.64 Australian dollars after it announced it had sold
its Canadian brewing interests for 1.11 billion Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
News Corp. and Telstra installment receipts were boosted thanks
to rumors from the U.S.A. that phone giant AT&AMP;T would launch a 30
billion U.S. dollars takeover bid for cable giant
Tele-Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said a takeover of that scale could mean bullish asset
revaluations for all leading telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
Other leading industrials to rise included Lend Lease, up 60
cents, and National Mutual, five cents stronger.
</P>
<P>
The banking index slipped 27.3 points to 5,650.8 with National
slipping 33.1 cents, Commonwealth easing 17.6 cents, Westpac
losing four cents and ANZ up seven cents.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Barely Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A little help from the New
Zealand dollar failed to greatly influence the local currency
Wednesday, leaving the Australian dollar anchored just below 61
U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
For the third consecutive day the currency ended the local
session barely changed.
</P>
<P>
While the session was more volatile than the previous two this
week, the currency closed at 60.89 U.S. cents, very near the 60.85
close Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A dip below the crucial 60.50 U.S. cent level early in the
session was not sustained and the bears in the market were
thwarted by the announcement of a better-than-expected current
account deficit figure in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
SBC Warburg Dillon Read foreign exchange executive director
John Radinoff said a subsequent rise in the New Zealand dollar was
accompanied by a lift in the Australian currency which hit 61 U.S.
cents before retreating.
</P>
<P>
Despite the help from its NZ neighbor, a resurgence in the U.S.
dollar against the yen quickly put an end to the rally. Radinoff
said the yen remained the lead factor for the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
IBJ Australia senior trader Steve Chater said as long as the
Australian dollar continued to languish at low levels, the bond
market would remain watchful.
</P>
<P>
"The thought of it going below 60 U.S. cents again is going to
drive bonds," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe a break of that crucial level would send
the Australian dollar spiraling back down toward its all-time low
of 57.10 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
In the foreign exchange market, the Australian dollar was
buying 85.47 yen from 83.92 previously and 1.0969 German marks
from 1.0908.

<HEADLINE> Saudi FM Calls on Iraq to Respect Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has called on
Iraq to honor the U.N. resolution over Iraqi-Kuwaiti border,
principles of the Arab League and the regional security agreements
to show its good will towards its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal made the remarks
at the opening session of the Saudi-Egyptian Higher Committee in
Riyadh Tuesday night, Kuwait News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Faisal's remarks were in response to the recent statement made
by Iraqi Vice President Taha Ramadan regarding Iraqi-Kuwaiti
border.
</P>
<P>
Faisal said Ramadan's statement "is regrettable and indicates
Baghdad's continuous policy of deception."
</P>
<P>
Ramadan was reported to have claimed during his recent visit to
Morocco that the U.N.-demarcated border between Iraq and Kuwait
after the 1991 Gulf War to end Iraq's invasion of Kuwait lacked
"legal ground."
</P>
<P>
The remarks, running against the the U.N. Resolution 833 which
demarcates the boundary between the two countries after the Gulf
War, touched off broad criticism.
</P>
<P>
Terming that Ramadan was misquoted, Iraq has reiterated its
commitment to the resolution 833 after the incident.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Faisal also expressed the hope that Iraq
returns to the Arab and Islamic family, and plays a role on
international affairs.

<P>
SINGAPORE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore stock market slid
for a fourth straight day Wednesday as investors awaited the
off-budget measures to be announced next week.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) closed
7.40 points down at 1,074.85 despite the revelation that the
government will announce the much-anticipated package of
off-budget measures in Parliament next Monday to boost the
slowdown economy.
</P>
<P>
The turnover increased to 92.16 million shares worth 188.88
million Singapore dollars (115.88 million U.S. dollars). There
were 141 gainers against 136 losers with 311 stocks unchanged.
</P>
<P>
EasyKnit thk was the most actively traded stock with a volume
of 12.86 million units. DBS Land had 5.85 million shares traded.
Singtel was next with 4.97 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Creative 50 remained the top gainer of the day, up 1.80
Singapore dollars to 21.30 Singapore dollars. Jurship closed 30
cents up to 8.30 Singapore dollars. UOB F increased by 25 cents to
end at 5.40 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, ANA Ho topped the losers as it fell by 50
cents to finish at 1.50 Singapore dollars. SIA 200 shed 40 cents
to end at 6.40 Singapore dollars. MAA lost 38 cents to close 1.66
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Commentators said that the eager anticipation of the off-budget
measures to boost the economy has given way to the feeling that
the government can do little to turn the situation around.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the off-budget measures, aimed at reducing
business costs and helping companies cope with difficult times,
are not expected to excite the market unless they include some
radical steps.
</P>
<P>
The weakening Japanese yen also cast pall on the local bourse,

LUSAKA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's former President Kenneth

President Frederick Chiluba.

the father of the nation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President to Appoint New Air Force, Navy, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
will install the new chiefs of staff of the country's Air Force,
Navy and Police next Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Defense Minister and Commander of the
Armed Forces (ABRI) Gen. Wiranto after attending a limited cabinet
meeting on political and security affairs here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president will install Maj. Gen. Hanafie Asnan as Air Force
chief of staff, Vice Admiral Widodo as Navy chief of staff and
Maj. Gen. Roesmanhadi as chief of the State Police, Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
Asnan presently serves as logistics assistant to the Air Force
chief of staff while Widodo serves as commander of the Navy's
Western Fleet. Roesmanhadi is on Wiranto's staff as expert for
public security and order.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said the replacement is a normal procedure that is part
of the ABRI's consolidation efforts.
</P>
<P>
Asked on the possibility of replacing the Army chief of staff,
he said Gen. Subagyo is relatively new in his position, compared
to the others.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Habibie asked the people to give ABRI a chance to
conduct "internal consolidation" to enable the Armed Forces to
carry out investigation of cases concerning missing people and
widespread May riots.
</P>
<P>
Habibie told members of the National Commission on Human Rights
that he acknowledged that the credibility of his government
depended heavily on the resolution of the cases.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the internal consolidation meant replacements of
ABRI officials or restructuring, spokesman for the National
Commission for Human Rights Marzuki Darusman only said: "the term
has a wide range of meanings. We just try to understand that."

<HEADLINE> Mozambique, Malawi Fail to Reach Agreement on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 24 (Xinhua) --Discussions were held between the
Mozambican and Malawian presidents, but no agreement was reached
on the privatization of the management of the Nacala railroad and
the Mozambican northern seaport of Nacala.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano made the remarks after
talks with the visiting Malawian President Bakili Muluzi in
Nacala Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The daily Noticias newspaper Wednesday quoted Chissano as
saying that the two sides failed to sign the agreement because
they had different understanding of the target of the
privatization.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican president said that the two governments will
hold further talks on the issue.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Malawi hopes that it will hold 16 percent
of the shares of the railroad and port after the management of
the Nacala Corridor is privatized.
</P>
<P>
But President Chissano said that it is too early to make such
estimation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two governments will hold more talks on new
proposals due to be raised by Malawi. He predicted that an
agreement will be reached eventually.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi expressed his hope that Malawi would not be excluded in
the process of privatizing the management of the corridor.
</P>
<P>
Malawi is the biggest customer of the Nacala Port
and the Nacala Corridor, Muluzi said, therefore it's important to
"let Malawi participate in" the privatization of the management
of the corridor.
</P>
<P>
The Malawian president left Nacala for home Tuesday with the
accompanying Transport and Communications Minister Kamandagabaz
Chambalo, and Agriculture and Irrigation Minister Aleke Banda.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Says Social Science Academy Needs To Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Li Tieying, the new president of
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, says that the academy's
research facilities should be improved in two or three years and
there should be more housing for researchers.
</P>
<P>
Li said the academy should have the highest level of social
science inquiry in the country to deal with problems in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The CASS, which was set up in 1977, has become the country's
ideology and theory center. Its 30 or so institutes have close
relations with academics outside China, but it is not seen as a
modern research institute of the electronic age and its 3,000
researchers do not get high salaries, and the housing problem is
acute.
</P>
<P>
Li, who replaced Hu Sheng as the CASS's president in March,
explained, "I come to provide logistic support for the academy."
He conveyed President Jiang Zemin's greetings to both researchers
and workers, and said that Jiang has mentioned the importance of
theoretical work repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible for a big Party like the Communist Party of
China and a big country like China to reach its goals of
invigorating the country without the guidance of correct theory,"
Li said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have said that CASS should assist and advise
the Party and the government, especially in economic matters and
policy making, and Li reveals that the central government has said
that a still better CASS required to be built, and he asked
researchers to complete more research projects this year, and that
more computers be installed and a new data base and a library be
built.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea, Japan to Hold Meeting on Security Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Japan will hold a
consultative meeting over Japan's military role in Northeast Asia
region on Friday, said South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and Trade Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We can not sit idly by watching Japan expand its military role
which could infringe upon the South Korean sovereignty," said Moon
Bong-joo, director of the ministry's Asia Pacific Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Japan has expanded its military power as a revised defense
cooperation agreement signed by the United States and Japan allows the
Japanese troops to assist the U.S. army in case of emergency in the
Northeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
At the first meeting on security issue in history, South Korea
is to ask for a pledge that the revised agreement will not violate
its sovereignty when the United States and Japan cooperate in case
of emergency.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to accept the proposal by Japan to hold the
consultative meeting on security, despite public sentiment against
Japan's past militarism. We though it is the right time to
establish a direct bilateral mechanism on security issues
involving the two nations, " said Moon.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Japan is expected to confer with South Korea
over emergency case in the Korean peninsula as problems there will
influence Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said South Korea expects the meeting will help
the establishment of the Northeast Asia Security Dialogue, a
regional multilateral security forum consisting of South Korea, the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the United States, China.
Russia and Japan. Seoul proposed to set up the forum in 1994.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In an exclusive interview with Liberation, the new prime
minister of Morocco Abderahmane Youssoufi outlined his program for
reform and opening of the country, a process which could make
Morocco one of the few democracies in Arab world despite serious
opposition to the evolution at home. The socialist leader also said
that a failure of the government could inevitably lead to the rise
of Islamic extremism in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
-- Facing a more and more threatening financial crisis, Russia
suddenly dramatized the game on Tuesday by presenting an austerity
economic plan. Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said that if
Russia cannot overcome its economic crisis, it should stop talking
about democracy. Russian President Boris Yeltsin also said the
present economic situation is ``alarming.''
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin presented on Tuesday an
``anti-crisis program'' which is aimed at reassuring the
International Monetary Fund and foreign investors and answering the
threats of financial collapse which came in the shadow of the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said on Tuesday that his
leftwing government will govern with a ``resolutely modern'' policy
while staying ``authentically left.'' He also pointed out that the
role being played by the left is more and more important in France
because of the internal turmoil of the rightwing parties.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President leader Yasser Arafat Wednesday avoided a
no-confidence motion against his cabinet in the legislative
council by announcing the mass resignation of his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) Wednesday decided to
cancel a no-confidence vote against Arafat's cabinet, said a PLC
statement faxed to Xinhua from Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The PLC is scheduled to discuss the no-confidence note on
Thursday over the alleged corruption by a number of PNA ministers
and poor execution of the approved PLC laws by the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The council decision was made after PLC Speaker Abu Ala
received a letter from Arafat announcing the resignation of the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"The resignations of all ministers have been accepted and
consultations (on forming a new cabinet) are still going on and a
list of the new government members will be presented to the PLC
within two weeks," Arafat said in the letter.

LENS, France, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Teenager Michael Owen may start
the England squad when they meet Colombia here on Friday, head coach
Glenn Hoddle has said.
</P>
<P>
"Starting Michael on Friday is an option, and one I always though
would come in for the third game because Colombia's shape is different
to the other two sides," said Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
"It was always earmarked that he would be nursed into the World
Cup," he said.
</P>
<P>
"That's been the correct thing and the proof is in the pudding of
the way he's come on and applied himself," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle said he thought Owen was a great talent and his goal against
Morocco proved that.
</P>
<P>
"I've never said anything different. I believe and I know that it's
been the right thing for him," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China has developed the Chengdao
Oilfield, off its east coast, with an annual output of 1.05
million tons, making it the largest oilfield in Bohai Bay.
</P>
<P>
According to a China National Petrochemical Corp. (Sinopec)
official, offshore exploration was difficult because of the
complicated geological structure, but engineers at the Shengli
Oilfield developed Chengdao by applying a vast array of new
technology for 3-D seismic surveys and oil reserve studies.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai area has 2.12 million tons of oil output and 367
million cubic meters of gas output annually.
</P>
<P>
Officials expect even greater progress this year in oil and gas
exploration in the Bohai area, and expect 60 million tons of oil
and 10 billion cu.m. of gas reserves.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed higher in Tokyo
Wednesday as Japanese export-oriented high-technology issues were
boosted by the U.S. dollar's upsurge above the 140 yen line.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of Tokyo Stock Exchange gained 68.58 points, or 0.46
percent, from Tuesday's close to finish at 15,123.18.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, added 5.51 points, or 0.47 percent, to
1,180.93.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section came at an estimated 370 million
shares, down from 421.57 million shares Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An overnight rise in New York stocks led by computer and
high-tech issues also supported the Tokyo stock market, but the
renewed weakness of the yen sent bank and real estate shares
falling, traders said.
</P>
<P>
A cheaper yen against the dollar may boost exports of
automobile and high-tech firms, but also discourages foreign
investors from buying Tokyo stocks and other assets, since a weak
yen means less profit on such investments.
</P>
<P>
A weaker yen also puts Asian exporters at more risk, in turn
makes Japanese banks more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,334 issues listed on the First Section, losers edged
gainers 575 to 530, with 154 issues remaining unchanged.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A lubricating oil plant funded by
Royal-Dutch Shell began operation in the Zhapu Development Zone in
China's Zhejiang Province recently.
</P>
<P>
The group also has a pitch factory there. The two projects cost
a total investment of 50 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Increased overseas investment in Zhapu in recent years shows
that the development zone has become a popular new spot for
overseas investors, says Ruan Xinguang, director of the zone's
management committee.
</P>
<P>
The zone covers 16 sq.km. on the northern edge of Hangzhou Bay,
about 100 km from the leading industrial cities of Shanghai,
Suzhou and Ningbo.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors are welcome in the port, real estate,
building materials, petrochemical, machinery, and electronics
sectors, Ruan says.
</P>
<P>
Zhapu has a coastline long enough to build 100 new berths. By
2010, the annual handling capacity of Zhapu Port is expected to
reach 50 million tons.

BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Hawaii is a household name for the
Chinese, and after President Jiang Zemin's visit to Honolulu last
fall, the people of this island state are showing an growing
interest in China as well.
</P>
<P>
The government of the state of Hawaii and the Chinese Chamber
of Commerce in Honolulu will for the first time jointly launch a
trade mission to China's mainland this fall. Previous trade
mission destinations were confined to Taiwan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The 'China Bonanza' is what everybody is talking about after
President Jiang's visit here, and President Clinton is going to
China, too," said Richard Bahar, an official with Hawaii's
Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
Wesley Fong, president of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in
Honolulu, said that during Jiang's stay in Hawaii he briefed them
on China's economic development and encouraged the Chinese
community in Hawaii to contribute to the growth of the
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"And we're pretty much encouraged," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-U.S. relations have been improving constantly and moving
forward in recent years, and President Jiang's visit has pushed
bilateral ties to a higher level, according to Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
Top-level visits and contacts have also boosted
non-governmental cooperation and partnership between the two
countries in economic, trade, cultural, educational and legal
fields, they said.
</P>
<P>
Heartening progress has been made in people-to-people exchanges
and cooperation between the two countries, they added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Will Not Reschedule Payment of Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Wednesday reiterated that it will not reschedule the payment of
its foreign debts as this will only dampen the trust of the
international community toward the country, a minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Before taking a foreign debt, the government always considers
its capability to repay it," Finance Minister Bambang Subianto
told House Commission VIII on Finance here.
</P>
<P>
Until April, the Indonesian government's foreign debts have
reached 51.7 billion U.S. dollars, including 19.5 billion U.S.
dollars in bilateral debt, 15.5 billion U.S. dollars in
multilateral debt and 13.7 billion U.S. dollars in export credit.
</P>
<P>
All these are soft loans, with low interests and a long term of
payment, and no political commitment, the minister said, adding
that all the loans were used to finance the production sector as
agreed with the creditors.
</P>
<P>
Subianto also explained the progress on the settlement of
private sector foreign debts which reached 78.2 billion U.S.
dollars last February.
</P>
<P>
He cited the agreement reached in Frankfurt, Germany, last June
3 by Indonesian negotiators and representatives of foreign
creditor banks. Under the agreement, Indonesian businessmen will
be given up to eight years to repay their foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
"The government will continue to monitor the settlement of the
country's corporate foreign debts and will issue policies to
control the growth of these debts," Subianto added.

Since the end of the 1970s, more than 160,000 Chinese students
and researchers have been to the United States. Of these, more
than 40,000 have returned to China. In 1997 alone, some 3,000
students from the United States have enrolled in Chinese
universities, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. stores are full of commodities with the tag "Made in

The movement of people and commerce between the United States
and China also is on the rise. While buses full of Chinese
tourists shuttle back and forth from Los Angeles in California to
the gambling mecca of Las Vegas in Nevada, container ships from
around the world -- including the United States -- move in and out
of the Tianjin Xingang Foreign Trade Wharf.
</P>
<P>
"According to my observation, our trade with the United States
has been steadily increasing this year," said a Customs
official in the wharf warehouse. The reason is China's economic
stability and its competitiveness, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The improving bilateral ties should also be credited," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese foreign trade officials cited the same reasons for
continuing U.S. investment in China this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent sample survey of 50 American companies,
two-thirds are making money in China, while most of the rest are
not profitable because of long-term investments or managerial
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The people-to-people exchanges between Chinese and Americans
appear to be expanding everywhere. Meetings, talks and
collaborative projects in the areas of law, economy, trade, news
and publication, and religion have been frequently held on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
Nashville, a city in the U.S. state of Tennessee, is best known
as the center of country-western music. But even this city in the
Deep South of the United States will soon have a Chinese judge
from Shanghai. The young magistrate is going to Nashville to learn
how the American court deals with the media. China's newly elected
president of the Supreme People's Court, Xiao Yang, just called
upon the Chinese courts to open to the media for live coverage.
</P>
<P>
"We are excited about the young man's arrival," said Tennessee
Judge Webbe Brothers, adding that "we are also interested in
knowing from him how the Chinese courts work."

<HEADLINE> Depressed Tobacco Prices Cause Concern in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Tobacco sales that opened on a
depressed note this year have caused concern to all tobacco
growers in central and southern Africa, the Tobacco Association
of Zambia (TAZ) has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here Tuesday, TAZ Executive Director Graham
Wallace said that tobacco prices started off 40 percent below
last year's prices and this shows that the initial pricing fell
below the cost of production for tobacco throughout central and
southern Africa, the weekly Financial Mail reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The trend is now a major concern to all tobacco growers in the
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wallace said that the tobacco prices in Africa are being
depressed more seriously than in other regions which are in
competition with Africa, like Brazil and North America.
</P>
<P>
The TAZ executive director pointed out that tobacco producers
in Africa now believe that African markets have been unfairly
singled out by buying companies.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this to the quest by these companies to maintain
profit margins in African countries for their overseas
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco growers accept that African markets are being
unfairly singled out by buying companies who want to help them
maintain profit margins in countries for their overseas
shareholders," said Wallace.
</P>
<P>
He added that tobacco growers now accept that there is fairly
widespread nervousness through the manufacturing and marketing
companies as a result of the litigation targeted against the
industry in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the collapse of the national economies of many
of the Far Eastern countries where much of the tobacco product is
sold has worsened the situation.
</P>
<P>
A grower in Africa is currently receiving less than 1.5 U.S.
Dollars per kilogram for his crop, which is on the same level as
the cost of production. But the same amount of tobacco will sell
overseas for somewhere in the region for 2.8 U.s. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 70 to 80 percent of the value earned from tobacco
sales goes to foreign governments in excise duty and the balance
to shareholders of the manufacturing and merchant companies.
</P>
<P>
Growers in various production companies are coming
increasingly together to share their problems and to press other
parties involved in the industry for a more equitable share of
the benefits, said the TAZ official.

<HEADLINE> Whole Grain Foods May Protect Against Cancers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Diet of whole grain foods,
particularly breads and pasta, may protect against a variety of
cancers, said a survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, published on the the latest issue of the
International Journal of Cancer, said that diet with many whole
grain foods may lower the risk of various cancers, including those
affecting the digestive tract (stomach, colon, rectum, liver,
pancreas and gall bladder), and those outside the digestive
system, including cancers of the upper respiratory tract, breast,
prostate, ovary, bladder, and kidney.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Liliane Chatenoud from Milan, Italy, and his colleagues,
who conducted this survey in northern Italy, had studied more than
10,000 hospital patients with a variety of cancers and almost
8,000 patients treated for non-cancerous conditions from 1983 to
1996.
</P>
<P>
They speculated that whole grains may have antioxidant effects,
reducing the risk of cancer by "mopping up" cancer-causing free
radical molecules formed during some cells processes.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Registers Trade Surplus in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea registered a trade
surplus of 3.73 billion U.S. dollars last month on the basis of
customs clearance, said the Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministry
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the nation's exports stood at 11.39 billion dollars
while its imports were 7.66 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Though exports fell three percent last month compared with the
same time of 1997, the balance recorded a surplus.
</P>
<P>
The continued reduction in facility investment since January
this year did make the sharp reduction in import.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the decreased exports to the
depreciation of the currencies in Southeast Asian countries and
the inability to obtain export financing at home.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, South Korean exports
amounted to 55.87 billion dollars, up 5.7 percent over the same
time of 1997, while imports totaled 39.79 billion dollars, down
35.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the trade surplus at that period came to 16.07 billion
dollars, accounting for 64.4 percent of the government's targeted
trade surplus of 25 billion dollars for 1998.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- American businesses, attracted by
the favorable overseas investment atmosphere in Shanghai, are
playing a role in the city's economy.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, the 2,293 businesses with U.S. backing there
had 3.3 billion U.S. dollars worth of committed foreign
investment, or 11 percent of Shanghai's total.
</P>
<P>
American business involvement in Shanghai goes back to 1982,
and because of good returns by pioneering U.S. companies, by 1995,
more than 350 U.S. companies were opening businesses in Shanghai,
at the rate of about one a day.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-funded businesses are having a profound influence on
Shanghai's industrial structure, according to industrial
analysts. Shanghai General Motors - the biggest U.S.-funded
company in Shanghai - was established last year and the first
Buick-Shanghai sedan is scheduled to come off the assembly line at
the end of this year. The company's annual production is targeted
at 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Other leading U.S. manufacturers in Shanghai are
McDonnell-Douglas, 3M, Westinghouse, and Hewlett-Packard. American
businesses are also involved in Shanghai's thriving service
industry. McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken have more than 100
outlets, and Citibank has moved its Asian headquarters from Hong
Kong to Shanghai and become one of first banks doing business in
renminbi, the Chinese currency.

grouping to finalize the agenda and other preparations for the
10th SAARC summit.
</P>
<P>
A number of important activities have taken place in recent
months including five ministerial meetings on commerce, tourism,
environment, information and communications, and the outcome of
these will be considered by the forthcoming summit scheduled for
July 29-31 in Colombo, Sri Lanka, the Kathmandu-based SAARC
Secretariat said in a press release Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Besides, economic issues, in particular those of strengthening
the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) and
establishing a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA), are expected
to figure prominently at the summit, the secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of trade negotiations have been concluded under
SAPTA launched in December 1995, offering more than 2,000 items of
products for tariff cuts ranging from 10 to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The summit will also study the report of the Group of Eminent
Persons which was commissioned by the 9th SAARC summit in May 1997
to undertake a comprehensive review of the functioning of SAARC
and to prepare a plan of action for the new millennium, it said.
</P>
<P>
The group met four times between December 1997 and early June
this year, and made an extensive appraisal of the progress of
SAARC since its establishment in December 1985.
</P>
<P>
The group had made a number of recommendations for
strengthening the institutional setup of the regional grouping and
developing a long-range vision for the future, the secretariat
said.
</P>
<P>
Kanti Kumar Poddar, president of the SAARC Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, told the press here Monday that he head learned the
group had recommended the postponement from 2001 to 2008 of the
realization of SAFTA.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the recommendation, saying that it is against the
will of the South Asian business community. He was in Nepal to
lobby for the idea of a SAARC Economic Union by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
Several meetings of SAARC countries will take place in Colombo
before the summit, the secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
The 20th session of the Council of Ministers is slated for July
27-28, while the Standing Committee comprising the foreign
secretaries of the member countries will convene on July 25-26, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian Food Security Reserve Board will also meet
during the course of the meetings preceding the summit. The South
Asian Food Security Reserve, operational since August 1988, serves
as a cushion against food shortages in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, presentation of the SAARC Youth Award 1998 will take
place when the Council of Ministers meets, the secretariat added.
</P>
<P>
The award was established last year to encourage the youth in
the region in participatory work and innovative activities.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Joint Arab Actions on Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has called for Arabs' common
strategy and joint actions in handling the Arab-Israel issues,
especially the Palestine issue.
</P>
<P>
The call was made during a joint meeting of Iraq's Revolution
Command Council and Regional Command of Arab Socialist Baath
Party, which was held on Tuesday night under the chairmanship of
President Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership believed that all Arab forces should be
mobilized to back up Arab nation's common strategy, said the
agency.
</P>
<P>
The call was made when Arab countries are planning a summit on
the stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace negotiations between Palestinians and Israel have
been stalled since March last year due to Israeli government's
hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also called on Arab countries to help lift U.N.
sanctions off Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The joint meeting also discussed Iraq's relationship with the
U.N. Security Council and Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
disarmament in Iraq, saying that Iraq's open letter on May 1 this
year to the Security Council should be the basis for settling all
problems.
</P>
<P>
In that letter, the Iraqi leadership demanded the lifting of
trade embargo imposed on Iraq as a prelude to the overall lifting
of U.N. economic sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The joint meeting also criticized the United States and UNSCOM
for trying to prolong the sanctions on Iraqi people, said the
agency report.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Economic Future Looks Promising: Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's economic future looks
promising because the Zimbabwean government has taken some
significant steps to resolve some of the major problems facing
the country's economy, noted an official from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Zimbabwe-Britain Society in
Harare Tuesday night, the World Bank President's Representative
in Zimbabwe, David Cook, said that the Zimbabwean government has
taken significant steps on the fisc through the reduction of its
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The government of Zimbabwe has also made progress in
rebuilding its foreign exchange reserves, which had been depleted
by the crash of the Zimbabwean Dollar last November.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's economic outlook is "so far good," Cook was quoted
by the daily Herald as reporting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The economic fundamentals of Zimbabwe are really not that
bad. They are manageable," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the fisc side, Cook said that the latest indications are
that the government is on course to meet the set target of
reducing its expenditure to reasonable levels.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government is expected to reduce the budget
deficit to 7.5 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) during
this financial year.
</P>
<P>
Investor confidence is slowly picking up after suffering a
setback during the last half of last year over uncertainty
regarding funding of war veterans and the government's policy on
the land reform program, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that more still needs to be done on the
banking sector where confidence has been low after the collapse
of the United Merchant Bank.

<HEADLINE> China Remains Largest Borrower from World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China continued to be the largest
borrower of investment loans from the World Bank in fiscal year
1998 which ended on June 30, receiving 2.6 billion U.S. dollars,
or 9 percent of the World Bank's overall commitments.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Resident Mission in China of the World Bank
said that China has used these loans to finance 16 development
projects.
</P>
<P>
China rejoined the World Bank in 1981 and became its largest
borrower in fiscal year 1993. By the end of fiscal year 1998,
World Bank loans to China had grown to about 30.359 billion
U.S. dollars to finance 200 projects.
</P>
<P>
Lending for transportation, energy, industrial, urban
development and other infrastructure projects accounted for more
than half of the total portfolio, with the remainder going to
agriculture, social sectors, environment and water supply and
sanitation, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
World Bank sources said the bank's mandate in China is to
support broad-based economic development in the pursuit of poverty
reduction. Projects aided by the bank have played a unique role in
supporting China's economic reform and modernization process,
targeting the alleviation of poverty, infrastructure development
and human resources development.
</P>
<P>
"In the midst of the Asian crisis, it is encouraging to note
that China's overall economic performance remains strong and that
the bank's portfolio of projects continues to be one of the best
in the bank," said Yukon Huang, Director of the World Bank China
Program. "This provides a good basis for the bank to assist China
in coping with the challenges that lie ahead."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies U.S. Allegation of Having Nerve Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has categorically denied the
U.S. allegation that it has nerve gas warheads, the Iraqi News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted an Iraqi National Monitoring Department
spokesman as saying Tuesday night that the U.S. allegation is the
same kind of rumors as those fabricated before by the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on disarmament in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army laboratory in Aberdeen, Maryland, has reportedly
claimed to find traces of the deadly VX nerve gas on Iraq's
missile warheads.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said that it was surprising that UNSCOM
chose a U.S. army laboratory to make experiments and draw
conclusion, rather than choosing laboratories from neutral
countries.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler will brief the Security Council
Thursday on his talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
10 days ago in Baghdad, during which the two sides reached an
agreement on the program of work for the next two months.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in a letter to the Security Council recently that
Iraqi scientists had experimented with VX but were unable to turn
it into a weapon, and that 1.7 tonnes of the agent had been
produced but it was not of weapons grade.

<HEADLINE> 4 Kenyan Banks Reduce Base Lending Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Four leading banks in Kenya have
decided to lower their base rates on loans after the government
presented the 1998/99 budget aimed at narrowing budget deficit at
the parliament two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Commercial Bank announced Tuesday it will reduce its
base lending rate from 27.5 percent to 26.5 percent from July 1,
following similar moves by Barclays Bank, Standard Chartered Bank
and ABN-Amro Bank.
</P>
<P>
The down also came after a general decline in Treasury Bill
yields as the government cuts its borrowing from the public.
</P>
<P>
Maurice Kanga, chief economist of the Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK), said Tuesday that the average interest on the 91-Treasury
Bill declined to 25.40 percent in the auction dated June 2,
compared to 25.42 in the previous auction.
</P>
<P>
Kanga said that liquidity in the domestic market tightened
during the week to June 19, with the average interbank borrowing
rate moving from 15.26 percent on June 15 to 26.82 percent on
June 19, due to tax payments.
</P>
<P>
"The Central Bank of Kenya has since injected liquidity
through the Repurchase Agreements (Repos) with banks to ease the
situation," Kanga said in the weekly CBK bulletin.
</P>
<P>
On exchange rates, CBK said the Shilling went on strengthening
against the hard currencies, with an average exchange rate of
59.72 Shillings to the U.S. Dollar and 99.44 to the Pound,
compared to 60.98 Shillings and 99.65 Shillings to the Dollar and
the Pound respectively in the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Science, Technology Boosts China's Oil Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China has developed an important
theory of continental petroleum geology and a series of updated
technologies through 40 years of research and experiments, which
has effectively boosted the country's oil exploration and production,
a top oil official has said.
</P>
<P>
Using the theory and technologies, China has located 27 large
oil fields, each with deposits above 100 million tons, including
the well-known ones at Daqing in the northeast and Renqiu in
north China, according to Li Tianxiang, chairman of the Science
and Technology Committee of the China National Petroleum
Corp. (CNPC).
</P>
<P>
The official said that with exploration and practice China has
finally developed the technologies of layer-by-layer
oil-extraction, stabilizing oil reserves with injected water, and
using the polymer-drive extraction method, which are all
comparable to advanced methods used around the world.
</P>
<P>
Other major Chinese oil fields in the Bohai Bay area --
Shengli, Liaohe, Huabei (North China) and Dagang -- have developed
the rolling exploration technology which has increased oil
exploration in the area.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Bohai Bay area has been found to have proven oil
deposits of 7.28 billion tons and it produces 61 million tons of
crude a year, making it the second largest oil and gas production
base after Daqing, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the exploration of complex oil layers, China has come up
with a range of thermodynamic technologies to explore thick oil,
mainly by the use of steam.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the country produces 12 million tons of thick oil a
year, the fourth largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
A leading official with CNPC said China has set an explicit
target of proving 2.5-to-3 billion tons of oil reserves by the
turn of the century, and having an annual oil and gas output of
150 million tons and 25 billion cubic meters, respectively, by
2000.
</P>
<P>
To meet the goal, the official said China is launching eight
huge petroleum science-and-technology projects, and 32
technological developments nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Chinese Run Greater Risk of Osteoporosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Elderly Chinese are running a
greater risk of suffering the bone disease osteoporosis and
related fractures, according to research in one of China's largest
city.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of fractures among Shanghai residents aged 60 and
older almost doubled in the 1990-1997 period, rising to 9.96
percent from 3.35 percent in males and 15.28 percent from 8.78
percent in females.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Shanghai Institute of Gerontology told the
"Wenhui Daily" that rapid aging of the Chinese population,
improper diet and lack of physical exercise have led to more
osteoporosis cases.
</P>
<P>
And Shanghai is not alone. Experts in Beijing warned that China
has had about 84 million osteoporosis sufferers, about 76 percent
of the population 60 and older.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of a greying wave in China, the number of patients
will increase to 110 million by 2010, and exceed 200 million by
the middle of the next century, said Professor Liu Zhonghou,
chairman of the Osteoporosis Committee of the China Gerontological
Society.
</P>
<P>
Female osteoporosis patients outnumber males 6-to-1 in China,
and as they get older their bones are more susceptible to
fractures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many people still underestimate the danger of
the disease and pay little attention to prevention, he said.
</P>
<P>
World Osteoporosis Day was launched last year on June 24 to
increase people's awareness of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Experts have suggested that old people eat more calcium-rich
food, get some sunshine, and do proper physical exercises to
prevent the disease.

</P>
<P>
The new company will provide cargo transport, information,

</P>
<P>
Many other European companies have been putting their money,
advanced technology, and experience to work in China. By the end

with 13 billion U.S. dollars worth of paid-in investment.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that great business opportunities will come as
China's investment conditions improve with political stability,
and fast economic growth.
</P>
<P>
At the '98 Sino-European economic and trade fair in Brussels in
mid-June, officials and business people discussed European
companies' investment experiences in China and China's overseas
investment policies. It also held investment promotion activities
for agriculture, the chemical industry, energy, and infrastructure.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.N. Trains African Army on Logistics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations began training
African military personnel on logistics so as to help Africa to
response skillfully to the rising need for peacekeeping
operations in the continent.
</P>
<P>
A 10-day U.N.-sponsored logistics course, opened by Kenya's
Chief of General Staff General, Daudi Tonje, Tuesday in Nairobi,
is attended by service commanders and senior military officers
from different African countries, local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the course is to support the build-up of U.N.
logistics knowledge, an area that has been identified by African
member states as weak, said Tonje in a speech.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya and most African member states have in the past been
involved in peacekeeping missions and have responded to crises in
several parts of the world whenever called upon," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our armies must be organized, equipped, and trained to
adequately manage our basic function of defending our countries
with minimal resources," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The deputy military advisor to U.N. boss Kofi Annan, Mohinder
Bhagat, said the course is modeled on the U.N. training conducted
by Canada and Norway.
</P>
<P>
"Logistics is the key element in assuring the timely,
successful and effective deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping
operation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Too often, U.N operations have been constrained by the
support that has been provided and it is only through the
preparation of member states staff that we will overcome these
limitations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The course will end on July 2.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder for President Clinton's China trip: Cleaning up River to Beautify South China Tourist Attraction-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The water in the river is now so clear that the bottom can
easily be seen, and no heavy metals, toxic waste, or harmful
materials have been detected in the main stream in recent year,
making it one of the cleanest urban rivers in China.
</P>
<P>
The cleaner Lijiang River has been a good water source for the
Pepsi Cola Company, Guilin's first U.S.-funded project.
</P>
<P>
Improving 4 tributaries of the river is the latest move by
local authorities to keep the Lijiang River clean and beautiful, a
move that is expected to cost 120 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Part of the money will come from a World Bank loan. The project
is expected to start by the end of this year. The cleaning-up will
be completed before 2000, said Luo Guijiang, director of Guilin's
environment protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection has become a subject in Guilin's
primary and middle schools, showing the government's determination

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat has
urged Washington to step up pressure on Israel and go public its
plan for Israeli redeployment in West Bank, chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
Arafat reminded her that she had assured him last month that her
negotiations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a
second redeployment would be completed within two weeks, Erekat
said.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Netanyahu surprised some of the country's leading economists
by declaring Tuesday that Israel has successfully tackled its
inflation problem and can now focus on achieving other economic
goals.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the closing session of the Zichron Yaakov
economic conference, the prime minister said there is no place to
cut inflation any more next year because most experts believe that
prices rise will be 4 to 5 percent this year, far lower than the
set ceiling of 7 to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Arafat's office said Tuesday that the impasse in the peace
process will continue if Israel goes ahead with a referendum,
which it said has not been called for by any previous agreements
reached between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The office said that the referendum is only an attempt by
Netanyahu to dodge Israel's commitments over the second
redeployment.

<P>
GUILIN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Gao Quanzhong, whose family has
live alongside the Lijiang river in south China city for
generations, is a member of a special team of 94 farmers who are
protecting the woods along the river, which is a major tourist
attraction for the city of Guilin.
</P>
<P>
But, its thriving tourism and industry had caused environmental
problems, so Guilin started to close heavily polluting factories
back in 1979, and has so far shut down 49 in spite of losses to
the local economy.
</P>
<P>
It has also built four sewage disposal plants that treat 40
percent of the city's waste water, and ten garbage-disposal sites
to treat 81 percent of the city's garbage. And, boats using the
Lijiang have been equipped with waste storage facilities to
prevent the direct discharge of human waste into the river. More
trees have also been planted along the river. "With the river
getting cleaner, many fish have come back," said the 50-year-old
Gao.
</P>
<P>
The return of the fish is one of the more remarkable changes
that have come to one of China's most beautiful rivers.

<P>
The just-concluded poll, conducted among 36,190 people by the
Suan Dusit Rajabhat Institute, showed that 61.98 percent of the
respondents were satisfied with Chuan's performance so far, while
48.91 percent were happy with the work of his six-party coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll findings available Wednesday, 42.68
percent were satisfied with the government efforts to tackle
national problems; 42.98 percent were happy with the coalition's
unity; 45.98 percent with its clean image; and 48.48 percent with
its non-interference in state agency affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Chuan government also scored 6.78 points out of 10 for its
performance over the six months in office.
</P>
<P>
The Chuan government's score was higher than the 5.01 points

for the 1995-96 government of Banharn Silpa-archa in the same
period of time after coming into office.
</P>
<P>
The poll revealed that the Chuan government was popular in all
regions of the country except the impoverished northeast which
preferred Chavalit of the New Aspiration Party.
</P>
<P>
Pollster Sukhum Chalooeysap said Chuan's popularity was a major
factor contributing to the stability of his coalition government.
</P>
<P>
On the question of which areas of government performance they
found to be least satisfactory, 47.05 percent pointed to the

<HEADLINE> Australian Scientists Discover Test for EPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Australian sport scientists
claimed a major breakthrough on Wednesday in the battle against
doping with the discovery of the first test to detect the banned
substance erythropoietin (EPO).
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Sydney, the director of the
internationally acclaimed Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), Dr
Ross Smith, said the institute had developed a screening test it
hoped could be approved for the Sydney 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells around the
body and is believed to be widely used in endurance sports such as
cycling and cross-country skiing. But it has also been linked to
the deaths of several athletes.
</P>
<P>
Smith said: "We know that EPO dramatically changes the
parameters of the blood cells and we believe we have found a
screening method that can detect those changes."
</P>
<P>
EPO was first introduced in the mid-1980s to treat kidney
disease, but is now considered one of the most dangerous drugs in
sport.
</P>
<P>
Smith said AIS scientists had discovered that artificial EPO
altered the profile of red blood cells which behaved differently
when they came into contact with haemoglobin or iron.
</P>
<P>
Natalie Howson, chief executive of the Australian Sports Drug
Agency, said the development of a foolproof test would be a major
breakthrough in the fight against drugs in sport.
</P>
<P>
Smith said a series of controlled tests would be carried out on
24 high-level athletes over the next two months.
</P>
<P>
He said the results would be presented to the IOC, which would
ultimately decide whether or not to introduce blood testing in
time for the Sydney Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sees Surging Public Sector Borrowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' public sector
borrowing requirement is expected to double to 83.8 billion pesos
(2.09 billion U.S. dollars) this year from the original projection
due to increased borrowings of the government.
</P>
<P>
The original public sector borrowing target was 43.2 billion
pesos (1.1 billion dollars), which was already higher than the
40.3 billion pesos (1 billion dollars) posted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The increased borrowing of the government and other government
agencies was due to the sharp drop in revenue collection,
officials of the central bank told reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With less revenues, the government will have to source some of
its funding through borrowings from the private sector, they said.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in revenue collection has been attributed to the
economic slowdown caused by the regional currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The public sector borrowing requirement is the aggregate
borrowings of the national government, local government units,
government-owned corporations, government financial institutions,
the central bank and government-run social security systems.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the country's four economic performance criteria
monitored by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The deterioration in the fiscal position of the national
government also caused public sector borrowing to balloon.
</P>
<P>
The national government is projected to post a budget deficit
of 36.8 billion pesos (920 million dollars) this year instead of
an earlier-expected 5 billion peso (125 million dollars) surplus.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Begin Industrial Park Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Construction work on six
large-scale industrial projects will begin soon at Sri Lanka's
industrial park at Sitavaka 40 kilometers west of the capital city
of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Industrial Development Minister C. V. Gooneratne Tuesday handed
over the letters of approval to the six pioneers of the Sitavaka
industrial park, Industrial Development Ministry sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These projects will employ more than 3,000 people, they said.
</P>
<P>
A further 10 projects would be given approval in two weeks and
several applications for joint ventures with foreign technical and
financial collaboration had also been received, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
These applications involve investors from India, Sweden,
Britain, Malaysia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
They said the industrial park will have ventures for the
manufacture of wooden products, rubber goods, high value garments,
soft toys, embroidery, zip fasteners, gems and jewelry, industrial
safety equipment and mineral products, and food processing.
</P>
<P>
The products will be mainly for export. Special incentives
including a 10-year tax holiday are offered to the investors.
</P>
<P>
The industrial park is located on a 168-hectare area at
Sitavaka and is the largest infrastructural project in the
country. The construction started in July 1997 and will be
completed this December.
</P>
<P>
The project, funded by the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund
of Japan and the Consolidated Fund of Sri Lanka, is estimated to
cost 3.6 billion rupees (about 61.91 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Muslims Making Pilgrimages to Mecca (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1984, Du spent 8,000 yuan (975 U.S. dollars) on his first
pilgrimage to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the government's policy on privately run
enterprises, Du's eldest son ran a factory in the neighboring
Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region. A second son has a fur and
cashmere business, and a third son runs an Islamic restaurant in
Wuqing City.
</P>
<P>
Having earned more money, Du made his second pilgrimage to
Mecca in 1994, accompanied by his eldest son and daughter-in-law.
This time, the cost of the trip for each of his family members was
21,400 yuan (2,600 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ningxia and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are the
country's area's inhabited by the most Moslems. The annual per
capita income of rural residents in the two regions in 1997 was at
least 14 times higher than 20 years before.
</P>
<P>
Ma Zhengang, a 52-year-old farmer in Guyuan Prefecture, said
improved transportation has made it easier for Muslims to go on
Mecca trips. He recalled that it took his father-in-law three
years to cover the whole pilgrimage when he traveled by camel and
sought temporary jobs during the journey.
</P>
<P>
Now, highways link all the counties in the region's mountainous
areas. He said Muslims now take trains to Beijing and fly
chartered planes to Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Muslims Making Pilgrimages to Mecca (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Wang Jinyu, 24, has finally
realized his dream to make a "Haji", or pilgrimage, to Mecca in
Saudi Arabia, the sixth member in his family.
</P>
<P>
The grandson-in-law of 88-year-old Imam Du Wanzhen in northwest
China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Wang is among 50,000
wealthy Chinese Muslims who have made pilgrimages to Mecca since
1985.
</P>
<P>
Xue Shenglin, deputy head of the Islamic Association of China,
said 5,000 Chinese Muslims made pilgrimages to Mecca this year and
half of them went in groups organized by the association.
</P>
<P>
At least one of every 400 Muslims among China's 20 million
Muslims has made a pilgrimage to Mecca, he said. Making the
pilgrimage is considered one of the five most important things in
the lifetime of a Muslim.
</P>
<P>
Du has been the Imam, or officiating priest at his mosque, for
half a century. He made his first pilgrimage to Mecca in 1984 when
he was in his 70s.
</P>
<P>
However, in the following 14 years, five more of his family
members went on pilgrimages to Mecca because of the family's
improved living standard.
</P>
<P>
Xue said the government guarantees normal religious activities
and those who can afford to go are being allowed to go on
pilgrimages.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1989, the association sent Muslims to Mecca on
chartered planes together with translators and doctors.
</P>
<P>
Du said that since China's implementation in the 1970s of a new
policy on the use of agricultural land, his family leased half a
hectare to grow vegetables, which are sold in the city.

<P>
Hasina is the first head of government to visit her country's
two South Asian neighbors, after India exploded five nuclear
devices on May 11 and 13, and Pakistan retaliated by six tests on
May 28 and 30.
</P>
<P>
"We want peace and stability in the region. Arms race will not
benefit anyone," Hasina said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister ruled out her role as a mediator
between India and Pakistan. "I am not mediating and I will not do
so," she said.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Hasina sent separate letters to Sharif and
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, expressing her
willingness to visit the two countries to discuss the situation
after the tests.

<HEADLINE> Two Joint-venture Automakers in Vietnam Stop Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Two joint-venture car assemblies,
Ford-Vietnam and Nissan-Vietnam, have stopped their operations,
reports here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ford-Vietnam, located near Hanoi, came to a stop after six
months' operations because of its inability to sell its products
in the Vietnamese market, which was saturated with imported cars.
</P>
<P>
Nissan-Vietnam, which was situated in Da Nang City in central
Vietnam, cancelled its assembly line construction due to capital
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
There are 14 joint-venture car assemblies in Vietnam with an
estimated total design capacity of 140,000 units a year or 30
percent higher than the figure predicted for Vietnam's market by
2010.
</P>
<P>
However, only eight of the 14 joint-ventures are currently in
operation and they are unable to run at full capacity at this initial
stage.
</P>
<P>
Official reports showed that automakers in Vietnam sold only
5,700 units in domestic market last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali rupee fell further
against the U.S. dollar by 0.40 rupee to a record low of 68.00
rupees for a U.S. dollar on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Rastra Bank, the country's central bank, on Wednesday
refixed the buying and selling rates of the rupee against the
dollar at 68.00 and 68.65 respectively from Tuesday's 67.60 and
68.25.
</P>
<P>
The latest fluctuation of the Nepali rupee came after the
Indian rupee, to which the Nepali rupee is pegged, hit a new low
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After maintaining stability for three months by mid-May, the
Nepali rupee has weakened against the dollar by 4.30 rupees since
then.
</P>
<P>
As the Indian rupee keeps sliding over the international
economic sanctions following India's nuclear tests last month, the
Nepali currency, pegged to the Indian currency at a fixed rate of
1.6:1, has to follow suit.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 24 (Xinhua) -- About one million Cambodians
soon could be infected with the AIDS virus if tougher preventive
measures are not taken, the Cambodia Daily Wednesday quoted
Minister of Health Chhea Thaing as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chhea Thaing made the warning at a meeting of the National
Committee for HIV/AIDS and STD Prevention and Control Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that although condom sales has increased to 900,000
pieces a month, the AIDS problem is still growing. Data from the
Health Ministry showed there are between 30 and 50 new infections
a day. Cases of HIV are concentrated heavily among the 5 million
people living in Phnom Penh and the surrounding provinces.
</P>
<P>
Chhea Thaing also warned the increasing number in housewives
falling into the victims to the virus. In Cambodia, AIDS is no longer
a monoply for sexually active people. About 20,000 housewives have
contracted HIV from their husbands. A further 40,000 are at the risk
from infected husbands. An estimated 120,000 Cambodians are
HIV-positive.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetos Bill on Sanctions Against Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday vetoed legislation that imposes sanctions on foreign
governments or businesses supplying ballistic missile technology
to Iran, saying it would damage the national interest.
</P>
<P>
"This bill would hinder, not help, our overall national
interests ... making it harder to achieve the goals it is
intended to serve," Clinton said in a written statement.
"Therefore, I am vetoing this bill."
</P>
<P>
The veto of the Iran Missile Proliferation Act came at a time
when Clinton expressed his hope last week for a "genuine
reconciliation with Iran" if it complies with the so-called standards
the United States set up as conditions for normalization of relations.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has already eased travel to the
United States for Iranians and is supporting cultural and
academic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
As a gesture of rapprochement with Iran, Clinton decided last
month to waive sanctions against French, Russian and Malaysian
firms that have reached a deal with Iran for investment in its
energy sector.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said earlier that sanctions
legislation produced "hopeless shackles on the presidency,"
leaving no flexibility for the president on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, McCurry said, the legislation cast such a wide
net that some companies or countries would be unfairly punished,
possibly backfiring on U.S. goals of halting missile technology
transfers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said he was particularly concerned about the
bill's impact on the U.S. effort to work with Russia to stem the
flow of technology from Russia to Iran's missile program.
</P>
<P>
But the legislation failed to take into account the progress
that the administration had made in persuading Russia not to sell
missile technology to Iran, he said.
</P>
<P>
The administration is appearing to rethink its sanctions policy
as the United States has been facing strong opposition from allies
who condemned U.S. sanctions that punished foreign firms doing
business with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress have threatened to override the veto.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Firm Reaches New Mining Contract With Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian firm Ivanhoe Myanmar
Holding Ltd. has reached one more contract with the Myanmar mining
authorities to explore mineral deposits in the Southeast Asian
country.
</P>
<P>
Exploration of gold and copper deposits will be undertaken
under the third joint venture contract signed here Tuesday between
the company and the Geological Survey and Mineral Exploration
Department of the Myanmar Ministry of Mines, the official New
Light of Myanmar newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The exploration activities will be carried out in the
Myesaytaung area in Bago division's Letpadan township, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The Ivanhoe company had earlier signed two joint venture
contracts with Myanmar. One joint venture produces 25,000 tons of
copper annually from the mineral deposits at the Kyesin and Sabei
hills in Mongywa and Salingyi townships beginning this year, and
the other extracts mineral deposits at the Letpadaung hill in the
northern part of the country, where more than 400 million tons of
deposits have been detected.
</P>
<P>
Other Canadian companies involved in mineral exploitation in
Myanmar include the First Dynasty, Panorama and Palmer Resources.
</P>
<P>
Altogether a dozen foreign companies including those from
Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the United
States have been participating in mineral extraction in Myanmar,
with Canadian companies specializing in copper mining.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, foreign investments in
Myanmar's mining sector exceeded 498 million U.S. dollars in 42
related projects at the end of February this year.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics also show that the output value of
Myanmar's mining sector rose 1.5 percent in the 1997-98 fiscal
year ending March compared with the previous year. Production of
copper totaled 509,172 tons in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Exports of mineral and non-metallic products, mainly copper,
tin concentrates and gems, amounted to 43 million dollars in
fiscal 1996-97.

<HEADLINE> BankAmerica Expects U.S. Trade Deficit to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The overall U.S. trade deficit
will go up to 145 billion U.S. dollars this year, from 114 billion
dollars in 1997, according to the Bank of America's latest forecast.
</P>
<P>
Two economists of the bank said they made the forecast, which
was outlined in the bank's June Economic &AMP; Business Outlook,
mainly in consideration of the impact of Asia's economic crisis
and the continued domestic economic growth of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit has been widening since the
economy emerged from recession in 1991, and will further rise in
1998 as a result of robust U.S. economic growth and past dollar
strength, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicted that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit will
reach 232 billion dollars in 1998, up from 199 billion dollars in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall could be larger if U.S. consumer spending remains
stronger than currently anticipated, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the services component of U.S. trade is growing
rapidly, producing a record surplus of 85 billion dollars in 1997,
and is expected to grow further this year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports to Asia, excluding Japan, were down 15.9 percent
in March from a year earlier. Domestically, continued strength in
the consumer and business sector will keep U.S. import flows
running strong, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcing these trends is the recent strengthening in the
trade-weighted exchange value of the U.S. dollar, which makes
U.S. exports less competitive while cheapening U.S. imports, the
bank economists said.

<HEADLINE> "People's Daily": Raising Standards of Using Overseas Investment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- "People's Daily," China's leading
national newspaper, today runs a full page publishing a group of
summary articles calling for opening wider and raising the level
of using overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
These articles are based on speeches delivered by leaders of
ministries, central government departments, officials from
Shanghai and Hubei, an executive from SINOPEC and a foreign trade
researcher. The speeches were part of a recent forum on further
increasing the standards for using overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission, said in his speech that, under the current
situation, breakthroughs should be made in the use of overseas
investment in the service sector, in reforming the state-owned
enterprises and in developing the private business economy, and in
the central and western areas of China. More multinationals should
also be attracted to invest in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meng Xiangang, deputy secretary-general of the State Economic
and Trade Commission, called for the successful operation of
existing overseas-financed businesses in China by means of
improving the investment environment and giving a helping hand in
resolving difficulties and problems in production or operations
faced by overseas enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wan Baorui, vice-minister of agriculture, urged a
successful use of overseas investment in developing China's
farming sector, while Hu Xijie, vice-minister of communications,
said that utilizing overseas investment in an active, rational and
efficient manner is important to the country's transportation
infrastructure.

Meanwhile, Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister of foreign trade and
economic cooperation, noted that his ministry would intensify
overseas investment promotion programs, improve the industrial
structure of overseas investment, open wider China's service
sector still and implement policies to encourage more overseas
investment in China's central and western areas so as to keep the
volume of overseas investment at a constant level this year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yiren, vice-mayor of Shanghai, pledged that his city
would open more areas to overseas investors, while Deng Daokun,
vice-governor of central China's Hubei Province, said his province
would speed up the pace of overseas funding by encouraging
investment in agriculture, infrastructure and the revitalization
of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Chen Tonghai, deputy general manager of the China National
Petrochemical Corp. (SINOPEC), said his group would pay great
attention to the study of changes in the use of overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, China had approved 312,174 overseas-financed
businesses, with contracts involving a use of 538.675 billion
U.S. dollars of investment from overseas and actual paid-in
overseas investment of 236.756 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total approved overseas-backed businesses, 7,308
were added in the first five months of this year, down by 7.33
percent as compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The contractual use of overseas investment in the newly
approved overseas businesses amounted to 17.511 billion

<HEADLINE> Tropical Fish Moving to Mediterranean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of tropical fish
species, attracted by the increasingly warm waters of the
Mediterranean, are making the sea their permanent home and
threatening its ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
A study by Icram, Italy's leading marine research center, said
there were 55 species of warm-water fish in the Mediterranean,
making up 20 percent of its fish life. In 1986, there were only
40 species there.
</P>
<P>
This increase is attributed to the rising water temperature of
the Mediterranean, which has risen one degree in the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The warm-water fish, coming from the Saharan Atlantic and the
Red Sea, have thrived in part because indigenous Mediterranean
species have been weakened by over-fishing and deteriorating
environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
The red mullet, a newcomer in the sea, has become a major
economic resource along the Egyptian coast. The siganus is
replacing the salpa in the eastern Mediterranean. The globefish
is now common in Sicily and the striped sea urchin, an Atlantic
fish, also comes to Sicily.
</P>
<P>
Italian Environment Minister Edo Ronchi described the changes
in the distribution of species Tuesday as a worrying indication of
climatic change.

<HEADLINE> More Uruguayan Teachers Strike for Higher Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Discussions between teachers
and the authorities over wage increases worsened in Uruguay on
Tuesday as secondary school teachers in the capital city of
Montevideo joined strikes occurring in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Teachers' Union is demanding an average salary of 5,500
pesos (nearly 550 U.S. dollars) for the teachers, more than double
the 2,000 pesos (less than 200 dollars) they are making at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
The union is also calling for better working conditions.
</P>
<P>
The educational authorities estimated that an additional 255
million dollars is needed in the budget to pay for the increase,
which they said would be almost impossible under current economic
conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, they said they were willing to negotiate with the
teachers and would ask for more money in next year's budget.

<HEADLINE> Italian Lower House Approves NATO Expansion Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Italy's lower house approved NATO's
eastwards expansion Tuesday in what had become a vital test for
Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government.
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved by 310 votes in favor, with 79 against
and 169 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Olive Tree coalition, along with the small
opposition Democratic Union for the Republic party, voted for the
bill, which allows NATO to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic as its new members.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Refoundation Party and the Northern League voted
against while the Freedom Front abstained.
</P>
<P>
Before the voting, Prodi appealed to all parties to vote in
favor of the bill to ratify NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that the outcome of the vote would in no way
affect his government, which would continue to work on the program
it presented to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said: "What is at stake is the ability of our parliament and
our nation to demonstrate to its allies and to the whole world
that Italy is well aware of its responsibilities, its duties and
its international interests well beyond any coalition which
governs at the time."
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the Atlantic alliance had performed, and
still did, the role of guaranteeing security to member nations in
the most efficient and long-lasting way.

<HEADLINE> PAL Creditors Barred From Pressing Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) and a U.S. bankruptcy court have barred
banks, suppliers, leasers and other parties from pressing their
claims against the cash-strapped Philippine Airlines (PAL), a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
PAL legal counsel Estelito Mendoza was quoted by the Manila
Times as saying Tuesday that a U.S. bankruptcy court has issued a
temporary restraining order barring all persons or entities
anywhere in the U.S. from pursuing or enforcing claims against
PAL.
</P>
<P>
The order was issued by the bankruptcy court in the northern
district of California in response to PAL's petition against
American firm Aviation Sales Leasing Co., one of PAL's aircraft
leasers, which had filed for claims against the airline.
</P>
<P>
In Manila, the SEC also issued an order suspending all claims
pending before any local court or body against the debt-ridden and
strike-crippled national flag carrier.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. bankruptcy court's order, which effectively restrains
PAL's US-based creditors from seizing any of the airline's assets,
will be effective until July 2.
</P>
<P>
Mendoza said if PAL encounters a similar problem with its
creditors in Europe, the company will also seek the same
protection.
</P>
<P>
The SEC on Tuesday created a receivership committee to take
custody of all existing assets and properties of PAL and discuss a
rehabilitation program filed by the company last Friday.
</P>
<P>
PAL said in the petition that it was unable to pay a total of
2.1 billion dollars in debt due to its deteriorating financial
situation aggravated by the ongoing strike of its pilots.
</P>
<P>
The airline said it plans to retrench some 5,000 employees or
40 percent of its workforce, suspend more than two-thirds of
routes and dispose of dozens of airplanes.
</P>
<P>
SEC Chairman Perfecto Yasay said the interim receiver will
assist PAL and SEC in drafting a rehabilitation plan that will
save the company from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, no concrete agreements were reached in a
meeting between PAL officials and officers of the PAL Employees
Association which has filed a notice of strike protesting the
airline's retrenchment program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the striking PAL pilots' union showed no signs of
conciliation with the management. The devastating strike of some
600 PAL pilots, which entered the 21st day Wednesday, has cost PAL
more than 2 billion pesos (50 million dollars) in lost revenue,
PAL said.

BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
worked out standards for the classification of retail outlets to
standardize market practices.
</P>
<P>
According to a document of the State Internal Trade Bureau,
retail outlets will be divided into eight types: department
stores, supermarkets, large-scale comprehensive supermarkets,
convenience shops, warehouse stores, shops for special products,
boutiques and shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
The retail sector has flourished in an unprecedented manner in
recent years. However, due to a lack of regulations, the naming of
retail outlets has not been up to standards, bureau officials said.

GUANGZHOU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant
in south China's Guangdong Province has recently cleared a loan of
1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars raised in the Hong Kong market in
1988.
</P>
<P>
This means that the plant has paid off the first package of
overseas loans due to its successful operation and efficient use

</P>
<P>
So far, it has paid off 2.6 billion U.S. dollars in
construction loans and 700 million of circulating loans credited
by the Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that paying off such a big loan package has earned
a reputation for both the bank and the plant, which is China's
first nuclear power plant built with foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Urged to Be Stricter Against Bank Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
needs to enhance its ability to enforce regulations to contain the
rise in bank failures, a U.S.-based international credit rating
agency says.
</P>
<P>
In a report published Wednesday, Moody's Investors Services
said the central bank's inability to conduct surprise examinations
and the problem of corruption among bank examiners had weakened
the bank's capacity to effectively implement banking regulations.
</P>
<P>
"The monitoring and supervisory power of the central bank is
significantly constrained by its inability to conduct surprise
examinations," Moody's said in the report on the outlook of the
Philippine banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Special examinations need to be approved by the Monetary Board
but Moody's said that after the board's clearance is obtained, "it
has already long lost the element of surprise."
</P>
<P>
Moody's also raised the issue of corruption of bank examiners,
the first time the matter was mentioned in an analysis of the
problems confronting the country's banking sector.
</P>
<P>
"The widespread corruption of bank examiners, which often is
responsible for failure in early detection, further weakens the
regulatory powers of the central bank," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Quite often, the central bank comes into a troubled bank to
clean up the mess, instead of performing its preventive duties."
</P>
<P>
Moody's also outlined broad policy recommendations towards
containing the adverse impact of the region-wide crisis on the
banking sector.
</P>
<P>
One of these is for the incoming administration to continue the
market-oriented reform agenda of the Ramos government. Another is
the need for more effective enforcement of existing banking
regulations.

TIRANA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova said Tuesday that negotiations on Kosovo would not
start until Yugoslav authorities satisfied conditions set by the
six-nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
Rugova made the remark while meeting with U.S. special envoy
Richard Holbrooke at the U.S. Embassy in the Macedonian capital of
Skopje. Rugova is on his way to Belgium for a visit.
</P>
<P>
While discussing conditions, Rugova focussed primarily on the
withdrawal of the Yugoslav military and police forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need to negotiate a solution to the Kosovo
crisis, Rugova said the situation there was extremely severe due
to the constant attacks unleashed by the Yugoslav troops.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said the international community would continue their
efforts to create conditions suitable for settling the dispute
through peaceful negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has sunk into chaos since ethnic Albanians seeking
independence clashed with local Serb police in February. Several
hundred people have been killed since then.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Foreign Exchange Reserves Decline Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia's net international
reserves declined further, but continued to meet the International
Monetary Fund (IMF)'s performance criteria, a local newspaper
report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a statement issued by Bank Indonesia Tuesday
as saying that the country's net international reserves declined
by 65.8 million U.S. dollars to 14.601 billion dollars on June 19
from 14.667 billion dollars on June 12 due to overseas debt
payment and the depreciation of the Japanese yen against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The level of 14.601 billion dollars was still higher than the
minimum level of 13.18 billion dollars agreed at the end of March
with the IMF, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia, the central bank, also said that the subsidized
credit facility to finance the procurement of essential food
commodities rose by 313 billion rupiah (31.25 million dollars) to
19.63 trillion rupiah (about 1.96 billion dollars) on June 19
compared to 19.31 trillion rupiah (1.93 billion dollars) on June
12.
</P>
<P>
Liquidity injection for troubled banks under the Indonesian
Banks Restructuring Agency rose to 133.28 trillion rupiah (about
13.3 billion dollars) from 131.91 trillion rupiah (13.17 billion
dollars), the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also reported that money in circulation rose
by 193 billion rupiah (19.27 million dollars) to 67.37 trillion
rupiah (about 6.7 billion dollars), but was still below the
maximum level allowed by the IMF.

<HEADLINE> Fossil Animals Boost Dinosaur-Bird Connection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Two fossil animals found in
China have helped substantiate the theory that birds evolved directly
from small, carnivorous, ground-dwelling dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from China, Canada and the United States announced
their findings at a joint press conference held at the National
Geographic Association in Washington Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The feathered animals, whose bodies have many dinosaur
features, were discovered in the rich fossil beds of China's
Liaoning Province in 1996-98. More than 120 million years old,
they support the thinking of most paleontologists that birds
evolved from a dinosaur group known as theropods.
</P>
<P>
"They make the relationship between dinosaurs and birds closer
and closer, but they also make the definition and concept of birds
more and more indistinct," said Ji Qiang, director of China's
National Geological Museum.
</P>
<P>
Replicas of the animals, named Protarchaeopteryx robusta and
Caudipteryx zoui, will be on display to the public from June 24 to
July 26.
</P>
<P>
The link between dinosaurs and birds was first noted by
naturalist Thomas Henry Huxley in the mid-1800s. Most scientists
support the theory.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Makes Huge Investment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Motorola, one of the world's
leading mobile phone makers, has decided to invest an additional
1.5 billion U.S. dollars in Tianjin over the upcoming two and half
years to expand production, a company executive announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used to expand production of the most
sophisticated semiconductor integrated circuit chips used in
automotive electronic components, energy products and other
telecommunications components.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after China allowed foreign-funded
projects to be exempted from tariffs and import-related
value-added taxes on equipment imported for their own use, said
P. Y. Lai, president of Motorola China Electronics Ltd.
</P>
<P>
This government policy affects 186 project which fall in 18
categories in the fields of industry, agriculture, forestry,
animal husbandry and fishery.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Motorola will put to use in September a Motorola
Iridium mobile telecommunications global network at a cost of 270
million U.S. dollars. The system includes 66 communications
satellites, which have already been positioned.
</P>
<P>
It will also invest 50-to-100 million U.S. dollars to build a
training center for Chinese management personnel.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of these projects, the total investment of
Motorola in China is expected to reach 2.5 billion U.S. dollars by
2000.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, the largest coastal city in north China, is the
principal production base of Motorola in China and Asia. The
company invested 720 million U.S. dollars to build a semiconductor
chip factory in Tianjin in November of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The company's sales in China soared to 3.1 billion U.S. dollars
in 1996, accounting for 11 percent of its global sales. It is now
the largest U.S. investor and the second largest foreign-funded
firm in China.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Inflation May Exceed 80 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's inflation rate may
exceed 80 percent this year due to the worsening economy, local
press reports Wednesday quoted the Institute for Development of
Economics and Finance as saying.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate might even reach three digits, if the
situation did not improve, the institute's program director Nawir
Messi said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, the inflation
rate was 35.05 percent in January-May, compared to 2.71 percent in
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Nawir, one of the factors that would drive
inflation higher this year was the government's moves under
President B. J. Habibie, who replaced Soeharto last month.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Habibie's administration is facing numerous
challenges, mainly in getting the people's support, so he comes up
with populist measures to win the people's hearts."
</P>
<P>
The measures include accommodating demands to raise the
workers' minimum wages and the civil servants' salaries.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to restore ailing banks by injecting
large funds into the banks, some of which should no longer be
saved, was another populist move, he said, adding that the
government had to print more money in order to keep the banks
alive.
</P>
<P>
All these would lead to hyper-inflation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's banking sector is currently mired in its worst-ever
crisis, with confidence at its lowest ebb. This has forced the
central bank to inject more than 130 trillion rupiah (13 billion
U.S. dollars) in liquidity support into banks whose depositors
have panicked and rushed for their savings.
</P>
<P>
Nawir predicted that the number of poor people would rise to 60
million, much higher than the 50 million estimated by the World
Bank.

WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday nominated Jane Henney to become the first female chief of
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Department of
Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
A cancer specialist at the University of New Mexico, Henney,
51, will succeed former FDA Commissioner David Kessler.
</P>
<P>
A deputy to Kessler from 1992 to 1994, Henney received her
hands-on experience running the agency that regulates 25 percent
of the national economy: drugs, medical devices, foods and
cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
"There is no greater honor than to be asked to return to public
service and to lead the FDA, an agency that plays such a vital
role in protecting and promoting the health of the American
people," Henney said through a spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
The nomination must be confirmed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
A 1973 graduate of Indiana University's medical school, Henney
was a senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute by 1977
and then became its deputy director. In the late 1980s, she ran
the University of Kansas medical school.
</P>
<P>
In New Mexico, Henney supervises a medical school, a college of
pharmacy, and several teaching hospitals. She is also president
of the United States Pharmacopoeia, a nonprofit group that sets
drug purity and quality standards.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Wigs Add Color to World Cup in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Chinese wigs are
available in France to add color to football fans coming from all
over the world to watch the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The 5,000 colorful wigs, worth about 24.5 U.S. dollars each,
were transported from a township in east China's Jiangsu
Province to France just before the opening of the big football
event.
</P>
<P>
Designers at a wig factory in Huai'an city of Jiangsu
came up with the idea of providing wigs to World Cup fans who
usually seek unusual looks, and offered sample wigs to French
businessmen in March, according to a Shanghai-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Some 500,000 yuan (about 60,000 U.S. dollars) was invested by
French wholesalers in the factory soon after they decided to order
5,000 wigs, worth one million yuan (120,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A Chinese expert said wigs are considered a light-industry
product, which often appears on China's export list. But this is
the first year they are being sold at the World Cup.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Seeks Loan to Ease Financial Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government is
working with the Interamerican Development Bank in an effort to
obtain a loan of one to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars to help ease its
financial difficulty.
</P>
<P>
The expected loan, if available, will be used to help reduce
the nation's fiscal deficit to 2.5 percent of its gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Reports attributed the financial difficulty to low oil prices.
The domestic oil price per barrel is 11.2 dollars, 1.8 dollars
less than the official estimate.
</P>
<P>
Teodoro Petkoff, State Minister and head of the Coordination
and Planning Office for the Presidency, said Venezuela has lost
almost 5 billion dollars so far because of sluggish oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government hopes that a new tax law on housing
and luxury articles will be approved enabling it to receive more
revenue.

BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The State Land Administration
under the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources has discovered
more than 3.82 million cases of illegal land use across the

</P>
<P>
By the end of last October, nearly 55 percent of the cases had
been dealt with, but about 1.7 million remain unresolved.

The administration recently made public two cases which have
been handled in a move to publicize their land use campaign in a
country where arable land is in critically short supply.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1995, the Chengdu municipal government in
Sichuan province overstepped its authority in examing
and approving 244 projects. The projects took up 4,038 hectares of
land, 66 percent of which are arable land.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 244 projects, one should have been approved by the

<HEADLINE> Hingis, Novotna Sail into Second Round at Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The world's top woman player
Martina Hingis of Switzerland and Czech veteran Jana Novotna
sailed into the second round of the on-going Wimbledon Tennis
championships after beating their opponents in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Hingis, who became the youngest player to
win a Wimbledon title in 1997, started her journey to defend her
honor with a difficult spell.
</P>
<P>
American challenger Lisa Raymond, who ranked 19th in the world
and once defeated Hingis last year, put up a brillant fight
against the 17-year world number one and only marginally lost the
first set by 5-7.
</P>
<P>
After a long spell of rain delay, Hingis restored her usual
smashing style of pin point accuracy and snatched the winning set
by 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Novotna, last year's runner-up, gave her opponent no
chance of resistance by winning the two sets 6-3, 6-3. Seventh
seed American Venus Williams also followed their steps into the
next stage by beating Canada's Jana Nejedly 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Due to frequent invasion of rain spells, most of the men's
first round matches failed to take place. Australian Patrick
Rafter, who ranked 6th in this tournament, ousted Ivo Heuberger of
Switzerland 6-1, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
The 4th seed Greg Rusedski of Britain was trailing his little
known qualifier opponent by one set when the play was abandoned
due to falling rain.

<HEADLINE> Institute: World Military Spendings Drop by One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to continued disarmament, the
worldwide military expenditures have dropped by one third to about 680
billion U.S. dollars in 1996 from the high of 1,030 billion dollars in
1987, a German disarmament research institute said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest annual report issued by the Bonn-based
International Center for Conversion (BICC), the world's total military
spendings amounted to about 2.3 percent of the global gross domestic
product (GDP) in 1996, down from five percent in 1987.
</P>
<P>
While disarmament had been registered in most industrialized
countries, a number of Third World countries had increased their
military spendings, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Under the BICC estimates, the total number of soldiers in the world
sank to 22.7 million in 1996 from 23.5 million in 1995 and 28.8
million in 1987.
</P>
<P>
"Despite some setbacks, the worldwide disarmament process has
continued in the second half of the 1990s, but at a relatively slower
pace," the BICC report said.

<HEADLINE> Fiscal Evasion on Rise in Moldova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Fiscal evasion in 1997 increased
as much as twice in comparison with the precedent year in the
Republic of Moldova, totalling 515 million lei(about 110 million
U.S. dollars), 15 percent of the revenue, the Moldovan BASA-Press
news agency reported on Tuesday quoting a report of the Center for
Strategic Studies and Reforms.
</P>
<P>
The report "showed that taxation "is becoming an activity which
is not based anymore on law and includes some features as the
level of income, profit, added value. It is rather a process of
tax collection based on occasion, on personal relationships".
</P>
<P>
The same document described this "sort of taxation as widely
legalized in Moldova". "If the shadowy economy wins, as it seems
to come true in case of Moldova, it will be hard to believe that
there will be any economic development," the report concluded.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Composer Wins Grawemeyer Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese composer and conductor
Tan Dun Tuesday became the 13th winner of the 1998 Grawemeyer Award
for Music Composition, one of the most famous music award in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Tan's opera "Marco Polo" has earned him the award at the
University of Lousville. Through this opera, Tan takes his
audience along for the explorer's legendary travels from Italy to
China.
</P>
<P>
The opera was commissioned by the Edinburgh Festival and
premiered in May 1996 by the Munich Biennale. The work also has
been performed at the Holland and Hong Kong festivals.
</P>
<P>
A native of Hunan, China, the 40-year-old composer began his
musical career as a violinist in his native village. Tan is now
hailed as one of the world's stars in contemporary music, rising
quickly from rather humble musical beginnings. He currently
lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, he was one of the 30 students chosen from thousands
of applicants for the newly reopened Central Conservatory.
There, he was exposed to the works of many leading Eastern
composers.
</P>
<P>
Tan wrote his first symphony, "Li Sao," in 1980 and quickly
established his fame as an up-and-coming composer. In 1983, he
became the first Chinese composer since 1949 to win an
international prize, a Weber prize for his "String Quartet: Fen
Ya Song."
</P>
<P>
In 1992, he became the youngest composer to win the Suntory
prize commission, for which he wrote "Orchestral Theatre II."
</P>
<P>
Tan's music has been performed at prestigious venues such as
Lincoln Center in New York, Suntory Hall in Japan and Royal
Festival Hall in London. Excerpts of his "Symphony 1997" were
performed at ceremonies commemorating the historic transfer of
Hong Kong to China in July 1997.

SAINT-ETIENNE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Morocco coach Henri Michel
said he thought his team deserved to qualify.
</P>
<P>
Morocco was eliminated from the World Cup despite a 3-0 win over
Scotland on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's the worst scenario we could think of. We had a great
match, scored great goals but it's all over. I'm very sad for the
players. They would have deserved to go through." said Michel.
</P>
<P>
Scottish coach Craig Brown was also disappointed as his team
maintained their sad record of never getting past the group stage of
World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Brown said he was disappointed for the team and the travelling
fans.
</P>
<P>
"You can't give goals away at this level. We were reduced to 10
men but we were already behind at that point." Brown said.

<HEADLINE> Coach Olsen Says Victory Incredible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MARSEILLE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Norway coach Egil Olsen said on
Tuesday their 2-1 win over world champions Brazil was "incredible".
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible. I didn't believe this can happen. At least there
will one more match when I'm in charge," said Olsen.
</P>
<P>
He added, "I'm not only pleased but very, very proud. It's quite
amazing what happened. We started very low key but when we heard the
score of the other match, we had to change and take more risks. And
you saw what happened."
</P>
<P>
If Norway had drawn or lost, Morocco would have advanced with a 3-0
win over Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Olsen said, "I've already started to think about the Italy match.
We must recover fast and prepare quickly. We must not get carried away
with this win."
</P>
<P>
Norway's opponent in the second round will be former world champion
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Olsen gave much credit to Brazil, who also lost to Norway in their
last encounter in May last year.
</P>
<P>
"I was deeply impressed by Brazil. They're very, very good with the
ball and although of course the game was less important for them. I
though they were excellent and can go a very long way indeed," Olsen
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Discovery of VX Shows Importance of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Tuesday that discovery of traces of the deadly VX nerve
gas on warheads in Iraq would justify U.S. position to continue
sanctions on Iraq for the safety of America.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior U.S. official, U.N. weapons inspectors,
in a recent routine search of Iraqi missiles, discovered traces of
the deadly VX nerve gas on warheads.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the discovery during a Rose Garden bill-signing
ceremony, Clinton said: "If this report is true, it will just show
that our insistence over these last many years on the U.N.
inspection system is the right thing to do for the safety of
America and the safety of the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
"We'll stay with the position we've always had: Let the
inspections go forward and don't lift the sanctions until the
resolutions are complied with," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. senior official said the discovery, to be detailed at
the United Nations, will strengthen the hand of the United States
in maintaining tough economic sanctions on Iraq when the issue is
taken up by the Security Council on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bill Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, said in New York: "If this allegation is correct... that
will set back Iraq's efforts to try to lift sanctions. It shows
that they've been concealing, they've been lying, and it calls
into question their commitment to disarmament."
</P>
<P>
At a State Department briefing, spokesman James Rubin said: "It
appears to be another case of UNSCOM (the U.N. Special Commission)
having overcome Iraq's deceit on what it has done and it is
doing."
</P>
<P>
He said it was "another in a long series of examples of Iraq's
determined program of deceit, and it demonstrates how important it
is for sanctions to remain in place until Iraq cooperates with
UNSCOM."
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Iraqi
scientists had experimented with VX but were unable to turn it
into a weapon. He said in a letter to the Security Council that
1.7 tons of the agent had been produced but it was not of
weapons grade, according to the Iraqi News Agency.

<HEADLINE> Rekdal's Penalty Kick Sends Norway into Last 16 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MARSEILLE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Kjetil Rekdal converted a
89th-minute penalty kick to send Norway into the second round of the
soccer World Cup finals with a 2-1 win over defending champion Brazil
in group A on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rekdal, who plays for German club Hertha Berlin, shot to the
left-hand side of the goal. Brazilian keeper Tafarel dived in the
right direction but the ball just slided past his hands into the net.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time in one year that the Scandinavian squad
has beaten the world champion following their 4-2 win in Oslo last
May.
</P>
<P>
After the first half in which the Norwegians' watertight defence
successfully contained the Brazilian attacks, Bebeto finally found the
net with a diving header 33 minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Denilson dribbled through the left, was tackled down by
a Norwegian defender but struggled up to pass the ball to center for
Bebeto to head past keeper Frode Grodas.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians never appeared secure even after the goal and their
worries materialized in the 83rd minute when Chelsea striker Tore
Andre Flo equalized for Norway.
</P>
<P>
Flo, 25, slotted the ball home on a pass from Liverpool defender
Stig Bjornebye.
</P>
<P>
Lady luck shone on Norway in the 43rd minute when American referee
Esfandiar Baharmast awarded the penalty after Goncalves made a foul in
the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
A loss did not affect Brazil, who had qualified even before the
game. But Norway's victory meant that Morocco were eliminated despite
their 3-0 victory over Scotland.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Report Says Angola's UNITA Misses Deadlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Angola's faction of UNITA,
or National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, has failed
to meet agreed deadlines for normalizing state administration in
four strategic areas in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his
latest report to the Security Council which was made public on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the June 17 report, the areas that have been under
UNITA control are Andulo, Bailundo, Mungo and N'Harea. UNITA
failed twice to oblige its promise to give them to the central
government when deadlines were set for April 1 and May 31.
</P>
<P>
The report said the last two months were marked by a dangerous
deterioration of security situation in 8 of the 18 Angolan
provinces, with recent incidents resulting in the loss of many
lives and displacement of thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
Many of these anti-government attacks were conducted by armed
elements under UNITA control, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Annan reiterated his call for UNITA
demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution on June 12 to
impose sanctions on UNITA on June 25 unless UNITA has fully
complied with its obligations by June 23.

<HEADLINE> Morocco Win but Eliminated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAINT-ETIENNE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Morocco scored their first
win at the France'98 World Cup finals but still could not avoid the
fate of being eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Morocco trounced Scotland 3-0 in a Group A match but their hope
of qualifying for the second round was dashed by a late Norway
penalty shot in the other match of the group played at Marseille.
</P>
<P>
Norway came from behind to beat title-holders Brazil 2-1 to
qualify as the runners-up of Group A.
</P>
<P>
In the match both Morocco and Scotland must win to keep their
hope of qualifying alive, Morocco dominated the match with an early
goal at the 22nd minute from Abdejilil Bassir beat Scotland
goal-keeper Jim Leighton with a first-time drive.
</P>
<P>
Just one minute into the second half, Abdejilil Hadda sprinted
past Davd Weir and hit the ball into the net.
</P>
<P>
Craig Burley was shown the red card after the 53rd minute for a
clumsp challenge on Bassir.
</P>
<P>
Morocco took the numerical advantage to control the midfield. At
the 82nd minute, Bassir's shot was deflected past Leighton by Colin
Hendry and Morocco chalked away the 3-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
But the big-margin victory was not enough for the Moroccan to
gain a berth in the round of 16 as Norway surprisingly beat Brazil
2-1 thanks to a penalty shot at the 89th minute.
</P>
<P>
Norway garnered 5 points from two draws and one win. It was
their second win over Brazil in two years.
</P>
<P>
For the Scottish team, they again failed to get through to the
second round in World Cup finals. Their seven previous World Cup
trips all ended in the group stage.

<HEADLINE> House of Representatives Approves Workplace Anti-Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Small businesses in the United
State would get financial incentives and technical aid to adopt
drug-free workplace programs under legislation approved by the
House of Representatives Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The measure, approved 402-9, is part of a package of anti-drug
bills the Republican leadership has made a top priority over the
past month.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Representative Rob Portman, a Republican from
Ohio, the bill encourages states to provide financial benefits to
small businesses that meet minimum standards for drug-free
workplaces.
</P>
<P>
Portman helped develop a program in his home state that reduces
workers' compensation insurance premiums by up to 20 percent for
companies participating in drug-free programs.
</P>
<P>
The bill also provides 10 million dollars for demonstration
grants that would encourage small businesses to join
community-based anti-drug coalitions and offer technical
assistance through existing Small Business Development Centers.
</P>
<P>
Portman cited figures showing that substance abusers file five
times as many workers' compensation claims as nonabusers and have
three to four times the number of workplace accidents.
</P>
<P>
Small businesses realize the costs of drug abuse, he said, but
need help in implementing anti-drug programs.
</P>
<P>
The bill still needs Senate consideration.

JOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A new round of interest rate

as the central bank's repo rate dropped by 3.5 percent Tuesday,
South African television reported Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The repo rate, at which the Reserve Bank lends to commercial
banks, dropped to 20.5 percent as the Reserve Bank supplied more
money than the needs of commercial banks, the television said.

A new round of rate hikes was feared when the repo rate jumped

</P>

The two trains crashed at a railway crossing between Nylstroom

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Mayor of Moscow Yuri
Luzkov said here Tuesday that Russia opposed the use of force to
resolve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his talks with Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos, Luzkov said Russia was against military intervention,
use of force and unilateral actions from any military alliance,
including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that Russia was deeply concerned about the
developments in the Balkans, particularly in the Yugoslav province
of Kosovo where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of its nearly
2 million population.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the outcome of these situations were deaths
and the violation of rights, such as sovereign right.
</P>
<P>
If the international community was to be taking decisions
concerning the fate of countries, then these decisions must be
taken in conditions of peace and in a spirit of negotiations, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been running high in Kosovo since February when
Serbian police clashed with ethnic Albanians seeking independence
from Belgrade and integration into neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
Western countries have warned that they have almost run out of
options to end the crisis except military intervention.

<HEADLINE> No Obstacles in Face of Arab Summit: Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Tuesday In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia that there are no
obstacles in face of holding an Arab summit, but the success of
such a meeting requires adequate preparations.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in the Saudi capital, Moussa told reporters
that "there are calls for a well-prepared Arab summit, that does
not mean the postponing or delaying the convocation of such a
summit."
</P>
<P>
"This means that the Arab world is thinking wisely and is
serious to take a unified stand in face of the current situation
in the peace process," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz said Monday during a weekly
cabinet session that any Arab summit held without good
preparation would be fruitless.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about the Arab stand regarding the
expansion of Jerusalem, Moussa said "the decision by Israel to
expand Jerusalem is a violation to international resolutions which
forbid any geographical changes or restructuring the city legally
or administratively."
</P>
<P>
Moussa is in Saudi Arabia to chair with his Saudi counterpart
Prince Saud Al-Faisal a session of the Joint Egyptian-Saudi
Higher Committee.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian ambassador to Saudi Arabia Helmi Bdeir said the
committee is due to discuss ways of promotion of bilateral ties
and latest developments in the Arab and Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Bdeir was quoted by the Kuwaiti News Agency as saying that the
discussion will also touch issues on the stalled Middle East
peace process and current efforts to hold an Arab summit to
counter Israel's anti-peace policy.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Gulf region and the development of
relations with Iran will also be tackled by both foreign
ministers, Bdeir said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said a preparatory meeting was held to
finalize the agenda for the session of the Joint Higher
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Abu Zaid, Moussa's aid who co-chaired the two-day meeting,
said they discussed economic, trade and investment cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Parliament Criticizes Israel's Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian National Assembly
(Parliament) Tuesday accused Israel of killing the Middle East
peace process by endorsing a plan to expand the authority of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Parliament said in a statement that Israel's
decision has reflected its intentions to kill every effort exerted
by all the concerned parties to achieve a just, comprehensive and
lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Cabinet Sunday approved the plan to set up an
"umbrella authority" for Jerusalem over eight West Bank Jewish
settlements to the east, north and south of the city.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements signed between the Palestinians and
Israel, the issue of Jerusalem will be negotiated in the final
status talks for a permanent peace agreement. Neither side should
take unilateral actions to change the status of the city.
</P>
<P>
Israel's decision is an act of "open aggression" and should be
"firmly confronted," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian parliament called on all the peace-loving
countries and organizations in the world to resist Israel's plan
by all possible means.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem in the
1967 Mideast War, which the Palestinians want as the capital of
their future independent state.

<TEXT>

WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
promised visiting Irish President Mary McAleese on Tuesday that
the U.S. would remain engaged in the Northern Ireland peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which took place at the White House, was "very
warm, successful and productive meeting," said White House
spokesman Michael McCurry at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
"President McAleese expressed a great deal of confidence in the
Northern Ireland peace process, the implementation of the Good
Friday accords, the process that you see underway now daily in the
campaign period," McCurry said.

The Good Friday peace agreement, which ended 30 years conflict
in the British province, was signed in April under the auspices of
Clinton's special envoy , former Senator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
McCurry added that McAleese also "stressed the importance for
Ireland of the United States staying involved in the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he will continue to be helpful in any way he
can and the U.S. government would remain committed to
this peace process, McCurry said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Veto Iran Sanctions Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has decided to veto legislation on Iranian sanctions as its
regimes "produce hopeless shackles on the presidency to handle
U.S. foreign policy, the White House said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President's Press Secretary Mike McCurry told reporters he
expected the president would return the Iran Missile
Proliferation Act to Congress later on Tuesday, and the White
House would then issue a veto statement on that.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, passed by Congress, would automatically
impose sanctions on any foreign government or business that
supplies ballistic missile technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Congress gave little flexibility in the act to
the president when he is pursuing a new relationship with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, there is no flexibility in the act passed by
Congress that allows the president to work through problems," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's decision to veto the legislation came less than a
week after he expressed hope for "a genuine reconciliation with
Iran" if it complies with so-called standards the United States
has set as conditions for normalization of their relations,
which include suspension of support of terrorism, of
distribution of weapons of mass destruction and of opposition of
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has already eased travel to the
United States for Iranians and is supporting cultural and
academic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton believed Congress is trying to put
"hopeless shackles on the presidency with the legislation and to
"micromanage" U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton also considered the threshold for issuing
sanctions too low.
</P>
<P>
"The threshold set for imposition of sanctions is so low that
you could conceivably have situations in the future in which the
United States government might improperly or incorrectly impose
sanctions, which would cast out on the credibility of all the
sanctions regimes that we maintain," he said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton would continue to work with Russia on
U.S. concern about the proliferation of missile technology.

<HEADLINE> Nominee Calls for Reducing Political Battling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The nominee to be director of
the Census Bureau of the United States said he wants the political
battling reduced over the national head count in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Given the high stakes, it is unfortunate that Census 2000 has
become prey to partisan disagreements. These differences place
Census 2000 at risk by delaying the bureau's preparation in the
enormously complex task of accurately counting the American
people," Kenneth Prewitt said at a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary William M. Daley made the nomination at the
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Prewitt, head of the Social Science Research Council in New
York, would succeed Martha Farnsworth Riche, who left the Census
post in January.
</P>
<P>
The nomination needs to be confirmed by the Senate and could
become controversial because of the dispute over whether the
Census, scheduled for April 1, 2000, should include a statistical
method known as sampling, which is strongly opposed by Republicans
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
The use of statistical sampling in census has become a highly
controversial issue in the planning for the 2000 count with the
sides divided largely along party lines.
</P>
<P>
Democrats favor the plan, contending that it will reduce the
undercount that missed some four million people in 1990.
</P>
<P>
But Republicans counter that it opens the way for increasing
the count of minorities, who generally vote for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Prewitt said his job will be to ensure the Census is as
accurate as possible within any limits set by Congress, the courts
or the administration.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that sampling, properly used and employed,
can improve the accuracy of the count," he said. But "there are
very complicated issues about the sampling designs and uncertainty
about whether it will be allowed."
</P>
<P>
Confirmation will be done by the Senate, but it generally
listens closely to the opinions of House members, who are most
directly affected by the national head count. Census results are
used to reapportion seats in the House as well as in the
distribution of federal funds.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Relations with Colombia Open New Page </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that it is ready to assist the Colombian government in its
efforts to search for peace and the relations between the two
nations can open a new page.
</P>
<P>
Andres Pastrana, Colombia's president-elect, said that he would
like to see the United States playing a major role in fight
against drug trafficking and the negotiations with the left-wing
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that President-elect Pastrana expressed interest
in U.S. involvement in the Colombian peace process during a press
conference yesterday," said State Department spokesman James
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to assist the government of Colombia in its
efforts to search for peace. We are prepared to discuss this and
other issues with President-elect Pastrana in the coming days,"
Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration "stand ready to assist in encouraging
and supporting a peace process in Colombia," noted the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "Obviously, it is up to the government of
Colombia to determine what role it foresees for other countries in
these negotiations."
</P>
<P>
On the fight against drugs, Rubin said the U.S. does want to
cooperate more closely with the government of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
"When we get to a point where we have greater contact with the
new leadership, then we will be in a position to discuss details,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we are hopeful that we can turn over a new page in
U.S.-Colombian relations and vastly improve, not only the fight
against narcotics traffickers but also the whole array of
U.S.-Colombian bilateral issues," said Rubin.
