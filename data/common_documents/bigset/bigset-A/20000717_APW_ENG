Alliance Airways Flight Crashes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PATNA, India (AP) -- An Alliance Airlines plane carrying 58 people crashed
just before a scheduled landing Monday in eastern India, an airport manager
said. Relatives, police and airport workers mobbed the smoldering pile of metal
wreckage, screaming and crying as they tried to find survivors on the tarmac at
the airport in the capital of India's poorest state, Bihar. Witnesses said a
family of five died when the plane landed on their house a third of a mile
southwest of Patna airport. Airport station manager H.H. Khan said the plane was
carrying 58 people.

Clinton: Peace Talks Challenging
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton said Sunday that the Mideast Peace
negotiations are more difficult than any he's dealt with in his presidency but
he is more optimistic now about the talks than when they began six days ago.
''God, it's hard,'' Clinton said in the first official assessment of the talks'
progress. ''It's like nothing I've ever dealt with. All the negotiations with
the Irish, all the stuff I've done with the Palestinians before this and with
the Israelis, the Balkans at Dayton.'' But he said he was hopeful that Israelis
and Palestinians could reach agreement on the contentious issues that still

   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Right-wing protesters massed in Tel Aviv on Sunday
chanting ''The country must not be lost,'' to send a strong and personal message
to Prime Minister Ehud Barak that his people won't accept broad concessions to
the Palestinians. ''We are the majority, and the majority will win!'' shouted
many of those crowded into Rabin square, the site where the late prime minister
was assassinated in 1995 and where large protests are often held. Much of the
crowd, estimated at 150,000, had come by bus from settlements in the West Bank,
from homes they fear they might lose in a final peace agreement with the
Palestinians.

800 explosion broke ground for a new memorial Sunday on the Long Island shore
not far from where the plane went down four years ago killing all 230 people on
board. About 50 families, from as far away as Australia, were joined by New York

Confederate Air Force To Vote Name
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIDLAND, Texas (AP) -- Leaders of a vintage airplane collectors group known
as the Confederate Air Force say they'll call a vote to decide whether to change
the group's name because of concerns it may be costing them business at
airshows. Since the uproar began over the Confederate battle flag recently
removed from the South Carolina Statehouse dome, attention has been drawn to the
use of symbols linked to the Confederate era and slavery. The organization's
name has nothing to do with the Civil War -- the name stuck after somebody
painted it on the tail of a fighter plane in the 1950s.

<HEADLINE> Four Feared Dead in Texas Lake  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A father and three children were
believed to have drowned during a family swimming trip that ended
in a failed rescue Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The man's 8-year-old son, 11-year-old daughter and 9-year-old
nephew had been wading in Lake Somerville, about 40 miles east of
Austin, when they disappeared in 8-feet-deep water less than 100
yards from shore.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old father and a 21-year-old relative went into the
water to rescue them, but also went under, said Burleson County
Sheriff Gene Barber.
</P>
<P>
   Another man attempted to help, but was having trouble swimming
and returned to shore, the sheriff said. When the man turned back,
there was no sign of the children's father, he said. The
21-year-old man was rescued and was in critical condition Sunday
night at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the father and his daughter were recovered Sunday
night, and dive teams planned to continue searching the lake Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   None of the identities were immediately released, pending
notification of family members.
</P>
<P>
   The lake at Welch Park, a popular recreation site not far from
Texas A&AMP;M University, is relatively shallow but drops off
unexpectedly into deeper water, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Barber told the Bryan-College Station Eagle that there have been
numerous drownings in that part of the lake in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's somewhat of a drop-off,'' Barber said, ''and it
startles people when they step off and can't feel the bottom. This
is the place people love to come to wade, but it's dangerous when
they get out too far.''

<HEADLINE> Athletics and Rockies Rained Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Rockies were forced to wait another
day before trying to end their 10-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   A slow-moving storm that brought several inches of rain to the
metro area forced the Rockies and Oakland Athletics to postpone
their game Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The A's, who had lost 10 of 14 on the road, led 4-3 before rain
started falling as the Rockies prepared to bat in the fourth. The
game was rescheduled as part of a day-night doubleheader Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The game's seven runs came on homers that will be washed out.
Jason Giambi and Ramon Hernandez each had two-run shots for
Oakland, and Larry Walker and Jeff Cirillo homered for Colorado.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A streaker jumped onto the field at

right-field fence.

   The nude man appeared to come out from near the dugout seats on

second base, then was cornered by three security guards at the
right-field wall as play was held up in the top of the seventh

<HEADLINE> Cohen: U.S. Needs Missile Defense  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Iran's weekend test of a long-range
missile underscored the need for a U.S. national missile defense
system, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Iran tested its Shahab-3 ballistic missile, with a range of 800
miles, on Saturday. Tehran is developing a longer-range Shahab-4,
which it claims will be used to carry satellites into space and not
for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The test ''is one of the reasons why it is important for the
United States to undertake to research, develop and potentially
deploy a national missile defense system that would provide
protection against countries such as Iran posing a threat to the
United States,'' Cohen said on the last day of a three-day visit to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. defense authorities are developing a multibillion dollar
national missile defense system, but Washington has not yet
approved its deployment.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also would look to Australia to play a role in
the missile defense system if and when it is approved, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Defense Minister John Moore said Australia would
consider a request for participation if the system gets the
go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But that expectation could prove unfounded if the opposition
Labor Party wins federal elections expected by late next year.
Labor is opposed to Australian participation in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries jointly run the Pine Gap satellite tracking
center in central Australia and that secretive facility would
likely be used to track missiles as part of the U.S. missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers were speaking after the two countries agreed to
share new defense technology and cooperate on its development -- an
agreement that gives Australia enhanced access to U.S. military
research.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the agreement would be of particular benefit to
Australia's troubled fleet of six Collins Class submarines, which
have been plagued by technical problems ranging from periscope
malfunctions to excessive noise and vibration, as well as problems
in computer defense systems.

<HEADLINE> Landslide in China Kills 119  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- A mudslide set off by heavy rains buried
scores of houses in central China, killing at least 119 villagers,
an official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster struck rural Ziyang county in Shaanxi province late
Thursday night, said the region's Anti-Flood Office. Torrential
rains fell in the area from Tuesday to Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Another 29 people were missing and all the dead were buried in
collapsed houses, the office said.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster brings to at least 564 the number of people killed
in summer flooding throughout China this year. The rainy season
usually reaches a peak in late July. Damage often is worsened by
excessive farming and tree-cutting that leave stripped hillsides
unable to trap rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   In another part of Shaanxi, at least eight people were killed
Friday by a rain-triggered landslide in Huxian county, according to
the official Xinhua News Agency.

<HEADLINE> Bristol native returns to make first movie  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) - Gwen O'Donnell went to Hollywood to be a
movie star, but now hopes to find what she was looking for in her
own back yard.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, born and raised in Bristol, has returned to make her
first feature film. Struggling to land a breakout role, she wrote
her own - and came home for financial and moral support.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to be around my own people,'' she said last week on
the set of ''The Funk Parlor,'' a dark comedy in which she is the
writer, director and star.
</P>
<P>
   She also wanted to do local casting for the inhabitants of the
fictional New England town where the film is set.
</P>
<P>
   ''You couldn't really recreate the sense of a small New England
town in L.A.,'' O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   The story centers around John Funk, a Los Angeles club promoter
who returns home after a decade to bury his father, and ends up
staying to breathe life into the ailing family funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   John Funk is played by James Wilder, best-known for a recurring
role on television's ''Melrose Place.'' O'Donnell plays his love
interest, Sophie.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Clapp -Sgt. Greg Medavoy of ''NYPD Blue'' - is the local
police chief who blames Funk for the death of his daughter in a
hearse accident.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol offered the necessary architecture, landscape and
cross-section of people. The town of 59,000, a struggling
manufacturing center, has large Polish and Italian communities.
</P>
<P>
   Coming home had other benefits for O'Donnell - a reduced price
tag and residents not immune to the mystique of moviemaking. Many
people donated time, money and materials partly to help the
hometown girl and partly to have a role in a spotlight rarely
focused on the area, O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There aren't a lot of films shot in Connecticut, so it still
seems exciting to people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Paying for permission to use locations alone in Los Angeles
would have busted the $1 million budget, said executive producer
Chuck Lambeth, an acting classmate of O'Donnell's who plays Funk's
brother in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have cost twice as much in L.A.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in Bristol, filmmakers were allowed to shoot scenes at the
hospital, a diner and a biker bar in exchange for a mention in the
movie's credits. Last week, the crew was filming inside the DuPont
Funeral Home with just one stipulation: if a real person died, they
would have to clear out.
</P>
<P>
   Many locals served as extras, including O'Donnell's in-laws. Her
husband, Bob Kaczowka, is from New Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Sandino, 41, a switchboard operator at Bristol Hospital,
played a mourner at the funeral of Funk's father a day after she
watched filming in the hospital's emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   ''This doesn't happen in Bristol,'' Sandino said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ever,'' added Stephanie Smith, 29, an emissions tester for the
Department of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Being on the set didn't infect them with the acting bug however.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always wanted to do this and now I have no desire to,'' said
Smith, after watching lengthy setup and repeated rehearsals for
every scene. Still, ''It'll be nice to go to the movie and see the
places I know.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, who left Bristol after high school to study film at
the University of Southern California, began work on the movie
about four years ago when she became frustrated with winning only
small parts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hadn't happened for us, so we came to the conclusion ... we
had to do it ourselves,'' Lambeth said.
</P>
<P>
   The crew did ''everything but steal'' to raise funds from
friends and relatives, Lambeth said. Working 18-hour days, they
hope to finish the three-week shoot by the end of July and compete
in the Sundance film festival in October.
</P>
<P>
   But only about 10 percent of the hundreds of movies offered for
competition are accepted at the festival, the road many
independents take to mainstream success.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of filming, however, O'Donnell doesn't have the
time to entertain thoughts of failure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're shooting a big Hollywood movie with the resources of an
independent,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Fox Promotes Opening U.S. Border  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- For Fernando Salguero, crossing illegally
into the United States was a way of life. During the winter, he
harvested fruit in California, making enough money to buy seeds and
supplies to plant corn during the summer in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   As sneaking into the United States became harder, he hired a
smuggler to take him across. Eventually, he paid with his life,
dying along with other illegal immigrants hiding in the hot, stuffy
container of a water truck traveling through the desert to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   With Mexico struggling to employ the country's labor surplus and
those who can't find jobs taking desperate measures to travel to
the United States, Mexico's new president-elect, Vicente Fox, has
proposed opening the border between the two countries in an effort
to make cross-border movement of workers safe and legal.
</P>
<P>
   While some argue the measure is long overdue, it still faces
possibly insurmountable hurdles with workers and businesses in both
countries -- and the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mexico needs to have industries for the people who migrate,''
said Abel Perez, who has seen most of his family move to the United
States while he has tried to make a living in Mexico City.
''Mexican people are really exploited in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Salguero's sister, Maria Luisa, agrees, saying she prefers to
stay in Mexico with her three children. But she also believes her
brother -- who died at the age of 40, leaving his wife and six young
children -- should have had the right to travel to the United States
safely.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't know they were going to suffer,'' she said of the
11 people who died with her brother in July 1998. ''It looks like
the smuggler put them in a truck, and locked them in. By the time
he realized what had happened, they were already dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of immigrants die crossing the border each year,
especially in the summer heat. Fox -- the former governor of
Guanajuato state, which has one of the highest rates of migration
north -- argues that his plan will eliminate migration as well as
the gap between Mexican and U.S. salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenge for the United States and Mexico is to close
that brutal difference between the income of a worker on the
Mexican side who makes $5 a day and the $60 that he makes on the
American side doing the same job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also argue that Mexico's economy will have to grow
considerably before it could compete with U.S. wages. If the border
was opened now, ''we'd get three-quarters of Mexico moving up
here,'' said Sidney Weintraub of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has tried to increase investment and job opportunities
within the country, signing free trade pacts recently with the
European Union, Israel and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also envisions expanding the North American Free Trade
Agreement -- which triggered a boom in U.S.-Mexico trade and created
thousands of jobs for Mexicans -- into a common market that would be
North America's version of the European Union. The United States is
seen as unlikely to take him up on that.
</P>
<P>
   While the European Union has free movement of workers within its
borders, analysts argue that it began with fewer inequalities among
member countries -- and that the trade bloc invested money in poorer
countries so that they could compete, preventing mass migrations.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been greater opportunities in countries such as
Portugal and Ireland, which previously had struggled economically.
</P>
<P>
   ''Europe chose to develop on a high road,'' said Robert E.
Scott, an international economist at the Economic Policy Institute
in Washington. ''It made the necessary investment in poor countries
before becoming fully integrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox admits it would take decades before the United States,
Canada and Mexico could join a common market, and his proposal is
likely to meet strong opposition in the United States -- especially
with labor and other groups that fought NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also signs of support among American businesses
desperate for workers during the U.S. economic boom and unions
looking to boost membership. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the
AFL-CIO, the nation's largest labor organization, have supported
relaxing laws to make it easier for immigrants to work in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fox's proposal also could face opposition in Mexico,
especially from businesses that rely on the country's cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Assuming you do have a border that's virtually open, I think
the result could be a net loss for workers in the maquiladora
industry,'' said John Christman, director of a Mexico City
consulting group for the assembly-for-export industry that has
flourished under NAFTA. ''At least the maquiladora industry would
have to work a lot harder than it already does to keep its
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ramon Urquidez, 21, Fox's plan probably won't come soon
enough. He is looking for a way to cross illegally into the United
States, but he still hopes the two countries find a way for workers
to cross legally.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will give us permission to return and leave our country
without problems,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 'Perfect Storm' May Help Swordfish  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The hit movie ''The Perfect Storm'' recounts
the final voyage of the fishing boat Andrea Gail, sunk in a
ferocious storm after venturing far from shore.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists hope the film also focuses attention on what
sent the vessel 1,500 miles off the New England coast: the depleted
swordfish population.
</P>
<P>
   ''The timing of the film was fortuitous,'' said Vikki Spruill,
executive director of SeaWeb, a conservation group running a public
education campaign around the movie. ''We're trying to use the film
to draw attention to this larger problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., chairman of the House Resources
subcommittee on fisheries conservation, wildlife and oceans, said
swordfishing is a victim of its own popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the one hand we have this tremendous appetite for seafood,
which creates a high price,'' Saxton said. ''At the same time,
we've developed technologies that allow us to find the fish in a
scientific way.''
</P>
<P>
   Worry over swordfish depletion is being addressed on several
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists eagerly anticipate an Aug. 1 ruling by the
National Marine Fisheries Service that may close nearly 200,000
square miles in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico to ''pelagic
longline'' fishing, a highly successful but indiscriminate
technique by which miles of hooked and baited fishing lines are
suspended at a predetermined depth.
</P>
<P>
   SeaWeb, through its ''Perfect Storm'' education campaign,
supports the proposal because it would protect swordfish nursery
areas. ''The overarching problem is we're catching swordfish before
they've had a chance to reproduce,'' Spruill said.
</P>
<P>
   The fisheries service also plans to implement reduced quotas
recommended late last year by the International Commission for the
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. The lower quotas will be enforced
over the next three fishing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Charitable Trusts, which created SeaWeb, recently formed
the Pew Oceans Commission, which will spend 18 months studying
issues including overfishing.
</P>
<P>
   And in Congress, competing bills by Saxton and Sen. John Breaux,
D-La., would create a voluntary buyback program to encourage
swordfish and tuna longliners to give up their permits in exchange
for up to $450,000 in compensation from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Water Fishermen's Association, which represents
commercial fishermen, favors Breaux's bill because it would focus
specifically on the several dozen vessels that will be directly
affected by the closure of swordfish nursery areas. Some major
environmental groups prefer Saxton's broader approach.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial fishing advocates say they support most efforts to
boost the swordfish population through quotas and other
regulations, as long as they are applied fairly to all countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Common sense says nobody wants to fish themselves out of
business,'' said Linda Candler, vice president of communications
for the National Fisheries Institute, which represents commercial
fishermen and others in the seafood industry.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ''The Perfect Storm,'' Sebastian Junger detailed the
pressures and challenges facing commercial fishermen since the
introduction of longlining in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, Junger wrote, ''the gold rush was on'' as
fisherman used satellite navigation and electronic fish finders, as
well as new monofilament that made it possible to set lines 30 to
40 miles at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government took a series of steps, first requiring
longliners to acquire permits, then implementing a quota in 1991
for U.S.-licensed sword boats that closed swordfishing season as
soon as the target was reached.
</P>
<P>
   But the Natural Resources Defense Council still considers
swordfish ''severely depleted.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal has been to help rebuild this fishery and restore it
to health,'' said Sarah Chasis, a senior attorney with the
environmental group. ''That way everyone can benefit, (including)
consumers, commercial fishermen and recreational fishermen.''

<HEADLINE> Lessons of German Reunification  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN BARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The changes were so monumental, the many details
so all-engrossing, that when communist East Germany merged with
West Germany in 1990, few Germans noticed the visitors with
ringside seats.
</P>
<P>
   A cadre of South Korean experts had fanned out among federal
ministries to take notes on the historic union.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 years later, in the afterglow of the historic and
surprisingly genial first meeting of the North and South Korean
leaders, do these overlooked footnotes snap clearly into place.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that South Korean and German experts have conferred
about reunification scores of times since the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   For Korea, what better laboratory to research the mechanics of
reuniting one people from two countries than the new Germany?
</P>
<P>
   ''You are our role model,'' South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
told Germans on a visit to Berlin in March.
</P>
<P>
   He also conceded that South Koreans' initial elation a decade
ago at the fall of the Berlin Wall and the start of reunification
was deflated by shock over the costs. Koreans also noted the
difficulties East and West Germany had overcoming lingering
psychological differences between populations raised under two such
different systems.
</P>
<P>
   Kim also noted three important distinctions between the German
and Korean situations that would make a Korean reunification even
more challenging:
</P>
<P>
   --South Korea's economy is not nearly as large as West Germany's
was at the time of reunification.
</P>
<P>
   --East Germany and West Germany never fought a war against each
other or viewed each other as enemies.
</P>
<P>
   --The many cooperative exchanges that preceded German
reunification have so far been impossible between the democratic
South Korea and the totalitarian, reclusive North.
</P>
<P>
   If Germany has just one lesson to pass along to Korea, it would
be to move gradually, say experts in Germany familiar with both
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two Germanys both envisioned a slow process -- 10 to 15
years of growing together,'' said Gottfried-Karl Kindermann,
co-chairman of the Foreign Affairs Association at the University of
Munich. ''That changed with the East German revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The revolution was peaceful, but it accelerated reunification as
millions of East Germans turned out for huge demonstrations pushing
for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The popular pressure resulted in a still-controversial political
decision to convert the East German currency to the mighty West
German mark at a one-to-one ratio. The devastating economic impact
is still felt today.
</P>
<P>
   First it inflated corporate debt in eastern Germany by up to 400
percent, burying some companies so deeply they never dug out.
Galloping labor costs forced companies to lay off thousands of
workers.
</P>
<P>
   East German companies that might normally have been scooped up
by eager Western investors were instead regarded as poor bargains --
inefficient after years of communist mismanagement and too
expensive at prices boosted to Western levels.
</P>
<P>
   The scars remain. Joblessness in eastern Germany stands at 18
percent, compared with 8 percent in the west. The average eastern
worker earns 86 percent of the wage paid to his western
counterpart. Economic productivity in the east is about 70 percent
of the west's, and the region with 20 percent of the nation's
population contributes only 10 percent of its economic output.
</P>
<P>
   The German government has spent hundreds of billions of marks to
boost the eastern economy and to improve neglected infrastructure --
including the equivalent of more than $12 billion on new highways
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say reunification costs on the Korean peninsula would
be much higher because the economic gap between the impoverished
North and the richer South is so much greater than that between the
two Germanys at the time of unification.
</P>
<P>
   The North's 1999 gross national product was less than 4 percent
of the South's, and its per capita income of $714 was just 8
percent of South Korea's, according to a report last month by the
Bank of Korea in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would be prepared to say in the Korean case, North Korea
needs more resources transferred for a longer period,'' said
Sung-yo Park, a South Korean who has taught economics at Berlin's
Free University for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kindermann, who since 1975 has organized more than a dozen
meetings of Korean and German experts to discuss reunification,
said the costs of German reunification inserted a heavy dose of
reality into South Korea's dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Its idealized concept of reuniting a people split for 55 years
was replaced with images of disadvantaged North Koreans flooding
across the border. That, Kindermann said, prompted some grim
political and economic considerations.
</P>
<P>
   However it might come, experts believe Korean unity will not
have the popular impetus that distinguished -- and accelerated -- the
German experience, largely because of North Korea's reclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   German reunification was propelled by cries of ''We are one
people!'' Even 41 years of division had not destroyed this notion.
</P>
<P>
   Although the border was heavily fortified, East Germans watched
and were influenced by West German television. After a 1972
agreement, East and West Germans were permitted to visit family
members. They had regular cultural, academic and sports exchanges.
And the two Germanys engaged in lively trade, even during the Cold
War, not least because East German goods were considered good by
Soviet bloc standards.
</P>
<P>
   Park, the economics professor, says the psychological factor of
''one people'' is absent on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one thing that is very weak in Korea, the Korean
perception of one nation,'' he said. ''People wanted a united
Germany. But we still have time in Korea. We don't talk about the
imitation of German unification.''
</P>
<P>
   After last month's summit, Kim Dae-jung said he and Kim Jong Il
of North Korea shared similar ideas on reunification and had agreed
on a transitional stage involving two separate governments linked
by inter-Korean councils.
</P>
<P>
   ''So far, Kim Jong Il and Kim Dae-jung have talked about
existing side by side for a certain time,'' Park said. ''If we
stick to a two-state reality, side by side, there will be no
problem.''

<HEADLINE> Nazi Labor Documents To Be Signed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- More than 50 years after World War II, eastern
Europeans, Jews and others forced to work for the Nazi war machine
move closer to finally receiving compensation with the creation
Monday of a foundation funded by the German government and
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Stuart Eizenstat, representatives of eastern European nations and
other survivor groups were in Berlin for the ceremonial signing of
documents establishing the $5 billion compensation fund.
</P>
<P>
   More than one million former laborers are expected to be
eligible for payments from the fund, mostly central and eastern
Europeans. The fund also will compensate people subjected to
medical experiments by the Nazis and some with other
Holocaust-related claims.
</P>
<P>
   German officials say application procedures soon will be
publicized and have expressed confidence that payments could begin
this year. But German businesses have yet to raise their half of
the fund, which is being split 50-50 with the government.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 German businesses have pledged $1.5 billion as of
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Chief German negotiator Otto Lambsdorff repeated an appeal
Friday for more companies to join, even if they didn't exist during
the war. During a debate in Parliament, which approved the fund
July 6, Lambsdorff spoke about ''collective responsibility'' and
noted the foundation also would fund education and research on the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Among the latest institutions to pledge support was Germany's
Evangelical Church, which promised $5 million on Wednesday as it
acknowledged that Protestant churches used forced laborers during
the Nazi-era too, for such jobs as grave-digging.
</P>
<P>
   Lambsdorff told the station he would ''be happy'' if Germany's
Roman Catholic church would do the same.
</P>
<P>
   But the Catholics said they had no immediate plans for a general
contribution to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf Hammberschmidt, spokesman for the German Bishops
Conference, said they were aware of only two Catholic church
communities in Berlin who employed forced laborers in cemeteries,
and appropriate action would be taken at that level.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents to be signed Monday are guarantees from
Washington intended to protect German companies from class-action
lawsuits in the United States. Such legal actions catapulted the
slave labor issue to the forefront and induced Schroeder and
leading industrialists to begin talks on a comprehensive fund more
than a year ago.

<HEADLINE> The Federal Government Finds a Home  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two hundred ten years ago this month Congress,
while searching for a home, succumbed to Potomac Fever.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Advertiser summed up the predicament in a few
lines:
</P>
<P>
   ''Where will Congress find a resting place? They have led a kind
of vagrant life ever since 1774 when they first met to oppose Great
Britain. Every place they have taken to reside in has been made too
hot to hold them. Either the enemy would not let them stay, or
people made a clamor because they were too far north or too far
south. ... We pity poor congressmen, thus kicked and cuffed about
from post to pillar -- where can they find a home?''
</P>
<P>
   After those years of wandering, the First Federal Congress on
July 16, 1790 cut through a tangle of arguments and diversions and
set its sights on a permanent home for the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   The game plan set down by the Residence Act of 1790 went like
this:
</P>
<P>
   Congress would move from New York to Philadelphia and stay there
for a decade while a new capital was built from the ground up. Then
it would pack its bags -- hopefully for the last time -- and move to
''a district ... on the River Potomac.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of an exact location for a federal district carved
from Maryland and Virginia was left to President Washington, who
happened to be the chief promoter of a Potomac capital. His Mount
Vernon plantation was just down the river from the site he
eventually chose.
</P>
<P>
   The events leading Congress to the Potomac were cloaked in
uncertainty. Even after the 1790 vote, many Americans had a hard
time believing Congress would abandon a comfortable city like
Philadelphia for a construction site in the wilderness. Many
members of Congress agreed with them.
</P>
<P>
   The city-to-city wandering had begun early in the Revolution,
when Congress managed to stay barely a step ahead of pursuing
British armies.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Constitution was adopted in 1787, the seat of
government had shifted with Congress to Philadelphia, Lancaster and
York in Pennsylvania; Trenton and Princeton in New Jersey;
Baltimore and Annapolis in Maryland; and New York City.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most unsettling moves came in 1783, when Congress
felt threatened not by British bayonets but by rioting Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania soldiers, trying to win concessions from the state
government, marched on the Philadelphia statehouse and threw a
fright into Congress, then meeting in the same building.
</P>
<P>
   When an appeal to the state for military protection went
unanswered, Congress -- with much unhappy muttering about the
inability of local authorities to control mobs -- rode out of
Philadelphia and reconvened in Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   The memory remained fresh when the Constitution was drafted in
1787. It gave Congress the authority to establish a separate
federal district completely free of state control.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing on the exact location for such a district proved
difficult as cities along the East Coast offered themselves as
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Congress got around to considering a permanent home
for the government in 1790, the issue had been eclipsed by a
dispute over money.
</P>
<P>
   Northerners, led by Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton,
advanced the idea that the federal government should assume the
debt accumulated by individual states to fight the Revolutionary
War.
</P>
<P>
   Southern states generally opposed the plan until Virginian
Thomas Jefferson began to sense the intriguing outlines of a
mutually beneficial compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson invited Hamilton to discuss his proposal with members
of Congress from Virginia, and a dinner-table bargain was struck:
In exchange for a permanent federal capital on the Potomac in the
upper South, Southern states would no longer block the federal
government from assuming state debt.
</P>
<P>
   Congress approved the legislation to make the bargain legal,
even though at least one House member from Virginia confessed to
Jefferson that the deal caused him ''considerable revolutions of
stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   The exact location of the new capital was kept deliberately
vague.
</P>
<P>
   Congress authorized President Washington to place it anywhere on
a 100-mile length of the Potomac between Virginia and Maryland,
about the midpoint of the 13 original states. Washington soon
narrowed the choice to a tract anchored by Alexandria, Va., on the
south and Georgetown in Maryland on the north.
</P>
<P>
   French military engineer Pierre L'Enfant sensed the
possibilities when he wrote to offer Washington his services as a
city planner.
</P>
<P>
   ''No nation, perhaps, had ever before the opportunity offered
them of deliberately deciding on the spot where their Capital City
should be fixed,'' said L'Enfant, who went on to design it.

<HEADLINE> Fans Gather for Cher Convention  </HEADLINE>
By BENNIE M. CURRIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Move over Trekkies, a new fan-fest has landed.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 diva-worshippers came to Chicago for a two-day
weekend convention in honor of Cher. Cher Convention 2000 drew Cher
impersonators, wannabes and outright look-alikes from across the
country to a downtown hotel Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering at Chicago's Congress Plaza Hotel, which resembled
conventions for fans of Star Trek, comic books and sports teams,
was organized by three fans who found each other through Cher's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been a fan for years and we all thought it would be good
to get together with other fans,'' said Kim Werdman a real estate
manager from Arlington, Texas, who served as convention president.
</P>
<P>
   Cher wasn't present although organizers had expected her to
attend. While the event featured kitschy karaoke performances,
Sonny and Cher album covers and other memorabilia, it also had a
serious side.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the sale of T-shirts, photographs and other
keepsakes will be donated to the Children's Craniofacial
Association, a Dallas-based support group, Werdman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cher is the organization's honorary chairwoman. In the 1985 film
''Mask,'' she played the mother of a boy who was born with
craniofacial deformities, and the singer has since been a
benefactor for people who suffer from the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Since Cher was a no-show, her fans had to settle for the next
best thing -- impersonator Wayne Smith. Sporting a beaded pink
gabardine pants suit, Smith belted out a rendition of ''I Got You
Babe,'' the 60s hit duet by Cher and then-husband Sonny Bono.
</P>
<P>
   Smith handled both ends of the duet, mimicking Sonny's whiny
tone and Cher's husky vibrato by himself. ''I'm schizophrenic,''
Smith joked.
</P>
<P>
   His audience included male and female fans who sported Cher-like
hairdos in black, red and purple hues.
</P>
<P>
   Cher fan Troy Lynn Hershman was dressed more conservatively, but
said she's every bit as devoted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been a fan since I was four or five,'' said Hershman, 33,
of Houston. ''But I've never been to any of her concerts. I just
watch her on cable.''

<HEADLINE> Fire at Quebec Chemical Plant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   Residents Evacuated After Chemical Fire edits. No pickup.
</P>
<P>
   VAUDREUIL-DORION, Quebec (AP) -- An explosion and fire at a
chemical plant sent up a cloud of toxic smoke outside Montreal on
Sunday, prompting authorities to urge thousands of nearby residents
to leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze erupted in a building believed to contain up to 6,500
gallons of toxic chemicals, including sulfuric and nitric acid,
about 16 miles west of Montreal. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The thick cloud of smoke floated westward, visible for miles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're encouraging people to leave our municipality,'' said
Bertrand Myre, mayor of nearby St-Lazare. ''There's a strong odor
emanating from the cloud and it's not easy to breathe right now.
</P>
<P>
   ''I passed through the smoke and it just attacks your eyes and
throat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two French-language TV news channels estimated that around 8,000
people left their homes.
</P>
<P>
   A hockey arena was opened in nearby Vaudreuil-Dorion to
accommodate those forced to leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 firefighters from four neighboring municipalities
battled the blaze, the cause of which was not yet known. The plant
was closed when the fire began.

   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Two gunmen shot to death a journalist
at his newspaper office in western Bangladesh, authorities said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Shamsur Rahman, 43, head of the Jessore bureau for Janakantha, a
Dhaka-based Bangali language daily newspaper, was shot to death
Sunday night.
</P>

fleeing in a car parked outside, said Aminur Rasul, the chief
government administrator at Jessore.
</P>
<P>
   Rahman was taken to a hospital where doctors declared him dead.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Jessore, 85 miles west of Dhaka, the Bangladesh
capital, were investigating, Rasul said in a telephone interview.

Cohen: U.S. Needs Missile Defense System
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Iran's weekend test of a long-range missile
underscored the need for a U.S. national missile defense system, Secretary of
Defense William Cohen said Monday. Iran tested its Shahab-3 ballistic missile,
with a range of 800 miles, on Saturday. The test ''is one of the reasons why it
is important for the United States to undertake to research, develop and
potentially deploy a national missile defense system that would provide
protection against countries such as Iran posing a threat to the United
States,'' Cohen said.

   PATNA, India (AP) -- An Alliance Airlines plane carrying 58 people crashed
just before a scheduled landing Monday in eastern India, an airport manager
said. Relatives, police and airport workers mobbed the smoldering pile of metal
wreckage, screaming and crying as they tried to find survivors on the tarmac at
the airport in the capital of India's poorest state, Bihar. Witnesses said a
family of five died when the plane landed on their house a third of a mile
southwest of Patna airport. Airport station manager H.H. Khan said the plane was
carrying 58 people.

Clinton: Mideast Peace Talks Challenging
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton said Sunday that the Mideast Peace
negotiations are more difficult than any he's dealt with in his presidency but
he is more optimistic now about the talks than when they began six days ago.
''God, it's hard,'' Clinton said in the first official assessment of the talks'
progress. ''It's like nothing I've ever dealt with. All the negotiations with
the Irish, all the stuff I've done with the Palestinians before this and with
the Israelis, the Balkans at Dayton.'' But he said he was hopeful that Israelis
and Palestinians could reach agreement on the contentious issues that still
divide them.

Protesters Chant Message to Barak

   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Right-wing protesters massed in Tel Aviv on Sunday
chanting ''The country must not be lost,'' to send a strong and personal message
to Prime Minister Ehud Barak that his people won't accept broad concessions to
the Palestinians. ''We are the majority, and the majority will win!'' shouted
many of those crowded into Rabin square, the site where the late prime minister
was assassinated in 1995 and where large protests are often held. Much of the
crowd, estimated at 150,000, had come by bus from settlements in the West Bank,
from homes they fear they might lose in a final peace agreement with the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Federal Forests Arguments Renewed  </HEADLINE>
By TARA BURGHART
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESTACADA, Ore. (AP) -- One woman took an unpaid leave from her
job, and another is waging a hunger strike while friends take care
of her bookstore -- all to try to save some trees.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to let logging equipment into the Mount Hood
National Forest, the U.S. Forest Service used armed officials to
move protesters out of their tree homes and is maintaining a
24-hour watch to keep activists from returning.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,030 acres included in the Eagle Creek timber sales have
renewed passionate arguments about old-growth forests, roadless
areas, logging, watersheds and wildlife habitat. Both sides say it
has become a ''poster child'' in the debate over logging.
</P>
<P>
   ''The environmental community needed a poster child timber sale
near a media center,'' said Chris West, a vice president of the
Northwest Forestry Association. ''It's close enough that they can
get media out there and they can get kids that don't have anything
else to do during the summer to go out there and camp.''
</P>
<P>
   With no way to fight the sales in court, anti-logging activists
say they were left with no alternative but protests, tree-sits and
forest blockades to try to persuade the public and politicians to
demand the Forest Service cancel the logging.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a poster child. There's no doubt about it. There's a
reason we chose Eagle,'' said Donald Fontenot, a spokesman for
Cascadia Forest Alliance, which has led most of the protests.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy dates back to the mid-1990s, when the Eagle
Creek area was included among the salvage rider sales, which were
exempted by Congress from environmental laws to jump-start logging
at the height of the timber battles and the spotted owl debate.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Creek is one of the last sales from the salvage rider with
land left to be logged.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists staged protests there in 1997 and 1998, but
turned up the pressure last summer, virtually halting logging by
blocking roads, camping in the area and living in tree platforms
and aerial pods.
</P>
<P>
   The protests came to a climax July 7, when Forest Service
officials and other authorities staged a surprise, pre-dawn raid to
evict the activists.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a woman has started a hunger strike in front of the
Forest Service regional headquarters in downtown Portland, and a
man who calls himself Tre Arrow is encamped on a 9-inch window
ledge 30 feet above the street on the same building.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters argue the logging threatens Portland's water supply,
could harm rare plants and animals, and will destroy centuries-old
trees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to look at preserving the wild lands we have,'' said
Joe Keating, the forest issue coordinator for the Oregon Wildlife
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service officials say the Eagle Creek timber sales are a
model for good management of federal forests, complying with
environmental and water standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best example of ecosystem management and forest
protection on federal land you're going to see in Western
Cascades,'' said spokesman Glen Sachet.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have been removed from their pods and treehouses,
a small band of activists remain camped at two places outside the
area the Forest Service closed off on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Several have been arrested for crossing into the closed area,
and Fontenot promised activists would be using a ''bag of tricks''
all summer to complicate any efforts at logging.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have become completely connected to this place,'' said
Meredith Bradshaw, who took a monthlong, unpaid leave from her job
with a catering company to support the protest. ''I can't turn my
back on it. I have to make sure logging trucks don't get in here
and that the sale is canceled''

<HEADLINE> DNC Parties a Hot Ticket in L.A.  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Forget movie premieres.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest ticket in town today is to one of the private
parties during next month's Democratic National Convention where
Barbra Streisand and director Rob Reiner can rub elbows with
everyone from a relatively unknown senator to the best-known
politician -- the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every political convention has this schmoozefest but Los
Angeles is going to be in a league by itself because of the
Hollywood connection,'' said Hal Dash, president of the campaign
consulting firm Cerrell Associates.
</P>
<P>
   From the Playboy Mansion to Paramount Pictures studios, from
Wolfgang Puck's trendy Spago restaurant to Los Angeles' Union
Station, from the Petersen Automotive Museum to the J. Paul Getty
Museum, the convention parties will present the mother lode of
wheeling, dealing and hobnobbing for visiting Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   At least one fest, whose location was not available but rumored
to be run by Streisand, is expected to see donations to the party
of $15,000 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles typically has been second behind New York City in
political contributions to the Democratic National Committee and
for those sponsoring parties during the Aug. 14-17 gathering, it's
a chance to influence the party.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really wanted to accurately portray our community. We
wanted to tell people our story because we felt this has not been
done in the past,'' said Maria Veloz, spokeswoman for the Latino
Committee 2000, a lobbying group planning a celebrity-filled bash
on a Hollywood studio backlot.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz is already in the air over the Hispanic Unity Caucus
gala at the Playboy Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, chaired by Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., is
designed to promote voter registration in the Latino community. But
holding the party at Hugh Hefner's playhouse has caused some
controversy, including attacks from the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''To a certain extent we don't want to dispel the myth that
there are all these scantily clad women running around,'' Playboy
spokesman Bill Farley said. ''But there's not going to be anybody
in swimsuits and bunny outfits. It's a formal dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Farley acknowledged the location may give pause to some
convention-goers. ''I'm sure it seems strange to some,'' he said.
''But Playboy has been politically active for many, many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Several telephone calls to Sanchez's office seeking comment were
not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Other planned major events include:
</P>
<P>
   --A block party prepared by the Spago restaurant for House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   --A party on a Paramount backlot by Gov. Gray Davis, dubbed ''A
Taste of California.''
</P>
<P>
   --A studio party by Sen. John Breaux on a set patterned after
Bourbon Street in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   --A party at the Egyptian Theater, sponsored by the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee to honor its chairman, Rep.
Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I.
</P>
<P>
   --A party at the Petersen Automotive Museum by DaimlerChrysler
Corp., and another sponsored by Sony Corp. at Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   --A party for the convention volunteers at the Los Angeles Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the parties will have one thing in common: People will
want to discuss serious issues and at the same time have some
fun,'' said Lisa Specht, a partner at the law firm of Manatt,
Phelps &AMP; Phillips, which is co-host to a party for foreign
dignitaries and heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   By far, the biggest night for parties will be the eve of the
convention, when 31 parties are thrown throughout the city for the
56 delegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it will be the Oscar night of the political world --
Hollywood meets Washington,'' said Ben Austin, spokesman for L.A.
Convention 2000, which is sponsoring the parties.
</P>
<P>
   In true Hollywood fashion, the price tag for these parties can
range from $20,000 to $200,000, with millions of dollars going to
caterers, party planners, restaurants and valet services.
</P>
<P>
   The host committee is expected to spend $5 million just for the
delegation parties and a huge media bash, which will include
high-profile entertainment, food and a showcase of pictures of Los
Angeles taken by children in the city.

<HEADLINE> Bush Mulls Vice President Decision  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whether or not Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush picks a vice presidential candidate who
opposes abortion, Vice President Al Gore contends Bush would take
away a women's choice on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will protect a woman's right to choose. Governor Bush has
sworn to take away a woman's right to choose,'' Gore, the
Democratic presidential nominee, said Sunday on NBC's ''Meet The
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He has told (conservative religious leaders) Jerry Falwell and
Pat Robertson that he will make appointments that will be very
pleasing to them. That's not difficult to interpret.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the urging of conservative Christians that he pick an
anti-abortion running mate, Bush said Sunday that his vice
presidential selection would be based on factors other than
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was responding to James Dobson, president of Focus on the
Family, who said recently that the likely Republican nominee,
''cannot and will not'' be elected president if he ''does not
energize his base'' of conservative Christians by picking a person
who opposes abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he gets ''all kinds of interesting advice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to pick somebody who can be president of the United
States and somebody with whom I can get along,'' he told ABC's
''This Week'' in a rare talk show appearance. ''I'm going to take a
lot of factors into consideration. Obviously issues matter, a
person's voting record matters, where they're from matters, their
gender matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he hasn't decided whether he'll announce his
running-mate choice before or during the GOP nominating convention
in Philadelphia starting July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Majority
Leader Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, conceded that Bush may pick a
candidate who does not oppose abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   But Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan, a former Republican and
a staunch opponent of abortion, said any discussion of Bush
choosing a running mate who favors abortion rights was just talk.
''Mr. Bush is blowing smoke,'' Buchanan said on CBS' ''Face the
Nation.'' ''He would have an explosion at his convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore brushed aside questions about whether consumer advocate
Ralph Nader, nominee of the Green Party, is cutting into his
support, saying voters eventually will want to pick ''between two
stark choices'' -- himself or Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Nader told CBS he was not concerned what effect he might have on
other candidates. ''I wouldn't be running if I were worried about
taking votes away from Al Gore or George W. Bush,'' he said.
''Nobody is entitled to votes. They have to earn them.''
</P>
<P>
   On other issues:
</P>
<P>
   --Bush countered Gore's criticism about a projected $610 million
shortfall in the Texas budget by noting that the state is running a
surplus that could run as high as $1 billion and there is plenty to
cover any needed adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   --Bush reiterated his belief that every prisoner executed in
Texas during his governorship was guilty. Gore said he supports the
death penalty but thought Republican Gov. George Ryan of Illinois
made a wise decision in calling for a moratorium after errors were
found in that state.
</P>
<P>
   --On Social Security, Gore said he would encourage people to
invest retirement savings in the stock market in addition to a core
Social Security fund that lawmakers could not touch. Bush said
people should have the option to invest their Social Security funds
in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   --Bush said he would expand research on an anti-ballistic missile
system. Gore was more cautious, saying the decision was still
President Clinton's but ''it's only responsible to investigate
whether or not it's possible ....''
</P>
<P>
   --Responding to criticism that his administration mishandled $33
million in federal school lunch money, Bush said Texas, in fact,
was ''higher than the national average'' in signing up poor
children for subsidized meals.
</P>
<P>
   --Gore defended his administration's 1996 campaign finance
tactics, saying he still believes an event he attended at a
Buddhist temple in California was not a fund-raiser. ''There was no
request for funds. No money changed hands,'' he said. He has denied
knowing anything about the $60,000 in illegal donations that
followed his appearance at the temple.

<HEADLINE> Unlicensed teen driver killed in fiery crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILLSTONE, N.J. (AP) - A 16-year-old unlicensed driver was
killed Saturday when the van she was driving struck a tree and
burned, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Berman, East Windsor, was headed home in a van that
belonged to her stepfather at about 6 a.m. when the vehicle slipped
off Norico Road, hit the tree and immediately caught fire, state
police Sgt. Frank Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   State police and the fire departments and first aid squads of
Millstone and East Windsor responded, but there was little that
could be done because the vehicle was ablaze when they got there,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Berman was pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the van tipped over onto the driver's side and slid
into the tree, which left Berman trapped in the blazing vehicle.
Jordan said it was not known if Berman was killed in the crash or
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Berman had taken the vehicle without her
stepfather's or mother's permission.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Keith Berman, said his daughter took her
stepfather's van without consent to go back to a party in
Roosevelt. That Friday night, Berman's mother had picked her up
from the same party at around 11 p.m. and brought her home, the
girl's father said.

<HEADLINE> Political Changes Around Globe  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first year of the new century has already become a time of
historic political change: Voters have toppled once-invincible
parties in Mexico and Taiwan, an enigmatic leader has taken over in
Russia and longtime foes have bearhugged each other at a summit in
the Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the main catalysts for the shake-ups and breakthroughs
have been building anger over corruption and fear of economic
stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   More voters and politicians seem to realize that nations mired
in graft and bound by tired political dogma can quickly fall behind
in a global economy that is becoming more competitive and less
forgiving of countries unwilling to change.
</P>
<P>
   ''A vibrant form of capitalism, scientific management and
democratic vitality are seen as the essential parts of the winning
combination,'' said Alex Inkeles, a sociologist at the Hoover
Institution at Stanford. ''And those who can convince people they
understand the process and can harness the forces of change win
support, allegiance and elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent political shocker happened in Mexico, where
voters on July 3 dumped the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI, ending its 71-year lock on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   With its vast empire of state companies, domination of the media
and loads of cash to buy votes, the PRI once seemed unstoppable.
But cracks began forming in the party's power base as it relaxed
its grip on Mexico and -- in the spirit of global free trade -- began
selling off state enterprises that once rewarded supporters with
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the PRI -- the world's longest-governing
party -- lost governorships and the powerful Mexico City mayor's
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Its biggest defeat came at the hands of President-elect Vicente
Fox, a brash-talking former Coca-Cola executive and rancher who
campaigned as a corruption-buster and challenged voters to oust the
PRI from the presidency and prove that Mexico is a real democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffry Frieden, a Harvard professor of government, said Mexico
fell victim to the global trend of growing complexity within
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The increasing sophistication of the economy has created
groups and classes that are hard to buy off: modern businesses,
professionals, middle classes,'' Frieden said. ''And I think in
most of these cases it has been these 'pivotal' voters who have
made the difference, throwing their support to opposition
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   In many important ways, Mexico's election mirrored Taiwan's
presidential vote on March 18 -- a campaign that ended the
Nationalist Party's five-decade control of the island's presidency.
Like the PRI, the Nationalists, or KMT, seemed unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's richest political parties, the KMT was widely
expected to use its deep network of local party bosses and
plentiful cash for vote buying to pull off another victory.
</P>
<P>
   But internal squabbles split the party and the KMT failed to
convince voters it would quit its business empire, with assets
valued at $3 billion, and evolve into a modern, clean political
party.
</P>
<P>
   Former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian seized on the corruption
issue and promised voters he would rid Taiwan of ''black gold,''
Taiwanese slang for the entrenched culture of kickbacks and
bribery.
</P>
<P>
   As a top maker of computers and microchips, Taiwan is strapped
tightly to the global economy, and Chen, 49, warned voters that
continuing to tolerate the Nationalists' graft would sap the
island's competitiveness. Voters listened.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest nation and No. 2 nuclear power has become an
example of how far a nation can fall when corruption, inefficiency
and lawlessness go unchecked. Once a superpower during its
communist era, Russia suffered years of decline under the rule of
Boris Yeltsin, who was unpredictable, frequently ill, usually out
of sight and seemingly uninterested in governing.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin surprised the world by resigning on New Year's Eve and
handing the presidency to Vladimir Putin, a former KGB spy who was
a mystery even his most ardent supporters. When he won the March 26
presidential vote -- Russia's second since the 1991 Soviet collapse
-- Putin was still an enigma to Russians.
</P>
<P>
   So far, one of 47-year-old Putin's favorite themes has been how
Russia needs a strong state to save it from slipping further into
bankruptcy and chaos. He wants to push through economic reforms,
crack down on official corruption, improve tax collection and rein
in regional leaders -- many of whom rule their regions like virtual
fiefdoms.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's disastrous economy and political turmoil are closely
watched by China and North Korea -- two communist nations who are
under great pressure to reform their repressive ways.
</P>
<P>
   Although China has taken bold strides opening up its economy in
recent years, Beijing keeps a tight grip on politics. Meanwhile,
North Korea prefers an iron grip on all facets of life and has been
an international hermit for five decades.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the world was surprised when mysterious North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il -- who once rarely made public appearances --
agreed to meet his South Korean counterpart, Kim Dae-jung, at a
three-day summit that began June 13.
</P>
<P>
   The two Kims bearhugged each other in the North Korean capital
of Pyongyang and signed a deal that was the biggest step toward
reconciliation since the 1945 division of the Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   Just why Kim Jong Il agreed to the summit is still a mystery,
though some analysts said it was part of a scheme to extract more
economic aid from the wealthy South.
</P>
<P>
   Years of mismanagement have caused North Korea's economy to
collapse. Starving people have added tree bark and leaves to their
meager diets, and hundreds of thousands have died of hunger in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   James Lindsay, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute in
Washington, said the unfortunate thing about unexpected change is
that it can also cut the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are singing 'Happy Days are Here Again' over events in
Mexico, Taiwan and especially North Korea,'' said Lindsay, also a
political science professor at the University of Iowa. ''Our
optimism today may prove to be as misplaced as our pessimism was
six months ago.''

<HEADLINE> Lavender Boom Means Big Business  </HEADLINE>
By HEIDI B. PERLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARWICH, Mass. (AP) -- A decade ago, when Cynthia Sutphin planted
her first 400 lavender plants in a small garden outside her Harwich
home, she wasn't certain why she was doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, she says, she just knew the plant would catch on
someday, and she wanted to be ready when it did.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the owner of the Cape Cod Lavender Farm annually harvests
more than 15,000 lavender plants and can barely keep up with the
demand for oils, soaps, potpourri and plants fueled by a surge in
consumers exploring natural remedies, homeopathy and aromatherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew that eventually lavender would hit it big,'' said
Sutphin, 48. ''And I knew that I would be in the right place at the
right time when it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say the ancient plant had its big break just last year when
it was named Herb of the Year by the International Herb
Organization in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But others say its popularity has been steadily building for
years with the increase in more health-conscious consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only recently that people started to notice it can be
used for so much more than just perfume,'' said Peggy McElgunn,
director of the herb association. ''People are finally waking up to
it and becoming smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   To the untrained eye -- or nose -- lavender is just another
flowering plant with deep purple buds and a scent reminiscent of a
grandmother's perfume.
</P>
<P>
   But to Sutphin and other herb enthusiasts, it is a near mystical
herb that can be used to cure headaches, induce sleep, season pasta
or even sweeten lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, the flower buds release an oil that is used for
massage oil, soaps, perfume and air freshener. And when dried
correctly, the flowers can retain their scent and most of their
color for years, Sutphin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something our grandparents knew about,'' she said. ''Our
parents didn't, but now we're rediscovering lavender. It skipped a
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that people have begun to notice it again, just about
anything having to do with lavender is not only popular, but big
business.
</P>
<P>
   Sutphin's farm is beginning to see more competition from smaller
farms around the region, including the Franklin County Lavender
Growers in western Massachusetts, a cooperative of about 40 farmers
with about 3,5000 plants among them.
</P>
<P>
   Farms are flourishing across the country as well, including the
Olympic Peninsula, where the North American Lavender Conference is
held each year. More than 60 farms and herb nurseries in states
from coast to coast are registered members of the International
Herb Association.
</P>
<P>
   And where there was once just a handful of books about herbs and
their healing qualities, today there are more than 200 books in
print on lavender alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people have a growing need to get back to nature,''
said David Schiller, a spokesman for the International Aromatherapy
and Herb Association, based in Phoenix. ''Especially in cities with
no trees or grass. This lets them get (a taste of) nature again.''
</P>
<P>
   Growers agree.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could sit here and make soap all day and I would still run
out,'' said Denise Schwartz, who is a member of the western
Massachusetts cooperative. Demand has doubled since last year, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sutphin opened her farm to the public just four years ago.
Visitors have risen from 2,000 in the first year to 4,000 in the
second to 8,000 in the third. This year, business already has
quadrupled, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to expand her tiny shop, which is now housed in a shed
at the end of the winding driveway that leads to her farm. And next
year she says she and her husband, Matthew, may have to hire some
full-time help.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting too big to run this whole thing ourselves,''
Sutphin said. ''It's just no longer possible.''
</P>
<P>
   On her 11 acres of lush fields, she grows eight varieties of
lavender. For a few weeks each year, most of the eight varieties
are in bloom, painting her landscape with a delicate purple brush.
</P>
<P>
   And when all the flowers are out and the breeze blows just
right, there is no sweeter sight or scent in the world, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's beautiful to look at, and pleasing to the eyes and the
nose,'' she said. ''Once you're hooked, you're hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sutphin and her husband sell their lavender in bulk to
home decor doyen Martha Stewart and to individual customers who
find the farm.
</P>
<P>
   And even in the dead of winter, when the Cape Cod roads are
unplowed and her dirt driveway is nearly impossible to find, there
is always someone out there looking for lavender, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What can I say?'' she said. ''People love it.''

<HEADLINE> Water, Fire an Explosive Mixture  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL MELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Giant flames rise here from piles of
pine and cedar in 97 braziers on three downtown rivers.
Torchbearers patrol the waters in boats with names from Greek
mythology as music piped in from bridges fills the air.
</P>
<P>
   What started as a one-time event on New Year's Eve 1995 has
grown to a summer spectacle that annually attracts tens of
thousands -- and has spawned imitators.
</P>
<P>
   But what is copyrighted art in one community is seen as simply
fire burning on top of water in others, though Barnaby Evans,
creator of Providence's ''WaterFire,'' begs to differ.
</P>
<P>
   Evans tried to snuff out productions making use of those
opposing natural elements in rural South Kingstown and in the city
of Pawtucket because he felt they copied his popular creation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people associate WaterFire with Providence and its
renaissance. Our hope is that it can be positive for everyone,''
the 47-year-old artist said. ''Rather than smaller versions of my
idea, let's see new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people wonder how Evans or anyone else can lay claim to
mixing fire and water, an idea that dates to ancient times.
</P>
<P>
   It was also used more recently in London, which welcomed the new
year and millennium with a celebration that included a ''river of
fire'' display on the River Thames.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one can own anything as natural as water and fire,'' said
Jeanne Wettlaufer, of the Historic Downtown Merchants Association
in South Kingstown.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Evans' suggestion the South Kingstown fire display be
moved off the river, the local group went ahead with a June
festival after consulting a lawyer. The party included fire
spouting from barrels floating on the river. A similar display is
planned for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had no ambiance and was very simple ... people loved it,''
Wettlaufer said.
</P>
<P>
   Pawtucket originally canceled its plans after Evans objected but
last week said it will move forward. Evans offered his blessing,
after the city agreed to drop ''fires'' from the formal name of its
display. The city will also look into the possibility of something
more original, Mayor James Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said he is not claiming the idea of mixing fire and water
as his own. He said various cultures have used fire and water in
burials and other rituals ''going back to prehistory.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Evans said, he has no interest in suing local communities
but will protect his copyright of the WaterFire name and the
concept behind his production if forced. He thinks other towns
should take the idea behind WaterFire and develop something they
can call their own.
</P>
<P>
   Steve D'Aguanno, 48, of Scituate, R.I., has seen WaterFire a
couple of times and agreed it is artistic expression.
</P>
<P>
   ''You come down not to see fire on the water but to experience
this environment in a different way,'' he said, walking along the
Providence River.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is just fire on the water,'' said Cheryl Brown, 42, of
Providence. ''It's a beautiful site that gets people together like
a social event.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmine Bonitati, 83, of Cranston, R.I., thinks WaterFire is
good for the city but should be shared.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's crazy to say other towns can't do it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Alliance Airways Flight Crashes  </HEADLINE>
By INDRANIL SINGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATNA, India (AP) -- An Alliance Air jet carrying 58 people
caught fire and crashed into a house just before a scheduled
landing Monday morning in eastern India.
</P>
<P>
   Five members of a family of seven died when the Boeing 737 hit
their house a third of a mile southwest of Patna airport, witnesses
said. Twenty bodies, burned beyond recognition, were pulled from
the metal wreckage about 3&AMP;frac12; hours after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen people were brought to Patna Medical College Hospital,
with four in life-threatening condition, said administrative
officer Dr. R. K. Singh.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, with flames spewing, dipped just before it crashed,
said witness Ashok Kesri. ''The plane was on fire before it hit the
house,'' said Kesri.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives, police and airport workers mobbed the smoldering pile
of metal wreckage, screaming and crying as they tried to find
survivors. Thousands of people swarmed around the plane, whose
tailfins could be seen above their heads as the plane rested
against a crumbled brick house in a government housing complex.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 737 was carrying 52 passengers and six crew members,
said A.K. Vashisht, a deputy general manager for state-owned Indian
Airlines, the parent company of Alliance Air.
</P>
<P>
   Some men grabbed a water hose and tried to help soldiers and
police put out the flames. More than 20 fire engines surrounded the
rubble and put out the flames about three hours after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was flying on instruments because of bad weather, Star
News television quoted airline officials in Calcutta, the plane's
departure point.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was headed to New Delhi, with a scheduled stop at
7:15 a.m. in Patna, capital of India's poorest state of Bihar.
Airline officials said 46 people booked their flights to Patna and
six were going to the only other stop, Lucknow, capital of Uttar
Pradesh state.
</P>
<P>
   India has frequent air crashes. The worst was a collision of a
Saudi jetliner and a Kazak cargo plane over New Delhi that killed
349 people in November 1996.

<HEADLINE> Bus Explodes in Vietnam, Killing 16  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- A bus carrying chemicals exploded in
central Vietnam, killing 16 people and seriously burning 10 others,
a local police officer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen people were killed instantly and three others died in
hospital after the accident Sunday afternoon in Quang Nam province,
500 miles south of Hanoi, police officer Nguyen Dung said.
</P>
<P>
   Dung said the bus was carrying more than 40 passengers on a road
from Hanoi to southern Ho Chi Minh City when it suddenly exploded.
It took firefighters more than an hour to extinguish the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the dead have been identified, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the explosion was not yet known. Police officer
Chau Khanh Viet said 20 containers of chemicals were on board the
bus, apparently brought by a passenger. Samples of the chemicals
were being tested for identification.
</P>
<P>
   More than a week ago, a head-on collision between a bus and a
truck left 14 people dead and 14 others injured in the same
province.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Lankford Brother Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- A 19-year-old man who died Sunday of
gunshot wounds was identified as the brother of St. Louis Cardinals
outfielder Ray Lankford, according to broadcast reports.
</P>
<P>
   Percibal Thomley was shot in the head at about 10 p.m. Saturday,
police Officer Sherry Rumsey said. Thomley was taken to Los Angeles
County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where he died Sunday, police
Sgt. James Kimoto said.
</P>
<P>
   Police could not confirm whether Thomley was Lankford's brother,
but three St. Louis television stations reported that he was.
</P>
<P>
   Lankford's aunt, Geraldine Blackwell, who spoke to KTVI-TV in
St. Louis, said in a telephone interview that Thomley was shot on
''a heavy gang street.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They tell us he went out to the car to get something, just
before they got ready to go out, and they said someone was standing
there waiting and shot him in the back of the head,'' Blackwell
told the station. ''Another friend said they think they mistook him
for someone else, but they don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Hainje, the Cardinals' media relations assistant director,
said that Lankford left the team Sunday morning ''for personal
reasons to attend to a family matter in California.'' He declined
to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Lankford missed Sunday's game against the Twins and will miss
''the next couple of games,'' Hainje said.

<HEADLINE> Anniversary of JFK Jr.'s crash marked silently, if at all  </HEADLINE>
By HEIDI B. PERLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) - It was one year ago that a late night plane crash
off the coast of Martha's Vineyard killed one of America's favorite
sons and left an entire nation to grieve.
</P>
<P>
   But on the anniversary of the crash that killed John F. Kennedy
Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and his sister-in-law
Lauren Bessette, it is clear that for most Americans, the grieving
is over.
</P>
<P>
   A small driftwood memorial was erected Sunday on the Vineyard's
Philbin Beach, the beach closest to the area where his plane went
down.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from the wooden cross, which bore the names ''John,
Carolyn and Lauren,'' little else was done to mark the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   No Kennedy fanatics camped out in front of the political
family's compound in Hyannis Port on Cape Cod. No flowers were left
on the stoop of the Manhattan apartment where Kennedy used to live.
And unlike a year ago, no women clutched pictures of the handsome
John Jr. and wept publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been very, very quiet,'' Barnstable Police Officer James
Ellis said. ''We've had patrols out all week, and we haven't had a
problem yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Freeman, mother of the Bessettes, released a public
statement last week to announce the family's decision not to mark
the anniversary publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The Christ Church in Greenwich, Conn., which last year was
filled with people mourning the Bessette sisters, was empty on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And even the young Kennedy's uncle, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., planned to do nothing more this weekend than spend some
time with his family in Hyannis Port.
</P>
<P>
   John Jr. was flying to Martha's Vineyard with his wife and
sister-in-law when his single-engine Piper Saratoga fell into the
waters late at night, seven miles south of his island home. They
were flying from New Jersey to attend his cousin Rory Kennedy's
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   A recently released report from the National Transportation
Safety Board blamed the crash on Kennedy for becoming disoriented
in the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   Vineyard residents are doing little to mark the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Anne McGhee, a Harvard University professor who has a home on
the island, said she thinks that while few are showing their pain
publicly, many, like her, are feeling it in private.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need to be reminded or have a memorial,'' she said.
''We just know.''

<HEADLINE> Marion Jones Wins Long Jump  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The day belonged to three remarkable
women.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Jones won her second event of the U.S. Olympic track and
field trials with the sweet poise that could make her the darling
of the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Joyner-Kersee fell short in her comeback attempt and bid
a graceful farewell to the sport she dominated for so long.
</P>
<P>
   And Marla Runyan completed her inspiring journey from disabled
athlete to Olympian, the first legally blind competitor to earn a
spot on any U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think my vision is just a circumstance that happened, and I
don't look at it as a barrier,'' Runyan said. ''I never said, 'I
want to be the first legally blind runner to make the Olympics.' I
just wanted to be an Olympian.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a painful leg injury, with 20-300 vision in her right
eye and 20-400 in her left, she finished third in the 1,500 meters
Sunday, behind winner Regina Jacobs and runner-up Suzy Hamilton
Favor.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was incredibly courageous,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones added the long jump title to the 100 meters crown she won
on Saturday, but not before flirting with disaster and nearly
ruining her hopes of five gold medals in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   She fouled on her first two attempts. If she fouled again, or
had a bad jump that left her in eighth place or lower among the 12
competitors, she would not advance to the finals. The long jump
would belong to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the second jump, I turned around and saw the red flag,''
Jones said, ''And I said 'OK, I've got one more, and if I don't get
into it, this dream will be over.'''
</P>
<P>
   She looked to the stands for encouragement from her coach Trevor
Graham and husband C.J. Hunter, who made the Olympic team in the
shot put on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as I saw they believed in me, I had no problem,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   She was careful to take off far behind the starting board and
made the finals comfortably at 22 feet, 1&AMP;frac34; inches. Then, on her
fifth and next-to-last attempt of the day, she soared 23-0&AMP;frac12;, the
fourth-best jump in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been waiting for that jump all year,'' Jones said. ''That
it came at the Olympic trials is great. I'll be ready for Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee faced the reality that her 38-year-old legs could
not match those of a new generation of jumpers. Aiming to qualify
for a fifth Olympics, Joyner-Kersee could manage only a distant
sixth at 21-10&AMP;frac34;.
</P>
<P>
   Six Olympic medals, more than any other female American athlete,
three of them gold, will have to suffice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought that maybe I could put it together, but I can't be
disappointed,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ''It was really a long shot.
Not to take anything from any of the other jumpers. They jumped
well, and they deserve to go. I deserve to go home and do what I
was doing before I decided to come back out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she laughed, as she often does, and warned her
husband-coach Bob Kersee that she would never compete again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not even in the Masters,'' she said. ''I'm going to tell
Bobby, 'Don't even try that.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson won the 400 meters with an effort that seemed
routine, even though at 43.68 seconds it easily was the fastest in
the world this year and just a half-second off his world record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt good the whole way. I worked the curve not as
aggressively as I usually do, because I felt I had a comfortable
lead,'' Johnson said. ''I wasn't trying to run any spectacular time
today, I was just trying to win the race. There's no reason to take
a risk at the Olympic trials.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger show comes next week, when Johnson faces rival
Maurice Greene in the 200.
</P>
<P>
   There had not been a jump-off to determine a U.S. Olympic berth
since 1936, but it happened in two events Sunday -- the women's high
jump and men's pole vault.
</P>
<P>
   Karol Damon and Erin Aldrich made the team by clearing 6-4, but
Amy Acuff and three-time U.S. outdoor champion Tisha Waller tied
for third. In a jump-off, Acuff claimed the final spot by clearing
6-3&AMP;frac14;.
</P>
<P>
   In the pole vault, with American record holder Jeff Hartwig out
of the competition after failing to clear a height in Friday's
preliminaries, Lawrence Johnson won at 19-5&AMP;frac12; and Nick Hysong was
second at 18-9&AMP;frac12;.
</P>
<P>
   There was a three-way tie for third between Derek Miles, Pat
Manson and Tye Harvey. Miles won the jump-off by clearing 18-5&AMP;frac12;.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan's third-place finish overshadowed a stirring duel between
Jacobs and Favor Hamilton. The two were elbow-to-elbow going into
the final lap before the 37-year-old Jacobs, en route to her fourth
Olympics, pulled away to win in 4:01.01, eight-tenths of a second
ahead of Favor Hamilton. Runyan was third in 4:06.44.
</P>
<P>
   In other events, surprising Latasha Colander-Richardson won the
400 meters in 49.87 seconds and Gabe Jennings led a 1-3 Stanford
finish in the men's 1,500 with a victory in 3:35. College teammate
Michael Stembler was third, with Jason Pyrah second.

<HEADLINE> Baldwin Wins Again, Leiter Loses  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM NAZIMOWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five days after the All-Star game, James Baldwin got another win
and Al Leiter lost again.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin (12-4), the winner in Tuesday's All-Star game, struck
out a career-high 11 and allowed seven hits in eight innings as the
Chicago White Sox beat the Milwaukee Brewers 11-5 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter (10-3), the All-Star loser for the NL, tied a season high
by allowing six runs, including Marty Cordova's grand slam in the
sixth. He gave up seven hits and four walks and struck out six in 5
2-3 innings as the Mets lost for the ninth time in 12 games, 7-3 to
the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   In other interleague games, it was New York Yankees 9,
Philadelphia 8, 10 innings; Boston 5, Montreal 2; Detroit 6,
Cincinnati 2; Houston 5, Cleveland 1; Atlanta 6, Tampa Bay 4;
Baltimore 9, Florida 5; Minnesota 5, St. Louis 2; San Francisco 6,
Texas 4; Seattle 6, Arizona 3; San Diego 6, Anaheim 5, 10 innings;
and Chicago Cubs 10, Kansas City 7. Oakland at Colorado was rained
out and will be made up Monday as part of a day-night doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   In the only NL game, Los Angeles beat Pittsburgh 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin's 12 victories matched his 1999 total, one shy of his
career high, set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't trying to strike everybody out, just trying to make
them put the ball in play. The strikeouts seemed to happen,'' said
Baldwin, who went home to North Carolina for three days after the
All-Star game to be with his wife as she delivered their second
child.

<P>
   All-Star Magglio Ordonez had a grand slam, a solo homer and a
career-high six RBIs for the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maggs speaks for himself,'' Baldwin said. ''He is coming out
and attacking pitches. It shows not only for him, but the whole
club. Anytime you have one guy doing that and you have the rest of
the guys falling in, it makes things easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez raised his season total to 23 with his fourth multihomer
game, second this season.
</P>
<P>
   John Snyder (3-4) took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter was perfect in Toronto until allowing a two-out single in
the fourth. He walked the bases loaded in the fifth before allowing
an RBI single to Alberto Castillo and an RBI grounder to Homer
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander blamed poor umpiring for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the worst-umpired game I've ever seen,'' Leiter said
of plate umpire Mike Fichter, a summer relief umpire. ''The guy had
no clue. It wasn't just me either. Guys on the Jays were
complaining too. I hope it doesn't come out that I'm a cry baby
because it wasn't just me.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Halladay (4-5) won for the second time since being recalled
from the minors on June 24. The right-hander allowed three runs on
five hits in six innings, struck out six and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Koch got four outs for his 21st save in 25 chances.
</P>
<P>
Yankees 9, Phillies 8
</P>
<P>
   David Justice's single capped New York's biggest late-inning
comeback in 24 years, five runs in the ninth inning and three in
the 10th at Yankee Stadium. After Brian Hunter's two-run homer in
the 10th off Mariano Rivera (3-3), Paul O'Neill, Bernie Williams
and Justice hit RBI singles off Jeff Brantley (1-4).
</P>
<P>
Red Sox 5, Expos 2
</P>
<P>
   One day after butting heads with plate umpire Ronald Kulpa and
getting ejected, Carl Everett went 2-for-2 with a two-run homer at
Fenway Park and Tim Wakefield (6-5) won his fourth straight start,
beating Mike Johnson (4-4).
</P>
<P>
Tigers 6, Reds 2
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson was 3-for-4 with a homer and Juan Encarnacion
hit two RBI doubles before a record crowd of 40,637 at Comerica
Park. Jeff Weaver (6-7) won for the third time in four decisions,
defeating Steve Parris (5-12).
</P>
<P>
Astros 5, Indians 1
</P>
<P>
   At Cleveland, Scott Elarton (9-3) won his fifth straight start

</P>
<P>
Braves 6, Devil Rays 4
</P>

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Extends Tour Lead  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREAS EVAGORA
<TEXT>
<P>
   COURCHEVEL, France (AP) -- Lance Armstrong moved closer to
winning his second consecutive Tour de France, and said his best is
yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong put on another superb display of mountain climbing in
the French Alps to finish fourth in the 15th stage Sunday to extend
his lead over Jan Ullrich from 4 minutes, 55 seconds to 7:26.
</P>
<P>
   A good performance in Tuesday's final mountain stage should
clinch a win for Armstrong, but the 28-year-old Texan still wants
to improve in the third and final week of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''My form is not getting better,'' he said after Sunday's leg.
''Things are similar to last year, with a good first few days in
the mountains, then trying to maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still think my best day on this course is yet to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong finished 50 seconds behind stage winner Marco Pantani,
the 1998 Tour de France champion.
</P>
<P>
   The shaven-headed Italian powered past Jose Maria Jimenez in the
final 1.8 miles of the 108-mile route from Briancon to Courchevel.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second impressive 2000 Tour win for Pantani, who has
barely raced at the top level since being thrown out of the 1999
Giro D'Italia for failing a doping test.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong cruised past the line knowing that Ullrich and Joseba
Beloki, who finished third, were well-beaten.
</P>
<P>
   With only one mountain stage left, there is little time for any
other rider to catch Armstrong, who again looked in imperious
climbing form.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's rest day, Armstrong just has to negotiate
Tuesday's 122-mile course from Courchevel to Morzine, near the
Swiss border, before the final flat stages to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Armstrong, who battled back from cancer to win last
year's Tour, isn't taking anything for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stage to Morzine is very difficult and I refuse to believe
that I have won the race until the very end. That is the attitude
that is the most intelligent and the most respectful.''
</P>
<P>
   Though shorter than Saturday's marathon 155-mile route from
Draguignan to Briancon, the 15th leg still had three tough summits
above 2,000 meters to challenge riders' climbing skills.
</P>
<P>
   Riders had to deal with chilly winds and sporadic showers, but
for most of the journey north to Courchevel enjoyed sun and
comfortable temperatures of around 59 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 180 riders that began the race two weeks ago, only 141
remained.
</P>
<P>
   The two hardest ascents were at Col de Galibier and Col de la
Madeleine, before the final ascent up the Category 1 climb of
Courchevel. A group of five riders led the charge up the final
ascent.
</P>
<P>
   In the final nine miles, Armstrong and Pantani chased the
leaders while Ullrich fell behind.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich, who has suffered from weight and fitness problems this
year, again struggled badly on climbs and finished 15th, 3:21
behind the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was feeling good on Madeleine, but when Pantani attacked I
had no strength left,'' said Ullrich, the 1997 Tour de France
champion. ''I am lucky still to be second.''

<HEADLINE> Floyd Shows Old Killer Instinct  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ray Floyd admits he's always been a good
putter. He works hard at it.
</P>
<P>
   Now that his back isn't killing him, the rest of Floyd's
considerable game is dependable again, too.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, who hadn't won in four years, birdied two of the last
three holes to win his second Senior Players Championship title,
beating Larry Nelson and Dana Quigley by one stroke Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love being inside the ropes,'' Floyd said. ''I love the
competition. And if you love the competition, you want to play
well.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something Floyd had been unable to do. Back and neck
injuries had made the game almost too painful. But a new exercise
routine made his body healthy and golf guru Rick Smith helped Floyd
build a new golf swing.
</P>
<P>
   It all came together at the TPC of Michigan, which just happened
to be the site of Floyd's last win in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was fun walking up to the 18th green and hearing the
applause, and knowing that I needed the putt,'' Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, who shot 6-under-par 66 for a 15-under 273 total, still
trailed Quigley by one as he approached the last hole, a par 4. A
3-wood off the tee and a wedge left him a 20-foot putt up a ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Not an easy task, but this is where major championships are won
and lost. As it turned out, Floyd had gone out Tuesday night and
practiced that very putt for almost five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I putted a lot of balls,'' Floyd said. ''When you read it, you
read it straight. It looks straight. And I putted down that same
line from different lengths, and it kept going right every time.
</P>
<P>
   ''So, I got over the putt today and I look up there and it
looked straight. And I said, 'You practiced this thing Tuesday and
you know it goes right.' I played it outside the hole and hit it
pretty firm, and it went right in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, playing in the final threesome, right behind Floyd's
group, had almost the identical putt to save par and force a
playoff with Floyd. Quigley's putt curled right of the cup, just as
Floyd suspected it would.
</P>
<P>
   The bogey dropped Quigley, who has never won a major, into a tie
with the hard-charging Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before I hit my tee shot on 18, we heard the crowd up at the
green,'' Quigley said. ''So we knew Raymond had made the putt
before I hit my tee shot.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Quigley tried to put a little extra effort into it
and pulled his tee shot into a hazard on the left. Quigley strained
a calf muscle in his left leg hacking the ball out. But he was
still short of the green and couldn't pull off a miracle pitch and
putt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started getting a little quick,'' said Quigley, who spent 13
years as a club pro before joining the Senior PGA Tour in 1997. ''I
think I was chocking a little bit, feeling the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, who has four senior majors to go with the four he won on
the regular PGA Tour, started the day tied with Nelson at 9-under
207, six strokes behind third-round leader Tom Kite. That made his
comeback the greatest in the history of this championship,
eclipsing the old mark of Dave Stockton who overcame a five-stroke
deficit in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be honest, I didn't think I would have a chance with a
66,'' Floyd said. ''But as it happened, I'm thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley shot a 71 to tie Nelson for second. Nelson shot a 67
despite playing the last seven holes without a putter.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he didn't intend to damage his putter, although he
was aggravated after making a poor putt on No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''I bowed it and it didn't rebound,'' said Nelson, whose
comeback stalled after an eagle on No. 17. ''It was one of those
non-tempered shafts, apparently.''
</P>
<P>
   Kite, seeking his third win and second major of his first season
on the senior circuit, shot himself out of contention with a
final-round 76.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tom was not as good as he was yesterday,'' Quigley said. ''Of
course, I wasn't either, so I guess that's to be expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Hale Irwin, also seeking his second major
title of the season, had a round of 66 to tie Mike McCullough at
275. McCullough shot a 69.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, the 16th different winner on the senior circuit this
season, is the third two-time winner of the Senior Players
Championship, joining Arnold Palmer and Dave Stockton.

<HEADLINE> Roberts Wins Greater Milwaukee Open  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- This time it wasn't just Loren Roberts' putting
that had his opponents shaking their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who built his career on a sublime putting stroke, had
all facets of his game working in an eight-stroke victory Sunday in
the Greater Milwaukee Open.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after his 45th birthday, Roberts won his second GMO
with the lowest overall score and the biggest victory margin
recorded in the event.
</P>
<P>
   He took control of the tournament when he holed a 160-yard iron
shot for an eagle Saturday, and he put the trophy on ice by hitting
a 25-yard chip from the fairway on Sunday's 12th hole. Add Roberts'
usual array of dazzling birdie putts, and nobody else stood a
chance in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was groovin','' said Franklin Langham, who finished a
distant second. ''He got on top and he never looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts shot a 5-under-par 66 to set the 72-hole tournament
record of 260 -- 24 under. He broke the mark set last year by Carlos
Franco (264), and he also topped Ken Green's record six-shot
victory margin in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He called the tournament the best four days of his career,
particularly because it came at a time when most players are losing
their games instead of finding them.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a huge victory for me, at 45 years old, playing
against (golfers in their) 20s and 30s,'' Roberts said. ''I can't
tell you what this means to me. I'm not going to forget this one
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is regarded as the game's best putter, but few fans
realize he didn't play golf until he was 17. He was a club pro for
five years, and he went to Q School five times before making the
PGA Tour full time.
</P>
<P>
   His first career victory came in 1994, when he was 38. His
victory Sunday was his seventh, and his first since last year's
Byron Nelson Classic. He tied for third in this year's Masters and
finished eighth in the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a late starter, always have been,'' said Roberts, the
oldest player to win on tour this year. ''I'm always a little
behind the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   With his sixth top-10 finish of the year, Roberts became the
second-oldest GMO champion. The victory also gave him 900,000
Presidents Cup points, putting him among the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   He even briefly challenged John Huston's tour record for lowest
score in relation to par, but two pars and a bogey on the final
three holes left Roberts at 24 under, four strokes shy Huston's
28-under in the 1998 Hawaiian Open.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted to a bit of relaxation while playing the final holes
with an insurmountable lead. Roberts acknowledged his cheering
galleries and engaged in some smiling banter with his caddy and
playing partners Langham and Frank Lickliter.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing better than standing on the last hole and
having a nine-shot lead,'' he said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, the 1996 GMO champion who played in the tournament for
the 18th time, added $450,000 to his career winnings in Milwaukee,
already more than any other player.
</P>
<P>
   He tore up Brown Deer Park for the fourth straight day, making
25 birdies and one eagle in the four-day event for scores of
65-66-63-66. The short, immaculately maintained course perfectly
suits Roberts' game, and it showed.
</P>
<P>
   With his meager drives and his reliance on precision, Roberts
doesn't draw much attention at the tour's major events. But at the
GMO, where just five of the world's top 50 golfers were in the
field, Roberts was the main event.
</P>
<P>
   An enthusiastic gallery of Wisconsin fans followed Roberts
during his final round, adopting him as a hometown favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Langham made an extra $120,000 with a 10-foot birdie putt on 18,
giving him a 72 Sunday and sole possession of second place, one
stroke ahead of Steve Pate, J.P. Hayes, Kenny Perry and Mathew
Goggin.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third runner-up finish this year for Langham, who was
second at the Doral-Ryder Open in March and last month's Kemper
Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just never gave me a chance,'' Langham said. ''I could just
see everybody's chances to win just slipping away.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts took command of the tournament Saturday, shooting a 63
and opening a two-stroke lead over Langham. On Sunday he picked up
where he left off, making birdies on three of his first four holes.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts left Milwaukee immediately after the tournament to hop a
plane for Scotland, where he'll compete in the British Open on
Thursday. Most of the top players got to St. Andrews a week
earlier, but Roberts doesn't intend to stop visiting the GMO any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that when next year comes around, I will be in
Milwaukee trying to shoot 25-under par,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sorenstam Wins Big Apple Classic  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) -- On Saturday, Annika Sorenstam was just
one of the regular folks in the golf world, hitting some balls at
the local driving range.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, she won the Big Apple Classic to take the LPGA Tour
lead with five victories and move into the top spot on the money
list.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder if anyone else who hit a bucket there the day before had
that good a finish to the weekend?
</P>
<P>
   When heavy morning rains made the course at Wykagyl Country Club
unplayable for Saturday's third round, Sorenstam decided to go to a
nearby public driving range and hit some balls to stay loose.
</P>
<P>
   She smiled and nodded when asked if she hit off the rubber mats
like everyone else. Then she laughed when asked if any of the
people hitting the balls with the red stripes recognized her.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not too many people bring a caddie and a tour bag to the
Cherry Lawn,'' she said of the driving range about 10 minutes from
the course.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam won for the second straight week with a closing
1-over-par 72 that gave her a 7-under 206 total and a one-shot
victory over Rosie Jones in the rain-shortened tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a typical round for Sorenstam as she had only two
birdies, both coming in the last four holes. But the second of
those came off a great second shot and gave her the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   On the 396-yard, par-4 17th, Sorenstam's drive found the left
rough. She was 132 yards away and there was a huge tree between her
and the green.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, with whom she was tied for the lead, put her second shot
from the fairway about 20 feet from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam came up with one of those shots people at the driving
range don't even try.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had the tree in front of me and the branches hanging down,
and it was wet,'' Sorenstam said. ''I know I can hit that shot but
getting exactly pin-high, you need a little luck and I had it
there.''
</P>
<P>
   After Jones just missed her putt, Sorenstam made hers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a great shot,'' Jones said of Sorenstam's second on 17.
''I was just happy to put a little pressure on her from where I
was. She only had had one choice, to go underneath, and she hit it
just absolutely perfect. She hit it just enough to get under that
tree, but with just enough speed to get up on the green. I just had
a feeling she was going to make that putt. I missed it, gave her
the line. She's that type of player.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones just missed a birdie putt on the par-5 18th and Sorenstam
made a 3-footer for par to win the tournament she also won in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am really overwhelmed especially. After I played the front
nine the way I did, I felt like going home. It wasn't going to be
my day,'' said Sorenstam who had three bogeys in a five-hole
stretch starting at No. 3. ''I just felt flat. I didn't have any
energy. Maybe I was too calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who also finished second in the tournament sponsored by
Japan Airlines in 1993, also had a 72.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam and Webb had been tied with four wins each this year.
Sorenstam has 23 career wins, all since 1995, and the first prize
of $135,000 moved her past Webb on the money list. Sorenstam has
won $985,635, while Webb, who had three 71s and finished out of the
top 10 for just the second time this year, earned $10,279 and
dropped to second with $963,742.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Finney, whose only tour win came in 1989, started the
final round with a one-shot lead over Sorenstam. She had a 75 and
finished third at 5-under 208. She had four bogeys in a five-hole
stretch starting at No. 7, but was still within one stroke of the
leaders until Sorenstam's birdie at 17.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Daniel and Ashli Bunch were both 5 under going to No. 16,
but Daniel bogeyed the par-3 and Bunch double-bogeyed it.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel, who won this tournament in 1994, closed with a 71 and
finished at 209 along with Moira Dunn (68) and Jackie
Gallagher-Smith (69).
</P>
<P>
   Bunch had a 74 and was at 211.
</P>
<P>
   Lorie Kane, who lost a five-hole playoff here last year to
Sherri Steinhauer, closed with a 68 and was at 1-under 212.
</P>
<P>
   Juli Inkster, who will defend her title at the U.S. Open this
week, was at 215 after a 72, while Steinhauer also closed with a 72
and finished at 4-over 217.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam, who won the Open in 1995 and '96, will have to be
considered the favorite this week at the Merit Club in
Libertyville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be as ready as I can be. The confidence is obviously
still there,'' she said. ''This was almost like a U.S. Open golf
course: fast greens, thick rough, long course, you name it. It's
great preparation for next week. To come off a win like this, I
cannot ask for anything more.''

<HEADLINE> 92 Russian Kids Contract Dysentery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Ninety-two children and five adults have come down
with dysentery at a Siberian summer camp where sanitary conditions
are poor, a news report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The dysentery likely spread from the camp's kitchen, which had
violated health and sanitary rules, Russia's ITAR-Tass news agency
reported. It said the General Prosecutor's office has opened an
investigation into the outbreak at the camp, located in Buryatia,
about 2,700 miles southeast of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Dysentery is an intestinal infection that spreads quickly when
water supplies are polluted. Symptoms include abdominal pain and
severe diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   The poor state of Russia's public health system since the fall
of the Soviet Union has contributed to the spread of diseases.
Dysentery outbreaks are reported frequently.

<HEADLINE> USDA Wants Imported Sheep Destroyed  </HEADLINE>
By WILSON RING
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST WARREN, Vt. (AP) -- The owners of three flocks of sheep
imported from Belgium to produce milk are losing their animals
because of the possibility they were infected with a sheep
equivalent of mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, officially known as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy or BSE, affected some 180,000 head of British cattle
and has been linked to a similar illness in humans, known as
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. About 50 people died in Britain after
apparently eating contaminated beef.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on four slaughtered sheep from a Greensboro farm found
evidence of disease in their brains that could indicate the
presence of BSE, U.S. Department of Agriculture officials said
Friday as they ordered the three flocks of 376 animals destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The results don't mean the animals definitely have the same
disease that caused the outbreak in Great Britain, but they could
have.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even the remotest possibility that it could be that, I think
that we have to take all precautions to protect the livestock
industry and subsequently the public health,'' said Linda Detwiler,
senior staff veterinarian for the USDA.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Faillace, who owns 120 of the animals, said the tests were
incomplete and his animals had shown no symptoms of BSE.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has never been a sheep in the whole world that has
gotten mad cow disease,'' said Faillace, of East Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that was true, although researchers have been
able to infect sheep with BSE in laboratories. In addition, sheep
are susceptible to scrapie, a disease similar to mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep, a breed called East Friesians, have been quarantined
since 1998, two years after the first of them arrived from Belgium.
However, the farmers have been allowed to sell cheese made from the
animals' milk.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Freeman, who owns a flock in Greensboro, said his
lawyer was looking into whether it would be possible to block the
seizure. ''I'm told the chances of blocking it are pretty slim,''
Houghton said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep came from an area of Belgium where BSE has been found.
They are the only such flocks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is spread when animals eat feed made from the brains
of infected animals, and the USDA said there was a possibility the
sheep in Vermont ate contaminated feed before they were imported.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials have said they would pay for
the sheep, but Faillace said they had not given him a price.
</P>
<P>
   Faillace, who holds a doctorate in animal physiology, and his
wife imported the sheep in hopes of establishing breeding stock for
the sheep dairy industry.
</P>
<P>
   He said the sheep milk was their only livelihood
</P>
<P>
   ''People really love our cheese,'' he said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly lower in early trading
Monday as investors pocketed some of the profits made during a
rally late last week in the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 30.05 at 10,782.70.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's

was down 18.37 at 4,227.81.
</P>

   Technology stocks made a resurgence last week following strong
second-quarter earnings reports from some industry bellwethers,

</P>
<P>
   ''More than anything else, what we're seeing is investors taking

<HEADLINE> Dennis Miller Serious About Football  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- All jokes aside, Dennis Miller is
serious about his new football role.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't want to convey I'm going to be the court jester
out there. If I see a chance for a humorous shot I'll take it, but
I'm there to talk about a football game,'' said the comedian, who
will join the broadcasting team of ABC's ''Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a former ''Saturday Night Live'' regular and the host of
his own HBO comedy show, is part of a drastic reworking of the
broadcast team that ABC Sports hopes will reverse a ratings
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Don Ohlmeyer, who picked the new crew, said Sunday that
Miller represents a different approach to sportscasting. ''Dennis
gives us much closer to a fan's point of view than has ever been on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   To get ready for his new role, Miller said he has been spending
time absorbing game stats and player histories. He said bringing a
comedian into the booth isn't as jarring as some observers have
made it out to be.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not like I'm on the medical channel ... I watch football
as much as anybody,'' he said.

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) -- Moby, the Grammy-nominated techno-musician,
says he might collaborate with Madonna some day -- just not now.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna had been interested in having him work with her on a
song for her upcoming album, ''Music.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moby, the 28-year-old great-great-grandnephew of ''Moby

he's not ready yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm on tour until December, which doesn't afford me the
opportunity to work with anyone.'' He said he's lukewarm on the
idea of collaborating in general.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I do have time to work on music, I'm kind of selfish, and
would rather work on my own stuff than someone else's,'' said Moby.
''She's a talented woman, and I like her a lot, and maybe at some
point we'll end up working together -- but if we don't, that's OK
too.''

stunned a Romanian audience by tearing up the conductor's score
after the orchestra twice fell out of step, according to a news

   The incident came at the end of a Friday concert when Spanish

</P>
<P>
   He claimed there was an error in the score in front of him, the

   Caballe then ripped up the score, and followed up by kissing
Collado on the cheek to show she had no hard feelings, Libertatea

and Collado, ''did not know what to make of it, and who was really

<HEADLINE> Philippines Garbage Death Toll Up  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Two foreigners believed to be German
aid workers were among nearly 200 people killed last week when a
mountain of waste collapsed on shanties next to Manila's biggest
garbage dump, the military said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The new information came as the official death toll in the
collapse grew to 196. Estimates of those still missing under the
tons of rotting, stinking garbage range from 140 to 500.
</P>
<P>
   The still-unidentified bodies of the foreigners were found in
the past week, said Maj. Valeriano Inocencio of the military's
Civil Relations Service, which is helping to search for victims. He
said residents described them as German nationals who were
sponsoring scholarships for children of poor families, but could
not identify them further.
</P>
<P>
   Inocencio said authorities interviewed at least one resident who
claimed to have guided the Germanse around the impoverished
squatters' community, called the Promised Land. And Greg Banacia, a
spokesman for the local government, said officials reported there
was at least ''one Caucasian, probably German, in the vicinity of
the July 10 tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lars Leymann, second secretary of the German Embassy in Manila,
said he was not aware of any missing Germans. Other embassy
officials were unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 18 more badly mangled bodies were pulled from the
mountain of garbage.
</P>
<P>
   At least 187 bodies have now been recovered since the trash
collapsed. In addition, nine people who were rescued earlier and
taken to hospitals have also died, Inocencio said. He said 61 of
the victims are still unidentified.
</P>
<P>
   Officials do not know how many people are still missing under
the tons of debris at the Payatas sump, part of Quezon City in
metropolitan Manila. ''People here come and go,'' Inocencio said.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents say up 500 people are still missing, while local
officials estimate the number at about 140.
</P>
<P>
   Inocencio said searchers have only been able to dig through
about one-fifth of an estimated 150 feet of garbage. He said the
searchers are being rotated every hour to prevent overexposure to
the stench and the harmful gases emitted by the decaying garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The Quezon City Disaster Operations Center reported that 2,760
people have been evacuated from the community, including many from
areas threatened by the possible collapse of another portion of the
garbage mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The Payatas dump, along with a former dump in Manila's Tondo
slum district called Smokey Mountain, long has symbolized the
wrenching poverty in the Philippines. On Saturday, residents of the
Payatas community announced they will file a class action suit
against the government, garbage contractors and local officials,
charging them with negligence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want justice for the victims,'' said human rights lawyer
Romeo Capulong, head of the Public Interest Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, garbage began to pile up on some Quezon City streets
after Payatas was closed to new dumping Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Manila is facing a growing garbage crisis. Surrounding towns
have refused to allow the construction of new dumps, and a Clean
Air Act passed last year forbids the use of garbage incinerators.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Celebrates Party Longevity  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Saddam Hussein celebrated his party's 32
years in power, saying in a speech Monday that Iraq has become a
vibrant country during his tenure and brushing off the nation's
current difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam said in a nationally televised address marking the July
17, 1968 revolution that brought his Baath party to power that he
had transformed Iraq from ''a wasteland ... with no agriculture''
into a successful country.
</P>
<P>
   He said the nation is on the verge of victory while ''evil ones
meet defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam made no mention of the U.N. trade sanctions which have
crippled the economy and driven millions of Iraqis into poverty.
The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
which led to the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions are not to be removed until U.N. inspectors verify
Iraq is rid of all weapons of mass destruction and the capability
to rebuild its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq and the United Nations could be headed for another flare-up
if Saddam resists U.N. plans to resume weapons inspections. The
inspectors pulled out of Iraq in late 1998 shortly before the
United States and Britain unleashed four days of punitive
airstrikes on Baghdad for allegedly failing to cooperate with the
inspectors.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Forget the government plots. Conspiracy
theorists have a more entertaining diversion this summer: Who wins
''Survivor''?
</P>
<P>
   There are almost as many theories as participants left on the
hit CBS show, with guessers citing computer codes, sophisticated
voice analyses and grainy photos in predicting who gets booted from
the island of Pulau Tiga.
</P>
<P>
   Bookmakers are urging true believers to back their theories with
cash.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest TV mystery since J.R. was shot on ''Dallas'' has set
off an obsessive search for clues reminiscent of when Beatles fans
played records backwards for supposed evidence of whether Paul
McCartney was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lot like the Kremlinologists of the Cold War days, who
would pore over photos from the Soviet Union to see who was in
favor with the politicians,'' said Paul Sims of Dallas, who runs a
Web site clearinghouse of ''Survivor'' rumors,
www.survivorsucks.com.
</P>
<P>
   The latest theory comes from a computer hacker who discovered
that CBS Web designers, in material supposedly unavailable to the
public, had placed a red X over pictures of all 16 contestants
except for one -- youth basketball coach Gervase Peterson. The X has
been used on the site to denote people voted off the island.
</P>
<P>
   Since this theory began to spread, more than half of the people
betting on an Internet site, wwwIntertops.com, have picked
Peterson, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a legitimate mistake that inadvertently revealed what
has been one of television's best-kept secrets?
</P>
<P>
   ''No comment,'' CBS spokeswoman Colleen Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Or is this simply a false lead posted by a mischievous CBS Web
worker who wanted to send people off the trail?
</P>
<P>
   ''No comment,'' Sullivan said again.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, of course, loves every minute of the speculation.
''Survivor'' drew nearly 25 million viewers last week and is the
unqualified TV sensation of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sims' site hasn't picked an ultimate winner, though it has
correctly predicted the last four people to be voted off the island
by their fellow castaways.
</P>
<P>
   Those picks were largely based on a picture of a tribal council
meeting that was flashed on the air, apparently inadvertently,
during the second week of the series. At a time 15 contestants were
still in the game, the photo showed a council meeting with only
nine participants.
</P>
<P>
   By figuring out who wasn't in the picture, Sims' Web site was
able to guess who would be the next people voted off.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean it was easy. A long debate in the
www.survivorsucks.com chat room -- complete with grainy photo
enlargements -- raged over whether one of the people in the picture
was Gervase or Gretchen Cody, the homemaker from Tennessee. Cody
was voted off the island last week.
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta-based security company, Protonesis, predicts Rudy
Boesch, the cranky retired Navy SEAL, will win. The company said
its pick was based on a sophisticated voice analysis of interviews
given by the show's producer and three contestants who have been
voted off.
</P>
<P>
   The system is supposedly able to tell what a person is thinking
while talking, and all signs pointed in Boesch's direction, said
Clay Fondren, shareholder in Protonesis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're staking our corporate necks on the line because if we're
wrong, then our credibility is gone,'' Fondren said. ''And we've
never been wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Intertop's odds have Rudy at 3-to-1. Rudy, Gervase and Richard
Hatch, the conniving corporate trainer, are the three favorites
with the same odds. A week ago, Intertop listed Hatch as the 5-to-2
favorite to win the million-dollar prize.
</P>
<P>
   The company has taken 2,400 bets on ''Survivor,'' spokesman Kyle
Fratini said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Ostrow, a television columnist at the Denver Post, used
reporter's intuition to predict that Greg Buis, the coconut-phone
talking Colorado resident, would win. She said it was because Buis
was the only contestant that CBS did not make available for
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   There are too many theories for Sims to keep track of.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've heard people standing on their heads and shouting at the
top of their lungs, 'It's Gretchen! It's Gretchen! It's
Gretchen!''' he said, ''and that turned out to be absolutely
false.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone is bound to be right. If the network can keep the
secret, it will be revealed on Aug. 23.

<HEADLINE> Blair Memo: Gov't Seen Out of Touch  </HEADLINE>
By IAN PHILLIPS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Downing Street launched an investigation Monday
into the leak of a damaging memo in which Prime Minister Tony Blair
expressed fear his government is seen as ''out of touch'' on crime,
defense and immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Party leader William Hague pounced on the
three-page memo -- intended to be read only by members of Blair's
inner circle -- as proof the Labor Party leader was ''rattled.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we know where all the spin and the gimmicks come from in
this government. It comes from the very top,'' Hague said. ''It
shows that the government gets very rattled that we are now setting
the agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The document, called ''Touchstone Issues,'' was drafted April
29, after a two-week period in which Hague grabbed the spotlight
with Tory initiatives to lock up bogus asylum-seekers and offer
better legal protection to people defending their families and
homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the memo, parts of which were published in both The Times and
The Sun newspapers Monday, Blair told his advisers that the
government was seen as soft on asylum and crime and not strong
enough in defending the nation's interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kosovo should have laid to rest any doubts about our strength
in defense. But all of these things add up to a sense that the
government -- and this even applies to me -- are somehow out of touch
with gut British instincts,'' Blair wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Blair also advised ministers that the government was in urgent
need of ''eye-catching initiatives'' and a stronger stand on issues
ranging from illegal immigration to family issues and crime,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should think now of an initiative, e.g. locking up street
muggers. Something tough, with immediate bite which sends a message
through the system,'' Blair wrote. ''This should be done soon and
I, personally, should be associated with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Downing Street confirmed Cabinet secretary Richard Wilson was
overseeing an inquiry into the leak.
</P>
<P>
   Among those sent the memo were Blair's official spokesman,
Alastair Campbell; chief of staff Jonathan Powell; senior adviser
David Miliband and Cabinet Office Minister Mo Mowlam.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Blair has trumpeted his government's economic
record and promised new money for health, education, policing and
transport.
</P>
<P>
   Those initiatives followed weeks of turmoil in which his
leadership abilities were questioned by a major fundraiser, he was
booed and heckled during a speech to the Women's Institute, and his
16-year-old son was arrested for being drunk in a public square.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, a father of four, said it frustrated him that his
personal values weren't better reflected.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister refused to comment on the memo Monday as he
arrived to deliver a speech in London on Monday to the American Bar
Association.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 26; Nasdaq Adds 38  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose modestly Monday as cautious
investors took few chances ahead of the release Tuesday of key
economic data used to gauge inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
25.73 at 10,838.48.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 6.33 at 1,516.31, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 37.76 at 4,283.94.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predicted mild trading while investors await for the
release Tuesday of the Consumer Price Index, which measures prices
paid by consumers and is used as a barometer for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Both major indexes rebounded from early losses, moving higher
once again on the strength of solid second-quarter earnings
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Internet software companies led the way on the Nasdaq.
VerticalNet rose $7.50 to $58.625, and Rambus shares were up $4.625
to $109.625.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said gains on the Nasdaq would likely be stronger if
not for profit-taking. The tech-heavy index surged last week
following strong second-quarter earnings reports from some industry
bellwethers, including Internet giant Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a typical summer Monday. More than anything else, what
we're seeing is investors taking a little bit off the table after
the strong run we saw in the latter part of last week,'' said Bill
Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in Darien, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Some of last week's high flyers fell on Monday. Ariba was down
87.50 cents to $123.688 and Amazon.com was down 75 cents to $41.75.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasm for biotechnology, health maintenance organizations
and drug stocks helped pull the Dow Jones index into positive
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were also mulling several high profile mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp., maker of Angel Soft and Sparkle paper
goods, is acquiring Fort James Corp. in a $7.5 billion merger that
would create the largest maker of tissue products in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific shares were down $2.75 to $25.875 in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange, while Fort James' stock rose $8.438 to
$33, also on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   And British food and drinks conglomerate Diageo PLC is selling
its U.S. food subsidiary Pillsbury, owner of the Green Giant frozen
vegetable and Haagen-Dazs ice cream brands, to General Mills for
$5.4 billion in stock and the assumption of $5.1 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo's American Depositary reciepts rose 62.50 cents to
$36.438 on the NYSE, and General Mills' shares fell $2.25 to
$34.063.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 606.36 million
shares, down from Friday's midafternoon pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.32 at 544.95.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Project Dogged by Corruption  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FENGDU, China (AP) -- The Mingshan Hotel is the house that
corruption built.
</P>
<P>
   Set on a verdant bluff above the murky Yangtze River, the
Mingshan's 120 rooms and four ballrooms were supposed to cater to a
fast-rising new town. Closed before it opened, the hotel is a
trophy in China's crusade to stop the misuse of money meant for the
relocation of 1 million-plus people forced to move for the world's
biggest dam.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is the latest headache for the communist government's
Three Gorges Dam, compounding criticisms about environmental
damage, waste and human rights and undermining public confidence in
the controversial mega-project.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting back, the government has waged a high-profile campaign
to shore up the dam's image. State media have exposed officials
pilfering resettlement money. Environmental regulators have
demanded clean up of the dangerously polluted Yangtze before the
dam's reservoir starts filling up in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the well-publicized bad news, the government shows no
sign of altering the project and construction continues on
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The damage control efforts have failed to impress the people
most affected by the project, much less its critics.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's so much corruption. Officials are peeling away the
resettlement funds, buying themselves things, playing around,''
said a Mr. Liu, sitting amid piled packets of dried noodles and
bags of sunflower seeds in his store in Fengdu, a town that will be
inundated and 30,000 of its residents relocated.
</P>
<P>
   Vocal detractors of the dam -- a band of engineers, scholars and
officials, most of them retired -- now pin their hopes on China's
reformist Premier Zhu Rongji. Since coming to power two years ago,
Zhu has ordered audits of relocation funds and demanded better
quality in resettlement programs and dam construction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're waiting for the crisis that will cause Zhu Rongji and
(President) Jiang Zemin to stop this process,'' said Dai Qing, a
journalist who has become the lead spokeswoman for the project's
critics.
</P>
<P>
   But while Zhu has displayed an interest in improving the
project, he has shown little tolerance for criticism. He personally
called Li Rui, a former minister of water resources, to demand that
the communist elder stop speaking out against the dam.
</P>
<P>
   The commission headed by Zhu that oversees the project dismissed
a petition by 53 noted engineers and academics asking for minor
changes, including keeping the reservoir at a lower level to cut
down on the numbers to be resettled and give time to see whether
pollution and silt clog the dam.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has dogged the project ever since the government
started planning nearly two decades ago. A fractious debate has
spawned contradictory claims on the consequences of building the
600-foot-high, 1.2-mile-wide dam, with a 350-mile-long reservoir
that will submerge two cities, 11 county seats and 114 towns.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of costs run from the government's $24 billion to
three times that figure, according to opponents. The dam will
displace either 1.3 million people, by government count, or 2
million, the opponents' number.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the dam will control chronic flooding that
as recently as 1998 killed 4,150 people and produce electricity to
feed a growing economy. Critics contend the project demonstrates a
communist love for unrestrained development and will ruin lives,
rare plants and ancient relics.
</P>
<P>
   On the front lines is Fengdu -- a Yangtze trading center for 500
years that now exudes an air of living on borrowed time. Buildings
look dilapidated, with peeling paint and crooked beams; signs
showing the planned reservoir's depth remind residents of their
move 2&AMP;frac12; years away.
</P>
<P>
   So does the work across the broad river on eight- to 10-story
high-rises, their concrete sides painted a fresh white or yellow,
in what will be called Fengdu New Town.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of us wants to move. But we have no choice,'' said Mr.
Liu, the sundries shop owner.
</P>
<P>
   At his store, complaints about resettlement seem brisker than
sales. Farmer Yang grouses the government has offered him too
little for his orange trees. Ms. Chen worries that business won't
be good: the town will be split, with those living on high ground
staying put while most others move to the new town.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling their skepticism has been rampant looting of
resettlement funds. By last year, graft in Fengdu was so blatant
that Beijing ordered a crackdown. Officials skimmed off $60,000
meant for a new museum to build a shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   Huang Faxiang, head of the local land management bureau,
pocketed $1.4 million, investing much of it in the Mingshan Hotel.
His boss, local Communist Party secretary Gao Rongmiao, misspent
$240,000 and took bonuses and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The Mingshan was shut late last year. Huang has been sentenced
to death, and Gao convicted but not yet sentenced. All told, 21
local officials have been punished.
</P>
<P>
   Fengdu was not alone. Government auditors have acknowledged the
embezzling of $52 million in resettlement money by local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Unacknowledged by the government so far are two cases reported
by the Hong Kong media involving two executives who stole or
squandered $133 million meant for the dam.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu and other Chinese leaders have so far pledged to cover the
losses and fund the project in full, according to Chinese and
foreign officials. But adding to the dam's already high costs could
dim the project's chances to repay its debts.
</P>
<P>
   In a bad sign, expected electricity shortages have not
materialized, with many smaller power plants coming on line.
Chongqing, the biggest city in the Three Gorges area, has refused
to buy electricity from another costly hydropower project, the
3,300-megawatt Ertan dam, adding to its annual losses.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticizes Iran Missile Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iran's weekend test of a medium-range missile
capable of reaching Israel or U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia is a
''serious threat to the region and to U.S. nonproliferation
interests,'' the State Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Philip Reeker said the United States has been engaged
in efforts for years to stop the transfer of missile technology and
equipment to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tests show Iran is continuing aggressive efforts to
develop missiles more capable than the existing 300- and
500-kilometer Scuds that they have, Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian television reported Saturday that the test firing of the
Shahab-3 missile ''is not in any way a threat to another country.''
</P>
<P>
   It said the test was in line with Iran's ''policy of
strengthening its defense capability on the basis of the principle
of deterrence.''

<HEADLINE> Berezovsky To Resign From Duma  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky, who claims to
have helped bring President Vladimir Putin to power, on Monday said
he would resign his seat in parliament to protest what he called
Putin's attempt to impose authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise announcement came as the two houses of parliament
finally agreed to compromise on Putin's plans to deprive regional
governors of their seats in the legislature's upper house. The
amended plan, which remains mostly intact, will be presented to the
lower house Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has said the plan is necessary to help rein in governors
who often run their regions as virtual autonomous entities.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, a member of the State Duma, the lower house, has
been among the most outspoken opponents of the plan. He also
accuses the Kremlin of leading a crackdown on businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to take part in the destruction of Russia,''
Berezovsky said at a news conference where he announced he would
relinquish his seat on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement raised wide speculation about what Berezovsky
could gain by resigning from parliament. Analysts agreed that he
was angling for some sort of advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This on its face doesn't make sense, but we know that
Berezovsky always has more than one model of developments in his
mind, with the best outcome for himself calculated,'' said Ariel
Cohen, a Russia specialist at the conservative Heritage Foundation
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One governor called the move ''a gesture of despair.'' But
Berezovsky suggested he was resigning to align himself with the
Russian businessmen whose holdings have been under investigation by
prosecutors and tax police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Berezovsky is demonstrating cooperative solidarity with other
businessmen,'' said Sergei Markov, director of the Institute of
Political Studies. ''He wants to be their leader, and to be their
leader he has to has to be one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Already investigators are looking into firms linked to
Berezovsky. They have opened a case into carmaker Avtovaz, to which
Berezovsky is believed to have ties. He also met with prosecutors
Friday to discuss fraud allegations concerning the Russian national
airline Aeroflot. Berezovsky, reportedly associated with Aeroflot
through holding companies, has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Berezovsky will give up his parliamentary immunity by
stepping down, he said the government could find a way to get
around it anyway. He is also not well-loved in parliament, which is
dominated by Putin supporters and has the power to revoke a
deputy's immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky is one of Russia's most visible self-styled
''oligarchs'' -- tycoons who claim to wield substantial political
influence. He has wide media holdings and has bragged of playing a
role in Putin's election this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky said Monday he would consolidate his media interests,
possibly to take a stance more critical to Putin. According to
Markov, he is also looking for the support and cooperation of the
regional governors who oppose Putin's plan to limit their powers.
</P>
<P>
   The Putin plan moved a step closer to becoming reality Monday:
The two houses of parliament came to a compromise on a key aspect
of the proposal that had threatened to bring them to a showdown,
Duma Deputy Oleg Morozov said after negotiations ended.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bills proposed by Putin, regional leaders who
currently make up the upper house will be removed and stripped of
legislative immunity from prosecution. The governors could also be
dismissed by the president if a court finds that they violated the
law.
</P>
<P>
   The bills call for governors to be replaced with appointed
legislators in the upper house, or Federation Council. The two
sides earlier agreed to postpone the changeover until 2002, but
couldn't agree on how to appoint and remove the legislators. The
governors wanted full control over the decisions.
</P>
<P>
   After talks that ran well into the evening, the two houses
agreed that governors will be able to pick whomever they wish
unless the regional legislatures block the appointment or dismissal
with a two-thirds vote, Morozov said in comments reported by the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   He said the amended plan would be presented to the Duma on
Tuesday. It would then be voted on by the Federation Council, which
overwhelmingly shot down the original.

<HEADLINE> Tourists To Get Gladiator's View  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Good news, gladiator fans. After 1,500 years, you
can now get the same center-stage view of the Colosseum the
celebrated fighters had moments before they met a bloody death or
gloried in victory.
</P>
<P>
   Italian culture authorities said Monday that tourists also will
soon be allowed under the arena, able to wander the spaces where
lions and hippopotami and elephants -- booty from the far reaches of
the Roman empire -- waited to be hoisted up in cages to take on the
gladiators.
</P>
<P>
   Culture Minister Giovanna Melandri inspected the arena's new
stage -- planks of laminated wood, dusted with sand -- on Monday. The
stage was built to take the place the area's floor, which was lost
over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Giving the Colosseum back its stage capped an eight-year
restoration of the monument, which included stripping the grime off
its massive stone and checking the stability of the arena, which
has been rocked by several earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators last took in entertainment in the arena in 523,
shortly before the Dark Ages pulled the plug on the good times.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the stage's return, Rome is putting on eight
performances this summer, starting Wednesday with the Greek
National Theater's rendition of Sophocles' ''Oedipus Rex.''
</P>
<P>
   With many of the arena's upper tiers in ruins, today's audience
will be limited. Where once 75,000 Romans cheered and VIPs gave the
thumbs-up or thumbs-down to the gladiators, now only 700 spectators
will be allowed, including standing-room.

<HEADLINE> Putin Travels to China  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin came to Beijing
on Monday for a summit with his Chinese counterpart during which
the two leaders are expected to reaffirm their opposition to
Washington's plans for a missile defense shield.
</P>
<P>
   The visit is the first stop on an Asian tour intended to
reassert Russia's global clout ahead of a meeting of the Group of
Eight industrialized powers in Okinawa, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and President Jiang Zemin were to sign a statement
condemning the proposed U.S. limited national missile defense,
which would require modifying the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders were also expected to take further steps to
bolster relations between the former communist rivals. They plan to
sign agreements on energy cooperation, including a feasibility
study for a gas pipeline from Russia into China. Bilateral
agreements on education and banking are also on the agenda for the
visit, which ends Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's plane, accented in the red, white and blue of the
Russian flag, landed at Beijing's Capital Airport shortly after
11:30 p.m. Monday. The Russian president descended a red carpet and
was greeted by Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Wenchang and
diplomats from the two sides before leaving in a motorcade of
limousines and buses. Putin made no statement to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was to be formally welcomed by Jiang at a military
ceremony near Tiananmen Square on Tuesday, followed by talks
expected to focus on increasing cooperation and the two nations'
opposition to U.S. development of a missile defense shield.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is expected to use his visits to Beijing and Pyongyang,
North Korea, to register once again Russia's deep concern over the
U.S. proposal to modify the ABM treaty to allow construction of a
limited national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Russia and China had a new kind of partnership that was
''nonaligned, non-confrontational, and non-threatening to any third
party.''
</P>
<P>
   After decades of tension that followed a falling-out in the late
1950s, relations between Moscow and China have been steadily
improving since the late 1980s. Since the 1991 Soviet collapse,
China has evolved into one of Russia's major trading partners and
is the top customer for Russia's ailing military industrial
complex. Beijing has purchased billions of dollars worth of jets,
missiles, submarines and destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Chinese leaders have spoken much about the
''strategic partnership'' between their countries and their efforts
to build a ''multipolar world'' -- a term intended to underline
their joint opposition to perceived U.S. global domination.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian media and analysts have warned the Kremlin against
using political and military ties with China as a tool to blackmail
the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need China and other Asian countries as economic partners
and additional markets, not an alternative to the West,'' political
analyst Yevgeny Verlin wrote in the business newspaper Vedomosti on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations have long discussed plans for building oil and
natural gas pipelines from Russia into China, but nothing has been
done so far. According to Russian media reports, Russia could
export up to $5 billion worth of energy resources a year to China
if the projects materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Officials traveling with Putin included Deputy Prime Minister
Ilya Klebanov, Defense Minister Gen. Igor Sergeyev and Minister of
Energy Alexander Gavrin, China's state-run Xinhua News Agency said.

<HEADLINE> New Web site offers a look at what didn't work  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCARSDALE, N.Y. (AP) - If at first you don't succeed, try
failuremag.com.
</P>
<P>
   A new Web magazine called Failure, launched Monday from a
three-story house in Scarsdale, gives visitors the chance to vote
on which dud tastes better - New Coke or Crystal Pepsi. There's an
article about Breakfast Mates, Kellogg's doomed attempt to sell
milk and cereal in one package. And at the Failure Store, anyone
brave enough to wear it can buy a T-shirt that literally says
''failure'' all over it.
</P>
<P>
   But founder Jason Zasky says Failure is all about success.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a site for losers,'' he said. ''We're not out to
judge people. We're not out to critique. We're not out to make
failure a personal issue. Actually, I think we write about winners
because those are the people out there taking risks, making things
happen, even if they fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Though generally entertaining, the online magazine
(http://www.failuremag.com) does tackles some weighty subjects. The
first issue has a long article, complete with maps, about ''the
most monumental failure of the past two millenniums'' - the defeat
of the Moors in 732 by Charlemagne's grandfather, Charles Martel.
Author Jack Stesney says that by blocking Arab influence, the
battle set civilization back 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   Another complex and perhaps controversial piece is promised for
a future issue: ''The Failure of Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also celebrates - if that's the word - ''This Day in
Failure.'' For July 17, it's the 1981 collapse of two walkways at a
Kansas City, Mo., hotel, which killed 114 people.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can help predict - sight unseen - which movies opening
each week will be turkeys. One of this week's titles seems all too
appropriate for failuremag.com: the Amy Heckerling film ''Loser.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the shorter, quick-hit content is a little more
lighthearted,'' Zasky says. ''But for the most part we're not even
talking about things that simply failed. In general, the issues are
not that black and white.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the people we write about are really successful and
failure is just a part of their life,'' he says. ''The biggest
failure is not trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Zasky, 30, and his partner, Kathleen Ervin, 34, expect to make a
success of Failure, and they're not talking about the kind of
Internet success that includes lots of financial losses and a
magical stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our approach is much more conservative than most startups,''
Zasky said. We're just hoping for a profitable business. I think we
can begin making a profit by year's end.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks his site is a natural for some advertisers, like
insurance companies - ''failure is kind of an inevitable thing for
them.'' He also believes the Failure Store will make money.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we tested the idea of the site, one of the things we
found was that with the younger portion of the audience, the
merchandise was really well-received. People were writing on the
surveys, 'Where can I get the hat? Where can I get the T-shirt?'
We're already getting orders this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Zasky seems unworried about running out of failures to write
about.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've already produced content that could last several
months,'' he said. ''We have so many ideas it's unbelievable.'' A
story will be coming soon about the $1 coin, he said. And the
new-products guy will be watching as Heinz brings green ketchup to
market.

<HEADLINE> El Al flight makes emergency landing in Canada due to disorderly passenger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - An El Al Israel Airlines flight from Newark,
N.J., to Tel Aviv made an emergency landing in Gander,
Newfoundland, Monday because a passenger was behaving in a
disorderly fashion, a spokesman for Israel's flag carrier said.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger, an Israeli who also has American citizenship,
shouted abuse at other passengers and smoked in the toilet, setting
off an alarm system, spokesman Nachman Kleiman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cabin staff and a doctor tried to calm the man down but without
success, Kleiman told The Associated Press. The captain decided to
land in Gander, rather than cross the Atlantic with the unruly
passenger on board.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger, whose name was not disclosed, was removed by
Canadian police.
</P>
<P>
   The diversion to Gander extended the flight by 2&AMP;frac12; hours.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was a Boeing MD-11 owned by the American World
Airways, operating for El Al with a World Airways flight crew and
El Al cabin crew, Kleiman said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Abolishes Religion from IDs  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK QUINN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The Greek government issued a decree
Monday formally abolishing religion from state identity cards -- a
decision the powerful Orthodox Church has said it will fight with
all means at its disposal.
</P>
<P>
   The decree, signed by Public Order Minister Mihalis Chrisohoidis
and Finance Minister Giorgos Dris, alters the identity cards that
all Greeks are required to have from age 14, eliminating the
''religion'' entry. It also abolishes fingerprints, occupation and
spouse's name, while it adds a blood type option as well as Latin
characters to allow easy travel in the 15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the religion change that has sparked a bitter fight
between the government and the Orthodox Church. The church, which
described the decree as ''autocratic,'' said Monday's signing was
''the implementation of an irrational, anti-religious plan with
complete contempt for the opinion of our faithful people.''
</P>
<P>
   About 97 percent of Greece's native-born population is baptized
into the Orthodox Church, which sees itself as the true guardian of
Greek identity and traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Many church leaders are deeply suspicious of the government's
drive to make Greece a modern European country. They see it as a
threat to the Christian Orthodox character of the nation and
possibly the stirrings of an eventual separation of church and
state in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Greece's church has said it will try to collect nearly 5 million
signatures in this country of 10.5 million people to force a
national referendum on the decree.
</P>
<P>
   The church asked all adult Greeks to declare their desire for a
referendum, even though the government has said it will not hold
one. Some of Christodoulos' senior clerics have expressed hope that
the government will collapse because of the campaign and a series
of mass rallies held last month.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Costas Simitis' Socialist government has said the
religion entry on the ID cards ran counter to Greece's
modernization efforts. It also says the church's signature campaign
could endanger the unity of the Greek people.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Makes Hospital Visit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Gen. Augusto Pinochet made a surprise
trip to a hospital Monday, two days before the start of hearings to
determine whether he will face trial on human rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   Amid tight security, the former dictator spent 75 minutes
undergoing routine dental treatment and unspecified laboratory
tests at the Santiago Military Hospital, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As he left, he smiled broadly while people gathered around him
and cheered. One woman kissed him on the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Courts opens hearings Wednesday on Pinochet's appeal
of a lower court ruling stripping him of his congressional
immunity. He faces 110 complaints of human rights abuses during his
1973-90 reign.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's lawyers are asking the court to have the 84-year-old
undergo medical tests before opening the hearings, saying his poor
health prevents him from properly organizing his defense. Lawyers
for the plaintiffs strongly oppose that request.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was released from home detention in London last March
after British doctors said he was physically and mentally unfit for
trial. Pinochet suffers from diabetes, has a pacemaker and
sustained three mild strokes in London.

<HEADLINE> Seven Hurt in West Bank Clash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) -- Seven houses were torched and seven
people injured in clashes between Palestinian residents of a West
Bank city and migrant Palestinian laborers from Gaza, officials
said Monday. Forty people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate cause of the clashes was not clear, but resentment
against laborers who have migrated through the recent opening of a
''safe passage'' between the two territories is widespread among
residents in the city of Qalqilya, in the central West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in Qalqilya began Sunday evening and lasted until
about 5 a.m. Monday. Seven people were hospitalized. Two of them
were seriously injured, one with a stab wound in the stomach, the
other with a back injury, a hospital official said.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the burned houses had been rented by the laborers. The
seventh was the home of a local resident, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, about 200 laborers, virtually the entire migrant
labor force, sought refuge in a police station.
</P>
<P>
   Long-time residents blamed them for the rioting.
</P>
<P>
   ''They steal clothes from the clothes lines,'' said Mohammed
Yassin, 30, who owns a minimarket. ''They subject our girls to
sexual harassment in the street and if you try to stop them the
others gang up on you.''
</P>
<P>
   About 400 police were rushed in from Nablus and other West Bank
cities to separate the two sides. Some of the 40 people arrested --
some migrants and some local residents -- will be prosecuted, said
the governor of Qalqilya, Col. Mustapha al-Malki.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected demands from local residents that all the laborers,
or at least the unmarried ones, be sent back to Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The migrants began arriving beginning in October 1999, when
Israel opened the route known as the ''safe passage'' from the Gaza
Strip to the West Bank. They were attracted by higher living
standards and lower unemployment in the West Bank, and the
proximity of the Israeli job market.

<HEADLINE> Police say neighbor blackmailed man over frozen mother's remains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FORT PLAIN, N.Y., (AP) - A 51-year-old man was charged with
grand larceny and the extortion of almost $20,000 from his
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   According to state police, Walter Aker discovered that George
McGovern had dismembered his mother soon after she died last year.
</P>
<P>
   It began when a neighbor was cleaning George's duplex last week
and found his 82-year-old mother's dismembered remains in a
chest-type freezer. Louise McGovern was last seen about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neighbors were told by Mr. McGovern that his mother had been
placed in a nursing home due to her declining health,'' police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aker allegedly confronted McGovern, 54, who died of a heart
attack last week, and demanded money over the course of a year in
exchange for his silence.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Aker also had McGovern make him the beneficiary of
his will.
</P>
<P>
   Aker has been arraigned and is being held in Montgomery County
Jail on $10,000 bail. His court date has been set for July 31.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A team of French researchers may have
uncovered a clue to why space travel affects the human body.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of astronauts have shown that periods of weightlessness
reduce the body's bone mass, depress the immune system and lead to
changes usually associated with aging. The causes are not fully
understood but are thought to originate at the cellular level.

<P>
   The new French study reports that gravity is necessary for
microtubules in developing cells to become organized. These tiny
tubes form a structure called the cytoskeleton, which helps cells
retain their shape by organizing in either parallel or circular
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, published in Tuesday's issue of Proceedings of
the National Academy of Science, found that cells that began to
develop in the weightlessness of space did not organize the
microtubules even after return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Organization was normal, however, in companion sets of cells
sent up in the European Space Agency rocket that were spun in a
centrifuge during their first 13 minutes of development.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gravity can thus intervene in a fundamental cellular process
and will indirectly affect other cellular processes that in their
turn depend on microtubule self-organization,'' reported the team,
led by Cyril Papaseit of the Department of Molecular and Structural
Biology of the French Atomic Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gravity direction ... leads to the emergence of form and
pattern,'' the researchers said. ''Such processes may have played a
role in the development of life on Earth.''

<HEADLINE> Court cuts time for murderer's drug conviction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - After a state appeals court ruled that a
10-year sentence imposed on a Union County man for possessing
cocaine was excessive, despite his prior murder conviction, the
trial judge imposed the same sentence again, offering more reasons
the second time.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge was wrong again, the appeals court ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sentence once said to 'shock our conscience' cannot become
less shocking merely because better or more thorough reasons were
stated to support it,'' the unanimous appeals court decision reads.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Davis didn't deserve the 10 years, with five to be served
before his first chance at parole, the court said. Instead it cut
his time to seven years and the parole ineligibility to 3&AMP;frac12; years.
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge failed to fully consider Davis' record when
crafting the penalty, the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Davis was subject to an extended prison term as
a repeat offender if he committed a crime within 10 years of his
first conviction. The cocaine charge came just three months short
of the end of the 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge should have considered that, as well as the fact
that Davis' second conviction was simply for drug possession, the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the sentencing judge failed to pay appropriate
regard to the specific offense involved once he determined to
impose an extended term,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The five-page opinion did not name the judge whose sentence the
appellate panel twice reversed. Lower court judges are rarely named
in appellate opinions, regardless of the decision, court
spokeswoman Winnie Comfort said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's typically not done,'' Comfort said.
</P>
<P>
   Details on Davis' prior crime and his hometown were not
immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Sunken replica ship raised in Buffalo Harbor  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - The tall ship Sea Lion was again floating
in Buffalo Harbor Monday, after spending a year and a half
underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Following months of planning and grueling preliminary work,
divers worked from early afternoon until midnight Sunday to raise
the replica 16th Century merchant ship, which sank after taking on
water during severe winter weather in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an ugly thing and a beautiful thing,'' salvage organizer
Sam Genco said of the waterlogged vessel, which is largely intact
but in need of extensive cosmetic repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Downey of the Buffalo Maritime Society called the feat
''miraculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My hat's off to those guys, I never thought they could do
it,'' he said. ''There were 20,000 pounds of ballast in that
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   The ballast - metal used to stabilize the ship - was removed
during some of the 23 preliminary dives over the past year. That
lightened the 63-foot vessel enough to raise it using a winch and
compressed air.
</P>
<P>
   With visibility near zero, ''it was like working in a cup of
coffee,'' Genco said of the ballast work, which began last fall.
''Everything we did, we did by feel.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the salvagers set a deliberately slow pace as they
lifted the ship and pumped out the water.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want it to come up all of the sudden, it's too
unpredictable,'' Genco said. ''You want to do it in a controlled
fashion so it doesn't get away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Genco said the mostly oak hull seemed to hold up in the water
but the less sturdy pine planking above the main deck took a
beating. Also, a 20-foot raised piece at the stern separated either
during or after the sinking and will have to be reattached.
</P>
<P>
   Built in Chautauqua County, the ship initially was displayed as
a tourist attraction on Chautauqua Lake but consistently lost
money. In 1992, Chautauqua Lake Historic Vessels sold it for $1 to
Downey, who brought it to the Buffalo Harbor and used it for tours.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Lion sank overnight last winter while docked at the
harbor. It apparently became hung up on some ice in a way that
allowed it to fill with water. Raising it again was strictly a
volunteer undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Future plans include towing the ship back to Chautauqua County,
to Barcelona Harbor where it would be again displayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just one hump, one very large hump, we got over,''
Genco said. ''Now we've got to clean it up and stabilize it and
figure out how to tow it back to Barcelona and arrange to restore
it.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Says Never Told of Time Frame  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge accused the White House on
Monday of keeping him in the dark about how long it would take to
restore thousands of lost Clinton administration e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said the White House never
told him that revised estimates for the project were vastly
different from what administration lawyers had reported in a
lawsuit in the case.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials earlier this year said thousands of
e-mails, including some from Vice President Al Gore's office, were
not properly archived. As a result, the messages were never
reviewed by White House lawyers to determine if they should be
turned over to investigators under subpoena in cases ranging from
the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Whitewater to campaign fund
raising.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth, who is holding hearings to determine how to retrieve
the messages and get them to investigators, has heard testimony
since Thursday from a handful of current and former White House
computer technicians.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he angrily criticized the administration for failing
to notify him earlier that a series of unsuccessful computer tests
in the project have delayed it, resulting in estimates that range
from a few months to several years.
</P>
<P>
   ''You weren't going to admit that until it was drug out of you
in this hearing,'' Lamberth, a native Texan, told Justice
Department lawyer James Gilligan, who is arguing the case on behalf
of the White House. Gilligan is representing the Executive Office
of the President in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth also complained that the White House couldn't give him
a firm figure on the number of computer backup tapes that must be
searched for missing e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   ''How does the number keep growing every day?'' he asked
Gilligan.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan replied that administration officials didn't mean to
mislead the judge, but said supervisors were struggling to manage
the complex e-mail case.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch, the conservative group that has brought the $90
million class action lawsuit, has accused the White House of
dragging its feet to delay retrieval of the messages until after
the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The group also maintains that the White House intentionally
hired consultants with little expertise in restoring the data to
delay the investigation. Judicial Watch has even offered to conduct
a test of a computer system that wasn't chosen, maintaining that it
would be 10 times faster than the one the government is using.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth didn't immediately rule on the proposal. He planned to
hear more testimony later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The White House last April told the judge it could deliver
results within 170 days -- a figure quoted at the time by White
House counsel Beth Nolan at a hearing of the House Government
Reform Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, technicians testified, they have tested three
computer systems, all of which failed to produce acceptable
results. A fourth system was approved only last Thursday, and
workers have begun using it to copy backup tapes of the e-mails. So
far, the new system has produced two unacceptable copies and two
more that are being reviewed by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth, a Reagan appointee, could appoint a special master to
oversee production of the e-mails or order another company to
perform the reconstruction. He also could let the White House
proceed with the job.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers seek to regulate power plant construction  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE COLLINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Lawmakers are seeking more authority for
the state to inspect power plants as they are built, a response to
the deaths of two workers at a Milford construction site in
February.
</P>
<P>
   The Task Force on Inspections of Power Plants held its first
meeting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. James A. Amann, D-Milford, a task force member, said
officials need to close a loophole in the 1998 electric
deregulation law that took inspection power away from the
Department of Public Utility Control.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't realize that we took that authority away,'' Amann
said. ''We do not have guidelines in the state of Connecticut for
these huge power plants being built. We hope our efforts ensure
safer plants in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   DPUC Commissioner Donald W. Downes said about five power plants
are planned or currently under construction. He said the DPUC
wasn't prepared for the ''onslaught'' of new plants and said his
agency has no employees with the expertise to inspect the plants.
Very few people in the world have such expertise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amann said local building inspectors have expressed concern
about the lack of guidelines for inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing regulations the DPUC only has the authority to
inspect gas pipelines during construction; the Department of Public
Safety has the power to inspect boilers.
</P>
<P>
   Downes said there is extensive oversight by insurance companies
of the construction and operation of power plants, in efforts to
decrease liability.
</P>
<P>
   A steel structure designed to house a steam generator collapsed
in Milford in February, killing boilermakers Kevin Winslow, 43, of
Newington, and Wayne Most, 38, of West Hartford, and injuring two
others.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has
proposed a $7,000 fine against the construction company, Kansas
City, Mo.-based Black &AMP; Veatch.
</P>
<P>
   Amann questioned the amount of the fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people die in an accident that severe ... that fine just
doesn't seem to be right in my mind,'' Amann said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed fine is the maximum under federal law. If OSHA had
found that the construction company's actions were willful, the
maximum fine could have been $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   The company paid a $4,038 fine last year for an accident at a
power plant construction site in Agawam, Mass., in which a worker
lost part of his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Black &AMP; Veatch did not have a representative at Monday's
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   John Allen, a Black &AMP; Veatch spokesman, said he would not
comment on the task force because he did not know the details of
its work. He also declined comment on the $7,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Amann said the task force will invite Massachusetts state
officials to future meetings to explain how they regulate power
plant construction sites. The task force also will invite OSHA
officials, insurance company workers, local building inspectors and
power plant leaders, Amann said.
</P>
<P>
   The next task force meeting is slated for next month. The date,
time and location have yet to be announced.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leaving Mideast Summit Wed.  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton turned up the heat on his
lagging Mideast peace partners, telling them he intends to depart
for Japan as scheduled on Wednesday with an agreement concluded by
then, his spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect when the president leaves the parties will have
wrapped up their business,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They all know the work they have to do,'' he said. ''They know
the opportunity that faces them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is due to leave Wednesday morning for an eight-nation
economic summit in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Important issues await Clinton and the other leaders of the
world's richest nations, including debt relief for poor countries
and the spread of AIDS, Lockhart said, adding that Clinton also
planned to meet there with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been meeting for a week with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the seclusion of
the presidential retreat, Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had expressed hope before he brought Barak and Arafat
together that he would be able to conclude a settlement within the
time allotted.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are still going through the issues,'' Lockhart said of
two sets of talks going on -- one involving senior U.S., Israeli and
Palestinian officials at the retreat and the other among experts on
water problems, economics and civil affairs meeting at nearby
Emmitsburg, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parties understand the schedule here,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Levy ordered to employ only certified teachers at poor schools  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - State education commissioner Richard Mills
ordered the New York City Board of Education on Monday to stop
employing uncertified teachers in the city's poorly performing
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The order comes after months of discussion between Mills and New
York City Schools Chancellor Harold Levy, who has said he was
having difficulty staffing those schools with certified teachers as
required by the Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   State education officials estimate there are at least 400
uncertified teachers employed at the 97 New York City schools on
the state's ''registration review'' list of poorly performing
schools. The Board of Regents began requiring that newly-hired
teachers at those schools under special watch be certified in
September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Mills has refused to issue temporary licenses for those new
teachers. His order Monday means those teachers must have state
certification if they are to keep their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very straightforward issue,'' Mills said. ''The
children in the poorest performing schools can't be saddled with
the additional burden of a teacher who is not qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   Margie Seinberg, a spokeswoman for the city board, would not say
whether the order would be immediately followed. She characterized
the order as part of a ''long-term conversation'' between Mills and
Levy that is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Mills asked for written assurances from Levy
that he would have city schools in compliance by Aug. 1. Levy wrote
back to Mills on April 3 that the chances of that were ''slim.''
</P>
<P>
   In the April letter, Levy said part of the difficulty came
because the city board ''pays less than the market wage rate that
is necessary in this part of the state to attract an adequate pool
of certified candidates.'' He also noted that the city will have to
hire a large number of teachers in the next three years and that
new recruitment efforts have not been around long enough to meet
the Aug. 1 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said in a telephone interview that steps have been taken
to make recruitment easier, including the commitment of more money.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Regents instituted the certification requirements
for registration review schools as part of a larger push to
increase teacher qualifications statewide. State certification of
all public school teachers in New York state will be required in
February 2003.

	   NEW YORK (AP) - A police officer was critically injured Monday
when he crashed his unmarked car into a utility pole while chasing
a motorcycle with stolen plates on Staten Island, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old officer, whose name was being withheld pending
notification of his family, was rushed to St. Vincent's Hospital on
Staten Island, where a team of trauma doctors was tending to him

are also police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the accident were sketchy. It occurred around 1:20
p.m. at the intersection of Gulf and Forest avenues in an isolated
section of Staten Island. The officer, who was in uniform, had
apparently been chasing the motorcycle when he crashed. Police were
searching for the motorcycle's driver. The injured officer was

<HEADLINE> Bosnians Remember Slain Journalist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Bosnians and international
officials have paid tribute to Associated Press Television News
cameraman Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora, who reported the sufferings of
the Bosnian conflict before his death in an ambush in Sierra Leone
in May.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora, 32, began his journalistic career in
Sarajevo in 1993 during the height of the conflict, which ended
with the Dayton peace agreement two years later. His career also
took him to Chechnya, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Congo and other war
zones before he was killed May 24 in an ambush along with Reuters
correspondent Kurt Schork.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100 mourners, including 12 members of his family,
co-workers from The Associated Press, Bosnian government officials,
U.N. mission chief Jacques Klein, and a senior aid official, Ralph
Johnson of the United States, gathered Sunday in Sarajevo's Roman
Catholic cathedral for a memorial Mass celebrated by the Rev. Ivo
Tomasevic and a Spanish military priest, the Rev. Miguel Angel
Valganon.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the congregation wept as a clerical assistant told them
that Gil Moreno de Mora ''shared the suffering of the Bosnian
people'' during the 3&AMP;frac12;-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, members of the family, including his mother,
traveled to the southern city of Mostar, where Gil Moreno de Mora
was based during some of the bloodiest fighting between Bosnian
Muslims and Bosnian Croats.
</P>
<P>
   In Mostar, the family visited in the home of Safet Sestic, a
Bosnian Muslim who was Miguel's landlord for almost a year. Sestic
wept as he told the family that throughout the fighting, Gil Moreno
de Mora would bring food and medicine to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ''He shared everything with us,'' Sestic said. ''He was a great
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Bosnian government awarded posthumous Bosnian
citizenship to both Gil Moreno de Mora and Schork, who also
reported from Sarajevo during the war.

<HEADLINE> Former federal prosecutor sentenced to two years for racketeering  </HEADLINE>
By HOLLY RAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - A former federal prosecutor who helped run
a racketeering ring that swindled millions of dollars from its
victims was sentenced Monday to two years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   John Field III, 62, served as U.S. attorney in Charleston,
W.Va., from 1972 to 1977 and later was director of enforcement for
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He was arrested in
1996 and pleaded guilty two years later to racketeering and money
laundering in New Hampshire and to a conspiracy charge in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is perhaps most regrettable is that the defendant was
once a U.S. attorney appointed to protect the public from the very
types of crimes which he committed,'' said Michael Gunnison,
assistant U.S. attorney for New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire authorities began investigating Field in 1994 when
he represented Norman Brooks, a Bedford telemarketer accused of
selling fraudulent investments in what authorities called a
telemarketing ''boiler room.''
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest, Field admitted advising telemarketers how to
avoid scrutiny from federal regulators, helping them market
worthless partnerships in ''wireless cable'' ventures and running
his own sales rooms out of his law offices in McLean, Va. He also
admitted laundering money for telemarketing clients whose assets
were about to be seized.
</P>
<P>
   ''It began with commodity fraud in boiler rooms operated mostly
out of Florida and California, but in the early 1990s, it took a
turn when he and other members of this criminal enterprise began
developing new investment products,'' Gunnison said. ''They
operated almost like franchises.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Field has cooperated with authorities in an
investigation that has resulted in raids at more than a dozen
boiler rooms in California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York
and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an investigation called ''Operation Busysignal,''
telemarketers who agreed to market fraudulent investment products
were caught after retired law enforcement agents posing as victims
recorded their sales pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal sentencing guidelines, Field faced a minimum of
less than six years in prison and a maximum of more than seven
years. But U.S. District Judge Joseph DiClerico agreed with
prosecutors who said Field's cooperation warranted a lesser
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''He made extraordinary efforts to prevent the same kind of
injuries from happening to countless other people,'' Gunnison said.
</P>
<P>
   Field's cooperation has helped prosecutors convict 18 others,
including Marcus Dalton, a New Jersey man known as ''The Grifter''
who pleaded guilty to federal racketeering charges and assisted
investigators.

<HEADLINE> Judge weighs whether Cayugas deserve interest on jury award  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - From the outset of a 1789 land deal, the
Cayuga Indian Nation has complained of being cheated by New York,
an anthropologist testified Monday in the start of a trial that
will determine whether the tribe gets interest on its $37 million
land claim award.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Peter Whiteley, an expert in America's indigenous
societies from Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y., was the
first witness called as the Cayugas attempt to convince U.S.
District Judge Neal McCurn to increase their $36.9 million land
claim award.
</P>
<P>
   ''The jury reached a ridiculously low figure. We have faith
Judge McCurn will fairly adjust that amount to reflect what the
loss of this land truly has meant to the Cayugas over 200 years,''
Martin Gold, one of the tribe's attorneys, said as he headed into
the courtroom for the start of the non-jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn will hear from as many as 13 witnesses as he decides
whether to increase the Cayuga's award. The trial is expected to
last at least four weeks, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are urging that it's adequate,'' said the state's lead
attorney, Dave Roberts. ''Or if a judgment is granted ... that the
calculation of that amount should be very conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury in February awarded the Cayugas $36.9 million in damages
for the loss of 64,027 acres of ancestral homelands in Cayuga and
Seneca counties. McCurn ruled in 1994 that New York illegally
acquired the land in 1795 and 1807 by purchasing it from the
Cayugas without the federal government's required approval.
</P>
<P>
   A state economist will testify that the Cayugas are not entitled
to any interest. The Cayugas' economist will say that interest
should be $1.7 billion, while a Justice Department expert places
interest at between $500 million and $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteley started the trial with a history for McCurn, beginning
in 1763 as he described how the Cayugas lost their land.
</P>
<P>
   Citing from historical documents, Whiteley explained that New
York officials, led by Gov. DeWitt Clinton, entered into treaties
with a minority faction of Cayugas.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteley said those records showed that the minority faction
wanted to consult with the tribe's majority. The professor noted
that Iroquois custom requires tribal consensus for making decisions
and that land is regarded as belonging to the community not to
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   However, Whiteley said the state enacted the treaty as final
without waiting for the minority Cayugas. Historical documents
suggest that state did this knowing it could split the tribe, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1789 treaty took life, the Cayugas almost immediately
began complaining that New York had ''cheated'' the tribe on how
much reservation land it had promised. Instead of ''three miles
wide all around Cayuga Lake,'' the tribe was given far less as New
York used the land as part of the Military Tract, Whiteley said.
</P>
<P>
   New York quickly subdivided the Military Tract for colonial
soldiers as their compensation for fighting for America's
independence even though the 1789 treaty provided that New York
would never be sold or leased to settlers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cayugas complained directly to Clinton, but he did little or
nothing, Whiteley testified.

<HEADLINE> New trial ordered when juror sees defendant in handcuffs  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - No one knows just what Juror Number 12 saw,
but his glimpse of a defendant in handcuffs is enough to order a
mistrial, an appeals court ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The court threw out Matthew Pugh's robbery conviction and his
12-year prison sentence and ordered a new trial for the Monmouth
County man.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Pugh leaving the courtroom in handcuffs is so
prejudicial a new jury must hear his case, the court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ''The inference is that he is dangerous, can't be trusted even
in a public place, a courtroom, sitting next to his lawyer,'' said
Dale Jones, a deputy state public defender.
</P>
<P>
   Police charged Pugh with robbery on April 1, 1998, after a $300
theft from a video arcade at the Seaview Square Mall in Ocean
Township.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh later admitted to the theft but denied that he scuffled
with security guards, one who cut his finger.
</P>
<P>
   ''Observing defendant in handcuffs and in the custody of
sheriff's officers had the clear capacity to convince the juror
that the defendant was capable of committing bodily injury,'' the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate panel's unanimous opinion continues the practice
in which trial judges go to great lengths to hide from juries the
fact that a defendant is in custody at the time of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   And the decision comes five days after prosecutors and defense
attorneys agreed to a deal in which Ambrose Harris would have his
feet shackled but not his hands during his trial on charges that he
killed a fellow death row inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the jury began deliberations after Pugh's three-day
trial in November 1998, the juror wandered back into the courtroom
looking for pencils, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   A sheriff's officer had been leading Pugh out of the court room,
but the prosecutor and defense attorney disagreed over how much the
juror saw.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Patricia Cleary did not question the juror.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate panel said the juror should have been interviewed,
and the entire jury might have needed instructions from Cleary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Failure to follow these procedures resulted in the distinct
possibility that the jury was left with one juror who had observed
defendant in handcuffs and in custody, and who consequently may
have convinced a prejudice,'' the appellate panel wrote.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey courts have routinely forbidden defendants to even
wear prison outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We maintain wardrobes in our regional offices for defendants
to wear at trial,'' Jones said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 8; Nasdaq Gains 34  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mixed Monday in listless trading
as cautious investors took few chances ahead of the release Tuesday
of key economic data used to gauge inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 8.48 at 10,804.27,
according to preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators closed higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index closed up 0.51 at 1,510.49, and the Nasdaq composite
index was up 28.49 at 4,274.67.
</P>
<P>
   The markets lacked a clear direction while investors awaited the
release Tuesday of the Consumer Price Index, which measures prices
paid by consumers and is used as a barometer for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan will
be testifying before a Senate committee on Thursday, and investors
will be dissecting his comments for clues on the direction of
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Stock Market rebounded from early losses, moving
higher on optimism that last week's string of strong second-quarter
earnings reports will extend into this week. Among the industry
bellwethers scheduled to report earnings later this week are
Microsoft and chip maker Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Qualcomm, also scheduled to release earnings this
week, soared Monday, rising $6.75 to $69.813 and helping to keep
the Nasdaq in positive territory. The stock surged after Japan and
Europe upheld three of the wireless telecommunications company's
patents.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Internet companies also fared well. VerticalNet
rose $10.922 to $62.047, and Rambus shares were up $3.50 to
$108.50.
</P>
<P>
   Gains on the Nasdaq would have been stronger if not for
profit-taking. The tech-heavy index surged last week following
strong second-quarter earnings reports from some closely watched
companies, including Internet giant Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a typical summer Monday -- not a lot of activity. More
than anything else, what we're seeing is investors taking a little
bit off the table after the strong run we saw in the latter part of
last week,'' said Bill Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor
Fitzgerald in Darien, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Some of last week's high flyers fell on Monday. Ariba was down
$1.813 to $122.75 and Amazon.com was down $1.375 to $41.125.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were also mulling several high profile mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific, maker of Angel Soft and Sparkle paper goods, is
acquiring Fort James in a $7.7 billion merger that would create the
largest maker of tissue products in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific shares were down $2.25 to $26.375 in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange, while Fort James' stock rose $8.437 to
$33, also on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   And British food and drinks conglomerate Diageo PLC is selling
its U.S. food subsidiary Pillsbury, owner of the Green Giant frozen
vegetable and Haagen-Dazs ice cream brands, to General Mills for $5
billion in stock and the assumption of $5.1 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo's American Depositary receipts rose 62.50 cents to
$36.438 on the NYSE, and General Mills' shares fell $2.688 to
$33.625.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 900.37 million
shares, down from 947. 16 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.54 at 545.17.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.84 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 1.53 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.77 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.74 percent.

<HEADLINE> Judge dismisses discrimination lawsuit filed by students  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A federal judge dismissed a race
discrimination lawsuit brought by nine Chinese and
African-Americans who claimed they were thrown out of a Denny's
restaurant and beaten by white customers while security guards
watched.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Frederick Scullin said the former students
failed to show they were denied seating or security services in
dismissing the 1997 lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the U.S. Justice Department rejected the group's
appeal to bring federal charges against the restaurant and those
involved after determining there was no evidence to support their
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still feel that there are facts in dispute here and that
this case should go to the jury,'' said Ken Kimerling, a spokesman
for the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, which
represented the students.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are probably going to appeal. We have to talk it over with
everyone, but that's our inclination,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Scullin filed his decision Thursday, lawyers just
received notice Monday, he said. If appealed, the case would go the
2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were confident that when all the facts were presented,
Denny's would be vindicated,'' said James B. Adamson, Denny's
president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Denny's parent company, Advantica Restaurant Group in
Spartanburg, S.C., has nearly 1,800 company and franchise
restaurants worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have worked very hard to create an inclusive organization
that embraces diversity in every aspect of our business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The former students claimed that the group was racially
discriminated against at a suburban Syracuse Denny's on April 11,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The group - seven Chinese and two African-Americans - said they
were denied service while other customers were seated ahead of
them, then were assaulted in the restaurant's parking lot by a
group of white patrons as two security guards watched.
</P>
<P>
   The security guards were off-duty deputies so the lawsuit also
named Onondaga County as a defendant, contending the county was
negligent for not properly training the deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Local prosecutors initially investigated the case but refused to
file criminal charges. Instead, District Attorney William
Fitzpatrick accused the students of being drunk, disorderly and
''orchestrating'' their claim, knowing full well Denny's legal
history regarding discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Denny's settled a $46 million class-action lawsuit
brought by black Secret Service agents and California students who
claimed discrimination in separate incidents. As part of the
settlement, Denny's operates under the watch of a federal civil
rights monitor from the justice department. However, its problems
have continued with recent incidents arising in Maryland, Florida
and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   According to restaurant employees and witnesses, the group
became rude and rowdy when they could not be immediately seated
together in the busy restaurant, which was teeming with an early
morning breakfast crowd heading home from the bars. The group was
asked to leave and then started a fight in the parking lot,
according to the prosecutor's report.
</P>
<P>
   The students, most of them attending Syracuse University, left
before police arrived. They did not seek medical treatment or
report the fight until after they had gathered at one of the
students' apartment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Denny's Inc. maintained it was not responsible for what happened
at the Syracuse restaurant because the restaurants were franchised
to an independent company, NDI Foods Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse-based NDI Foods has since entered bankruptcy
proceedings and turned its seven upstate New York Denny's
franchises back over to Denny's parent company. NDI also denied
that any discrimination occurred.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Report Confirms Lending  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Democratic lawmakers
said a new Federal Reserve report confirms the value of community
lending laws for banks, long a topic of partisan wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   Sent to Congress on Monday and laced with caveats, the Fed
report indicates that loans made under a 1977 federal law generally
are profitable for banks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in a statement issued from Camp David that the
report ''confirms that these loans are profitable and bring other
benefits to banks as well.'' Partly because of the 1977 law, he
said, ''Many banks and thrifts have shown commitment and innovation
in putting capital into the hands of individuals and into the
communities that need it most.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was ''deeply committed'' to keeping the law
strong and effective to help people ''not fully participating in
our nation's prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, an
outspoken critic of the law, said the report shows that loans under
the law are ''significantly less profitable than ordinary
lending.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said the survey shows that the Community Reinvestment Act,
which requires banks to make loans in low-income and minority areas
in which they operate, has created riskier loans with lower
profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed report says that lending under the law, known as CRA,
''can potentially lead to new and profitable business opportunities
for banking institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   It says ''virtually all'' of the 143 large U.S. banks and
savings associations responding to the survey reported that such
lending ''has led to new customers and additional loans.'' About
two-thirds of the responding banks also reported other benefits,
such as promoting a positive image in the community.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed cautioned that its survey had a limited scope and didn't
assess the CRA's effect on communities. In addition, it said, the
small sample size ''leaves some statistics vulnerable to extreme
values.''
</P>
<P>
   The central bank mailed out questionnaires on Jan. 21 to the 500
largest retail banks and savings associations. Participation was
voluntary; 114 banks and 29 thrifts responded -- accounting for 40
percent to 55 percent of total lending under the CRA.
</P>
<P>
   The survey reflects the experiences of large banks in a strong
economy, and results could be different for smaller banks or under
tougher economic conditions, the Fed noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I approach the report with considerable caution,'' said Paul
Smith, senior counsel at the American Bankers Association, the
industry's biggest trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said many banks have told him they have found making loans
under the CRA to be ''maybe not quite as profitable as other
lending, but it's real close.''
</P>
<P>
   For the administration and key Democratic constituencies, the
community lending law is a cherished icon that they credit with
having boosted the renewal of inner-city areas in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   A partisan dispute over the issue threatened late last year to
scuttle sweeping legislation to allow banks, securities firms and
insurance companies to get into each other's businesses. After days
of negotiations, key Republican lawmakers reached a compromise with
administration officials under which banks wishing to expand into
other areas of financial activity have to obtain a satisfactory
rating from federal examiners on their community lending and to
maintain the rating.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we also know that CRA lending is not only good for our
neighborhoods, but also profitable for lenders,'' said Rep. John
LaFalce, the ranking Democrat on the House Banking Committee.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Attend Final G-8 Summit  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost lost in the shadow of the hush-hush
Mideast talks at Camp David, a dramatically different summit awaits
President Clinton this week.
</P>
<P>
   This one, beginning Friday on the Japanese island of Okinawa, is
Clinton's splashy farewell at the annual gathering of the world's
richest nations. Unlike the secrecy-wrapped summit at Camp David,
Okinawa will have plenty of photo ops, festivities and news
briefings where officials will be eager to talk about what's going
on.
</P>
<P>
   Given the state of America's booming economy, the White House is
happily drawing a contrast between Clinton's first summit in 1993
and his final bow this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1993, the president was the new guy on the block with a
weak U.S. economy and growing deficits,'' said Lael Brainard,
Clinton's deputy national economic adviser. ''This year he returns
as the senior statesman in the group, with a positive world
economic outlook, the longest expansion in U.S. history and an
established record on turning deficits into surpluses.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton took office, the United States was expected to
report a $455 billion deficit this year. Instead, the president can
boast of a surplus totaling $211 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will join one last time with the leaders of Russia,
Japan, Canada, Britain, France, Germany and Italy. The biggest
question is whether the Camp David talks will end -- or suspend -- so
that the president can leave on schedule Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll know that we're following through on the schedule when
you see the president walk up to the top of the steps (of Air Force
One) and wave and the door close,'' spokesman Joe Lockhart said,
briefing reporters near Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned further by reporters, Lockhart hardened his answer.
''What I know is the president intends to get on a plane Wednesday
morning to go and fulfill his requirements as an important leader
in the G-8 (Group of Eight),'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will have one-on-one meetings with Russian President
Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Japanese
Prime Minister Yoshiro Miro. It will be his second meeting with
Putin in about six weeks, following Clinton's trip to Moscow in
early June when they disagreed sharply about U.S. plans for a
national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the summit leaders in Okinawa share Putin's concerns
about the proposed missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, leaders of developing nations -- South
Africa, Nigeria, Thailand and Algeria -- will take part in
pre-summit talks with Clinton, Blair, Mori and German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder. They will meet Thursday in Tokyo to discuss
sharing the benefits of the information technology revolution with
people in poor countries to improve their economies, health care
and education.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the summit of industrialized nations will open on
Okinawa at a conference center built for the meeting. The talks
will conclude Sunday with the issuance of a final communique.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa is home for 26,000 U.S. troops, and there have been
tensions over instances of criminal and unruly behavior by the
American forces. In a gesture of respect, Clinton is to deliver a
speech Friday morning at Okinawa's Cornerstone of Peace Park,
commemorating the Battle of Okinawa, one of the bloodiest battles
of World World II.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Steinberg, Clinton's deputy national security adviser, said
the president will talk about the importance of good neighborly
relations and at the same time point out that the U.S. troops make
a major contribution to stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said that ''any time an incident arises, it's
regrettable and we do everything that we can to try to remove the
causes of that. We want to have a relationship where there are
never any incidents of that type.''

<HEADLINE> Virus found in mosquitos, infected birds in NYC  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Mosquitoes carrying the West Nile
virus have been found for the first time this year, and they
include a type of mosquito active in the daytime, the state Health
Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, birds with the disease have been found in New York
City, also for the first time this year, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   No human cases have been detected.

   Health Department spokesman John Signor said the finding of the
West Nile virus in mosquitoes was based on preliminary DNA
evidence, but confirmation was likely enough ''to put it in a press
release and announce it, get the word out.''
</P>
<P>
   State Health Commissioner Antonia Novello said the mosquitoes
that tested positive were from Westchester and Suffolk counties.
The Suffolk Department of Health Services immediately announced an
insecticide-spraying program targeting the virus. Westchester
Health Department spokeswoman Mary Landrigan said officials were
meeting to discuss the finding.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City birds - two crows found dead in Staten Island
- were among four birds added Monday to this year's list of West
Nile victims. The other two were from Clarkstown in Rockland
County. A total of 19 birds from the suburbs in New York and New
Jersey had earlier been found infected.
</P>
<P>
   The Staten Island crows were the first sign of West Nile this
year in New York City, which was the epicenter of the outbreak last
year. In 1999, the first known appearance of the disease in the
Western Hemisphere, seven people were killed: five from the city,
one from Suffolk and one from Westchester. Extensive measures,
ranging from pesticide spraying by helicopter to dropping
larvicides in catch basins, were undertaken throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Novello said it was no surprise to find mosquitoes carrying the
virus, given all the birds that tested positive in recent weeks.
Birds, like humans, get the disease from mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the sample from Westchester revealed the virus for
the first time in the Aedes japonicus mosquito, a recent arrival in
the Northeast, which is ''likely to be a daytime feeder.'' She said
adults tend to be found in wooded areas, larvae in small water
containers such as discarded tires.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito previously identified with the virus is the Culex
pipiens, generally active between dusk and dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Novello said measures already in place to minimize exposure to
mosquitoes should be maintained - ''this time during the daytime,
as well as at night.''
</P>
<P>
   They include covering bare skin and applying a repellent
containing DEET; removing any outdoor items that hold water,
including blocked gutters and old tires; repairing broken screens;
and regular cleaning and chlorination of swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk County Health Services spokeswoman Millie Svatek said
that although the county's Department of Public Works has been
regularly spraying for mosquitoes - since years before the advent
of West Nile - ''This is different. This spraying is in order to
prevent or reduce the transmission of this disease.'' There was no
immediate announcement of where and when the spraying would begin.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were announced as scientists from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Geological Survey were
working in the region to assess existing preventive measures and to
try some new ones - like trapping house sparrows to test them for
antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Landrigan said the CDC was working in Westchester on Monday, and
Geological Survey spokesman Butch Kinerney said his agency was
working in Bergen County, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Novello said she had contacted the CDC ''to discuss a
multistate, regional approach to prepare a plan of action to fight
the disease.''

<HEADLINE> White House Proposes Wiretap Law  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House proposed legislation Monday to
update wiretapping rules so that legal protections currently
applied to telephone calls are extended to electronic
communication, such as e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would require law enforcement officials to obtain
high-level approval before applying for a court order to intercept
the content of e-mail -- in line with current rules that govern
listening to phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, the same communication, if sent different ways --
through a phone call or a dial-up modem -- is subject to different
and inconsistent privacy standards,'' said White House Chief of
Staff John Podesta, in announcing the proposals. ''It's time to
update and harmonize our existing laws to give all forms of
technology the same legislative protections as our telephone
conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   The wiretap proposal also addresses so-called ''trap and trace''
orders which allow law enforcement officials to identify the source
of a phone call or an e-mail, but not its content. Under the
proposal, law enforcement officials would only need one order --
even to trace an e-mail or a phone call that may travel through
multiple phone carriers or Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also could trace such communications without prior
approval in an emergency situation, such as when a computer is
under attack.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time, the administration is proposing that a
federal or state judge independently determine whether the facts
support such a trace order.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were asked how those changes would impact the new
''Carnivore'' system, which the FBI is using to obtain e-mails of
investigative subjects with a search warrant. When Carnivore is
placed at an Internet service provider, it scans all incoming and
outgoing e-mails for messages associated with the target of a
criminal probe.
</P>
<P>
   If the Carnivore system is being used to intercept the content
of electronic communications, then law enforcement officials would
need high-level Justice Department approval before obtaining a
court order and stricter standards limiting its use would apply,
Podesta said. Officials would need an independent judge to review
an order if the system is used for tracing, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI says the tool already is subject to intense oversight
from its own internal controls, the Justice Department and the
courts -- with signification penalties for misuse of the system.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Civil Liberties Union chided the
administration, saying that the practical impact of the legislative
proposal on the Carnivore system is limited. It called for outright
suspension of the tool.
</P>
<P>
   ''Carnivore represents a grave threat to the privacy of all
Americans by giving law enforcement agencies unsupervised access to
a nearly unlimited amount of communications traffic,'' said Barry
Steinhardt, ACLU associate director.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed measures would also address inconsistencies in how
current law applies to different networks carrying Internet
traffic. For example, now that cable systems are being upgraded to
offer two-way services, laws that apply to dial-up modems over
phone lines should be extended to cable connections, Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer hacking laws would also be modified so that multiple
small attacks would be treated as one large attack, but mandatory
jail time would be eliminated for less serious offenses. Federal
prosecutors would have jurisdiction over juveniles in serious
computer attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The plan could be meshed with pending legislation in Congress.
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has authored a wide-ranging Internet
privacy bill and applauded the administration for its efforts ''to
focus attention on privacy from government snooping.''
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who has introduced
another measure, said he would work with the White House on a bill
that would balance law enforcement interests with privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dempsey of the Center for Democracy and Technology said the
administration's plan effectively combines both goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also announced Monday updates to its
export control policy for powerful data and voice-scrambling
technology. American companies now can sell encryption products to
any end user -- government or nongovernment -- in the European Union
or these eight other trading partners: Australia, Norway, Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland, Japan, New Zealand and Switzerland. The
policy change will also remove a previous technical review waiting
period of 30 days.

<HEADLINE> Most county colleges freeze tuition  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - All the numbers are in, and for most county
college students in New Jersey, they look good.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the state's 19 county colleges have frozen tuition
rates for the fall 2000 semester, according to the New Jersey
Council of County Colleges. One college, Sussex County Community
College, even reduced tuition by 7 percent, the council said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the council's annual survey, the remaining seven
colleges raised tuition, ranging from 1.7 percent to 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the average tuition increase at the two-year colleges
for fall 2000 is 0.6 percent, or less than 50 cents per credit
hour, the council said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this all equates to is, continuing affordability of
community college for students,'' said council spokesman Jacob
Farbman.
</P>
<P>
   The latest data show that most colleges are keeping up their end
of a bargain with Gov. Christie Whitman that they will maintain
stable tuition in exchange for more state aid.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is, how long can they keep it up.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's county colleges are scheduled to receive the third
installment of extra state aid in the new state budget. This year's
$12 million in aid is part of a long-term plan to bring the state's
share of college operating aid to one-third of college costs, with
county freeholder boards and students kicking in the remaining
two-thirds, according to Farbman.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the state's support, we're moving closer and closer to
that goal of one third each,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Most freeholder boards are cooperating with the agreement,
maintaining the counties' shares of the formula, Farbman said.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to know whether the next governor and Legislature
will continue with the agreement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll work with the future governor and hope that the ball
does not get dropped,'' he said. ''We'll certainly hope for the
best, and the best is the continuation of that seven-year pledge.''
</P>
<P>
   New tuition rates range from a statewide low of $55.80 per
credit hour at Atlantic Cape Community College to a high of $75 at
Brookdale Community College.
</P>
<P>
   The state average is just over $65 per credit hour or about
$2,000 per year for a full time student.

<HEADLINE> Hagelin: New York will be a battleground  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Reform Party presidential candidate John
Hagelin said New York will be the battleground state in his race
against Pat Buchanan for the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin has emerged as a challenger to Buchanan for the Reform
Party nomination. They are competing in a mail-in open primary for
the party's presidential nomination that runs until its national
convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin told a news conference that 172,000 of the party's
250,000 registered members live in New York, making the state
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be the battleground of the Reform Party national
presidential primary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin, 46, already has endorsements from Lenora Fulani and
other key leaders of the New York's Independence Party, the state's
Reform Party affiliate. He said he planned to spend the next
several weeks in New York meeting as many party members as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin offers himself as an alternative to the major party
candidates, saying he would reform the political system. He is a
physicist and a practitioner of transcendental meditation. He also
is a leader of the Natural Law Party and is simultaneously seeking
its presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hagelin accused Buchanan of using strong-arm tactics in
his battle for the party's nomination, he added:
</P>
<P>
   ''Actually, I like Pat in many respects, but as a candidate for
the Reform Party he's a poor fit.''

<HEADLINE> State berries to get national boost  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLASTONBURY, Conn. (AP) - Thirty minutes of picking proved
fruitful for Arnold and Linda Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Glastonbury couple plopped about 15 pounds of blueberries
into pails at Rose's Berry Farm Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's my favorite fruit,'' said Linda Anderson,
reaching into the branches of the highbush fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably the best for you,'' said her husband, Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message a farmer-funded campaign hopes to spread
around the nation next year.
</P>
<P>
   One of only three native North American fruits, blueberries have
the highest antioxidants among more than 40 fresh fruits and
vegetables. Studies have shown they may reduce the build-up of the
type of cholesterol that contributes to heart disease and strokes.
The other fruits native to the continent are the Concord grape and
the cranberry.
</P>
<P>
   Henry and Sandi Rose, owners of the largest blueberry farm in
the state, spent about $35,000 last year to advertise the fruit and
their farm.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the federal government will make sure they spend a
little more.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture will oversee the $1.1 million
nationwide promotion that mandates a $12 per ton payment from
farmers producing at least 2,000 of blueberries a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the number one fruit,'' said Sandi Rose. ''There's a lot
more demand for it this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,220 blueberry farmers recently approved the program and
the creation of a U.S.A. Blueberry Council through an industry-wide
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The Roses never got a ballot, and have plenty of questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Promotion money is good, but who are they going to promote?''
asked Henry Rose. ''Are they just going to do it when the southern
berries are around? What time of the year is it going to come out?
Who's it going to benefit?''
</P>
<P>
   Like most Connecticut fruit farmers, the Roses easily produce
the 2,000 pound minimum. Henry Rose estimates their 40 rolling
acres of the highbush berries yielded about 250,000 pounds last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Dzen, a third-generation farmer in South Windsor, grows
about 150,000 pounds of blueberries a year on 18 acres. He also
never was asked to vote on the referendum, but said any amount of
promotion would be beneficial. Dzen's self-promotion amounts to
newspaper ads and state-produced brochures.
</P>
<P>
   Last year North America produced more than 342 million pounds of
blueberries, worth $251.6 million. Michigan is the largest producer
with 76 million pounds a year.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Connecticut berries are a drop in the pail.
Statistics on the berries produced here aren't readily available,
either through state or national sources.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a totally different market we have here,'' said Dzen.
</P>
<P>
   The berries, when lumped with other fruits, account for just
under 3 percent of total state agriculture receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not even on the map,'' said state Deputy Agriculture
Commissioner Bruce Gresczyk.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose customer, picker and blueberry lover Arnold Anderson
knows otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   While flying cross-country recently, he spotted a mention of
Rose's farm in an airline magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hey,'' he said. ''That's in my back yard.''

<HEADLINE> Officer Involved in Kuwait Charged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force brought charges Monday against
an officer who commanded a C-130E cargo plane during an aborted
landing in Kuwait last year in which three U.S. servicemen were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of dereliction of duty and negligent homicide were
brought against Capt. Darron A. Haughn by Brig. Gen. Richard J.
Casey, commander of the 43rd Airlift Wing at Pope Air Force Base,
N.C., the Air Force announced.
</P>
<P>
   Haughn is assigned to the 463rd Airlift Group at Little Rock Air
Force Base, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Casey was appointed to review the results of the accident
investigation. The charges he brought Monday will be delivered to
Air Force Brig. Gen. Paul J. Fletcher, whose options range from
taking no action against Haughn to appointing an investigation
officer under Article 32 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice,
which could result in a general court martial.
</P>
<P>
   The C-130 made an aborted landing on Dec. 10, 1999, in Kuwait.
The three men who were killed were hit by landing gear that
punctured the inside of the fuselage, the Air Force determined.
</P>
<P>
   In April the Air Force determined that the three deaths resulted
from pilot and crew error.
</P>
<P>
   The air crew failed to follow procedures and made an improper
approach to a runway, Air Force officials said. The pilot didn't
keep an eye on instruments and became disoriented, not realizing
how close the plane was to the ground or how far it was from the
runway at Al Jaber Air Base southwest of Kuwait City.

<HEADLINE> 1 Indian U.N. Peacekeeper Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- One Indian U.N. peacekeeper was
killed and seven peacekeepers were injured during the weekend raid
to free more than 200 U.N. soldiers who were surrounded by rebels,
the U.N. commander in Sierra Leone said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We managed to extricate all the 233 peacekeepers and in doing
so we had one fatal casualty and seven injured,'' the force
commander, Indian Maj. Gen. Vijay Jetley, said. ''This is the price
we have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials previously had said four peacekeepers had been
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The slain peacekeeper was identified as Sgt. Krishnan Kumar. He
died of injuries suffered when his truck was hit by a
rocket-propelled grenade, according to a United Nations statement.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic rescue mission began early Saturday when a team of
Ghanaian, Indian and Nigerian troops supported by British and
Indian helicopters freed all 222 Indian peacekeepers and 11
military observers of various nationalities who had been besieged
within a U.N. base inside the eastern rebel stronghold of Kailahun
since early May.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those rescued were flown out by helicopters, while
others left the area by military convoy. The freed peacekeepers are
expected to be stationed in the eastern town of Daru.
</P>
<P>
   During the operation ''we managed to get quite a big haul of
weapons and a bigger haul of ammunition. We found some reasonably
sophisticated weapons such as automatic and semiautomatic weapons,
heavy medium and small machine guns, and also anti-aircraft guns,''
Jetley said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said the large seizure of weaponry indicated the rebels had
more arsenals elsewhere in the West African nation. ''If this is
what they have in one part of the country, then quite surely they
have more in different parts of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations in New York, Security Council members
praised the rescue operation, saying Monday it shows what can be
done with well-trained and equipped troops.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassadors said the rebels' entrapment of the peacekeepers had
become ''intolerable'' and that the force commander had no other
choice but to take action to free his troops.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said the release
will enable the U.N. force to help the Sierra Leone government
extend its authority in the country ''without this millstone around
their neck caused by the rebels.''
</P>
<P>
   With all U.N. peacekeepers now freed, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said through a spokesman that he hopes that efforts now
can be directed toward resuming the peace process in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue came two months after the rebels of the Revolutionary
United Front reignited Sierra Leone's eight-year civil war by
launching attacks on towns and capturing some 500 U.N. hostages.
Those hostages were disarmed, and released after several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the war, the rebels systematically have
killed and maimed tens of thousands of civilians in a bid to gain
power through fear. They have abandoned three different peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels suffered numerous casualties in Saturday's fighting,
according to U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue mission was a rare display of offensive strength by
the United Nations, which has been embarrassed in Sierra Leone by
rebel attacks and the capture of hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   At about 13,000 troops, the peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone
is the United Nations' largest.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to mount a rescue was made after the U.N. force in
Sierra Leone received a distress call from the detainees about
dwindling food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   While they had been detained, the 222 peacekeepers still had
their weapons. Over the past two weeks, however, the rebels refused
to allow the U.N. force in Sierra Leone, to send the detainees
supplies by road or air.

<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - An Irvington man who allegedly stole a
Millburn police car last month then rammed into a police officer
faces charges of attempted murder, an assistant prosecutor said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Malik Teel, 20, was arrested Friday in Union County, said
Charlotte L. Smith, executive assistant Essex County prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Teel allegedly was driving a stolen car around the parking lot
of The Mall at Short Hills on June 19. Police chased him until he
crashed into a police car. Teel allegedly got out of the stolen car
and ran into an empty police car abandoned by officers who had
begun a foot chase.

   He slammed the car door on the arm of Officer Reginald Hay, then
hit Officer Gino Baldani with the vehicle, throwing him 30 feet,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers fired at the car as it left, police said. No police
cars chased the stolen car because officers were helping Baldani,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Baldani was treated at a hospital for head and back injuries and
was released.
</P>
<P>
   The police car was recovered in Irvington a few miles away.

   Smith declined to say exactly where in Union County Teel was
arrested. He was scheduled to be arraigned at 9 a.m. Tuesday before
state Superior Court Judge Harold W. Fullilove.
</P>
<P>
   Teel is charged with attempted murder of a police officer,
carjacking, aggravated assault and resisting arrest.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Coverdell Has Brain Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By BARNINI CHAKRABORTY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Sen. Paul Coverdell underwent surgery Monday to
relieve pressure on his brain after suffering a cerebral
hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour operation was a success, but it was unclear what
lasting effects the Georgia Republican will have, said Dr. Gary
Gropper, the neurosurgeon who performed the surgery at Atlanta's
Piedmont Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think over the next 48 hours we'll have a better idea how
he's doing,'' Gropper said.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell is listed in serious condition and will remain in the
intensive care unit for the foreseeable future, said Sen. Bill
Frist, R-Tenn., a doctor who is a friend of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 61, was hospitalized Saturday night after complaining
of severe headaches. Tests showed the hemorrhage in the temporal
lobe of his brain, and his condition worsened, making the surgery
necessary, Frist said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital spokeswoman Nina Montanaro said Coverdell did not lose
consciousness or suffer any seizures that she knew of before the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott opened the Senate on Monday by
saying of Coverdell: ''I don't know of a senator who works any
harder or has a more indomitable spirit. Our thoughts and our
prayers are with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, who has been in the Senate since 1992, had reported
no serious health problems in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell is the fourth-leading Republican in the Senate,
serving as the GOP Conference secretary. He sits on several
committees, including Agriculture, Finance and Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell also serves as the Senate point man for presidential
candidate George W. Bush. He has been busy preparing for the GOP
convention, which begins in Philadelphia in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has appointed Coverdell to lead numerous tasks, including
controlling debate on a key education initiative currently stalled
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''His absence will be felt, even for an hour or two. He's just
that kind of guy.'' Lott spokesman John Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta resident, Coverdell was elected to the Georgia Senate
in 1970 and became a Republican leader in that chamber. Later, he
was director of the Peace Corps for two years before he won his
U.S. Senate seat by defeating the Democratic incumbent, Wyche
Fowler Jr.
</P>
<P>
   He was re-elected in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Woodward's Parents On Theft Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTER, England (AP) -- The parents of Louise Woodward, the
former au pair convicted in the death of a child in Massachusetts,
went on trial Monday on charges of defrauding a fund set up in her
name.
</P>
<P>
   Gary and Sue Woodward are accused of submitting a false invoice
for $14,500 for Sue Woodward's accommodation in Boston where her
daughter was tried for murder in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodwards became ''richer, and richer and richer'' while
pleading poverty and defrauding the fund, prosecutors alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Woodward, who accompanied her parents to court, and the
and the American legal team that handled her case are listed as
defense witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of
Matthew Eappen, an 8-month-old boy in her care, but a judge later
reduced her conviction to manslaughter and she was released after
spending 279 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, both 44 and now estranged, have denied submitting
any false invoices to the Louise Woodward and Family Trust, which
received donations from the public.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Bernard Lever said the invoice was presented to
trustees by Gary Woodward after he returned from the United States
in January, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward told the trustees' lawyer in a plea for money to be
paid urgently that his and his wife's finances were ''wiped out''
and that they had each seen savings of $15,000 dwindle to $3,000 as
a result of their time in Boston, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lever said, the couple's assets had increased to
$45,000 or $55,000, in addition to $75,000 Woodward had banked
after selling a story to the Daily Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He said Woodward had kept secret from the trustees the payment
from the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''He never mentioned it to the trustees, to the fund-raisers, or
the people all the way round the world, who were thinking: 'This
poor couple -- where are they going to get their next penny from
while this charge is hanging over their unfortunate daughter's
head,''' Lever said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can see that far from getting poorer and poorer and poorer
as Mr. Woodward was telling the solicitor ... they became richer
and richer and richer,'' Lever told the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege the couple submitted the false invoice for
accommodation at the home of Boston lawyer Elaine Whitfield Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   When shown the invoice, Whitfield Sharp told the court it was
written on her law firm's official stationery, which was kept in
her home office, but that she had nothing to do with producing it.
</P>
<P>
   She said Sue Woodward stayed almost continuously at her home
before the trial but did not pay rent. The Woodwards, she added,
occasionally paid for meals.
</P>
<P>
   Lever said another apartment used by the family in Boston had
been provided free by the au pair agency that employed Louise.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last three weeks.

<HEADLINE> Autism Study Sparks Concern  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- First, parents clamored for the hormone
secretin in hopes it would help their autistic children. Put to the
test, however, secretin is proving disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new theory is triggering desperate parents' interest -- and
this time the stakes are higher because it could spur misuse of the
nation's most precious antibiotic, vancomycin.
</P>
<P>
   An Illinois mother persuaded scientists to try a
bizarre-sounding experiment, testing whether vancomycin might help
her son's severe autism. To their surprise, little Andrew Bolte got
better.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Sandler of Rush Children's Hospital in Chicago was
skeptical of Ellen Bolte's theory that a neurotoxin-producing
intestinal infection was behind some of her son's symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   He administered the antibiotic anyway. Andrew ''was not cured,
but all of a sudden he started saying words, became
toilet-trained,'' Sandler recalled. ''I found that very intriguing.
It's not supposed to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   So Sandler treated 11 autistic children who, like about a third
of children with this serious brain disorder, also suffer painful
gastrointestinal problems. Neuropsychological testing concluded
that 10 children improved, he reports in this month's Journal of
Child Neurology -- but only for a while.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the problem: Andrew and the others worsened again
after just a few months. Yet already parents are calling doctors
about vancomycin. That's worrisome because overuse of vancomycin,
considered the best weapon against the problem of
antibiotic-resistant infections, will spur germs to become
impervious to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a danger,'' said Sandler, who has quit using vancomycin,
calling it inappropriate until more research proves if it is a real
clue or a false lead.
</P>
<P>
   Another Chicagoan, Dr. Michael Chez, plans to compare vancomycin
to a dummy drug this fall, important because simple attention
during medical research markedly helps autistic children, the
so-called ''placebo effect.'' (Send an e-mail to rushstudy@aol.com
for study information.)
</P>
<P>
   Like other autism experts, Johns Hopkins University neurologist
Dr. Andrew Zimmerman is bracing for families' calls. ''It's
heartbreaking, because you know they really want answers,'' yet the
study is far too weak to back antibiotic use, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's ''provocative,'' Zimmerman said, because scientists
are scrutinizing whether bowel problems are caused by or worsen
autistic symptoms, or are a coincidental side effect of the
terrible brain disorder.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400,000 Americans have autism, characterized by
profound social withdrawal, inability to communicate, repetitive
behavior and sometimes aggression. No one knows what causes it,
although much research suggests something goes wrong during
critical fetal brain development.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand children have taken secretin, an intestinal
hormone, after a mother said one dose brought her son out of
autistic isolation. But in scientific studies, secretin so far has
proved no better than a dummy injection.
</P>
<P>
   Intense behavior therapy is autism's only proven treatment. But
Andrew Bolte was so aggressive the therapy didn't stand a chance,
his mother said. He screamed for hours. He even chewed drywall from
the walls. Complicating matters were severe diarrhea and other
gastrointestinal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bolte blames antibiotics prescribed for fluid in Andrew's ears
shortly before he became autistic at 19 months. Her unproven
theory: those drugs killed Andrew's normal gut-protective bacteria,
allowing an intestinal infection that can produce nerve-killing
toxins, which entered his brain. Vancomycin, she thought, could
kill that infection.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six doctors scoffed. After all, autism typically appears
between ages 14 and 22 months, and no sufferers have ever been
found with neurotoxic infections.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler called it ''highly improbable,'' too, but he tried
because Andrew, by now 3, was miserable. Two months later, Andrew
was ''very calm,'' allowed Bolte to hug him and finally followed
verbal commands.
</P>
<P>
   Aggression and other symptoms soon returned. But Bolte believes
vancomycin eased his bowel problem enough to open a window for
behavior therapy, saying Andrew retained his language improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Even she cautions against demanding vancomycin, however.
Instead, she is raising money for bacterial research.

<HEADLINE> 2 Witnesses Doubt Flight 800 Probe  </HEADLINE>
By G. STEPHEN BIERMAN Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the fourth anniversary of the crash of TWA
Flight 800, two witnesses criticized investigators Monday for doing
too little to determine the source of a light they say they saw in
the sky near the doomed plane.
</P>
<P>
   They speculated the light might have been a missile.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators of the wreckage have found no evidence that a
missile struck the plane, National Transportation and Safety Board
spokesman Paul Schlamm told The Associated Press. The board,
expected to pronounce its findings next month, has focused on
mechanical malfunction in the Boeing 747's center fuel tanks as the
cause of the explosion that brought it down.
</P>
<P>
   All 230 people on board were killed in the July 17, 1996, crash.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Brumley, who watched as a passenger on another flight
5,000 feet above Flight 800, said he told his story to the FBI but
felt it wasn't taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could not positively say that what I saw was a missile. What
I saw was a very bright flame of light moving parallel to my
aircraft,'' Brumley said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Stalcup, chairman of a group called the Flight 800
Independent Researchers, said 260 eyewitnesses told the FBI that
they saw a light in the sky before the crash. Of them, 96 said they
saw it originate from the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators recently test-fired missiles under similar
conditions in Pensacola, Fla., to determine just what witnesses
might have been able to see the night of the crash. Schlamm said
board staff members stressed that the tests should be seen as
''dotting the i's and crossing the t's,'' not as an indication of
new findings.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB is expected to reveal the results of the missile test
and other tests when it meets August 22-23.

<HEADLINE> Assad Sworn In As Syrian President  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA ABU-NASR
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Standing under a huge portrait of his
late father, Bashar Assad assumed Syria's presidency before a
cheering legislature Monday and quickly rejected Western-style
democracy and territorial concessions to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, a 34-year-old former eye doctor and the chosen successor
of Hafez Assad, addressed the People's Assembly, or parliament,
after a swearing-in ceremony that finalized his smooth ascent to
power. He pledged to carry on his father's policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot apply the democracy of others on ourselves,'' he
said in his inaugural address. ''We have to have our democratic
experience which is special to us, which stems from our history,
culture, civilization and which is a response to the needs of our
society and the requirements of our reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The political strategy which (Hafez Assad) devised and
supervised ... proved a great success until this very day,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing Mideast peace, Assad said the recovery of the Golan
Heights, which Israel captured in 1967, ''is at the top of our
national priorities.'' He urged the United States ''to play its
full role as an honest broker and a co-sponsor'' of Israeli-Syrian
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed Syria will not deviate from his late father's
rejection of any territorial compromises.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the urge to reach a state of peace, but we have no
urge to compromise an inch of our territory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Thurmont, Md., State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
sent messages of congratulations to Assad. Clinton and Albright are
attending Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in Thurmont.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said Albright also welcomed Assad's affirmation of
Syria's interest in the Mideast peace process and his recognition
of Washington's role.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's inaugural address was met with the qualified approval of
his exiled uncle Rifaat Assad, who tried to overthrow Hafez Assad
in 1983-84 and said after his brother's June 10 death that he would
return to Syria at the ''appropriate'' time to run for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued on behalf of Rifaat Assad and faxed to The
Associated Press in Cairo said that he supported the ''positives''
in Bashar Assad's address.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Rifaat Assad declares that the contents of Dr. Bashar
Assad's speech give rise to hope for a new corrective movement
which Dr. Rifaat Assad called for in his first statement on June
12,'' said the statement, which did not say why Rifaat Assad
modified his stand on his nephew's ascent to power.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh told
The Associated Press: ''If Bashar wants to take Syria to a new era
of modernization and progress, the road goes necessarily through a
peace agreement with Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Sneh is a close adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad told Syrians he will improve their lives by
revitalizing the economy, reforming the administration and
eliminating corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he arrived at parliament and was met by cheering crowds
chanting: ''With our blood and soul we sacrifice ourselves to
you.'' Inside, he placed his right hand on the Quran, the Muslim
holy book, and vowed to ''respect the constitution and the laws and
preserve the people's interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The hall, decorated in sumptuous traditional Syrian wood inlay
and dominated by a large portrait of Hafez Assad, echoed with
thunderous applause as 249 of parliament's 250 delegates -- one
member was on sick leave -- gave the new president a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Eyal Zisser, a Syria expert at Tel Aviv University, said there
was not much new in the speech, particularly on the issue of
Syria-Israel peace talks -- but there were signs thing could
gradually change. Assad's pledge to bring his country ''into the
21st century'' means ''Israel must give him a chance,'' Zisser told
Israel television.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Foreign Ministry spokesman Aviv Shiron said his
minister, David Levy, was waiting to review a translation of the
speech before commenting.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's inauguration to a seven-year term as Syria's 16th
president comes little more than a month after his father's death.
Running as the only candidate, the younger Assad was elected last
week by 97.29 percent of voters in a referendum orchestrated by the
ruling Baath party.
</P>
<P>
   Since the election, pictures and banners with slogans supporting
the new leader have to a large extent disappeared from the streets,
government buildings and car windows of Damascus. Their absence has
been seen as sign of the new president's more modern approach to
politics: He reportedly ordered their removal and has urged the
state-run media to refrain from the exaggerated praise common under
his autocratic father.
</P>
<P>
   His speech Monday was interrupted more than a dozen times by
applause. He spoke at length about economic development -- the major
concern in a country where unemployment is believed to be 20
percent and economic growth has fallen to 2 to 3 percent since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Assad promised to improve Syrians' lives by introducing
transparency and accountability in government. He said he will
gradually change the economy by modernizing antiquated laws,
eliminating bureaucracy and revitalizing the private and public
sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it absolutely necessary to call upon every single
citizen to participate in the process of development and
modernization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new president, who has spearheaded a two-year
anti-corruption campaign, also indicated he will continue the
purge. ''There is no escape from bringing the careless, the corrupt
and the evildoers to justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The purge has already landed two ministers in prison, and former
Prime Minister Mahmoud el-Zoubi committed suicide moments before a
police commander could deliver a summons for his arrest.

<HEADLINE> Emmy Awards Move To Shake Up Show  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's the attitude, not the years, that have
made the Emmy Awards seem old in their fifth decade.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting-edge programs like Garry Shandling's ''The Larry Sanders
Show'' -- with 56 nominations over six years and just three trophies
-- were snubbed under a voting system that drew judges with
conservative artistic tastes.
</P>
<P>
   After viewing an episode last year of ''The Sopranos,'' the
no-holds-barred mob drama, one judge sniffed, ''I could never vote
for a show which used that kind of language,'' according to an
academy insider.
</P>
<P>
   But when the 52nd annual primetime Emmy nominees are announced
Thursday, they'll be judged under a revamped system that could
favor bolder shows.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to energize the TV honors, the Academy of Television
Arts &AMP; Sciences is abandoning its longtime ''blue ribbon'' judging
panels that required members to commit to a weekend videotape orgy
at one hotel. While that ensured judges viewed each nominee, it
favored members who had more leisure time and tended to be older.
</P>
<P>
   Now, judges can plop down in front of their own TV sets at their
convenience to watch tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The academy, which is experimenting with the approach in the top
categories, says change was overdue: Last year, the Emmy broadcast
drew its lowest ratings since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''You may see programs win that traditionally have been seen as
too avant garde or too edgy for the academy,'' said academy
President James B. Chabin. ''What we're trying to do is throw the
doors open and bring in a new generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Which could mean new hope for frisky sitcoms (and potential
nominees) like ''Malcolm in the Middle,'' ''Will &AMP; Grace'' and
''Sex and the City,'' the fierce ''Sopranos,'' or acclaimed
newcomers ''The West Wing'' and ''Once and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Sopranos'' received a leading 16 nominations in 1999 but
lost out as best drama to ''The Practice'' and won only two major
awards (for lead actress Edie Falco and for best drama series
writing).
</P>
<P>
   At least the show made it to the party. Many younger-skewing
series, such as ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' have failed to merit
serious Emmy consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers indicate the revised system is working, the academy
says. About 1,200 panelists volunteered last year for hotel duty,
said John Leverence, vice president for awards. This year, there
could be up to 4,000 judges.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surge has come in the drama and comedy series
categories, which have jumped from about 100-150 judges each to
about 400-500 so far, Leverence said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got to be hopeful that this year there might be a chance
for a spoiler or surprise just because there's new blood involved
in the process,'' said TV Guide critic Matt Roush. The awards show,
with Shandling as host, is Sept. 10 and airs on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Change can't come fast enough for younger academy members.
</P>
<P>
   ''The next generation of television creatives is so
technologically savvy that, if I've heard it once, I've heard it
100 times, 'When are we going to be able to download nominations on
the Internet, vote, certify that we voted and E-mail our votes
in?''' Chabin said.
</P>
<P>
   That the academy might be behind the techno-curve seems
surprising in an industry always lusting for the latest gizmos. But
the academy's membership doesn't reflect Hollywood at large: It's
older, whiter and more male.
</P>
<P>
   New members generally were brought in by buddies; through a
direct-mail campaign this summer, the academy is trying to draw
more women and minorities, Chabin said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all are impressed by the awards shakeup. Thomas O'Neil,
author of ''The Emmys'' (Perigee), thinks the revised system is
full of static.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Emmys were the only show business award in which every
nominee was guaranteed that their work will be seen by every voter.
Now that guarantee is gone,'' O'Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   The academy's plan to ensure that voters watch at home by
requiring signed affidavits is no substitute for the blue-ribbon
panels, O'Neil said. He thinks the panel system need expansion, not
abolition.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being limited to one weekend in one hotel, multiple
panels should be held at different institutions -- such as the
Museum of Television and Radio, in New York -- to accommodate
voters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Emmy's track record is proof of the old approach's effectiveness
to O'Neil, who notes that most of TV's finest work has been honored
over the years. He also sees panel judging as the underdog's
protector.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greatest legacy of these awards is that shows like 'Hill
Street Blues' and 'Cagney &AMP; Lacey' were close to being canceled in
their first season. Then they won Emmys, the networks kept them on
the air and they went on to live forever in TV's pantheon.''
</P>
<P>
   Shandling's take on the affair is more lighthearted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sounds like my show would have gotten watched more under this
system than in the old days. Because when I hear 450 (judges),
that's bigger than my audience was.''

<HEADLINE> Henry VIII Wives Have Day in Court  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- King Henry VIII had many titles -- King of England
and of Ireland, Defender of the Faith, ''Bluff King Hal.'' But in a
mock courtroom Monday he was called something else -- adulterer,
abusive husband, deadbeat dad.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British family lawyers examined the marital woes of
England's oft-wed king, who in the 16th century married six wives,
beheaded two of them and broke England's ties with the Roman
Catholic Church so that he could leave his first wife and remarry.
</P>
<P>
   During the session -- part of the American Bar Association's
annual meeting being held in London this week -- 500 lawyers heard
long-suffering first wife Catherine of Aragon ask for a restraining
order against her violent spouse. Doomed Anne Boleyn, headed for
the chopping block in 1536, sought a quickie divorce, while sixth
wife Catherine Parr called on the king to honor their prenuptial
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The amazing thing is, 400 years later the issues are all still
the same,'' whispered one American lawyer in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The mock trial -- heard simultaneously by England's top family
law judge, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, and Florida Supreme Court
Justice Peggy Quince -- was designed to feature issues in
contemporary family law.
</P>
<P>
   Few modern-day marriage problems are as cataclysmic as those of
Henry, whose attempt to get his marriage to Catherine of Aragon
annulled so he could wed Anne Boleyn led to his excommunication by
the pope and the founding of the Anglican church.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. and British lawyers representing the queens did not
have to struggle very hard to give their tales a contemporary ring.
Anne Boleyn -- accused by the king of adultery, incest and treason --
was ''the victim of sustained spin,'' according to her lawyer.
Catherine Howard -- Henry's fifth wife, also executed for treason --
was a battered spouse trapped in a cycle of violence.
</P>
<P>
   As befits the theme of the conference -- ''Common Law, Common
Bond'' -- the trans-Atlantic judges broadly agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The behavior of his majesty toward several of his wives has
gone beyond acceptable bounds,'' Butler-Sloss said drily.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the event highlighted differences between U.S. and
British law -- especially when it comes to money. Quince was more
ready to grant the wives' financial demands than the cautious
Butler-Sloss.
</P>
<P>
   She called some of the financial claims, which included
Catherine of Aragon asking for half the King's property and other
payments including the crown jewels, ''excessive under English
law,'' awarding ''reasonable costs -- English standards, not
American standards.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. lawyers have flooded London for the conference, which has
close to 4,000 registered participants. They can choose among more
than 200 meetings and seminars, from the topical (''Privacy,
Paparazzi and the Media'') to the sobering (''How Depression Can
Affect the Bottom Line of Your Practice.'')
</P>
<P>
   Speakers this week include U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno,
former Sen. George Mitchell, broker of the Northern Ireland peace
accord, and lawyer Cherie Booth, wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair
-- though not, as organizers had hoped, in a debate with Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who is otherwise engaged with her U.S. Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   To underline the meeting's theme of the deep links between the
two countries' legal systems, lawyers on Saturday held a ceremony
at the site west of London where King John signed the Magna Carta,
the founding document of English common law.
</P>
<P>
   ''The common law, and the common values that go with it, were
England's first exports to America,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair
said at the gathering's opening ceremony Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the two nations continue to have their differences -- a fact
that will be highlighted at another mock trial on Thursday. The
United States will put King George III, who lost the American
colonies in the Revolutionary War, in the dock for terrorism, and
Britain tries George Washington for treason.

<HEADLINE> President of Romania Won't Run Again  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Saying he is disgusted by corruption,
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu announced Monday that he
will not run for re-election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can see the degradation of the political scene,''
Constantinescu said in a live address carried by private television
station Antena 1. ''There is a blind fight for personal interests.
People buy and sell places in the parliament, using lies and
blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   Constantinescu, 60, who supports reforms and integrating into
the European mainstream, is trailing in opinion polls behind former
President Ion Iliescu. Bickering in the five-party governing
coalition and the decline in the economy have made him unpopular
since he came to power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Elections are expected in November.
</P>
<P>
   Constantinescu's announcement leaves two candidates in the
presidential race, both associated with the former communist
regime. They are Iliescu, a former high-ranking communist official
who then became president in 1990-96, and Teodor Melsescanu, a
foreign minister under Iliescu, who was a top-level diplomat before
1989.
</P>
<P>
   However, sources close to the president said he would support
current Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu to be a third candidate in
the presidential race this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be interpreted as an allusion to his steadily
waning popularity, Constantinescu told reporters, ''We need a new
kind of president, the country must not be divided. We need a
Romania that can be managed. We need a president who is a
manager.''
</P>
<P>
   A former geology professor, Constantinescu won election on
promises to clean up corruption and bring Romania closer to Western
institutions such as NATO and the European Union. He was a member
of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   While Romania has gained credibility abroad in the past four
years, a slump in the economy made Constantinescu unpopular at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Under Constantinescu's leadership, Romania offered NATO the use
of its airspace during the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Romania also was invited to join negotiations for European Union
membership last year. It hopes to join by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Constantinescu said he had lost the fight to
eradicate corruption. He said corruption has spread throughout
politics and into business interests in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   His voice trembling, Constantinescu said, ''I have made personal
mistakes, which I recognize. I thought I could do more than the
presidential mandate allowed. I trusted people I shouldn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not run for a place in parliament in this
year's election or in the future. ''I do not need parliamentary
immunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Constantinescu rhetorically asked Romanians ''Do you want to
live in a world of theft and lies or truth?''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would dedicate his last four months in office to
''getting closer to people without anyone suspecting I want to
score points for the elections.''

<HEADLINE> Fund Created for Nazi Slave Laborers  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany signed off Monday on a $5 billion
foundation to compensate people forced to work for Hitler's war
machine, sealing months of arduous negotiations on one of the last
Nazi evils not redressed after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the United States, Russia, Israel, four
eastern European states, the Jewish Claims Conference and lawyers
for the victims signed documents along with German officials
establishing the compensation fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''This closes one of the last open chapters of the Nazi past,''
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said. ''We are setting down a
durable marker of historic and moral responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million former laborers are expected to be eligible
for payments, mostly central and eastern Europeans. The fund also
will compensate people subjected to Nazi medical experiments and
some with other Holocaust-related claims.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they expect the foundation, funded in equal parts
by German industry and the government, will start payouts this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can't undo the suffering that the victims went through, and
unfortunately it also comes too late for many,'' Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, the agreement marked a ''historic day'' not
only for the survivors, but for Germans because they were forced to
confront this aspect of the Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton issued a statement praising the German
government and companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''This important and generous act will bring comfort and some
measure of justice to surviving victims of the Nazi era,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a fitting capstone to the 20th century, and a
cornerstone for a 21st century of peace and tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said foundation trustees would meet to draw up
application procedures immediately, and said the government would
transfer its entire $2.5 billion contribution to the fund's coffers
this year so that payments can begin quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Several former forced and slave laborers attended the signing
ceremony at the Foreign Ministry in Berlin -- a building that once
housed Nazi Germany's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally we have a victory, not only morally but also in a
material sense,'' said Karel Horak, a 79-year-old Czech survivor of
a Nazi-era forced labor camp who attended.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Miller, head of the Jewish Claims Conference, praised
Germany for launching the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''A great challenge faces us now,'' he added. ''We must reach
potential beneficiaries as quickly as possible. Survivors are dying
each day.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany has paid some $60 billion in restitution to survivors
for suffering at the hands of the Nazis, but slave labor had always
fallen between the cracks. German companies long denied
responsibility for using slave labor, arguing they had been
pressured by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. class-action lawsuits filed by survivors brought German
industry and Schroeder to the bargaining table last year. As the
theme spilled into the open in Germany, it became clear that the
use of Nazi-era labor extended far beyond industry to farms, city
administrations, private households and even churches.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents signed Monday were guarantees from
Washington intended to protect German companies from class-action
lawsuits in the United States. German industry will only free its
share of the fund once the lawsuits are dropped.

<HEADLINE> Three men indicted in $3.5 million chicken-for-Russia scam  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Three men, one of whom authorities linked to the
Russian mob, have been indicted in Manhattan on charges of stealing
$3.5 million in a chicken-for-Russia scam.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that the defendants and their three
companies stole money from a Latvian bank by scheming to sell the
same frozen chicken leg quarters over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the defendants, Nickolai Kouznetsov, 49, and his son
Serguei, 28, sold at least one load of chicken three times,
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said. He said the third
defendant, Igor Ilchenko, 38, falsified records that showed he was
warehousing chickens for the Kouznetsovs.
</P>
<P>
   Serguei Kouznetsov, who now lives in Russia, was arrested Friday
at his mother's house on Long Island while there to visit his
children. He was charged with first-degree grand larceny and
falsifying business records.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded innocent to the charges, but made no other statement.
</P>
<P>
   At Kouznetsov's arraignment, Assistant District Attorney Clark
Abrams said financiers of the chicken exports had filed civil suits
claiming losses of $38 million in several transactions because of
the Kouznetsovs.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams also said international law enforcement officials told
him Seguei Kouznetsov associated with Russian organized crime
figures. Kouznetsov was held without bail. His father and Ilchenko
are fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the cases for which they were indicted, Morgenthau
said, the Kouznetsovs legally sold 11 million pounds of chicken
that were already en route to Estonia, then Russia. Using documents
that falsely showed they still owned the chicken, the Kouznetsovs
sold it again to Paritate Bank of Latvia, the district attorney
said.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, the Kouznetsovs gave Paritate a warehouse
receipt that said 6 million pounds of chicken was being held in a
Pensacola, Fla., for the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on the receipt, Paritate sent the Kouznetsovs money.
Again, the chickens being paid for had already been sold.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Herbert Adlerberg ordered Kouznetsov
held without bail and scheduled his next court date for Aug. 1.
Kouznetsov faces up to 25 years in prison if he is convicted on the
grand larceny charge.

<P>
	   SARATOGA, N.Y. (AP) - A Saratoga County man was sentenced Monday
for failure to register as a sex offender under the state's
stiffened sex offender registry law.
</P>
<P>
   Darrick W. Preece failure to report a change of address was his
second offense under the 1996 Sex Offender Registration Act, and
therefore a felony, according to James A. Murphy, Saratoga County
District Attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Preece was sentenced to indeterminate sentence of between one to
three years in prison. Police said Preece moved at least three
times in the past 18 months, each time within Saratoga County and
each time without telling police.

<HEADLINE> Ocean County authorities suspect murder-suicide in death of pair  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) - A Brick woman found dead in her kitchen
Monday apparently had been stabbed, and a man with whom she had a
long-term relationship was found dead in the garage of his Monmouth
County residence, Ocean County authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies were scheduled to be conducted Monday night on the
bodies of Caroline Queen, 42, of South Beverly Drive in Brick and
Dennis Kayes, 45, of Isham Circle in Brielle, according to Ocean
County Prosecutor E. David Millard.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Brielle were summoned to Kayes' residence Monday
morning by his brother, Robert Kayes, who had gone to his brother's
home, the prosecutor said in a statement. It was not immediately
clear why Robert Kayes had gone to the residence.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Kayes' body was found in the garage. He appeared to have
died of carbon monoxide poisoning, according to Millard.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kayes told police his brother had had a relationship with
Queen, who had recently bought a house in Brick. Brielle police
then notified Brick authorities, asking them to check on Queen. Her
body was found just before 9:50 a.m., according to Millard.
</P>
<P>
   Kayes and Queen had lived at the Brielle residence, but within
the past month or so, Queen had moved to Brick, Millard said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are investigating the deaths as a murder-suicide,
but Millard's office said additional details would not be released
until the autopsies have been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Monmouth County authorities have decided that the Ocean County
prosecutor will have jurisdiction over the case.

<HEADLINE> Long-Distance To Pay $2.4M Fine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators ordered a California
carrier Monday to pay $2.4 million for illegally switching
consumers' long-distance service and deceptive telemarketing
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission said it received thousands
of complaints from consumers about the company -- Business Discount
Plan Inc. of Long Beach -- in a 10-month period. Consumers said the
company misrepresented itself and said it was affiliated with their
existing local or long-distance carrier. Other complaints alleged
that BDP told consumers its service consisted of a discount plan
combining local and long-distance charges onto one bill.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not deny substituting itself as the preferred
carrier for 30 consumers, but it claimed that it should not be
found liable under commission rules.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the company -- formerly known as Trans National
Telephone Inc. -- did not immediately return calls seeking comment
that were left with the carrier's consumer service representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC found the company liable for $2.4 million for violating
commission slamming rules and laws governing telemarketing
practices. The agency also said that further evidence of violations
could lead it to revoke the company's license to provide
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   According to the commission, the consumers slammed by the
company reside in Colorado, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Virginia,
Nevada, New Hampshire, Texas, Ohio, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maine,
Florida and Arizona. They include both residential users and small
businesses.

<HEADLINE> Judge Accuses White House on E-Mail  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge accused the White House on
Monday of keeping him in the dark about how long it would take to
restore thousands of lost Clinton administration e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said the White House never
told him that revised estimates for the project were vastly
different from what administration lawyers had reported in a
lawsuit in the case.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials earlier this year said thousands of
e-mails, including some from Vice President Al Gore's office, were
not properly archived. As a result, the messages were never
reviewed by White House lawyers to determine if they should be
turned over to investigators under subpoena in cases ranging from
the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Whitewater to campaign fund
raising.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth, who is holding hearings to determine how to retrieve
the messages and get them to investigators, has heard testimony
since Thursday from a handful of current and former White House
computer technicians.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he angrily criticized the administration for failing
to notify him earlier that a series of unsuccessful computer tests
in the project have delayed it, resulting in estimates that range
from a few months to several years.
</P>
<P>
   ''You weren't going to admit that until it was drug out of you
in this hearing,'' Lamberth, a native Texan, told Justice
Department lawyer James Gilligan, who is arguing the case on behalf
of the White House. Gilligan is representing the Executive Office
of the President in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth also complained that the White House couldn't give him
a firm figure on the number of computer backup tapes that must be
searched for missing e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   ''How does the number keep growing every day?'' he asked
Gilligan.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan replied that administration officials didn't mean to
mislead the judge, but said supervisors were struggling to manage
the complex e-mail case.
</P>
<P>
   The judge and Clinton administration critics including Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., have grown increasingly critical of the White
House's failure to produce a single piece of e-mail from backup
tapes in the almost five months since the problem became publicly
known. Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee,
is urging Attorney General Janet Reno to support appointment of a
special master to supervise production of the e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch, the conservative group that has brought the $90
million class action lawsuit, has accused the White House of
dragging its feet to delay retrieval of the messages until after
the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The group also maintains that the White House intentionally
hired consultants with little expertise in restoring the data to
delay the investigation. Judicial Watch has even offered to conduct
a test of a computer system that wasn't chosen, maintaining that it
would be 10 times faster than the one the government is using.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth didn't immediately rule on the proposal. He planned to
hear more testimony later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The White House last April told the judge it could deliver
results within 170 days -- a figure quoted at the time by White
House counsel Beth Nolan at a hearing of the House Government
Reform Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, technicians testified, they have tested three
computer systems, all of which failed to produce acceptable
results. A fourth system was approved only last Thursday, and
workers have begun using it to copy backup tapes of the e-mails. So
far, the new system has produced two unacceptable copies and two
more that are being reviewed by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth, a Reagan appointee, could appoint a special master to
oversee production of the e-mails or order another company to
perform the reconstruction. He also could let the White House
proceed with the job.

<HEADLINE> Fox Announces Multiparty Transition  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's president-elect announced a
multiparty transition team Monday made up of people who have long
been on the political outside to help him complete the first
peaceful transfer of power in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, whose July 2 victory over the party that has ruled
Mexico since 1929 redrew the country's political landscape, said
the new team would help him form policies and goals between now and
Dec. 1, when he takes office.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will support me in the definition of the strategies of
the new government,'' Fox said at a news conference, surrounded by
the 18 members of the new team.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 18, only 11 are affiliated with Fox's National Action
Party, or PAN. Fox said they will work with members of the outgoing
government to draft the 2001 budget, which the outgoing president
must present to Congress before Fox takes office.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he would announce his actual Cabinet and top advisers
for his government in late August or September, although the people
on the transition team were obvious favorites for those posts.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive, has hired head hunters who
normally work for businesses to look for candidates for those
posts.
</P>
<P>
   There were few surprises among the names announced Monday. Most
had been among the people most mentioned as candidates for the top
posts in Fox's government.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's economic advisers are Luis Ernesto Derbez and Eduardo
Sojo, who had been the favorites to assume the top economic posts
in the new government. Sojo worked with Fox when he was governor of
Guanajuato state; Derbez is a former World Bank official.
</P>
<P>
   Coordinating political affairs will be Santiago Creel, a former
congressman who lost the election for Mexico City mayor this month,
and Rodolfo Elizondo, a senator. Both are with the PAN.
</P>
<P>
   Porfirio Munoz Ledo, a former leader of both the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and the main leftist
opposition party, will coordinate ''political reform,'' a project
Fox said might lead to amendments in the Constitution. Munoz Ledo
is the only member of the team who has ever been a Cabinet member.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's foreign policy will be coordinated by Jorge Castaneda, a
columnist and political science professor, and Adolfo Aguilar
Zinser, a senator. Neither has a party affiliation, but both have
leftist political views.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's personal secretary will be Alfonso Durazo, a member of the
PRI and the former secretary of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI's
presidential candidate who was assassinated during the 1994
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Tex. Comptroller Assures Taxpayers  </HEADLINE>
By SUZANNE GAMBOA
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The Texas comptroller reassured state
taxpayers and bond raters Monday that the state is paying its bills
and has plenty of money to spare, despite the publicity over the
state's money matters because of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no deficit,'' Carole Keeton Rylander, the state's
Republican comptroller, said Monday. ''There is a budget surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the state reported $610 million in cost overruns. The
news quickly became fodder for Vice President Al Gore's campaign.
Gore, a Democrat, said the budget shortfall demonstrates that the
economic proposals of likely GOP presidential nominee Gov. George
W. Bush would return the country to deficit spending and raise its
debt.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas has a $1.1 billion-dollar surplus. But when your
governor is a candidate for president, everything is up for
question.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mario Gallegos, Jr., a Democrat from Houston, on Monday
called for an independent audit of the departments of Health, Human
Services and the Health and Human Services Commission, where some
of the cost overruns have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''Miss Rylander was responding from a cry for help from the Bush
campaign folks. I anticipate serious overruns,'' Gallegos said.
</P>
<P>
   The higher costs would leave the state with about a $500 million
surplus, small compared to other recent state surpluses, but still
a surplus. Rylander said she plans a news conference later this
week, to provide a more solid estimate of the budget surplus, which
could be greater, and details about the Texas economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to sit back and have myths put out that there is
a deficit in Texas,'' she said. ''It's misleading and incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Top lawmakers and state officials have said the state's $610
million budget overruns resulted from higher Medicaid prescription
drug costs, a higher prison population in county jails because of
tougher parole rules and bad budget assumptions by two state
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The reports and subsequent political criticism came just as
Texas was preparing to head to Wall Street to auction some
short-term notes that will provide cash flow for the next fiscal
year. The state will seek a bond rating before auctioning those
notes, which Standard &AMP; Poor's Ratings Services last year gave its
highest rating possible for short-term debt. The notes will mature
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander said because of the timing she felt compelled to
provide the revenue update and announce the state's anticipated
surplus. Alex Fraser, a director with Standard &AMP; Poor's Rating
Services in Dallas, said Rylander's office provides him with
monthly reports on the state's finances, ''so this is not a
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Party Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm accused
Rylander of announcing the budget surplus estimate to mask ''a
situation that is threatening to Bush's presidential aspirations.''
She said with the early announcement, Rylander was giving Bush ''a
blank check for spending.''
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller is not required to provide such estimates until
just before the Legislature meets, in January but has the option to
give them early.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, said he thought it was a
good idea for Rylander ''to put the rumors to rest.'' Ratliff,
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee which helps write the
state budget, said Rylander had to risk the criticism for the
state's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''If she had stayed quiet and the bond rating suffered because
of misperceptions out there,'' he said, ''it could have cost the
state millions and millions.''

<HEADLINE> Officer Involved in Kuwait Accused  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force brought charges Monday against
an officer who commanded a C-130E cargo plane during an aborted
landing in Kuwait last year in which three U.S. servicemen were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of dereliction of duty and negligent homicide were
brought against Capt. Darron A. Haughn by Brig. Gen. Richard J.
Casey, commander of the 43rd Airlift Wing at Pope Air Force Base,
N.C., the Air Force announced.
</P>
<P>
   Haughn is assigned to the 463rd Airlift Group at Little Rock Air
Force Base, Ark. Base officials declined to release his home
telephone number to a reporter seeking comment
</P>
<P>
   Casey was appointed to review the results of the accident
investigation. The charges he brought Monday will be delivered to
Air Force Brig. Gen. Paul J. Fletcher, whose options range from
taking no action against Haughn to appointing an investigation
officer under Article 32 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice,
which could result in a general court martial.
</P>
<P>
   The C-130 made an aborted landing on Dec. 10, 1999, in Kuwait.
The three men who were killed were hit by landing gear that
punctured the inside of the fuselage, the Air Force determined.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, the Air Force determined that the three deaths
resulted from pilot and crew error.
</P>
<P>
   The air crew failed to follow procedures and made an improper
approach to a runway, Air Force officials said. The pilot didn't
keep an eye on instruments and became disoriented, not realizing
how close the plane was to the ground or how far it was from the
runway at Al Jaber Air Base southwest of Kuwait City.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum penalty for Haughn, if he were to be convicted by a
general court martial, would be 3&AMP;frac12; years in prison, dismissal from
the service and forfeiture of all pay and benefits while
imprisoned, said Capt. Jeff Glenn, a spokesman for the Air Mobility
Command at Scott Air Force Base, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Three other crew members -- the C-130's co-pilot, navigator and
flight engineer -- already have received ''lesser corrective
actions,'' Glenn said. That can range from oral counseling to
non-judicial punishment, he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 8; Nasdaq Gains 28  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mixed Monday in listless trading
as cautious investors took few chances ahead of the release Tuesday
of key economic data used to gauge inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 8.48 at 10,804.27.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators closed higher, however. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index closed up 0.51 at 1,510.49, and the Nasdaq
composite index was up 28.49 at 4,274.67.
</P>
<P>
   The markets lacked a clear direction while investors awaited the
release Tuesday of the Consumer Price Index, which measures prices
paid by consumers and is used as a barometer for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan will
be testifying before a Senate committee on Thursday, and investors
will be dissecting his comments for clues on the direction of
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Stock Market rebounded from early losses, moving
higher on optimism that last week's string of strong second-quarter
earnings reports will extend into this week. Among the industry
bellwethers scheduled to report earnings later this week are
Microsoft and chip maker Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Qualcomm, also scheduled to release earnings this
week, soared Monday, rising $6.75 to $69.813 and helping to keep
the Nasdaq in positive territory. The stock surged after Japan and
Europe upheld three of the wireless telecommunications company's
patents.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Internet companies also fared well. VerticalNet
rose $10.922 to $62.047, and Rambus shares were up $3.50 to
$108.50.
</P>
<P>
   Gains on the Nasdaq would have been stronger if not for
profit-taking. The tech-heavy index surged last week following
strong second-quarter earnings reports from some closely-watched
companies, including Internet giant Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a typical summer Monday -- not a lot of activity. More
than anything else, what we're seeing is investors taking a little
bit off the table after the strong run we saw in the latter part of
last week,'' said Bill Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor
Fitzgerald in Darien, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The profit taking bit into some of the gains made by last week's
high flyers. Ariba was down $1.813 to $122.75 and Amazon.com was
down $1.375 to $41.125. Both companies soared last week.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were also mulling several high profile mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific, maker of Angel Soft and Sparkle paper goods, is
acquiring Fort James in a $7.7 billion merger that would create the
largest maker of tissue products in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific shares were down $2.25 to $26.375 in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange, while Fort James' stock rose $8.437 to
$33, also on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   And British food and drinks conglomerate Diageo PLC is selling
its U.S. food subsidiary Pillsbury, owner of the Green Giant frozen
vegetable and Haagen-Dazs ice cream brands, to General Mills for $5
billion in stock and the assumption of $5.1 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo's American Depositary receipts rose 62.50 cents to
$36.438 on the NYSE, and General Mills' shares fell $2.688 to
$33.625.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.11 billion shares,
down from 1.18 billion on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.55 at 545.18.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.84 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 1.53 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.77 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.74 percent.

<HEADLINE> Number of Prisoners Drops in Cuba  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- The number of political prisoners in Cuba dropped
slightly over the first six months of this year as the Cuban
government opted to hold people for brief periods rather than give
them long sentences, a leading human rights group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Elizardo Sanchez, president of the independent Cuban Commission
of Human Rights and National Reconciliation, said that the
organization's latest survey showed 314 people were held for
political reasons during the first half of 2000, down from 344
during the last six months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The group is considered to be illegal in Cuba, but is tolerated
by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''After a slight increase in the second semester of 1999, this
statistical drop could re-establish the positive tendency observed
over the past 10 years that reduced the number of prisoners for
political motives from more than 1,000 to several hundred,''
Sanchez said in a statement faxed to foreign news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the government of Cuba is substituting an
earlier policy of long prison sentences for one that involves
several hours, days or weeks, as well as warnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government maintains it holds no political prisoners,
only common criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the drop, Sanchez said that Cuba ''continues to be the
only closed society in the Western Hemisphere'' and the government
''continues to violate virtually all the civil and political rights
of the citizenry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, who himself spent many years in Cuban prisons, is among
the island's best known opposition activists.
</P>
<P>
   The commission he heads issues a report on civil rights every
six months, along with a list of people it considers to be
imprisoned for political motives.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Activate, Sign RHPs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Hoping to shore up their struggling
bullpen, the Texas Rangers activated right-handed pitcher Ryan
Glynn in time to start Monday's game in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn was placed on the 15-day disabled list July 2 after
blisters on his right index finger cut short starts on June 24 and
July 1. Before Monday's game, he was 1-0 with a 1.56 ERA in three
starts with Texas.
</P>
<P>
   During a rehabilitation stint with Triple-A Oklahoma of the
Pacific Coast League, he was 3-2 with a 3.64 ERA in 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Glynn, the Rangers optioned infielder Kelly
Dransfeldt to Oklahoma. Dransfeldt, recalled from Oklahoma on July
3, hit .200 with one RBI in five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also signed free agent right-hander Clint Sodowsky
and assigned him to Tulsa of the Double-A Texas League. Sodowsky,
28, has a major league record of 8-14 in 106 games with Detroit
(1995-96), Pittsburgh (1997), Arizona (1998), and St. Louis (1999).

<HEADLINE> Long-Distance Phone Co. Fined $2.4M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators ordered a California
carrier Monday to pay $2.4 million for illegally switching
consumers' long-distance service and deceptive telemarketing
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission said it received thousands
of complaints from consumers about the company -- Business Discount
Plan Inc. of Long Beach -- in a 10-month period. Consumers said the
company misrepresented itself and said it was affiliated with their
existing local or long-distance carrier. Other complaints alleged
that BDP told consumers its service consisted of a discount plan
combining local and long-distance charges onto one bill.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not deny substituting itself as the preferred
carrier for 30 consumers, but it claimed that it should not be
found liable under commission rules.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the company -- formerly known as Trans National
Telephone Inc. -- did not immediately return calls seeking comment
that were left with the carrier's consumer service representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC found the company liable for $2.4 million for violating
commission slamming rules and laws governing telemarketing
practices. The agency also said that further evidence of violations
could lead it to revoke the company's license to provide
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   According to the commission, the consumers slammed by the
company reside in Colorado, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Virginia,
Nevada, New Hampshire, Texas, Ohio, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maine,
Florida and Arizona. They include both residential users and small
businesses.

<HEADLINE> Marriage Tax Relief Nears Passage  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to draw sharp contrasts with Democrats
over tax cuts, Republicans pushed Monday for congressional approval
of a bill to slash income taxes by $248 billion over 10 years for
married couples, including those now paying more than two single
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate began by voting on amendments, all of which could be
deleted later to enable Republicans to send President Clinton a
clean ''marriage penalty'' bill before the GOP's national political
convention begins July 31.
</P>
<P>
   A less costly Democratic alternative giving married couples a
choice of filing as singles or jointly was defeated Monday night on
a 50-46 vote, clearing the way for Senate passage likely Tuesday of
the GOP tax cut. The measure would then go to the House, where
swift action is also expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will see who supports marriage tax relief, and we will see
who thinks American families are not entitled to this relief,''
said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., the Senate Finance Committee
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he could sign the measure into law only under
one condition: that Congress also send him legislation creating a
prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart accused Republicans of playing politics by
passing the tax-cut bill alone to force a veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can make political points, pass bills so they can talk
about them at their convention, or we can get marriage penalty
relief and prescription drugs for seniors,'' Lockhart said. ''It's
up to them: politics or substance?''
</P>
<P>
   Elimination of the marriage penalty was the centerpiece of the
$792 billion Republican tax cut vetoed last year by the president.
Republicans have spent this year passing bite-sized pieces of that
larger tax cut using the huge budget surplus, hoping to frame
clearer election-year distinctions between themselves and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A new Treasury Department analysis of seven GOP tax measures
that have passed the House Ways and Means Committee so far this
year said that together, 76 percent of the cuts would go to the 23
million wealthiest families. The remaining 91 million familes would
get just over 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told reporters the
administration prefers tax cuts targeted at low- and middle-income
taxpayers instead of ''large tax cuts that are heavily backloaded
and primarily benefit the highest-income Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty bill gradually would enlarge both the 15
percent and 28 percent tax brackets so they apply to a greater
share of a married couple's income. Today, two single people enjoy
wider tax brackets than a comparable married couple, resulting in
an average tax bill $1,400 higher for 25 million couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not just tax relief, it's a tax correction,'' said
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would boost a married couple's standard
deduction to twice that of two single people, increase the income
cap for low-income couples who claim the earned-income tax credit
and ensure that the alternative minimum tax is not triggered when
couples claim any of several personal credits.
</P>
<P>
   The failed Democratic alternative would have given couples the
choice of filing joint tax returns or as two singles, whichever
benefits them more, with benefits phasing out at incomes between
$100,000 and $150,000. That would cost $54 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We say: You choose. It is your choice,'' said Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the Republican bill would cut taxes of millions of
married couples who don't now pay penalties, usually those in which
one spouse earns most of the family income, and would give
unnecessarily large tax cuts to upper-income people.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't a marriage-penalty bill. It's a tax cut disguised
as a marriage-penalty bill,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans planned action on several other tax bills this week:
</P>
<P>
   --The House is expected to pass legislation gradually raising
contribution limits for individual retirement accounts from $2,000
to $5,000 annually and for 401(k)s from $10,500 to $15,000. Total
cost: About $16 billion over five years.
</P>

<HEADLINE> AF Capt. Accused in Kuwait Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force brought charges Monday against
an officer who commanded a C-130E cargo plane during an aborted
landing in Kuwait last year in which three U.S. servicemen were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of dereliction of duty and negligent homicide were
brought against Capt. Darron A. Haughn by Brig. Gen. Richard J.
Casey, commander of the 43rd Airlift Wing at Pope Air Force Base,
N.C., the Air Force announced.
</P>
<P>
   Haughn is assigned to the 463rd Airlift Group at Little Rock Air
Force Base, Ark. Base officials declined to release his home
telephone number to a reporter seeking comment
</P>
<P>
   Casey was appointed to review the results of the accident
investigation. The charges he brought Monday will be delivered to
Air Force Brig. Gen. Paul J. Fletcher, whose options range from
taking no action against Haughn to appointing an investigation
officer under Article 32 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice,
which could result in a general court martial.
</P>
<P>
   The C-130 made an aborted landing on Dec. 10, 1999, in Kuwait.
The three men who were killed were hit by landing gear that
punctured the inside of the fuselage, the Air Force determined.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, the Air Force determined that the three deaths
resulted from pilot and crew error.
</P>
<P>
   The air crew failed to follow procedures and made an improper
approach to a runway, Air Force officials said. The pilot didn't
keep an eye on instruments and became disoriented, not realizing
how close the plane was to the ground or how far it was from the
runway at Al Jaber Air Base southwest of Kuwait City.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum penalty for Haughn, if he were to be convicted by a
general court martial, would be 3&AMP;frac12; years in prison, dismissal from
the service and forfeiture of all pay and benefits while
imprisoned, said Capt. Jeff Glenn, a spokesman for the Air Mobility
Command at Scott Air Force Base, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Three other crew members -- the C-130's co-pilot, navigator and
flight engineer -- already have received ''lesser corrective
actions,'' Glenn said. That can range from oral counseling to
non-judicial punishment, he said.

<HEADLINE> Defecting Doctors Seek U.S. Refuge  </HEADLINE>
By ED McCULLOUGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Two Cuban doctors who defected to
Sweden after spending a month in a Zimbabwean jail went to the U.S.
Embassy in Stockholm Monday, seeking permission to enter the United
States as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's where we can be most useful for our cause,'' Leonel
Cordova Rodriguez, 31, said in one of his first interviews since
arriving here a week ago. ''We have a very interesting story to
tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordova Rodriguez, a general practitioner, and dentist Noris del
Carmen Pena Martinez, 25, were arrested in Zimbabwe as they sought
to defect from Cuba. They were part of a 107-member medical team
that Cuba sent to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova Rodriguez said President Fidel Castro's intention in
sending the team was at least as much political as humanitarian: a
goodwill gesture to help Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe win a
tough re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova Rodriguez and Pena Martinez said they flew to Zimbabwe
on March 20 on a two-year assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors, who became friends after discovering they shared
anti-Castro views and a determination to defect, said they first
sought refuge at both the Canadian and U.S. embassies in Harare,
Zimbabwe, which referred them to the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cubans disappeared June 2, the day of their hearing
before a Zimbabwean asylum committee. They said they were detained
by Zimbabwean officials, who together with Cuban diplomats forced
them on a plane heading back to Havana.
</P>
<P>
   However, during a stopover at Johannesburg, South Africa, they
said they passed a note to an Air France official indicating they
were being kidnapped. They were sent back to Zimbabwe, where the
U.N. refugee agency and the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service looked after their well-being in jail and negotiated for
their release.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba denied any involvement in the alleged kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish immigration authorities issued the pair two-month visas.
The INS conditionally approved refugee status, contingent on
medical examinations, clearance of security procedures and other
measures, according to documents faxed to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova Rodriguez and Pena Martinez said they went to the U.S.
Embassy on Monday to formally resume the refugee application
process, hoping to travel to Miami, where they have relatives and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The case has generated a lot of interest.
</P>
<P>
   During an hour-long interview, the phone rang half a dozen times
for one or the other doctor, including calls from the U.S. National
Cuban-American Foundation, U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
of Florida and a major metropolitan U.S. newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova Rodriguez, who said his wife and three children were
evicted from their apartment and now live with neighbors, hopes his
family will be allowed to join him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pena Martinez said she would have lost her job and her life
would have changed ''totally'' for the worse if she had been sent
back to Havana.

<HEADLINE> Virus found in suburban mosquitos, NYC birds  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Mosquitoes carrying the West Nile
virus have been found for the first time this year, and they
include a type of mosquito active in the daytime, the state Health
Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, birds with the disease have been found in New York
City, also for the first time this year, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   No human cases have been detected.
</P>
<P>
   Health Department spokesman John Signor said the finding of the
West Nile virus in mosquitoes was based on preliminary DNA
evidence, but confirmation was likely enough ''to put it in a press
release and announce it, get the word out.''
</P>
<P>
   State Health Commissioner Antonia Novello said the mosquitoes
that tested positive were from Westchester and Suffolk counties.
The Suffolk Department of Health Services immediately announced an
insecticide-spraying program, beginning Tuesday, targeting the
virus. In Westchester, Health Department spokeswoman Mary Landrigan
said no decision had been made about spraying.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City birds - two crows found dead in Staten Island
- were among four birds added Monday to this year's list of West
Nile victims. The other two were from Clarkstown in Rockland
County. A total of 19 birds from the suburbs in New York and New
Jersey had earlier been found infected.
</P>
<P>
   The Staten Island crows were the first sign of West Nile this
year in New York City, which was the epicenter of the outbreak last
year. In 1999, the first known appearance of the disease in the
Western Hemisphere, seven people were killed: five from the city,
one from Suffolk and one from Westchester. Extensive measures,
ranging from pesticide spraying by helicopter to dropping
larvicides in catch basins, were undertaken throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they planned to spray from trucks late
Wednesday night and early Thursday in the sections of Staten Island
where the infected birds were found.
</P>
<P>
   Novello said it was no surprise to find mosquitoes carrying the
virus, given all the birds that tested positive in recent weeks.
Birds, like humans, get the disease from mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the sample from Westchester revealed the virus for
the first time in the Aedes japonicus mosquito, a recent arrival in
the Northeast, which is ''likely to be a daytime feeder.'' She said
adults tend to be found in wooded areas, larvae in small water
containers such as discarded tires.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito previously identified with the virus is the Culex
pipiens, generally active between dusk and dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Novello said measures already in place to minimize exposure to
mosquitoes should be maintained - ''this time during the daytime,
as well as at night.''
</P>
<P>
   They include covering bare skin and applying a repellent
containing DEET; removing any outdoor items that hold water,
including blocked gutters and old tires; repairing broken screens;
and regular cleaning and chlorination of swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk County Health Services spokeswoman Millie Svatek said
that although the county's Department of Public Works has been
regularly spraying for mosquitoes - since years before the advent
of West Nile - ''This is different. This spraying is in order to
prevent or reduce the transmission of this disease.'' Applications
were scheduled for Tuesday evening in Lindenhurst, West Babylon and
Point O' Woods on Fire Island.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were announced as scientists from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Geological Survey were
working in the region to assess existing preventive measures and to
try some new ones - like trapping house sparrows to test them for
antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Landrigan said the CDC was working in Westchester on Monday, and
Geological Survey spokesman Butch Kinerney said his agency was
working in Bergen County, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Novello said she had contacted the CDC ''to discuss a
multistate, regional approach to prepare a plan of action to fight
the disease.''

<HEADLINE> Father of shaken baby gets seven years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - A 22-year-old Fulton County man was
sentenced Monday for assaulting his infant son last year.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Yates of Caroga Lake was sentenced to serve seven years
behind bars. Judge Richard Giardino decided on the term after
hearing statements from both the prosecution and the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Yates was convicted of violently shaking his
two-week-old child before squeezing his head and dropping him onto
a couch.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing was postponed when the defense tried to overturn the
guilty verdict with new testimony from the victim's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Faith Owen changed her testimony and said that she was in the
room with the father and the baby and that there was no assault.
During the trial, she had said she was in the next room.

<HEADLINE> WNBA All Stars Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona State women's basketball program took
advantage of the festivities surrounding the WNBA All-Star game to
announce that their Dec. 27 game against Tennessee will be held in
Bank One Ballpark in an attempt to break the NCAA women's
basketball attendance record.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been in the works for two years, and I've been selling
this game for two years,'' Arizona State coach Charli Turner Thorne
said at a news conference. ''There is no downside to this event.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the baseball stadium's retractable roof would be open
unless rain was falling.
</P>
<P>
   The 49,000-seat ballpark can be configured to seat at least
30,000 for basketball. The women's record is 24,597 for Connecticut
at Tennessee on Jan. 3, 1998. The game was held at Thompson-Bolling
Arena in Knoxville. Tenn., which has played host to nine of the 10
largest crowds for a college women's game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a very big arena here,'' Tennessee coach Pat Summitt
said by phone, ''but we're very excited to be part of this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils were 14-15 last season, but Turner Thorne said
the addition of three transfers who will be eligible this season
should help her team make a game of it against Tennessee, which was
33-4 and lost to Connecticut in the NCAA championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the Dec. 27 game will benefit breast cancer
research. AstraZeneca, which makes the drug Nolvadex, is the title
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   STAR ON THE BENCH: Cynthia Cooper of the Houston Comets, the
WNBA's MVP in 1997 and 1998, wasn't able to start the All-Star game
after spraining her right ankle in the next-to-last game before the
break.
</P>
<P>
   Comets coach Val Chancellor chose Minnesota Lynx small forward
Katie Smith, the league's No. 2 scorer at 20.5 points per game, to
start at Cooper's off-guard position. Smith was one of six Western
Conference All-Stars picked by coaches after fans voted for the
starters.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, 37, plans to retire after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   NEXT STOP: The league hasn't decided where to stage the 2001
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Val Ackerman said her staff is considering other
sites with strong fan support. The inaugural 1999 game was held in
New York's Madison Square Garden, and Phoenix got this game because
of its strong fan base.
</P>
<P>
   ''Probably sometime within the next couple of months we're going
to make the announcement,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   TOP PRODUCERS: Thirteen of the 133 women on WNBA rosters who
attended college in the United States went to Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Florida and Tennessee are next, with eight each.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Tech has seven alumnae in the league, while
Connecticut, North Carolina State and Southern California have six
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern Conference is the top league with 35 players,
while the Pac-10, with more than half its 25 players from Stanford,
is next.

<HEADLINE> Clinton says she is victim of 'warehouse of insults' from GOP  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton portrayed herself Monday
as the victim of a ''warehouse of insults'' from the Republican
Party as the controversy continued over whether she uttered an
anti-Semitic slur 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Her Republican Senate opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, expressed
doubts about her denial, saying: ''I don't know who to believe. I
don't think New Yorkers know who to believe. And therein lies a
good deal of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton did get support Monday from Gail Sheehy, author of
''Hillary's Choice.'' Sheehy told The Associated Press that she had
heard the story of the alleged anti-Semitic comment several years
ago from the wife of the man who claims to have been the target of
the slur.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheehy said she left it out of her book because it was ''off
the wall. It was totally without credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also got a vote of confidence from two major nonpartisan
Jewish organizations. The Anti-Defamation League said Clinton's
''public record shows no evidence of anti-Semitism and we do not
believe her to hold negative views about Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   American Jewish Committee executive director David Harris
agreed, adding: ''The allegations are highly suspect. Suspect
because of their source, suspect because they come 26 years after
the alleged incident, and suspect because they come amid a heated
Senate campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not directly accuse the Republicans of being behind
the allegation that she called one of her husband's campaign aides
a ''Jew b------'' in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But she complained that the GOP was trying to tar her in
general, saying: ''I've been accused of a lot of different things.
I'm sure they'll come up with a lot more. You just have to look at
my opponent's fundraising letter, the chairman of the Republican
Party's letter and the head of the Conservative Party's charges.
Apparently they have a whole warehouse of insults.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ''It's only July. There's going to be a lot more of
this. Just get ready.''
</P>
<P>
   A Lazio fund-raising letter recently mailed by state Republican
Chairman Bill Powers called her ''cold-blooded and hotheaded'' and
a ''shrill and scheming person.'' Last week state Conservative
Party Chairman Mike Long, who has endorsed Lazio, compared the
first lady to the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation that the first lady used an anti-Semitic term
appears in a book out this week called ''State of a Union: Inside
the Complex Marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton,'' by former
National Enquirer reporter Jerry Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer quotes Paul Fray as claiming that Hillary Clinton
used the slur in a fight with him after Bill Clinton lost a
Congressional election that Fray had worked on.
</P>
<P>
   Fray is not Jewish, but one of his grandparents was. Oppenheimer
said the account was confirmed by Fray's wife and another campaign
worker who heard the argument through a closed door.
</P>
<P>
   Fray did not immediately return a call made to an Arkansas phone
number listed in his wife's name.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy said Monday that Fray's wife Mary Lee told her Hillary
Clinton had used an obscenity and the word ''Jew'' in the fight
with Fray. But when she asked Paul Fray about it, ''he skirted the
issue. That's why I didn't use it (in 'Hillary's Choice'). I
realized that he didn't back it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy called the Frays ''only moderately reliable. They were
kind of flaky.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sheehy's book, she quotes Fray as saying that he and Clinton
had fought so bitterly because ''when Jewish people get together
and things don't go right ... they go at each other's throats.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'But Hillary's not Jewish,''' Sheehy recalled. ''Then
there was this long pause and he said, 'But she tries to be
Jewish.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy characterized the exchange as ''amusing and bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy said Fray was a lawyer who lost his license after memory
loss due to a massive cerebral hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas Bar Association could not be reached Monday night
to confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary and Bill Clinton both said they don't recall the meeting
with the Frays.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Senate campaign on Sunday released a 1997 letter,
which the first lady said was from Fray, in which he begged her
''forgiveness'' for saying ''things against you ... without factual
foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Hillary Clinton said ''any reasonable person looking
at the evidence in this case would conclude there's no credibility
on the other side. ... I have a lot of confidence in the
fundamental good judgment of New Yorkers to see through this.''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen representatives of right-wing Jewish groups protested
outside Clinton's midtown campaign office. ''These remarks made 26
years ago are the tip of the iceberg,'' said Dr. Joseph Frager, who
identified himself as president of the Jerusalem Reclamation
Project. Frager accused Hillary Clinton of ''a bias against the
state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile at the Camp David peace talks between Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart called the allegation
''scurrilous and untrue'' and said it showed ''how deep in the
gutter some people can go.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also defended his wife in Monday's Daily News,
saying: ''She might have called him a b------. I wouldn't rule that
out. She's never claimed that she was pure on profanity. But I've
never heard her tell a joke with an ethnic connotation.''

<HEADLINE> Congressional Analysts See Surplus  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Congressional Budget Office will project
an enormous $2.17 trillion in federal surpluses over the next
decade, officials said Monday, further fueling the election-year
battle over what to do with the government's mountains of excess
cash.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate by the nonpartisan CBO, contained in agency
documents distributed on Capitol Hill, was a bit higher than
expected but not a major surprise. CBO's projection had been
expected to somewhat exceed last month's estimate by the White
House budget office, which more than doubled its own earlier
10-year surplus forecast to $1.87 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the new figures -- which exclude Social Security's own
huge surpluses -- seemed likely to give added impetus to lawmakers
and candidates seeking to cut taxes or to boost spending for
prescription drug coverage, defense and other programs. CBO planned
to officially release the numbers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the figures should help Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee, argue that his
proposal for more than $1.3 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years can
be paid for by budget surpluses without eroding Social Security's
trust funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''This validates Gov. Bush's budget,'' said Bush spokesman Ari
Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democrats' presumed presidential
nominee, has argued that Bush's plans are reckless. Gore says the
combined costs of Bush's proposed tax cuts, increases for defense
and other programs, plus lost interest savings would eat into
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The new numbers could also make it harder for congressional
Democrats to argue that cuts Republicans have proposed in the
estate tax, taxes paid by married couples and other levies are
unaffordable. Underlining that, since President Clinton unveiled
his administration's higher surplus projections, dozens of House
and Senate Democrats have voted for GOP tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new figures could weaken GOP arguments
that Clinton's proposal for adding a new Medicare prescription drug
benefit is too costly. Though its 10-year cost is unclear, a
House-passed Republican version is projected to cost about $40
billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   CBO said it believes Clinton's proposed drug coverage and other
new Medicare benefits he would create would cost $310 billion over
10 years -- nearly $60 billion higher than the president's price
tag.
</P>
<P>
   And as congressional Republicans begin pushing through the 13
annual spending bills that finance federal agencies, the higher
projections could help Clinton win some of the extra billions he
wants for schools, foreign aid and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to head off a spending spree, Senate Budget Committee
Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., told reporters that lawmakers
''ought not do any damage this year'' by enacting expensive new
programs, such as Clinton's proposed prescription drug benefit
under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Both the administration's and CBO's higher projections are due
to the economy's continued healthy performance, which has exceeded
what was expected when both budget offices issued their last
projections early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, though many economists consider it unlikely, the
projected surpluses could shrink dramatically -- or even vanish --
should the economy hit a prolonged, severe downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, CBO now envisions a $4.56 trillion budget surplus from
2001 through 2010 -- $2.39 trillion from Social Security and $2.17
trillion from all other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the projected non-Social Security surplus -- $1.48
trillion -- would occur from 2006 through 2010. Generally, budget
forecasts are less accurate the further into the future they
extend.
</P>
<P>
   In January, CBO projected a 10-year budget surplus of $3.15
trillion, including $2.31 trillion from Social Security and $838
billion from other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have agreed informally to use Social Security
surpluses only for debt reduction. The remaining surplus in what
politicians are contesting for spending, tax cuts and debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   CBO also is projecting a $232 billion surplus, including $84
billion from non-Social Security programs, in the fiscal year that
ends Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the third consecutive year in which the government
has run an overall surplus, and the second straight year with a
non-Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the government had annual deficits for four decades.
</P>
<P>
   The CBO figures assumed that spending for most federal programs
would grow at the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, last week's offer by GOP leaders to try reaching
early agreement with the administration on a $340 billion measure
financing education, health and labor programs was getting a rough
start.
</P>
<P>
   In a draft letter to top Republicans, White House budget chief
Jack Lew said such talks should also cover expanding the rights of
managed-care patients, tax breaks aimed at encouraging local school
construction and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, told a reporter that
Republicans would not agree to such wide-ranging talks. The letter
''sounds like a political document to me,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING to fix state code  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Mosquitoes carrying the West Nile
virus have been found for the first time this year, and they
include a type of mosquito active in the daytime, the state Health
Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, birds with the disease have been found in New York
City, also for the first time this year, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   No human cases have been detected.
</P>
<P>
   Health Department spokesman John Signor said the finding of the
West Nile virus in mosquitoes was based on preliminary DNA
evidence, but confirmation was likely enough ''to put it in a press
release and announce it, get the word out.''
</P>
<P>
   State Health Commissioner Antonia Novello said the mosquitoes
that tested positive were from Westchester and Suffolk counties.
The Suffolk Department of Health Services immediately announced an
insecticide-spraying program, beginning Tuesday, targeting the
virus. In Westchester, Health Department spokeswoman Mary Landrigan
said no decision had been made about spraying.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City birds - two crows found dead in Staten Island
- were among four birds added Monday to this year's list of West
Nile victims. The other two were from Clarkstown in Rockland
County. A total of 19 birds from the suburbs in New York and New
Jersey had earlier been found infected.
</P>
<P>
   The Staten Island crows were the first sign of West Nile this
year in New York City, which was the epicenter of the outbreak last
year. In 1999, the first known appearance of the disease in the
Western Hemisphere, seven people were killed: five from the city,
one from Suffolk and one from Westchester. Extensive measures,
ranging from pesticide spraying by helicopter to dropping
larvicides in catch basins, were undertaken throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they planned to spray from trucks late
Wednesday night and early Thursday in the sections of Staten Island
where the infected birds were found.
</P>
<P>
   Novello said it was no surprise to find mosquitoes carrying the
virus, given all the birds that tested positive in recent weeks.
Birds, like humans, get the disease from mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the sample from Westchester revealed the virus for
the first time in the Aedes japonicus mosquito, a recent arrival in
the Northeast, which is ''likely to be a daytime feeder.'' She said
adults tend to be found in wooded areas, larvae in small water
containers such as discarded tires.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito previously identified with the virus is the Culex
pipiens, generally active between dusk and dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Novello said measures already in place to minimize exposure to
mosquitoes should be maintained - ''this time during the daytime,
as well as at night.''
</P>
<P>
   They include covering bare skin and applying a repellent
containing DEET; removing any outdoor items that hold water,
including blocked gutters and old tires; repairing broken screens;
and regular cleaning and chlorination of swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk County Health Services spokeswoman Millie Svatek said
that although the county's Department of Public Works has been
regularly spraying for mosquitoes - since years before the advent
of West Nile - ''This is different. This spraying is in order to
prevent or reduce the transmission of this disease.'' Applications
were scheduled for Tuesday evening in Lindenhurst, West Babylon and
Point O' Woods on Fire Island.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were announced as scientists from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Geological Survey were
working in the region to assess existing preventive measures and to
try some new ones - like trapping house sparrows to test them for
antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Landrigan said the CDC was working in Westchester on Monday, and
Geological Survey spokesman Butch Kinerney said his agency was
working in Bergen County, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Novello said she had contacted the CDC ''to discuss a
multistate, regional approach to prepare a plan of action to fight
the disease.''

<HEADLINE> New president sworn in in Fiji  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's new president, a frail and elderly
tribal chief, was sworn in Tuesday and immediately urged
reconciliation in the ethnically divided nation that had been
paralyzed by a two-month hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Ratu Josefa Iloilo took the oath of office in a stately official
residence overlooking the harbor of the capital, Suva.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are one, as one nation and one people,'' Iloilo told an
audience that included nationalist coup leader George Speight, the
country's former military head of state Commodore Frank
Bainimarama, and former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka.
</P>
<P>
   Iloilo, his left hand shaking from Parkinson's disease, said he
would be ''dedicated to promoting national unity and encouraging
moderation, inclusiveness, consideration and compassion of all in
our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight, who backed Iloilo's appointment, said: ''We are
pleased, it's a good day for the Fijian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Iloilo is expected to name a new Cabinet within days and the
world is waiting to see if it will include Speight supporters. If
it does, Fiji is likely to be slapped with international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   A steady stream of officials trooped in and out of Iloilo's home
Monday as behind-the-scenes negotiations to form the new Cabinet
intensified.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports Speight was unhappy with a scenario that
would include few of his men and allow Laisenia Qarase, who was
sworn in two weeks ago by the military as interim prime minister,
to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has already released a list of supporters he wants in
the Cabinet, including Ratu Epeli Kanaimawi as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Qarase's prospects rose Friday, however, after he released a
blueprint for Fiji's future that was branded as racist for
guaranteeing political superiority and affirmative action for
indigenous Fijians and promising redistribution of resources to
benefit them.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the stated goals of the May 19 coup that Speight led.
The last 18 of dozens of legislators taken hostage in Parliament
were freed last Thursday as part of a deal that Speight said would
disenfranchise ethnic Indians, who make up 44 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has vowed a renewal of the civil disturbances that
wracked the country for 11 days until the hostage release if he
finds the Cabinet unacceptable. He is particularly interested in
ensuring that his backers dominate a commission that will write a
new constitution.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand did not wait even for the Cabinet lineup to be
announced, imposing sanctions Monday. The sanctions include
suspension of joint military exercises, reduced development aid and
ending student visits and sporting visas.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would find ethnic Indians acceptable in the Cabinet,
Speight replied, ''Not at the moment, not if I can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   He described deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry's declared
intention to return to office as ''misguided.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Chaudhry being beaten up while being held by Speight
and a gang of gunmen for two months in Fiji's Parliament, Speight
said, ''He's OK, he was roughed up once and beaten once. He's lucky
he's alive.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton denies using anti-Semitic slur  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The Anti-Defamation League on Monday defended
Hillary Rodham Clinton against allegations she used an anti-Semitic
slur 26 years ago, and the first lady portrayed herself as the
victim of a ''warehouse of insults'' from the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Jewish leaders, meanwhile, lashed out at her. And
her Republican opponent for Senate, Rep. Rick Lazio, said it's up
to the voters to decide what to think.
</P>
<P>
   The ADL said in a statement that it takes Clinton at her word
that the accusation is false. ''Her public record shows no evidence
of anti-Semitism, and we do not believe her to hold negative views
about Jews,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   American Jewish Committee executive director David Harris
agreed, adding: ''The allegations are highly suspect. Suspect
because of their source, suspect because they come 26 years after
the alleged incident, and suspect because they come amid a heated
Senate campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusation is made in a book due out this week that says the
first lady uttered the slur the night Bill Clinton lost a
congressional bid in Arkansas in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ''State of a Union: Inside the Complex Marriage of
Bill and Hillary Clinton,'' is by former National Enquirer reporter
Jerry Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer quotes Paul Fray, who worked for
Bill Clinton's congressional campaign, as claiming that Hillary
Clinton called him a ''Jew b------'' after Clinton lost.
</P>
<P>
   Fray is not Jewish, but one of his grandparents was. Oppenheimer
said the account was confirmed by Fray's wife and another campaign
worker who heard the argument through a closed door. Fray did not
immediately return a call made Monday to a phone number listed in
his wife's name.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady called a news conference at her home in Chappaqua
on Sunday to deny the allegations. And then on Monday, she
complained that the GOP was trying to tar her in general.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been accused of a lot of different things. I'm sure
they'll come up with a lot more,'' she said. ''Apparently they have
a whole warehouse of insults.''
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign also released a 1997 letter, which the first lady
said was from Fray, in which he begged her ''forgiveness'' for
saying ''things against you ... without factual foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Any reasonable person looking at the evidence in this case
would conclude there's no credibility on the other side,'' Clinton
said. ''I have a lot of confidence in the fundamental good judgment
of New Yorkers to see through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was asked about the controversy after touring a Harlem
school and said: ''I think this is a very disturbing comment. This
is sort of a 'she said, they said' situation. ... I don't know who
to believe. New Yorkers don't know who to believe. And therein lies
a good deal of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio added, ''It's up to the voters to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also got support Monday from Gail Sheehy, author of the
book ''Hillary's Choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy told The Associated Press that she had heard the story of
the alleged anti-Semitic comment several years ago from Fray's
wife. But Sheehy said she left it out of her book because it was
''off the wall. It was totally without credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of conservative Jewish groups held a news
conference Monday outside Clinton's midtown campaign office to
criticize her.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no statute of limitations for racism or anti-Semitism
or bigotry,'' said state Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a leader of
Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers cited Clinton's embrace of wife of Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, and President Clinton's role in brokering a
Middle East peace deal they do not support.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the Camp David peace talks between Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart called the allegation against the first lady ''scurrilous
and untrue'' and said it shows ''how deep in the gutter some people
can go.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also defended his wife in an interview in Monday's
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ''She might have called him a b------,'' Clinton told the
newspaper. ''I wouldn't rule that out. She's never claimed that she
was pure on profanity. But I've never heard her tell a joke with an
ethnic connotation.''

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Fernandez Out for Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Florida Marlins pitcher Alex Fernandez will
miss the rest of the season, it was announced Monday, after a sore
shoulder that sidelined him for two months failed to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez was 4-4 with a 4.13 ERA before being placed on the
15-day disabled list on May 19. The day before, Fernandez threw 100
pitches in five innings against the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander has a strained rotator cuff and a strained
ulnar collateral ligament in the elbow of his pitching arm. He's
considering his options for dealing with the career-threatening
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things are not good,'' manager John Boles said before the
Marlins' game Monday at Baltimore. ''It's not a healthy shoulder.
That's all there is to it. I feel tremendously sad for Alex,
because he loves to pitch so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez missed a start on May 11 with a sore elbow, but
returned a week later against the Padres and allowed nine hits and
three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, 30, was first diagnosed with the injury during the
1997 NL Championship Series and was unable to pitch in the World
Series won by the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out the 1998 season, Fernandez was chosen as the
NL Comeback Player of the Year last season. He went 7-8 with a 3.38
ERA in 141 innings, while being held to a limited pitch count.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, sidelined since May 19, began throwing earlier this
week, but gave up on pitching again this season after consulting
with doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pain was excruciating, and he just couldn't do it,'' Boles
said.

<HEADLINE> Trooper video of shooting puts focus on whether officers were threatened </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) - No officers can be seen standing in the
path of a car driven by an unarmed motorist before it lurched
forward, possibly touching a police car, backed up toward a state
police car, then moved forward again, triggering a volley of shots,
a viewing of a trooper videotape shows.
</P>
<P>
   The car then rolled back about a foot, triggering a second, but
shorter, set of shots that end after the driver, Stanton Crew,
jerked forward, the tape shows.
</P>
<P>
   The entire shooting lasted just over 10 seconds and began just
seven seconds after Crew was run off the highway.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear from the tape whether there were any shouted
warnings to Crew, and the tape does not show the entire scene along
the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Crew, 31, of Morristown, died early June 2, 1999, on an
embankment off the shoulder of Interstate 80 in Parsippany
following a 15-mile chase that police said began when he failed to
stop for a traffic violation in Dover. His passenger, Adrienne
Hart, then 22, was wounded in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Morris County Prosecutor John B. Dangler obtained a court order
to release the videotape Monday, four days after federal
authorities announced they would not prosecute the two police
officers and two troopers who fired 27 times at Crew.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they fired because they feared for their lives after
Crew began ramming the two cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   Crew family lawyer Linda B. Kenney said the tape calls that
account into question and that the family has been pushing for its
release.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't call it a ramming. I would call it a hitting of the
car,'' Kenney said. ''He was trying to get out of the line of fire
where he was corralled into.''
</P>
<P>
   A Morris County grand jury in December found the four officers
broke no laws when they killed Crew but nonetheless asked
authorities to evaluate how police officers are trained to use
deadly force.
</P>
<P>
   The video, which was seen by the grand jury, was made by a
camera mounted on a state police car containing two troopers who
did not fire, said Capt. Christopher Linne, a spokesman for the
Morris prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Linne said authorities would not comment on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   A message for Crew's family was not immediately returned Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Kenney said they expect to file a wrongful death lawsuit in
about two weeks charging that Crew's civil rights were violated.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Crew's family believes he did not pull over for
police because he was driving with a suspended license. Crew, who
was black, possibly feared law officers because of the wounding of
three young minority men on the New Jersey Turnpike a year earlier,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As it turns out, he was right,'' Kenney said.
</P>
<P>
   Crew's Morristown family, who have also hired lawyer Johnnie
Cochran and made the Rev. Al Sharpton an ally, have said officers
shot Crew because he was black. Three of the officers are white and
one is Hispanic. The police are from the Denville and Parsippany
departments. Hart is white.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury concluded that race had no role in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-minute, 15-second color videotape shows the end of the
chase, apparently when that car joined the pursuit, including when
Crew makes a U-turn across a grassy median.
</P>
<P>
   Crew's blue Camaro is eventually chased by at least six police
cars and run off the right side of the highway in a cloud of dust.
</P>
<P>
   Officers scrambled out of their vehicles and drew their weapons
as the Camaro moved forward, then in reverse, and forward again.
About seven seconds after Crew came onto the embankment, shooting
started.
</P>
<P>
   Over a dozen shots can be heard in about three seconds. After
about a four-second pause, during which the Camaro rolled back
about a foot, police fire over a half-dozen shots during about four
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   A voice can be heard shouting ''cease fire'' three times. By
then, officers are crouched and peering in at the passenger and
driver-side windows with drawn guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Get out of the car and put your hands up,'' somebody then
yelled before the tape is turned off.
</P>
<P>
   The Crew shooting, and the earlier shooting on the turnpike,
prompted the state attorney general's office to examine
use-of-force policies. Last month, it issued new guidelines that
limited police officers' ability to fire on moving vehicles and
required them to file separate reports every time force is used.
</P>
<P>
   The two troopers in the turnpike shooting were indicted on
attempted murder charges and await trial.
</P>
<P>
   State investigations led to admissions that the New Jersey State
Police have routinely targeted motorists because of their race.

<HEADLINE> Prince Charles Won't Remarry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prince Charles does not intend to marry his
longtime companion Camilla Parker Bowles, according to a letter by
his private secretary published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was sent Monday to Britain's Press Complaints
Commission in response to an article in The Sunday Times claiming
that the prince was considering remarrying in Scotland. It was
reported in the national media Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Decisions like this are not taken lightly. We have got to the
end of our tether,'' the letter, written by Stephen Lamport, said.
''There is no intention of remarrying. We keep saying it, but it is
ignored or dismissed as dissembling.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not just about the Prince of Wales. He is concerned
for the feelings of his children, the children of Mrs. Parker
Bowles, the memory of his late wife, and his public role,'' it
continued.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is to be no wedding and so it is pointless speculation
otherwise,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a formal complaint has been lodged
directly on Charles' behalf with the press commission. Previously,
he had only complained about an invasion of his sons' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Charles and his advisers have been at pains to have the public
accept 52-year-old Parker Bowles, who the prince's ex-wife, the
late Princess Diana, blamed for the breakup of their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   When his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, agreed to meet Parker
Bowles earlier this year, there was frenzied speculation in the
media that a marriage might be in the future. Opinion polls have
shown that the public would not be in favor of them marrying.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Times had claimed that Charles was mulling over a
Scottish marriage because The Presbyterian Church of Scotland is
willing to remarry divorced people. The Anglican Church of England
frowns on divorce.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore has gained support from women and independents,
according to a poll released today, closing an overall gap with Republican
George W. Bush in the presidential race. Bush was at 48 percent and Gore was at
46 percent in the poll of likely voters by CNN-USA Today-Gallup. The error
margin was 4 percentage points, meaning that the two candidates were even.

Alberta Promises Aid for Twister Victims
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- The hundreds of victims of the Pine
Lake tornado and those who moved swiftly to help them won't have to
bear the financial burden of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta Premier Ralph Klein announced a comprehensive financial
assistance package Monday, aid that could amount to millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll rose to 11 when Lisa Gourley, a 30-year-old
Calgary woman, succumbed to her injuries in hospital Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Forty other people remained in central Alberta hospitals. More
than 100 had been treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary estimate put the damage at $12 million, but the
related costs of the search and cleanup could send that figure
soaring.
</P>
<P>
   The Pine Lake tornado -- rated an F3 on a scale of one to five --
has been the ugly exception to a relatively tame summer of severe
Prairie weather, said Jay Anderson of Environment Canada.

Former Alberta Treasurer Said Safe in BC
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- If there is one place where
Alliance Party leader Stockwell Day's political future is safer
than in Alberta, it is in British Columbia's Okanagan Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Constituents of Okanagan-Coquihalla, where the former Alberta
treasurer will run in an upcoming federal byelection, share
Alberta's social and economic conservative values in spades, said
one political observer.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of these people are ferocious low-taxers,'' said Carl
Hodge, chair of political sciences at Okanagan University College
which has campuses in the riding.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the first thing they think of. When they want a
politician, they want tax-cuts out of the politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodge said social conservative issues such as abortion and
homosexual marriages may alienate voters in the rest of Canada, but
they find support in the Okanagan, a largely rural riding.
</P>
<P>
   The valley has traditionally been a stronghold for conservative
political parties at the federal and provincial levels. It is one
of the country's largest ridings, engulfing three provincial
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Day's decision to run in the Okanagan is motivated by the
Alliance party's need to stretch its political base.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia has so far proven to be an Alliance stronghold
but the province's politics are unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   With burgeoning elderly and First Nations populations, health
care and treaty rights are issues of priority in the riding.

Labrador Inuits Seek Alcohol Ban
</P>
<P>
   NAIN, Newfoundland (AP) -- Another suicide on the weekend -- the
eighth in five months -- has prompted protesters to redouble their
efforts to have booze banned in Labrador's largest Inuit community.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, RCMP in Nain reported a 20-year-old man had taken his
own life the night before. No other details were available.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, when a cargo ship arrived in Nain carrying 134,000
cans of beer, a small group carrying placards gathered at the wharf
to call for an end to such shipments.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, RCMP reported that a 34-year-old man had hanged
himself. Sources in the community say the man took his own life
after his common-law wife failed to return home after a drinking
binge.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in Nain has been stuck at around 80 per cent for
years and the Labrador Inuit are the only Inuit group in Canada
without a land-claim settlement, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Urges End To Olympic Probe  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL FOY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch is weighing into the
Justice Department's investigation of the Olympic bribery scandal,
urging federal prosecutors to play their hand or back off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm tired of it,'' the Republican from Utah said Monday in an
interview from Washington D.C., defending the leaders of Salt
Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. ''It's time to
wrap it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Welch and Dave Johnson have endured a 19-month federal
investigation and last week rejected a government plea bargain
involving felony tax fraud. Their lawyers continued negotiating
with federal prosecutors on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch is among Olympic boosters who worry the Utah games could
take place against the backdrop of a criminal trial forcing a Who's
Who of Utah to the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that oversees
the Justice Department, said he didn't know what evidence was being
gathered by federal investigators. But he doubted the investigation
is uncovering any serious criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch also defended Welch and Johnson by saying they were forced
to compete against other ''vote-buying'' cities bidding for the
Olympics. Hatch recalled a history of bitter defeats for Utah
before it finally was awarded the games by the International
Olympic Committee in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He said Salt Lake was getting ''clobbered'' for what had been a
long-standing practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the way the game was played. It's the way it has been
played for decades. It's what they had to do to get the Olympics:
Wine and dine these people and go out of your way for them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten IOC members resigned or were ousted last year after a Salt
Lake Organizing Committee ethics panel reported the bid paid $1.2
million in cash, gifts, scholarships and other inducements to win
the games.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has obtained guilty pleas to tax fraud
from a Salt Lake businessman and a former U.S. Olympic official in
connection with the scandal, and a grand jury indicted the son of
South Korean IOC member Kim Un-yong for immigration fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But Welch and Johnson are considered the investigation's chief
targets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless (prosecutors) can find serious criminal violations -- I
question it -- I just hope we can get it behind us,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin would not respond
because the investigation is still under way. But Hatch had
criticism to answer from others.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like he's trying to influence the investigation,''
Meghan Holbrook, who heads up Utah's Democratic Party, told Salt
Lake's KTVX-TV. ''It's also extremely improper and inappropriate as
chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee for him to even comment on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch has made liberal use of his Judiciary platform to
criticize the Justice Department. He said he wasn't trying to
influence the Olympic investigation, but one lawyer charged Hatch
has tried to run political interference at the Justice Department
for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''He holds the purse strings,'' said Nancy Luque, a Washington
lawyer trying to overturn the conviction of Clinton-Gore
fund-raiser Maria Hsia.
</P>
<P>
   In a pending court motion, Luque objected to a Judiciary
subcommittee hearing where Republicans summoned a Justice
Department prosecutor and urged him to seek the maximum possible
sentence for Hsia. She was convicted last summer of arranging
$100,000 in illegal foreign contributions for the 1996 presidential
campaign.

<HEADLINE> AF Capt. Charged in Kuwait Accident  </HEADLINE>
By TOM PARSONS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The Air Force pilot commanding a C-130
that crashed last year in Kuwait, killing three passengers, was
charged Monday with dereliction of duty and negligent homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Darron A. Haughn was charged by Brig. Gen. Richard J.
Casey, based on Casey's review of the results of an investigation
board that looked into the Dec. 10 crash.
</P>
<P>
   The plane Haughn was flying was assigned to the 61st Airlift
Squadron at Little Rock Air Force Base. It was ferrying 86 military
passengers the 23 miles from Kuwait International Airport to Al
Jaber Air Base southwest of Kuwait City when it crashed before
dawn.
</P>
<P>
   At the Arkansas base on March 31, Air Force officials announced
the investigation board concluded the accident stemmed from pilot
and crew error.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Frank Laras, who headed the investigation, said that, after
failing to follow procedures and making an improper approach to a
runway, the air crew didn't keep an eye on instruments and became
disoriented, not realizing how close the plane was to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically ... he flew the plane into the ground,'' Laras said.
</P>
<P>
   Haughn could not be reached for comment Monday; Officials at
Little Rock Air Force Base declined to provide a home telephone
number. Haughn had been removed from flying status.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force said the charges against will be referred to Brig.
Gen. Paul J. Fletcher, 314 Airlift Wing Commander at Little Rock
Air Force Base. The options range from no action to a general
court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum penalty for Haughn, if he were to be convicted by a
general court-martial, would be 3&AMP;frac12; years in prison, dismissal from
the service and forfeiture of all pay and benefits while
imprisoned.

<HEADLINE> Bear Kills, Eats Man in Alaska  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL QUEARY
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- In a rare predatory attack, a brown bear
killed and partially ate a man at a campground a few miles from a
bear-viewing site in far southeast Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The body of George Tullos, 41, was found Saturday at the Run
Amuck campground near Hyder, a small community on the Canadian
border about 75 miles northeast of Ketchikan. The attack apparently
happened sometime late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not a matter of slapping him around. The bear ate on
him,'' state trooper Sgt. Steve Garrett said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After the bear was shot and killed, biologists found the
victim's flesh in its stomach, said Bruce Dinneford, regional
management coordinator for the state Division of Wildlife
Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service maintains a bear-viewing site near
Hyder, but the campground is more than three miles away from the
tourist attraction, said Paul Larkin, who operates the viewing
area.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-pound male bear showed up about 10 days ago and quickly
became a problem for a town of 140 accustomed to bears, rummaging
through garbage and scrounging for food.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a bear who was an opportunist, taking advantage of
what he could find,'' Larkin said. ''We don't see many bears like
this, thank goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   The night before the attack, Larkin and others tried to trap the
bear so it could be moved out of town, but were thwarted by a
faulty trigger mechanism in the trap.
</P>
<P>
   Tullos, who was in Hyder for the summer to work at a restaurant,
had apparently gone to the secluded area of the campground to
sleep, Larkin said.
</P>
<P>
   After his body was found Saturday, workers at a nearby sawmill
spotted the bear at the dump. Workers shot the animal.
</P>
<P>
   Predatory bear attacks are very rare because bears perceive
humans as a threat rather than prey, said Bruce Bartley, a
spokesman for the state wildlife division.
</P>
<P>
   Bartley could recall only three reported cases of bears
attacking people and eating them in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyder attack was the first one his agency has heard about in
Alaska this year, Bartley said.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 3, Reds 1  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Rich Becker drove in two runs and Dave Mlicki won
his second straight decision as the Detroit Tigers beat the
Cincinnati Reds 3-1 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki (4-9), making his first start since July 4, gave up one
run on eight hits with two walks and three strikeouts in 6 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki, who pitched one inning of relief July 8, was relieved by
C.J. Nitkowski with one out and runners at first and third in the
seventh. Nitkowski got Ken Griffey Jr. on a liner to right and
Dante Bichette on a grounder to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Brocail pitched the eighth, setting up Todd Jones for his
25th save in 26 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Luebbers (0-1), making his first appearance of the season,
gave up three runs on seven hits in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Luebbers, recalled July 12 after Denny Neagle was traded to the
New York Yankees, faced Detroit for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, who have won 16 of their last 25 games, took a 3-0
lead with four hits after two were out in the second. Damion Easley
reached on an infield single, stole second and scored the first run
on Shane Halter's RBI single. Luis Polonia doubled, then Becker
stroked a two-run single to left.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds made it 3-1 in the sixth when Bichette doubled to start
the inning and scored on Dmitri Young's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Easley had a one-out triple in the fourth, but Luebbers got
Halter on a grounder and Polonia flied out to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer, who hit a two-out triple in the fifth, was out at
the plate trying to score when Luebbers uncorked a wild pitch with
a 1-1 count on Deivi Cruz. Catcher Eddie Taubensee, who entered the
game in the second after Benito Santiago experienced back spasms,
chased the ball down near the Reds' on-deck circle and flipped it
to Luebbers in plenty of time to nip Palmer.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Juan Encarnacion, running hard to his right in center
field, stretched out full to make a spectacular diving catch that
robbed Young leading off the Reds' second. ... The Reds gave Palmer
an intentional walk to load the bases in the first and it paid off
when Cruz grounded into an inning-ending double play.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Commissioner Halts Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The state's acting insurance
commissioner has closed an inquiry into leaks of department
documents, an investigation ordered by the former head of the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Acting Insurance Commissioner Clark Kelso
terminated an effort by former commissioner Chuck Quackenbush to
recover copies of the documents already in circulation, and to pull
them off the state Senate's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The documents are at the center of the scandal that drove
Quackenbush from office early this month. The documents found that
insurance companies bilked hundreds of policyholders following the
1994 Los Angeles earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   However, instead of fines that could have totaled billions of
dollars, Quackenbush allowed the companies to pay far less into a
nonprofit fund that critics say later helped him politically.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, Quackenbush ordered an investigation into the
unauthorized release of the studies. Quackenbush and insurance
companies contended the release was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Later, it was disclosed that an Insurance Department lawyer
released them to the Assembly Insurance Committee. A Senate
committee subsequently released dozens of copies to the news media
and posted them on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush sued to recover the copies and remove them from the
Web. Kelso dropped those efforts Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Continuation of these lawsuits will, in the end, serve no
purpose,'' Kelso said in a statement. It was unlikely a court would
order recovery of the copies, given their wide dissemination, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Plane Was To Be Grounded  </HEADLINE>
By INDRANIL SINGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATNA, India (AP) -- A Boeing 737-200 jet that crashed and burst
into flames Monday, killing 55 people on board and on the ground in
this eastern Indian city, was scheduled to be taken out of service
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The plane smashed into two homes about a mile from its
destination, leaving weeping relatives digging through flaming
wreckage in search of more survivors and officials trying to
determine what caused the crash. Seven of the 58 people on the
plane survived.
</P>
<P>
   ''Miracles do take place in this world. I thank God for it,''
said Bharat Rungta, a passenger who told Press Trust of India he
was jolted out of sleep when the Alliance Air plane went down. ''I
managed to jump out of the plane,'' he said from his hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   Indian aviation guidelines call for aircraft to be grounded
after 20 years -- the exact age of the plane that crashed Monday,
according to the domestic news agency United News of India. But a
Boeing spokesman in Seattle, Russ Young, said the planes can fly
''virtually indefinitely,'' as long as they are properly
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Airlines, the government-owned parent of Alliance Air,
wants to replace all its 737s and Airbus 300s in two years, UNI
said. A panel studying ways to modernize the fleet is expected to
report in August.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight crashes since 1973 involving Indian Airlines, six
have been Boeing 737s.
</P>
<P>
   But Indian Airlines maintained the aircraft's age was not a
factor Monday. ''This aircraft was fully airworthy,'' Indian
Airlines spokesman Robin Pathak said in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a question of whether an aircraft is old or new, what
counts is whether it is maintained well enough,'' Pathak said.
''There are more than 1,000 planes flying elsewhere that are more
than 25 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine bodies, most of them burned beyond recognition, were
pulled from wreckage after the Boeing 737-200 crashed into two
brick houses near the capital of Bihar.
</P>
<P>
   S.P. Modi, director of the airport authority at Patna, said the
crash killed 51 of the 58 people on board, and four people on the
ground. The plane carried no foreigners, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Young said the company had sent an investigator to the crash
site.
</P>
<P>
   Another Boeing spokesman in Seattle, Gary Lesser, said the plane
was delivered in June 1980 and had recorded 42,000 flight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Civil Aviation Minister Sharad Yadav announced a judicial
inquiry into the crash and said the plane's cockpit voice recorder
had been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The jet crashed while making a second attempt to land at an
airport in Patna. Several witnesses said the plane was on fire
before it came down, though a national aviation official said it
was not.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, relatives, police and airport workers rushed to
the wreckage and searched for survivors. They used shovels, bare
hands and homemade implements to dig through debris and pull people
from the damaged houses.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven survivors were taken to the hospital -- seven of them from
the plane and four from the housing complex, hospital officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Civil Aviation Ministry secretary A.H. Jung told reporters that
the pilot, Capt. Sohan Pal, had requested to circle for a second
time before attempting a landing -- something Jung said was not
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   But Pal, who had 4,300 flying hours, may have been flying too
low as he made his second approach, Jung said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was nothing wrong with the plane's systems. The pilot
reported no problems during the flight,'' he said. He said the
plane was in ''perfect condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses on the ground and at least one survivor said the plane
was smoking or in flames before it smashed into the Gardanibagh
housing complex for government employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sitting by the window in the front section of the
aircraft, which started shaking dangerously when we were preparing
to land after smoke was sighted,'' said Rohit Ranjan Sinha, a
Calcutta businessman. He survived with burns.
</P>
<P>
   The United News of India quoted witness Ullas Mandal as saying:
''I saw the aircraft wrapped in smoke, wobbling in the sky at a low
altitude for a few seconds before its left wing was torn off after
grazing a neem tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Jung denied those reports.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was en route to New Delhi, with scheduled stops at
Patna and Lucknow. The majority on board had booked their flights
to Patna, a city of 1.5 million and the capital of India's poorest
state, Bihar, airline officials in Calcutta said.
</P>
<P>
   India has a poor record of air safety because of outdated
equipment at most of its airports.
</P>
<P>
   The international airports at New Delhi, Bombay, Madras and
Calcutta started using sophisticated air traffic control systems by
U.S. manufacturer Raytheon in 1999. That was more than two years
after a collision between a Saudi airliner and a Kazak cargo plane
over New Delhi killed 349 people in India's worst air crash.

   Miller, a member of the Special Forces, also known as the Green
Berets, was sent to Vietnam in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   He received the Medal of Honor -- the nation's highest award for
valor -- for his actions on Jan. 5, 1970. While leading a seven-man
patrol of American soldiers and Montagnard tribesmen in Laos, a
booby trap injured five of Miller's men and alerted a North
Vietnamese reconnaissance patrol, which began an attack that
continued through the day.
</P>
<P>
   During the exchange, every man in the patrol was wounded,
including Miller, who was shot in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   As Miller, the only member of the patrol able to keep fighting,
was running out of ammunition at nightfall, a relief patrol
evacuated him and the other two survivors.
</P>
<P>
   He received the Medal of Honor from President Nixon on June 15,
1971.

<HEADLINE> Marriage Tax Relief Nears Vote  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to draw sharp contrasts with Democrats
over tax cuts, Republicans pushed Monday for congressional approval
of a bill to slash income taxes by $248 billion over 10 years for
married couples, including those now paying more than two single
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate began by defeating a number of Democratic amendments,
including a 50-46 vote against a less costly alternative that would
have given married couples a choice of filing taxes as singles or
jointly. Final Senate passage was set for Tuesday, with swift
action expected to follow in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to send President Clinton a clean ''marriage
penalty'' bill before the GOP's presidential nominating convention
begins July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will see who supports marriage tax relief, and we will see
who thinks American families are not entitled to this relief,''
said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., the Senate Finance Committee
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he could sign the measure into law only under
one condition: that Congress also send him legislation creating a
prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart accused Republicans of playing politics by
passing the tax-cut bill alone to force a veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can make political points, pass bills so they can talk
about them at their convention, or we can get marriage penalty
relief and prescription drugs for seniors,'' Lockhart said. ''It's
up to them: politics or substance?''
</P>
<P>
   Elimination of the marriage penalty was the centerpiece of the
$792 billion Republican tax cut vetoed last year by the president.
Republicans have spent this year passing bite-sized pieces of that
larger tax cut using the huge budget surplus, hoping to frame
clearer election-year distinctions between themselves and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A new Treasury Department analysis of seven GOP tax measures
that have passed the House Ways and Means Committee so far this
year said that together, 76 percent of the cuts would go to the 23
million wealthiest families. The remaining 91 million familes would
get just over 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told reporters the
administration prefers tax cuts targeted at low- and middle-income
taxpayers instead of ''large tax cuts that are heavily backloaded
and primarily benefit the highest-income Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty bill gradually would enlarge both the 15
percent and 28 percent tax brackets so they apply to a greater
share of a married couple's income. Today, two single people enjoy
wider tax brackets than a comparable married couple, resulting in
an average tax bill $1,400 higher for 25 million couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not just tax relief, it's a tax correction,'' said
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would boost a married couple's standard
deduction in 2001 so that it equals that of two single people -- in
2000 dollars, an increase from $7,350 to $8,800. It would increase
the income cap for low-income couples who claim the earned-income
tax credit and ensure that the alternative minimum tax is not
triggered when couples claim any of several personal credits.
</P>
<P>
   The failed Democratic alternative would have given couples the
choice of filing joint tax returns or as two singles, whichever
benefits them more, with benefits phasing out at incomes between
$100,000 and $150,000. That would cost $54 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We say: You choose. It is your choice,'' said Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the Republican bill would cut taxes of millions of
married couples who don't now pay penalties, usually those in which
one spouse earns most of the family income, and would give
unnecessarily large tax cuts to upper-income people.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't a marriage-penalty bill. It's a tax cut disguised
as a marriage-penalty bill,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans planned action on several other tax bills this week:
</P>
<P>
   --The House is expected to pass legislation gradually raising
contribution limits for individual retirement accounts from $2,000
to $5,000 annually and for 401(k)s from $10,500 to $15,000. Total
cost: About $17 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   --The House Ways and Means Committee will consider a bill to
repeal a 1993 tax increase in which income tax was imposed on 85
percent -- up from 50 percent -- of Social Security benefits of
recipients earning over $34,000 for individuals, $44,000 for
married couples. That bill would cost an estimated $44.6 billion
over five years.
--------
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty bill is H.R. 4810.

<HEADLINE> Indians 8, Astros 6  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Rookie Tim Drew got his first major league win
as Travis Fryman's three-run double capped Cleveland's six-run
fifth inning Monday night and sent the Indians to an 8-6 win over
the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome homered twice -- one a 479-foot shot -- and Kenny
Lofton, batting leadoff again, went 2-for-3 with two steals and
made two nice catches before crashing into the wall in center for
the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Drew, making his second big league start, allowed two runs and
three hits in five innings. The younger brother of St. Louis
outfielder J.D. Drew walked four, struck out three and gave the
Indians a reason to keep him around for a while as their No. 5
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Karsay pitched the ninth for his 19th save.
</P>
<P>
   Down 0-2 in the count with two outs in the fifth, Fryman doubled
to the gap in left-center off rookie Wade Miller (0-2), who limited
the Indians to one run and two hits before the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Sandy Alomar Jr. and Omar Vizquel sandwiched RBI
doubles around a run-scoring single by Lofton. After Miller got two
outs, Houston manager Larry Dierker had Miller intentionally walk
Thome to face Fryman, the Indians' All-Star third baseman and best
player this year.
</P>
<P>
   Daryle Ward and Richard Hidalgo hit two-run homers for the
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo's 26th homer gave the Astros a 2-0 lead in the second.
He followed a one-out walk to Moises Alou by ripping a 1-1 pitch
from Drew over the wall in left.
</P>
<P>
   Thome brought the Indians within a run in the bottom of the
inning with his 24th homer of the season and first since June 27.
</P>
<P>
   Ward hit his 14th homer in the seventh off Jamie Brewington to
make it 7-4. The Astros got within 7-5 when Craig Biggio hit into a
double play, but Lofton ended the inning by running down Jeff
Bagwell's drive to deep center.
</P>
<P>
   Thome gave the Indians a little breathing room with his
tape-measure shot in the seventh, the third-longest homer in Jacobs
Field history.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Lofton was moved back into the leadoff spot after 12 games
batting lower in the order. ... The Indians' 40-26 four-year
interleague record is the AL's best. ... Houston is 6-8 vs. the AL
this season after going 22-7 in interleague play the past two
years. ... Crew chief Jim McKean returned to his home in St.
Petersburg, Fla., after partially tearing his left Achilles' tendon
while working home plate during Sunday's game. McKean was replaced
by umpire Lance Barksdale, and Dan Morrison took McKean's crew
chief duties. ... Drew lasted just one-plus innings in his big
league debut May 24. ... Indians OF Ricky Ledee was a late scratch
with the flu. ... Lofton robbed Julio Lugo of extra bases with an
over-the-shoulder catch before crashing into the wall in deep
center in the third.

<HEADLINE> Five Killed in Mass. Highway Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH ATTLEBORO, Mass. (AP) -- A tractor-trailer apparently
careened off a highway and pulled another car off the road with it,
bursting into flames and killing the five people inside the
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's total destruction of the vehicles involved,'' said
Fire Chief Robert Coleman. ''You would not recognize the car from
the truck at this point, that's how bad it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The tractor-trailer cut a swath through some woods and came to a
stop about five feet from the back of a house, about 100 feet from
Interstate 95. The porch of the house caught fire, but the blaze
was extinguished quickly.
</P>
<P>
   State police said they believe the accident occurred when a car
in the northbound lanes slowed down for construction and hit a
barrier. As traffic was slowing down for that accident, the truck
hit the car and caused a chain reaction involving another car and
two smaller trucks, State Police Lt. Paul Maloney said.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Rules on Tobacco Ads  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN POPE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Monday upheld most of
the strict regulations on tobacco advertising imposed by
Massachusetts last year, ruling they do not violate the free speech
rights of tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The court largely upheld lower court rulings against cigarette,
smokeless tobacco and cigar companies that sued the state over and
health-warning label requirements and bans on outdoor advertising
and advertising within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said the state attorney general would have to
reformulate regulations governing cigar advertising. The state
cannot regulate such advertising on Web sites or in national
magazines distributed in Massachusetts, the court ruled. Nor can it
hold manufacturers responsible if their products are sold in
Massachusetts, even by a third party, without the required warning
label.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts was the first state to require a conspicuous
warning label covering at least 25 percent of the front or top
panel of every package of cigars. Warnings would also cover at
least 20 percent of any advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling consolidated a variety of challenges to the
regulations by Lorillard Tobacco Co., Brown and Williamson Corp.,
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Philip Morris, as well as several
cigar and tobacco exporting companies.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco and cigar companies argued the regulations were
pre-empted by federal law and violated the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But the court ruled that Congress had not intended for the
Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act to stop states from
imposing their own regulations, and the regulations do not violate
free speech rights because they are ''proportionate to the state's
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly we're disappointed,'' said Brendan McCormick, a
spokesman for Philip Morris Inc. ''We challenged several of those
regulations because we believe that several of them unduly restrict
our ability to market a legal product to adult smokers.'' He said
the decision may be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach spokesmen for Lorillard, Brown and Williamson
and R.J. Reynolds and several of the cigar companies Monday night
were unsuccessful.

<HEADLINE> Experts Begin Cuba, US Trade Probe  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Two trade experts hired by the American government
have quietly arrived here for fact-finding portion of the first
U.S. investigation into the effects of the 38-year-old embargo
against Cuba, a U.S. source confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The two economists arrived here on Sunday for a weeklong mission
for the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent federal
agency, said the source, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The pair was to meet with Cuban officials and foreigners doing
business here to put together a report for the U.S. Congress, the
source said. The economists were not immediately available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The visit is part of a larger investigation that the ITC
announced in April at the request of the House Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will analyze the historical impact of U.S.
sanctions on both the U.S. and Cuban economies, especially on
affected sectors, and on U.S. exports, imports, employment,
consumers, and investment, the ITC said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   A public hearing on the study will be held in Washington in
September, and the ITC will submit its report to the committee by
Feb. 15, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The mission began as three U.S. senators who favor a lifting of
the embargo wrapped up a weekend trip to the communist island.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Max Baucus of Montana and Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, both
Democrats, and Sen. Pat Roberts, a Republican from Kansas, are
among a growing number of American lawmakers who support at least a
partial lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The House last month approved a $75.3 billion spending bill for
farm programs and food regulation after dropping a provision that
would remove restrictions on American food and medicine sales to
Cuba. But House Republican leaders have agreed to try to put a more
restricted version in the final version of the legislation later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   American opponents of the embargo say it has failed their aim of
forcing Castro to create a more open society. Supporters of the
sanctions say they are necessary to punish Castro's government.

<HEADLINE> Agent: Deal Reached George Contract  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans reached an
agreement Monday that will make Eddie George the highest-paid
running back in the NFL, his agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamont Smith confirmed that terms had been reached for a
six-year contract extension worth $42 million, including a $14
million signing bonus that will be paid out over the next 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing we're most pleased about is the deal places him in
that elite category, which he deserves,'' he said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   A news conference was scheduled for 4 p.m. CDT Tuesday at the
Titans' practice facility to announce the extension.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans had made signing George, a three-time Pro Bowl
selection, their top priority after signing coach Jeff Fisher to a
new contract this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   George, the 1995 Heisman Trophy winner from Ohio State, has been
the focus of the offense since he was drafted in 1996, and he had
said he wanted the deal done before reporting for training camp
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   George, who turns 27 in September, has not missed a game in his
first four seasons and has 25 100-yard games. The Titans are 20-5
when he has rushed for 100 yards, and he turned in a career-high
with 1,762 combined yards and a career-best 13 touchdowns last
season as the franchise reached its first Super Bowl in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   George also is one of only four running backs to rush for at
least 1,200 yards in each of their first four seasons, joining Eric
Dickerson, Earl Campbell and Barry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Indianapolis Colts signed rookie Edgerrin James to
a seven-year, $49 million contract, while the St. Louis Rams signed
Marshall Faulk to a seven-year, $45 million deal. Jamal Anderson of
the Atlanta Falcons signed a five-year, $32 million contract last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The signing bonus equals the $14 million cornerback Ty Law
received from the New England Patriots and tops the $13 million to
receiver Keyshawn Johnson of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers or Joey
Galloway's $12 million from the Dallas Cowboys.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 5, Marlins 3  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Delino DeShields homered and drove in three
runs to back a solid seven-inning stint by Jose Mercedes as the
Baltimore Orioles beat the Florida Marlins 5-3 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brady Anderson had three hits, including a solo homer, as the
Orioles won their second straight from the Marlins to improve to
7-10 in interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   DeShields' fifth homer, the second in two games, put Baltimore
up 2-0 in the first inning. He added a sacrifice fly in the third
before Albert Belle singled in a run for a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hit his 12th homer leading off the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes (4-4) allowed three runs and seven hits, walking none
and striking out two to earn his first win as a starter since April
22.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Groom and Mike Trombley worked the eighth and Mike Timlin
got three outs for his 11th save, the second in two games.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Wilson drove in two runs for Florida and Luis Castillo
went 2-for-4. He's 19-for-40 during a nine-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   But the Marlins' third straight loss dropped them to .500
(46-46).
</P>
<P>
   DeShields put the Orioles up 2-0 by driving a 3-2 pitch from
Reid Cornelius (3-3) over the right-field scoreboard after Mike
Bordick reached on a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Florida went up 3-2 in the third. Cliff Floyd blooped an RBI
single to center and Wilson followed with a two-run double, the
Marlins' fourth straight hit off Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   But the right-hander allowed only two singles in his final four
innings while facing the minimum 12 batters.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles took the lead for good in the third on a sacrifice
fly by DeShields and an RBI single by Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes got some defensive help in the sixth. Mike Lowell was
thrown out by B.J. Surhoff trying to stretch a single and rookie
third baseman Ivanon Coffie made a diving stop to rob Derrek Lee of
a hit.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Marlins RHP Alex Fernandez is out for the season, the team
announced Monday. He was sidelined since May 19 with a strained
rotator cuff and a strained elbow ligament. ... It was Anderson's
first three-hit game since June 11. ... Orioles C Charles Johnson
threw out Castillo trying to steal in the fifth, only the 17th time
in 56 tries that the fleet second baseman has been caught. ...
Bordick made his ninth error at shortstop, matching his total for
last season.

<HEADLINE> Raines, Kelly Seek Spots on US Team  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) -- Almost four months after retiring from
the major leagues following a battle with lupus, Tim Raines began a
quest to make the U.S. Olympic baseball team Monday by joining the
Somerset Patriots for a four-game minor league stint.
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Yankees general manager Bob Watson, one of the
chief scouts for the U.S. team, is scheduled to visit Commerce Bank
Park on Thursday to watch Raines and former Yankees infielder Pat
Kelly play in an Atlantic League game.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who also retired a couple of months ago, joined the
Patriots on Monday to start his own four-game Olympic showcase
against the Bridgeport Bluefish.
</P>
<P>
   Raines started in left field and batted second, and drew the
loudest cheers when introduced before the game.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran of 21 years, who won two World Series championships
with the Yankees, broke his bat grounding out in the first inning,
flied out to deep left-center in the third and had a swinging bunt
single down the third-base line leading off the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Raines, who left after the sixth, easily ran down a sinking
liner in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport won the game 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no guarantees,'' said Raines, who looked a little
pudgy at what he said was 10 pounds more than his 195-pounds
playing weight. ''This is just an opportunity for me to make the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to see if I still have the desire to play, the speed
on the basepaths and if I still have the movement in the
outfield,'' said Raines, who had a career .295 average with 964 RBI
and 807 stolen bases, fifth highest in league history. ''It's hard
to judge what a guy can do in four days, but I feel I can do it,
and by September, I know I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines, who turns 41 on Sept. 16 -- the day after the Olympic
opening ceremonies in Sydney, Australia, intended to spend time
with his family and golf after retiring. But Watson telephoned him
a week later and discussed playing for the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Raines get ready for the chance, he's also
considering playing in the majors again.
</P>
<P>
   Raines retired because he just didn't have enough time to get
ready for the season after undergoing treatment for lupus, a
disease in which the immune system turns against its victims.
</P>
<P>
   He lost 50 pounds while taking a heavy dosage of steroid
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the toughest thing I've been through,'' Raines said.
''I've had injuries during the season but never to the point where
I couldn't come back. To be away from the game and not be able to
work out, or run, or throw a ball for seven months is something as
a ballplayer, you hope never happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious that Raines was enjoying himself on Monday night,
and so were his new teammates, mostly former Double-A, Triple-A,
and former major league players looking to get to the bigs.
</P>
<P>
   When Raines stepped into the batting cage about three hours
before the game, almost every player on the field stopped to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rock's in the house,'' Patriots first baseman Antuan Bunkley
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Raines didn't do much with his first few swings, there was
some chatter when he ripped a few line drives on his third trip to
the cage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't played in a real live game since spring training,''
Raines said. ''It should be interesting to see if I can keep my
weight back till the ball gets to me.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he does?
</P>
<P>
   ''Deep down, yeah, I would be lying if I said I felt like I
played my last game,'' Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who retired because of arm problems after spending time
in the Angels' training camp, isn't looking to get back into the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   He'd settle for an Olympic berth, in large part because his
wife, Rebecca, is an Australian.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my last hurrah,'' said Kelly, who spent nine years
with the Yankees, Blue Jays and Cardinals. ''This is a chance to
have a World Series ring and an Olympic medal, which is pretty
special.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Walker Likes Police Rides  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Rockies slugger Larry Walker, who has
participated in civilian ''ride-alongs'' with police, said Monday
he doesn't fear for his safety, although he does wear a bulletproof
vest on such occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The practice came to light Sunday, when it was reported that
Rockies second baseman Mike Lansing was with police when they
conducted a no-knock raid that left an innocent man dead last Sept.
29.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Gerry Whitman on Sunday said Lansing remained in
the police van while officers raided the wrong house and killed
45-year-old Ismael Mena.
</P>
<P>
   The raid by the Denver Metro SWAT unit resulted in the ouster of
former Police Chief Tom Sanchez and the reassignment of Public
Safety Manager Fidel ''Butch'' Montoya. The officer who obtained
the search warrant faces perjury charges, and Denver paid $400,000
to Mena's family in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing was reluctant to comment about the matter, saying, ''I
was on the ride, but I didn't go in the home. I stayed in the van.
It's no big deal. I can't really say anything more.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockies general manager Dan O'Dowd was unavailable to comment
Monday on whether the club was concerned about its players' safety
on ride-alongs and whether it planned to prohibit the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Club spokesman Jay Alves issued only a brief statement. ''We
have been advised by Mike that he was in a van that evening,'' the
statement said. ''He wasn't involved in any way and did not see
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, however, was outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt the club should be concerned about a player's
safety on ride-alongs, Walker said, ''No, absolutely not. We're no
different than any other member of the public who wants to do this.
We sign waivers that allow us to go on these rides.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I go out, I don't get crazy. I sit in the car most of the
time. I wear a bulletproof jacket just for my own state of mind.
You don't have to wear one, but I do. I put it on in case something
crazy happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, the 1997 NL MVP and two-time defending batting champion,
said he won't participate in a ride-along that is likely to subject
officers to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's something dangerous where they're going after a
suspect they've got nailed down or something, I'm not going
there,'' he said. ''They tell you ahead of time. Or if I do go, I
just stay in the police vehicle and don't leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he has gone on ''two or three'' ride-alongs since
coming to Denver in 1995, and at times has accompanied SWAT teams
in Denver and in other cities. He confirmed that Lansing and former
Rockies outfielder Dante Bichette also have participated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a tremendous amount of respect for what the police
do,'' he said. ''I'm fascinated by their work. They're overworked
and underpaid individuals, out there risking their lives. I have a
lot of friends on the force.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just being out there, being in the car and riding around, it
gets me pumped up. You don't need shooting, you don't need chasing.
Being in that car, with access to the siren and lights and speed
and everything -- just thinking about that is enough. You don't need
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker was upset that Lansing was portrayed in a local newspaper
and on television as somehow being culpable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so bizarre, so sad,'' he said. ''What did Mike Lansing
do? He rode in the car. What did the policemen do? They did their
job. They had a gun pointed at them, so they shot back. Now all of
a sudden it's front-page news: Mike Lansing rides with police. It's
uncalled for. I don't know what Mike being there that day has
anything to do with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Civilian ride-alongs are common with patrol officers but are
unusual with SWAT teams, though Lansing had the required ride
permit for that day, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He apparently was riding with an officer he knew,'' Whitman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police shot and killed Mena after the Mexican national pointed a
gun at them. No drugs were found in the house and an independent
investigation concluded the raid was conducted on the wrong house.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing, 32, said he frequently goes on ride-alongs with police.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's not every day you hear gunshots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said Monday he was never informed that Lansing was a
witness to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know anything about Mike Lansing being there,''
Sanchez said. ''In fact, I was astonished by that revelation this
morning.''

<HEADLINE> Source: Samuels, Redskins OK Terms  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- The Washington Redskins agreed to terms with
No. 3 overall draft pick Chris Samuels on Monday night, ending his
holdout after one day, The Associated Press has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The tackle from Alabama checked into the team hotel Monday night
after his agent, Jimmy Sexton, wrapped up negotiations with
director of player personnel Vinny Cerrato, a league source said.
</P>
<P>
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the league
would review the contract Tuesday morning and that Samuels would be
at practice. Financial details were not available, although CBS
SportsLine reported that the contract covered six years for $30.6
million with a $10 million signing bonus and a voidable seventh
year.
</P>
<P>
   Samuels' arrival leaves No. 2 overall selection LaVar Arrington
and Pro Bowl running back Stephen Davis unsigned. Samuels is
projected to start at left tackle, although he will be asked to win
the job from veteran Andy Heck.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton and Cerrato were not available for comment Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rookies, quarterbacks and veterans returning from injuries are
allowed to participate in three days of practice before the full
roster begins camp Thursday. The sounds of coaches barking orders
meshed with the racket of jackhammers Monday as the Redskins finish
last-minute preparations for the big opening day, when thousands of
fans are expected to pay an NFL-first $10 admission fee to watch
practice.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Redskins hope to have Arrington and Davis under
contract and on the field. The deal with Arrington is almost
complete and could be announced Tuesday or Wednesday. He will get
slightly more than Samuels.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have high picks like that, there's a lot that goes
into the contracts,'' Cerrato said. ''You can be close on some
things, but it takes a while to get everything together.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is another matter. The NFC's leading rusher, designated as
the team's franchise player, was less than impressed with the
Redskins offer of a $5 million signing bonus, especially given
owner Dan Snyder's spending splurge that netted big bucks for Deion
Sanders, Bruce Smith and now Arrington and Samuels.
</P>
<P>
   Davis offered to sign a one-year contract in May, a variation on
the one-year, $3.532 million tender that must be offered to
franchise running backs. The Redskins rejected that, Cerrato said,
because they don't want Davis becoming a free agent again at the
end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   A holdout or two won't be the only distractions at this camp.
Snyder broke a contract with Frostburg State University in Maryland
and moved the operation to the Redskins' regular training facility
-- where the name has been changed from Redskin Park to Redskins
Park -- and added ''NFL experience'' attractions to create a
carnival atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Norv Turner approved the change, but the players have
mixed feelings. It's nice to be close to home and close to fans,
but the Allegheny Mountains feel a lot more comfortable than the
humid, insect-riddled flood plains of the Washington suburbs in
July.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can stand out there in the heat, because I don't do
anything,'' kicker Brett Conway said. ''For the other guys, it
going to be hot. ... We also have to get rid of the bugs.''
Notes: First-year running back Norman Miller twisted his right
ankle and is day-to-day. ... Cornerback and third-round draft pick
Lloyd Harrison had a good day, picking off passes thrown by rookie
quarterback Todd Husak. To be fair, the receiving corps was
undermanned and began to wilt in the heat. ... Snyder invited
veteran Curtis Buckley, who tore his Achilles' tendon in the spring
and is out for the season, to help coach the special teams. ...
Snyder really knows how to make an entrance: Minutes into the
afternoon practice, his blue helicopter landed just beyond the end
zone. Snyder, Cerrato and Hall of Fame quarterback Sonny Jurgensen
hopped out and took their seats along the sideline.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 7, Expos 3  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Troy O'Leary hit a three-run homer and Nomar
Garciaparra drove in two runs to raise his batting average to .400
as the Boston Red Sox beat the Montreal Expos 7-3 victory Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra went 3-for-3 with two walks and singled in a run in
a two-run eighth, the other scored on a bases-loaded walk to Carl
Everett.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, batting .237 overall, is hitting .364 with three homers
and 13 RBIs since his stay on the disabled list for personal
problems related to divorce proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Wildness finally proved costly for Montreal in the seventh as
Morgan Burkhart and Garciaparra received walks from Anthony Telford
(5-4) in front of O'Leary's homer.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal starter Julio Santana, who issued five walks in 5 2-3
innings, left with a 3-2 lead on Terry Jones' run-scoring double in
the sixth. Santana walked Scott Hatteberg and Darren Lewis, the
last two batters he faced, but Telford ended the sixth by getting
Jeff Frye to fly out.
</P>
<P>
   Then Telford lost his control and gave way to Steve Kline, who
had a 2.00 ERA, with two outs in the seventh. Kline's major
league-high 50th appearance wasn't his best as O'Leary belted a 1-2
pitch into the right-field bullpen for his eighth homer of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Hipolito Pichardo (4-1) pitched two scoreless innings before
Derek Lowe worked the ninth as Boston improved to 8-3 in its last
11 games. Montreal is 1-6 in its last seven and has never won in
five games at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who had just seven RBIs in 59 games, delivered the
go-ahead hit with two outs in the sixth off Rich Garces, scoring
Lee Stevens, who singled.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox went ahead 2-0 in the second on Garciaparra's
leadoff homer, his 13th of the season, a double by O'Leary and a
single by Hatteberg.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos, held hitless by Jeff Fassero through the first four
innings, knocked him out of the game with two runs in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Seguignol led off the inning with his second homer and
Jones singled. Tomas De La Rosa sacrificed Jones to second and
Wilton Guerrero singled him home. After Mike Mordecai singled,
Garces replaced Fassero and ended the threat by retiring Montreal's
most dangerous hitters, Jose Vidro and Vladimir Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
Notes:@Fassero allowed three runners in the first four innings on
walks to Mordecai and Stevens and a throwing error by shortstop
Garciaparra on Vidro's grounder. ... Everett, awaiting a decision
on a suspension for twice bumping umpire Ronald Kulpa on Saturday,
went 0-for-4. That decision from Frank Robinson, who handles
baseball's on-field discipline, could come Tuesday. ... Santana
struck out three, two of them in the first inning.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Suddenly Susan'' TV star Brooke Shields is
suddenly engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Her fiance, Chris Henchy, proposed last weekend during a Mexican
vacation, Shields' publicist, Mia Ricchiuti, said Monday.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 8, Braves 6  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Fred McGriff capped a three-RBI
night with a homer off John Rocker, and right-hander Ryan Rupe won
for the first time since last August as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
beat Atlanta 8-6 Monday night to stop the Braves' four-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff led off the seventh inning with his 19th homer, lining a
3-2 pitch from Rocker into the right-field seats. He also drove in
two runs off Terry Mulholland (9-9), who yielded a two-run homer to
Greg Vaughn in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays scored three unearned runs in the fifth to break
a 3-3 tie. After McGriff grounded out to drive in the go-ahead run,
Bubba Trammell delivered a run-scoring single and Vinny Castilla
contributed an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez hit a solo homer off Rupe, who lost six straight
decisions over 10 starts dating back to Aug. 31, 1999. Rafael
Furcal added an RBI bunt single later in the second, and Chipper
Jones and Andruw Jones drove in runs with sacrifice flies for
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Trenidad Hubbard added an RBI double and Keith Lockhart an RBI
single in the ninth for Atlanta's final runs. Roberto Hernandez got
the final two outs for his 15th save in 20 chances.
</P>
<P>
   The win was Tampa Bay's first in eight games against the Braves.
Only three expansion teams have gone longer without beating an
opponent. The Colorado Rockies lost their first 16 games against
Atlanta in 1993-94, the New York Mets lost eight in a row to the
Cincinnati Reds, and the 1969 Montreal Expos dropped their first
eight against the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves came from behind to tie the game twice in the first
four innings, but stranded eight runners doing so to keep Rupe in
the game. Wally Joyner left three runners on, fouling out in the
fourth after Andres Galarraga was given an intentional walk to load
the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's 15th homer gave Tampa Bay a 2-0 lead. The Braves
countered with Lopez's 423-foot homer, his 14th, that hit one of
the catwalks supporting Tropicana Field's roof. Atlanta tied it 2-2
when Reggie Sanders scored on Furcal's bunt single after being hit
by a pitch and stealing second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Sloppy Atlanta fielding led to the Devil Rays' next three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders misplayed Vaughn's fly ball to right into a two-out
double in the third. McGriff followed with a broken-bat liner to
right that barely cleared the glove of leaping second baseman
Lockhart and put Tampa Bay ahead 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones' error on Vaughn's sharp grounder down the
third-base line put Mulholland into a bind with runners at second
and third with one out in the fifth. McGriff grounded out, snapping
the 3-3 tie and the next two batters, Trammell and Castilla,
singled and doubled to make it 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker received a mixed reception from the crowd of 28,538 when
he entered at the start of the seventh. Fans along the left-field
line stood and cheered when he trotted out to the bullpen to warm
up in the sixth, but there also were boos when he went in to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up the homer to McGriff, Rocker retired the next
three batters.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rocker, who hadn't pitched since walking the only batter he
faced last Thursday at Baltimore, threw for nearly 15 minutes in

<HEADLINE> Phillies 10, Yankees 8  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Just as he has been most of the past year for
the New York Yankees, David Cone was far from perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching 365 days after his perfect game, Cone allowed a two-run
homer to Mike Lieberthal and a three-run shot to Pat Burrell as he
lost his career-high sixth straight decision, 10-8 to the
Philadelphia Phillies on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Abreu iced the game with a grand slam for the Phillies,
who won for the first time in seven tries at Yankee Stadium. They
lost twice in the 1950 World Series, three times in 1998 and in the
opener of the series Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cone (1-8), whose last win came April 28 against Toronto, is in
danger of being bumped from the Yankees' rotation. With only one
win in 17 starts and the emergence of Dwight Gooden, a change could
come soon.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was antsy in the 12 days between starts, frustrated by his
struggles and by being skipped over for a start at Shea Stadium
against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre expressed confidence in the right-hander
before the game -- saying he would start again in five days -- but he
could not have been pleased with what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   After working a perfect first inning, Cone walked Scott Rolen
leading off the second and gave up a towering homer to Lieberthal
to fall behind 2-0. After a perfect third, Cone allowed four more
in the fourth on an RBI single by Tom Prince and Burrell's
three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, 37, rolled his eyes in disgust after Burrell's blast -- the
19th he allowed this year. Torre looked on with a blank expression,
perhaps wondering if his most trusted big-game pitcher had anything
left.
</P>
<P>
   Cone allowed six runs and six hits in five innings. He is 3-13
with a 5.86 ERA in 30 starts since his perfect game against
Montreal last July 18.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill homered off David Coggin (2-0) and scored three
times, and Tino Martinez went 4-for-5 with a home run and four RBIs
for the Yankees. Bernie Williams played like a hard-hitting free
safety, breaking up two plays at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded in the third, Martinez singled to right
field. Lieberthal caught Bobby Abreu's throw home on the fly,
braced himself and was knocked over by Williams. Lieberthal's glove
fell off and the ball rolled loose, allowing Williams to score on
the error to tie the game at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal left after the inning with a sprained left ankle and
was replaced by Prince, who was knocked over by Williams in the
fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second, Martinez singled to right
again. Prince went up the third-base line to field Abreu's throw,
which arrived just before Williams, who knocked the ball loose and
scored to make it 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Torre rubbed Williams' shoulders as he returned to the dugout
and O'Neill -- a football player in high school -- joked with the
soft-spoken Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees added two in the eighth on an RBI single by Scott
Brosius and a run-scoring groundout by Derek Jeter. The Yankees,
who rallied from five runs down in the ninth on Sunday, brought the
tying run up in the eighth. But Rolen made a leaping backhand grab
of David Justice's soft liner to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez led off the ninth with his ninth homer, off Ed Vosberg,
before Chris Brock got three outs for his first career save.
</P>
<P>
   Coggin allowed four runs -- three earned -- six hits and six walks
in five innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Burrell, who hit three homers in a three-game series at
Shea Stadium last month, has hit half of his eight homers this
season in New York. ... Yankees C Jorge Posada dropped his appeal
of a one-game suspension because Chris Turner was slated to start.
... Phillies SS Desi Relaford was replaced by Alex Arias after the
first inning because of inflammation in his right shoulder.

<HEADLINE> West 73, East 61  </HEADLINE>
AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- In the end, the West didn't need Cynthia Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time WNBA MVP, who sprained an ankle last week, watched
the league's second All-Star game in street clothes and saw Lisa
Leslie score a record 16 points to lead Western Conference to a
73-61 victory over the East on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome could have been worse, like last year's 18-point win
by the West in the inaugural game, but the West committed 23
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Thompson, Cooper's Houston teammate, had 13 points and a
record 11 rebounds to garner MVP honors. Mwadi Mabika, Leslie's
teammate in Los Angeles, and Yolanda Griffith of Sacramento each
scored 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Taj McWilliams of Orlando, who finished with 10 points, made two
free throws with 2:47 to play to bring the East within 66-59.
</P>
<P>
   Tari Phillips of New York, who also had 10 points, scored 55
seconds later to cut the deficit to five.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffith, who displaced Cooper as the league MVP last year,
made a layup with 1:37 to play, opening a 68-61 lead, and Brandy
Reed, Griffith and Ticha Penicheiro of Sacramento each made a free
throw down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, a Phoenix forward left off the West roster in voting by
both the fans (starters) and coaches (reserves), was added as a
12th player by the league last week to avoid a fan revolt in the
host city. But she fizzled on the court, shooting 1-for-11 and
turning the ball over three times.
</P>
<P>
   There were 11 lead changes and three ties in the first half, and
the teams went 5&AMP;frac12; minutes in one stretch separated by no more than
a point.
</P>
<P>
   Then the reserves lifted the East to its high-water mark.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando's Shannon Johnson and Nykesha Sales, Sue Wicks of New
York and Charlotte's Andrea Stinson all scored unanswered baskets.
Stinson was fouled attempting her 10-foot jumper, and the resulting
three-point play with 7:06 remaining gave the East a 26-21 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the West had a backup waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Mabika had seven points over the final 6:46 of the half, and the
West outscored the East 19-7 to take a 40-33 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The game was televised in 154 countries and 23 languages, but
was hardly a classic.
</P>
<P>
   The West shot 37.7 percent and the East 29.4 percent, and the
East committed 15 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger factor was rebounding as the West finished with a 60-40
advantage on the boards.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Princess To Face US Charges  </HEADLINE>
By DARA AKIKO WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A Bahraini princess who used forged military
documents to flee her country and marry a U.S. Marine must face
charges of illegally entering the United States, a judge said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration judge Ignacio Fernandez refused to dismiss the
charges, a ruling that prevents the princess, 19-year-old Meriam Al
Khalifa, from applying for permanent residency in the United States
without seeking political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Al Khalifa plans to apply for asylum on the grounds that she
faces extreme persecution for marrying a non-Muslim if she returns
to her country, said her attorney, Jan Joseph Bejar.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can guarantee you it is not just 'Daddy is mad at me,'''
Bejar told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   She has up to a year under U.S. law to apply for political
asylum. She faces charges of misrepresenting her identity to enter
the United States and not having the proper documents to enter the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Mubaraki, a lawyer for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, declined comment, saying the case was sealed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Bahraini Embassy in Washington says her
family is eager for her to return and that she would not face
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was closed to the public and news media, but Bejar
provided an account of the judge's action. Al Khalifa left without
speaking to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Al Khalifa lives with her husband, Pfc. Jason Johnson, on Camp
Pendleton, a Marine base 40 miles north of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's effort to allow her to remain in the county has
drawn the support of Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who sent a
letter of support last week to immigration authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Al Khalifa and Johnson met last year at a mall in the Bahraini
capital of Manama, where the 25-year-old Marine was assigned to a
security unit.
</P>
<P>
   As his deployment was ending late last year, he forged U.S.
military documents that Al Khalifa used to fly to the United States
on a commercial airplane. She dressed in baggy clothes and wore a
New York Yankees baseball cap to resemble an American. Immigration
officials in Chicago discovered the ruse.
</P>
<P>
   The couple later married in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps demoted Johnson to private first class and
assigned him extra duty.
</P>
<P>
   Al Khalifa's father is a cousin of Bahrain's head of state, Emir
Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.
</P>
<P>
   Bahraini royalty rarely marry outside the family circle. They
also belong to Islam's mainstream Sunni sect. Islam forbids Muslim
women to marry non-Muslim men, though Muslim men can marry outside
their faith.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore Closes Gap With Bush  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore has gained support from women and
independents, according to a poll released Monday, closing an
overall gap with Republican George W. Bush in the presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was at 48 percent and Gore was at 46 percent in the poll of
likely voters by CNN-USA Today-Gallup. The error margin was 4
percentage points, meaning that the two candidates were even.
</P>
<P>
   In a four way matchup, Bush was at 45 percent, Gore at 43
percent, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader at 5 percent and Reform
Party hopeful Pat Buchanan at 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore led Bush among women in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, 51
percent to 44 percent and the two leading candidates were about
even among independents in the latest poll, taken Friday through
Sunday of 635 likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, Bush and Gore were even among women and Bush had
a 16 percentage point lead among independents -- 48 percent to 32
percent. In that same earlier CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, Bush led
Gore overall 50 percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News poll taken from Thursday through Sunday also showed
Gore closing up the race with Bush. Bush was at now at 43 percent
and Gore was at 41 percent among registered voters. In May, Bush
had 47 percent and Gore was at 39 percent in the CBS poll. Bush had
a razor thin lead over Gore in a four-way matchup in that poll,
with Nader at 4 percent and Buchanan at 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS poll of 596 registered voters was taken July 13-16 and
has an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Both polls were taken after former Sen. Bill Bradley, popular
among independents and woman Democrats, publicly endorsed Gore in
their first joint appearance since their bitter primary battle.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Gore adviser Tad Devine said the polls show what the Gore
campaign's internal polls have been showing recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think some of these other (public) polls, which are
credible, are beginning to catch up and show this is a close
race,'' Devine said from his Nashville office. ''I think we have a
race that has been tight and which will likely be tight for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallup Poll executive editor Frank Newport said that polls since
January have been fluctuating with Bush ahead in some polls and the
two candidates close in others.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be in a period of some fluctuation among likely voters
as we move into the weeks and months ahead, with the vice
presidential announcements and conventions,'' Newport said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll analysis by Andrew Kohut of the Pew Research
Center for the People and the Press suggested that polls since the
end of the primary season have fluctuated, with most either showing
the presidential race close or Bush with a slight lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fluctuation in poll results reflects a lack of conviction
among voters, fueled in part by the fact that fewer people are
paying attention to the campaign than in 1992 or 1996,'' Kohut
said.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the Bush supporters in the CBS poll said if Bush picks
an abortion rights supporter as vice president it would not affect
their backing of Bush. A third, 35 percent, said it would make them
less likely to support him and 13 percent said it would make them
more likely.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth of the Republicans in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll
said they would still like to see Sen. John McCain become the
nominee, although he quit the race after primary losses to Bush.
Independents were about evenly split on whether they would want to
see Bush or McCain as the nominee.

<HEADLINE> Petranoff Reaches Javelin Final  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- He's one of track and field's most
colorful characters, and on Monday, Tom Petranoff was in top form.
</P>
<P>
   After qualifying for Thursday's final in the javelin at the U.S.
Olympic trials, the 42-year-old Petranoff held court and
distributed his Turbo Jav, a throwing implement designed to develop
correct throwing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux Greer, who missed competing in the 1996 Olympics by
inches after finishing third in the trials, led the qualifying at
263 feet, 1 inch, while American record-holder Tom Pukstys was
fourth at 254-9. Petranoff, the former world record-holder,
finished fifth at 237-3.
</P>
<P>
   Petranoff, who competed in his first trials in 1980 and made the
team that did not compete in the Moscow Games, thinks his chances
of making this year's team are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me to make this team would be exposing how vulnerable we
are in this event,'' the outspoken Petranoff said. ''I'm surprised
the (qualifying) distances were as low as they were.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got everything to win and nothing to lose. It's a mental
thing. I'm strong physically. I'm trying to get my timing down.''
</P>
<P>
   The world record is 323-1 by Jan Zelezny of the Czech Republic.
Pukstys' American record is 285-10.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. used to be the best in the world at this event,''
Petranoff said. ''And right now, frankly, we're maybe as bad as
we've ever been. That has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Pukstys made the 1999 U.S. team for the World Championships, but
didn't compete because of a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, he injured a shoulder at a meet in Glasgow,
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very scared,'' he said. ''Up to five days ago, I
couldn't get over 220 (feet). This was a test throw.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to let it all hang out in the final. I want to go to
Sydney so bad it's not even funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer still was bemoaning his near-miss four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was hard for me not to cry,'' he said. ''I'd only been
throwing the javelin for a year. Now, it motivates me.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's javelin was the first event on Monday night's program.
The schedule included finals in the men's long jump, and women's
javelin, 400-meter hurdles and discus.

<HEADLINE> ABC Plans Restroom Ads For Sitcom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Turns out television really is in the
toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ABC said Monday it plans to put ads for one of its sitcoms in
urinals in Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just when you think you've heard it all, we have found the
perfect ad location for 'Norm,' and they're called restroom
panels,'' ABC marketing executive Alan Cohen told the Television
Critics Association.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he expected reporters to joke that ''ABC is going down
the toilet this fall,'' Cohen defended the campaign as fitting for
''Norm.'' The show stars Norm MacDonald as a crass, insensitive
guy.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Norm'' ads will combine a billboard above the urinal with
an audio message about the show.
</P>
<P>
   As a takeoff on NBC's ''Must See TV'' slogan, ABC also plans to
put a ''Must Pee TV'' headline over the billboard message, said
network spokesman Kevin Brockman.
</P>
<P>
   The network will also reach out to viewers with automated calls
from series stars reminding them to tune in.
</P>
<P>
   The messages, targeting homes in the top 10 TV markets, will
only be left as voice mails if no one picks up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to call you and bother you with 'Sign up for a
credit card.' We're not going to even want to talk to you if you
answer the phone,'' Cohen said.

By The Associated PressINTERLEAGUE:
Phillies-Yankees:
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: RHP Curt Schilling, who hasn't been shy lately
about his desire to be dealt to a contender, is trying to avoid
trade talk. ''The big thing is I made some comments that were taken
out of context. Still it probably was not the right thing to say,''
Schilling said. But he did shed some light on his situation Sunday
night when he ran into Denny Neagle, who was traded to the Yankees
last week and will start against Schilling on Tuesday. ''He said,
'You lousy jerk. That's where I wanted to go.' Obviously he was
envious.'' ... RHP Robert Person, on the DL with a sore right
shoulder, started Monday night for Double-A Reading. ... After
converting his first 13 save opportunities, closer Jeff Brantley
has blown three of four. Manager Terry Francona said Brantley was
likely unavailable Monday night after pitching three of the
previous four days.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: C Jorge Posada dropped his appeal of a one-game
suspension because Chris Turner was slated to start. Clay
Bellinger, who has never caught in the majors, was the emergency
backup. He got time behind the plate in a recent stint with
Triple-A Columbus. ... Even though Dwight Gooden has pitched well
in his two outings with the Yankees and Monday's starter David Cone
had one win in his first 16 starts, manager Joe Torre said Cone was
not pitching for his job. ''He's going back out five days from now
as far as I'm concerned.'' ... RHP Ramiro Mendoza, on the DL for
three weeks with a sore shoulder, will likely begin a rehab stint
this week.
Expos-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Brothers Vladimir and Wilton Guerrero were in
Montreal's starting lineup. Another brother, Julio, is in the Red
Sox system as a right fielder for Class-A Lowell of the NY Penn
League. ... Another Julio also has connections with Boston. Julio
Santana, Montreal's starting pitcher Monday, signed with the Expos
on June 18 after being released from the Red Sox organization. ...
With Orlando Cabrera on the DL, shortstop Tomas De La Rosa made his
major league debut. In 80 games with Triple-A Ottawa this year, he
hit .216 with one homer and 19 RBIs. ... C Chris Widger made a
speedy recovery after leaving Saturday's game at Tampa Bay with a
mild concussion in the third inning. He was in the starting lineup
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Monday night starter Jeff Fassero is one of three Red
Sox pitchers who once played for the Expos. The others are Pedro
Martinez, Tuesday night's starter, and reliever Rheal Cormier. And
Boston pitching coach Joe Kerrigan made his major league pitching
debut on July 9, 1976, for the Expos against Houston. ... Red Sox
RHP Bret Saberhagen, on the DL all season following shoulder
surgery, was scheduled to make a rehabilitation start Tuesday for
Class A Lowell. ... The waiting game continued for OF Carl Everett.
He was in the starting lineup after no decision was made Monday on
how long he would be suspended for bumping an umpire Saturday. ...
SS Nomar Garciaparra wasted little time getting back in the groove
with a homer on the first pitch he saw Monday. He was hitless
Sunday for only the fourth time in 30 games.
Reds-Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Things keep going from bad to worse for C Benito
Santiago, whose batting average dropped from .333 to .134 during a
9-for-67 slump. He left Monday night's game with back spasms after
making a diving play on a ball hit in front of the plate in the
first inning. It was only his second start on the Reds' current
road trip, and he was out of the game before his first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: 1B Tony Clark, on the 15-day DL with a bulging disc,
has been shut down completely by team doctors. Clark has been
instructed not to ride the exercise bike, not to swing a bat, not
to do anything for at least a week. ... OF Juan Gonzalez, who has
missed nine of 10 games with tendinitis in his left ankle, was
given a CAT scan Monday which turned up nothing. He is due for a
bone scan Tuesday.
Astros-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Monday night's matchup between rookie RHPs Wade Miller
and Cleveland's Tim Drew marked just the second time two rookies
have started in an Astros game since 1997. The other all-rookie
matchup came on June 25, 1998, when Houston's Scott Elarton faced
Colorado's Mike Saipe. ... The Astros have been hit by a pitch a
major league leading 54 times this season. Three Houston players
rank in the top 10 in HBPs, including Craig Biggio, who has been
plunked a major league-high 16 times entering Monday night's game.
... Miller's start -- second of his career -- was just the sixth by
an Astros rookie since 1997. The Indians had 17 rookie starts this
year.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: RHP Jaret Wright threw off a mound for the first time
since being placed on the DL June 3 with an inflamed right
shoulder. Wright threw 49 pitches in his 12-minute session and
reported no pain. ''He threw very well,'' pitching coach Dick Pole
said. Wright will rest his arm Tuesday before throwing off the
mound again Wednesday. ''We'll up the intensity,'' Pole said. ...
CF Kenny Lofton was back in his familiar leadoff spot Monday night
after batting in the No. 7 spot twice and eighth for 10 games.
Manager Charlie Manuel moved Lofton down in the order to help him
regain his confidence, and Lofton responded by hitting .400 with
nine RBIs. Lofton went a span of 1,067 games leading off before the
switch. With Lofton back up top, Roberto Alomar was again hitting
third and Ricky Ledee seventh.
Mets-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets placed 3B Robin Ventura on the 15-day DL,
retroactive to July 14. Ventura bruised his right rotator cuff
while sliding on June 25. ... RHP Rick Reed was activated from the
DL before the game. Reed was placed on the DL June 30 with a
fractured left wrist and strained left calf. ... Manager Bobby
Valentin said the Mets, who entered the game 49-41, are ''obviously
underachieving.''
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: RHP Pasqual Coco, 8-4 with a 3.83 ERA at Double-A
Tennessee, made his major league debut. Coco replaced RHP Frank
Castillo, who has tendinitis in his elbow. Asked why Coco was
chosen to start, Toronto manager Jim Fregosi said: ''It was his day
to pitch. He's well rested.'' ... To make room for Coco, the Blue
Jays placed SS Alex Gonzalez on the 15-day DL with a strained right
groin, retroactive to July 7. ... RHP Joey Hamilton, recovering
from shoulder surgery, will make three rehab starts at Triple-A
Syracuse.
Braves-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: 2B Quilvio Veras, out for the season with a torn
anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, is scheduled to
undergo surgery Tuesday in Atlanta. Dr. Marvin Royster will perform
the operation. ... Manager Bobby Cox served the fourth game of a
five-game suspension. Asked what it's like watching a game on
television and managing, he said: ''You can't manage from it.
Everything is too easy on TV. You can't figure out why someone
bobbled a ball or missed a pitch.'' ... SS Walt Weiss and RF Brian
Jordan sat out. Rafael Furcal started at shortstop after beginning
Sunday's game at second base. Keith Lockhart started at second.
Reggie Sanders shifted from left to right field, and Bobby Bonilla
started in left.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: 3B Vinny Castilla continues to struggle at the plate.
He had one homer in his first 22 games and one in his last 40
before Monday night. ... RHP Jim Mecir's loss Sunday was his first
since April 19. ... The Devil Rays are in the midst of a stretch in
which they'll play 34 games in 35 days. ... All five of Tampa Bay's
hits Sunday were for extra bases (four doubles, one home run), only
the second game in franchise history that the Devil Rays have not
had a single. It also matched the major league-high this season for
most hits in a game with all for extra bases. Pittsburgh had three
doubles and two triples at Philadelphia on July 1.
Marlins-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: The team announced that RHP Alex Fernandez is out for
the season after failing to show improvement from a strained
rotator cuff and a strained ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow.
... The three outfield assists by RF Mark Kotsay on Sunday was a
team record. ... RHP Jesus Sanchez, who snapped an 11-start winless
streak in his last start, seeks his seventh career win Tuesday
against the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: 3B Cal Ripken has resumed baseball-related activities
and scoffed at talk of his possible retirement. ... SS Mike Bordick
made his ninth error Monday, matching his total for all last
season. ... RHP Jose Mercedes, who yielded five runs in the first
inning of his previous start, blanked the Marlins on Monday.
Cardinals-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: St. Louis continues to hold a commanding lead in the
NL Central, and has been in first place for all but three days this
season. They have led the division by as many as 10 games in 2000,
marking their first double-digit division lead since they won the
National League crown in the 1968 season. They lost the World
Series in seven games to Detroit that year. ... On Monday, St.
Louis placed OF J.D. Drew on the 15-day DL, retroactive to July 8.
Drew is mending a sprained left ankle and will be replaced in the
lineup by Chris Richard, who was called up from Triple-A Memphis.
It is Richard's first major league callup. ... The Cardinals are in
the midst of a season-high 11-game road trip. They are playing 17
of their first 20 post All-Star break games on the road. ...
Sunday's loss to Minnesota was the Cardinals' first since June in
which neither team hit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The once-dead effort to get an outdoor baseball
stadium built in downtown Minneapolis might get a boost Tuesday
when baseball commissioner Bud Selig visits the Twin Cities. Selig
will address Minnesotans for Major League Baseball, a 130-member
advisory committee which is seeking ways to build a Wrigley
Field-style ballpark, using mostly private funds. Selig is expected
to talk about the current state of the game and its economics. ...
Minnesota's lone All-Star game representative, OF Matt Lawton, has
thus far played in every Twins game and started 93 of Minnesota's
94 games. ... After winning the opening game of their current
series, the Twins are 7-1 all-time against St. Louis in the
Metrodome, including 4-0 during the 1987 World Series, in which the
Twins defeated the Cardinals in seven games. It was the first World
Series in which the home team won every game.
Brewers-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The starting time for Saturday, Aug. 12 game vs. St.
Louis has been changed to 12:15 p.m. CDT to accommodate FOX
television. It's also Bob Uecker Day at County Stadium. The
longtime Brewers announcer will be honored, starting at 11 a.m. ...
RHP Jason Bere, originally selected by the White Sox in the 36th
round of the 1990 free-agent draft, made his first start against
them Monday. Bere was 47-34 with a 5.21 ERA in 104 appearances (101
starts) from 1993-98. He appeared in the postseason in '93 and the
All-Star game in 1994 for the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Frank Thomas was chosen AL Player of the Wee, the
second time this year (April 3-9) and 12th time in his career
Thomas has been honored. He hit .545 (7-for-15) with two homer, 10
RBIs and a 1.000 slugging percentage. ... Entering Monday, Thomas
led the AL with 18 RBIs in July ... The White Sox are averaging
24,133 fans per home game, a 33-percent increase over 1999. If it
maintains this pace, Chicago will draw 2,235,308, which would be
the fourth-highest season total in franchise history, behind the
1991-93 seasons. ... The White Sox's 57-34 start is the best since
the 1954 club began 58-33. The White Sox have improved 22&AMP;frac12; games in
the standings from this point last year, when they were 44-47, 13
games back of Cleveland.
Cubs-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The Cubs' third straight victory Sunday marked the
fourth time this season they won three straight. They have not won
four in a row since last September 22-25. ... The Cubs would win
their third straight series for the first time since May 1999 with
a victory either Monday or Tuesday. If that occurs, the Cubs will
have their first winning road trip of the season, and three
consecutive series wins against AL opponents for the first time
since the beginning of interleague play. ... When Sammy Sosa
homered Sunday night, he added Kauffman Stadium to his list of
ballparks in which he homered. He has hit a home run in 33 major
league ballparks. Sunday was the third straight game in which he
homered, the 17th time in his career he has accomplished that.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Manager Tony Muser said 2B Carlos Febles is ''real
close'' to coming off the DL, with a move possible before the team
embarks on an eight-game road trip Wednesday to Cleveland, Detroit
and Chicago. Febles has been on the DL since June 5 with a left
shoulder strain. ... The Royals are playing their final interleague
series of the season, and stood 7-9 entering Monday's game. They
finished 4-5 on the road, taking two of three in Pittsburgh, and
losing two of three each in St. Louis and Houston. They took two of
three from Pittsburgh at home, and lost two of three at home
against Milwaukee.
Athletics-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Art Howe managed his first split doubleheader on
Monday. ''It is unique,'' Howe said between games. ''The good thing
is we don't have to leave the stadium like the fans will.'' ...
Howe, Colorado's hitting coach in 1995, admitted he hardly
recognized the 2000 Rockies. ''I see Larry Walker from the 95 team
and that's it. We'd just signed Todd Helton, but he never came up
to the big club. '' ... Marcus Jones was informed of his impending
callup at 1 a.m. and arrived in Denver at 9 a.m. for his afternoon
start after catching a 6 a.m. flight out of Sacramento. ... Jones
was the 27th pitcher in Oakland history to start in their major
league debut. ''I'm beat, but I wanted to show them what I could
do,'' Jones said. ''I thought I was dreaming at the time they
called me. I was coming up and never could sleep.'' ... Immediately
after Game 1, the Athletics optioned Jones back to Sacramento and
called up RHP Ariel Prieto from Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Immediately after Game 1, the Athletics optioned Jones
back to Sacramento and called up RHP Ariel Prieto from Sacramento.
... Colorado designated LHP Rigo Beltran after Game 1 to make room
for OF-1B Butch Huskey, who was acquired Sunday in a deal with
Minnesota. ... The Rockies rested Larry Walker in Game 2 of the
split doubleheader. ''He's fine,'' Colorado manager Buddy Bell
said. ''We just don't want to press the issue with his elbow.'' ...
Tom Goodwin stole his first base in 16 games. ... About reliever
Gabe White's rare breakdowns, three runs in two-thirds of an
inning, Bell said, ''We got back into the game, but unfortunately
Gabe White wasn't able to hold things. He's done such a great job
for us all year and you don't expect him to give up another run.
Things like this happen on a streak.''
Rangers-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: The Rangers activated RHP Ryan Glynn from the 15-day
disabled list to start Monday night's game against the Giants.
Glynn was on the disabled list since July 2 with a blister on his
right index finger. Glynn began a new conditioning program to
toughen the new skin on the finger. As part of the program, Glynn
plunges his hand into a tub of rice. Hall of Famer Steve Carlton
followed the same program throughout his career. ... INF Kelly
Dransfeldt was optioned to Oklahoma of the PCL to make room for
Glynn. Dransfeldt appeared in five games with the Rangers in two
separate stints. He has a hit in five at-bats with one RBI. ... LHP
Darren Oliver has made three rehab starts with Oklahoma and is
scheduled to pitch somewhere Thursday. He could take LHP Matt
Perisho's place in the rotation against Anaheim, or he could make
one more start at Triple-A. ... RHP Francisco Cordero has given up
28 hits and 15 runs in 14 2-3 innings over 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: 2B Jeff Kent was out of the lineup Monday for the
first time all season, and manager Dusty Baker hopes not to use him
at all unless he's faced with a critical pinch-hit RBI situation
late in the game. ''It's hard to give guys a whole lot of breaks
down the stretch,'' Baker said. ''Jeff ended the first half
exhausted and when he went to the All-Star game, that's not a
break. I didn't want to sit him against Oakland because they're our
cross-bay rivals, and I wanted him to face (Sunday's starter
Esteban) Loaiza. We also face (Rick) Helling tomorrow, so all those
things added up.'' ... Baker managed his 1,160th game, tying him
for third-most by a Giants manager with Leo Durocher. ... Monday's
starter Livan Hernandez made his 100th career appearance.
Mariners-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: Mariners starters have a major league-best 4.26 ERA,
slightly better than Arizona's 4.28. ... Paul Abbott has both hits
by Seattle pitchers in interleague play this season. ... Seattle's
bullpen has retired 21 consecutive hitters. ... Rickey Henderson
moved past Babe Ruth into 35th place on the career hits list with
2,875. ... Henderson is 13-for-27 career against the Diamondbacks.
... Monday's starter, John Halama, lost four of his six previous
decisions. ... Edgar Martinez, relegated to the bench without a
designated hitter in the NL park, was 0-for-1 as a pinch-hitter
Sunday to end his 13-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Buck Showalter is 28-28 against Seattle, with most of
the games coming while Showalter managed the New York Yankees. ...
Arizona has lost five of seven games, three of four since the
All-Star break. ... Geraldo Guzman, Monday's starter, is the 16th
starter in Diamondbacks' history. ... 1B Alex Cabrera was activated
from the 15-day DL and OF Jason Conti was optioned back to Triple-A
Tucson of the PCL. Cabrera, who homered and tripled in his first
two at-bats in the majors, was 8-for-14 before he strained his left
groin running out a double. ... Omar Daal, trying to regain his
form after starting the season 2-10, retired both hitters he faced
Sunday.
Angels-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Monday night's starter, Brian Cooper, was sent down to
Class A Lake Elsinore on July 7 so he could make a start during the
All-Star break. He started at Lancaster on the night of the
All-Star game, allowing four hits and one run in seven innings. ...
Tuesday's starter, Ken Hill, is 9-2 with a 3.21 ERA in 18 career
starts against the Padres, his highest victory total against any
major league team.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: CF Ruben Rivera sat out Monday night after striking
out 22 times in 11 games, fanning at least once in each game. He
was replaced by rookie Kory DeHaan, who made his first start in
center field and 10th overall in the outfield. ... RHPs Carlton
Loewer and Brian Boehringer will both have season-ending
arthroscopic surgery on their pitching shoulders Tuesday, to be
performed by team doctors Lewis Yocum of the Angels and Jan Fronek
of the Padres at Centinela Hospital. Counting those two operations,
seven Padres will have undergone nine different surgical procedures
since opening day. RHP Rodney Myers had two procedures on his left
knee and one on his right shoulder. Additionally, Loewer had
surgery on his left ankle in January after he fell out of a deer
blind in Louisiana. That injury has long since healed and was
followed by shoulder problems.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Pirates-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: All-Star catcher Jason Kendall, whose agent met last
Saturday with Pirates GM Cam Bonifay to discuss an extension
believed to be a five-year deal worth between $9 million and $10
million a season, is eligible for free agency after the 2001
season. But the Pirates, who have yet to respond to Dan Lozano's
counteroffer, might trade Kendall by the July 31 non-waiver trading
deadline. Kendall is hitting .321 with eight homers and 30 RBIs.
''It could always be better. You can never be satisfied,'' Kendall
said. ''I had a decent first half, but it wasn't up to my standards
by any means. The bottom line is about winning. If you win,
everybody's season is better. That's what we need to do.'' ...
Manager Gene Lamont entered Monday night's game with a 342-377
record since being chosen AL manager of the year in 1993 with the
White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: C Todd Hundley was placed on the 15-day disabled
list because of a non-displaced fracture of his right thumb,
retroactive to July 9. This is his second trip to the DL this
season. He was sidelined from May 31-June 25 because of a strained
abdominal oblique muscle in his right rib cage. ''The guys who have
been backing him up are doing an adequate job,'' LF Gary Sheffield
said in reference to Chad Kreuter and Paul LoDuca. ''But there's
only one Todd Hundley. He's the guy who gets the big RBIs and hits
the big home runs when the team is playing sluggish or
lackadaisical. He's always ready to play.'' ... Mike Judd,
scheduled to make his first start for the Dodgers this season and
fifth of his career Tuesday in place of the suspended Carlos Perez,
was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque a day earlier than
anticipated because of the roster move with Hundley. Judd will
pitch on nine days rest, except for a couple of bullpen sessions.
... Sheffield's selection Monday as NL player of the week was his
second of the season and sixth of his career. Sheffield, who won
his only NL batting title in 1992 when he hit .330 for San Diego,
is vying for his first home run crown with a major league-leading
31 heading into Monday night's game. He hit a career-high 42 for
the Marlins in 1996, when Andres Galarraga hit 47 for Colorado.

By The Associated Press	   Two-time Pro Bowl tackle Eric Swann changed his mind
and will
visit Denver on Tuesday as he continues to weigh playing for the
Carolina Panthers or the Chicago Bears.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Herb Zucker, the son of Swann's agent, Steve Zucker, said Monday
night the defensive tackle changed his mind about visiting the
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, who last week canceled a meeting with the St. Louis Rams,
is torn between Carolina and Chicago, Steve Zucker said, but is
leaning slightly toward joining the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just loves (Carolina coach) George Seifert and the way they
plan to use him,'' the agent said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Broncos make a bid for Swann, it probably would be in the
form of an incentive-based contract.
Redskins:
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 overall draft pick Chris Samuels agreed to terms, ending
his holdout after one day, The Associated Press has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The tackle from Alabama checked into the team hotel Monday night
after his agent, Jimmy Sexton, wrapped up negotiations with
director of player personnel Vinny Cerrato, a league source said.
</P>
<P>
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the league
would review the contract Tuesday morning and that Samuels would be
at practice. Financial details were not available, although CBS
SportsLine reported that the contract covered six years for $30.6
million with a $10 million signing bonus and a voidable seventh
year.
</P>
<P>
   Samuels' arrival leaves No. 2 overall selection LaVar Arrington
and Pro Bowl running back Stephen Davis unsigned.
Titans:
</P>
<P>
   The team reached an agreement that will make Eddie George the
highest-paid running back in the NFL, his agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamont Smith confirmed that terms had been reached for a
six-year contract extension worth $42 million, including a $14
million signing bonus that will be paid out over the next 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing we're most pleased about is the deal places him in
that elite category, which he deserves,'' he said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   A news conference was scheduled for 4 p.m. CDT Tuesday at the
Titans' practice facility to announce the extension.
Panthers:
</P>
<P>
   Starting quarterback Steve Beuerlein, a Pro Bowl selection last
season, practiced Monday after missing both minicamps because of
five offseason operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''You say coming off of last year I should feel comfortable, but
I've had five surgeries,'' he said. ''So now there's questions
about whether physically I can step in and play at the same level.
That's my motivation now. I've got to show that physically I can
get myself back to where I can play at the same level that I was
playing at, if not better than, last year.''
Bills:
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi Award winner Corey Moore, a third-round pick out of
Virginia Tech, signed.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a defensive end in college who the Bills will switch to
outside linebacker, set a Big East record last season with 17 sacks
as the Hokies made it to college football's title game.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills also signed wide receiver Drew Haddad, chosen in the
seventh round out of the University of Buffalo.
Saints:
</P>
<P>
   Darren Howard, New Orleans' top draft pick, signed a five-year
deal, leaving the Saints with no holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas State linebacker, taken in the second round, was on
the field Monday, the third day of training camp. The team cut
linebacker Terrence Miles to make room for Howard.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints had no first-round pick because of last year's trade
to get running back Ricky Williams.
Vikings:
</P>
<P>
   Free agent linebacker Kevin McCullar signed with Minnesota. The
6-foot-2, 245-pound McCullar, who went to Texas Tech, played in NFL
Europe with the Frankfurt Galaxy.
Rams:
</P>
<P>
   Second-round pick Jacoby Shepherd agreed to a four-year deal
with the Super Bowl champions. The cornerback started just two
games in his lone season at Oklahoma State after transferring from
a junior college.
</P>
<P>
   Top pick Trung Canidate and third-round pick John St. Clair are
still unsigned, with training camp opening Friday in Macomb, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis also is talking to quarterback Kurt Warner, defensive
end Kevin Carter, receiver Isaac Bruce and cornerback Todd Lyght
about new contracts.
Eagles:
</P>
<P>
   Second-round draft pick Bobby Williams, an offensive lineman,
signed a four-year deal with Philadelphia. The 6-foot-3, 320-pound
Williams earned second-team all-SEC honors last season.
Jaguars:
</P>
<P>
   Running back Tavian Banks, sidelined since injuring his left
knee against Atlanta on Nov. 7, was waived after he failed his team
physical.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, 26, played in the first eight games last season. At the
time of his injury, he was fourth on the team with 14 catches for
137 yards. He also carried 23 times for 82 yards.
Chargers:
</P>
<P>
   Former Amsterdam Admirals linebacker Marcel Willis agreed to a
one-year deal, giving the team more depth at the position.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Chargers agreed to terms with former Oakland
Raiders linebacker Richard Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   Willis was second on the Admirals' defense with 30 tackles
during the 2000 NFL Europe season. He also recorded four sacks,
broke up five passes and had four tackles on special teams.
Packers:
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila, a fifth-round choice from
San Diego State, agreed to terms, leaving four players unsigned,
including top pick, tight end Daniel ''Bubba'' Franks.

<HEADLINE> Sales of off-market brands rise, county wants tobacco money in lump sum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HORNELL, N.Y. (AP) - Sales of off-market cigarettes in New York
are growing faster then tobacco leaves in the warm Virginia sun.
</P>
<P>
   With names like Smokin' Joes and USA Gold, off market brands are
underselling the familiar, traditional brands by as much as 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lower prices of off-market brands are due to their exclusion
from national tobacco litigation. The settlement of that litigation
has forced major tobacco manufacturers like Philip Morris to pledge
billions of dollars worth of future revenues to state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   That obligation has in turn driven up the cost of brand-name
cigarettes like Winston to over $4 per pack. And the near doubling
of New York's cigarette tax to a highest-in-the-nation $1.11 a pack
has also not helped, according to the state Association of
Convenience Stores.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, a pack of Smokin' Joes retails for $2.80. A pack of
Durants goes for about $2.70. ''These new cigarettes are not going
to be hung with the same liability as the older brands,'' notes
Steuben County attorney Fred Ahrens.
</P>
<P>
   Steuben County is working toward converting up to 30 years worth
of future tobacco payments into a single bond issue that could net
up to $20 million in a lump sum payment from investors.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling, Ahrens said last week, how much the new,
cheap brands will cut into the market share of tobacco giants like
Philip Morris or Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's one of the variables as to why it's a prudent move to
go to securitization,'' Ahrens said. ''These (litigation) revenues
are predicated on their (future) sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the lower overhead of the start-up manufacturers
may allow some to acquire a profitable market share.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Ahrens said, future sales of Marlboros and
Camels may drop accordingly, with reductions in litigation-related
payments to state and local governments.

<HEADLINE> Agent: Titans, George Deal Reached  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans reached an
agreement Monday that will make Eddie George the highest-paid
running back in the NFL, his agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamont Smith confirmed that terms had been reached for a
six-year contract extension worth $42 million, including a $14
million signing bonus that will be paid out over the next 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing we're most pleased about is the deal places him in
that elite category, which he deserves,'' he said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   A news conference was scheduled for 4 p.m. CDT Tuesday at the
Titans' practice facility to announce the extension.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans had made signing George, a three-time Pro Bowl
selection, their top priority after signing coach Jeff Fisher to a
new contract this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   George, the 1995 Heisman Trophy winner from Ohio State, has been
the focus of the offense since he was drafted in 1996, and he had
said he wanted the deal done before reporting for training camp
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   George, who turns 27 in September, has not missed a game in his
first four seasons and has 25 100-yard games. The Titans are 20-5
when he has rushed for 100 yards, and he turned in a career-high
with 1,762 combined yards and a career-best 13 touchdowns last
season as the franchise reached its first Super Bowl in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   George also is one of only four running backs to rush for at
least 1,200 yards in each of their first four seasons, joining Eric
Dickerson, Earl Campbell and Barry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Indianapolis Colts signed rookie Edgerrin James to
a seven-year, $49 million contract, while the St. Louis Rams signed
Marshall Faulk to a seven-year, $45 million deal. Jamal Anderson of
the Atlanta Falcons signed a five-year, $32 million contract last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The signing bonus equals the $14 million cornerback Ty Law
received from the New England Patriots and tops the $13 million to
receiver Keyshawn Johnson of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers or Joey
Galloway's $12 million from the Dallas Cowboys.

<HEADLINE> Jennings Runs To Beat of Drummers  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- In a sport filled with individualists,
1,500-meters champion Gabe Jennings is in a league of his own, and
he comes by it naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Raised and home-schooled in a remote region of Northern
California, Jennings literally runs to the beat of different
drummers.
</P>
<P>
   With his parents providing the lead, friends and relatives pound
a primitive, steady beat on drums in the grandstands as he runs.
Jennings, whose shaggy hair makes him look like some latter-day
Beatle, said it provides him with the rhythm he needs on the track.
</P>
<P>
   A music major at Stanford, Jennings held a news conference like
no other after his victory Sunday. He spent several minutes
explaining how the sunlight floating off the leaves earlier in the
day had helped his preparation. He cried, he said, and knew it was
going to be a good day.
</P>
<P>
   He had reporters laughing with his discourse on the stages of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is in three stages,'' Jennings said. ''Athletics, that's
the initial stage, to get the body healthy. I'm trying to do that
with running. The other two stages are music and philosophy. When
I'm 50, I see myself being a jazz musician.''

   TRACK REBIRTH@: In Sacramento, for 10 days in July, track and
field is alive and well in America.
</P>
<P>
   Spirited, standing-room-only crowds have packed Hornet Stadium
to watch a sport that has barely has a pulse in the public
consciousness in non-Olympic years.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene, Jackie Joyner-Kersee and many other competitors
at the U.S. track and field trials have lauded the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say track is dead,'' Greene said. ''Track ain't dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance for the first three days were 23,211, 23,450 and
23,500.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a new beginning for track and field,'' said
Joyner-Kersee, competing in her sixth Olympic trials. ''The fans
have been very, very supportive. They've been wonderful. I think
the Sacramento Sports Commission did a great job of getting the
volunteers and pulling everybody together.
</P>
<P>
   ''This atmosphere is far greater than any Olympic trials that I
have experienced. Like Saturday, I'm sitting there watching and
they're all into the shot put. That was really great. As athletes,
that's what you want.''

<HEADLINE> Council Adopts Health Resolution  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council adopted its first
resolution on a health issue Monday, urging countries to consider
developing long-term strategies to combat AIDS and to educate
troops who may be deployed on U.N. peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimously adopted resolution, sponsored by the United
States, also asks the United Nations to take additional steps to
train peacekeepers on preventing the spread of HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The final text of the resolution was significantly changed from
the original after several countries objected to the Security
Council taking on an issue that other U.N. bodies deal with. In
addition, troop contributors complained that the United States,
which has no U.N. combat troops -- was seemingly mandating training
and education for others, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke acknowledged the criticism in
his comments to the council, assuring troop contributors that the
resolution ''in no way infringes on sovereignty, authority of
countries, but shows the collective will of the Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the council, with its main priority maintaining
international peace and security, was not undercutting the work of
the other U.N. bodies that deal with health, social and economic
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Russia successfully stripped a line of the
resolution that would have kept the AIDS issue on the council's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has no statistics on the problems of HIV
infection among peacekeepers, but Dr. Peter Piot, the executive
director of the joint UNAIDS program, said the resolution's focus
on the problem of AIDS and peacekeeping was ''significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke insisted that statistics weren't needed to know that
the problem exists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wherever peacekeepers go they attract women who are working
full-time or part-time as prostitutes. The process of spreading is
self-evident,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesia's delegate at the meeting, Hazairin Pohan,
questioned the linkage between peacekeeping and AIDS, saying there
was no clear evidence of the connection.
</P>
<P>
   And Malawi's U.N. ambassador, Yusef Juwayeyi, questioned the
resolution's reference to the epidemic being ''exacerbated by
conditions of violence and instability,'' noting that the African
countries hardest hit by AIDS aren't war zones: Malawi, Botswana,
South Africa and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just violence and instability,'' he said. ''AIDS must
have certain characteristics other than that that have promoted its
wide spread.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Scott Downs allowed only one run in
seven innings Monday night to lead the Cubs to a 3-1 victory over
the Kansas City Royals, Chicago's season-high fourth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Downs (4-3), gave up seven hits, struck out one and walked two
in 7 2-3 innings, the longest outing of his career. Joe Randa, who
scored Kansas City's run in the second and was tagged out at home
in the seventh, is the only runner Downs allowed past second base.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Aguilera got three outs for his 19th save in 25 chances for
the Cubs, who are assured of winning three straight series for the
first time since last May.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Durbin (2-4) gave up three runs on seven hits in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first inning for the
second straight game. Eric Young led off with a walk and then stole
second. He went to third on Mark Grace's single and scored on Sammy
Sosa's double to left that advanced Grace to third. Grace scored on
Henry Rodriguez' sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals answered with one in the second. Randa hit a one-hop
double off the wall in right and advanced to third on a groundout
by Mark Quinn. He scored on a base hit by Dave McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs got another run in the fourth, but could have had more.
Rodriguez led off with a double and scored on a single by Glenallen
Hill, but Hill was doubled off first when McCarty snared Willie
Green's liner.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Reed then doubled off the left-center field wall, but was
stranded when Damon Buford grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Randa led off the seventh with a double and went to third on
Quinn's grounder to short. But when McCarty grounded back to the
pitcher, Randa was thrown out easily at home.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kansas City is assured of its ninth series loss in 10. ...
The Royals, 40-50, dropped to a season-worst 10 games below .500.
The Royals also fell to 5-34 in games in which they scored four or
fewer runs. ... Sosa, who went 2-for-4, extended his hitting streak
to 10 games. ... The Cubs won three straight three previous times
this season. ... This marked the first game since June 29 against
Cleveland that Royals pitchers did not allow a home run -- a span of
13 games.

<HEADLINE> Bush Vows To Win Arkansas  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Striking at the heart of Al Gore's
political base, Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush
said Monday he will visit Arkansas and four other
Democratic-leaning states in the run up to the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to win this state,'' Bush declared at a news
conference in President Clinton's home state.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor was in Arkansas to promote a modest
initiative designed to make fathers take responsibility for their
children. Gore's poll numbers are unimpressive in several states
that are critical to Democratic presidential candidates, giving
Bush hope that he can rebuild the political coalition that his
father rode to the White House in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Arkansas, the GOP candidate plans to travel by
plane and bus to Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia en
route to the July 31-Aug. 3 convention in Philadelphia. Clinton won
each of those five states in 1992 and 1996. Former President Bush
won all but West Virginia in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Polls in those five states show Gore behind Bush or in a dead
heat as the Texas governor holds an advantage in the race for 270
state electoral votes needed to win the presidency. National polls
had given Bush a slight edge over Gore, but new polls out Monday
show the race about even.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign shrugged off news of the Texas governor's travel
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can go in any direction he wants to in terms of his travel,
but he better explain to the American people why he wants the
country to change course and take the country on a right-wing
U-turn, which is what his policies represent,'' Gore spokesman
Chris Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats outside the campaign said Bush's itinerary underscores
problems with the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush is making Gore race back to his base. It's a great power
play,'' said Democratic consultant Dane Strother of Washington.
''He's going to force Gore out of California and make him rush
around states he should have had nailed down by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton served nearly five terms as governor and twice won
Arkansas' six electoral votes, but the Republican Party has gained
strength since he left the state. Bush is sending a message to his
base by competing in the tiny state, Strother said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going back to Arkansas is a great way to energize the people
in his party who hate Clinton,'' the Democratic consultant said.
''It's his way of signaling, 'I'm going right at him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who also attended a party fund-raiser here, predicted he
would win the state ''based upon my record and what I'm saying, not
based on President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is having trouble in a number of other states carried by
Clinton in 1992 and 1996, including Oregon, Washington state,
Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois. Bush is even holding his own in
Tennessee, Gore's home state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush attended a GOP fund-raiser in Milwaukee, Wisc., late Monday
and plans to campaign in Illinois on Tuesday before heading to
Austin, Texas, to prepare for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's main task in Austin this week will be selecting a vice
presidential candidate. Aides said the decision could be announced
early next week, and Bush himself said his list of candidates is
narrowing.
</P>
<P>
   A local reporter asked if Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee of
Arkansas was on the list. Bush said no, dropping his habit of
hinting that a local politician is in the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ''The days of saying the list is growing and shrinking are over.
I'm getting close to a decision,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating,
Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel, Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson and Rep.
John Kasich of Ohio are considered by senior Republicans to be the
top prospects, though Bush advisers caution that he could make a
surprise choice. New York Gov. George Pataki's stock rose after he
met with Bush on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say the pre-convention trip will begin July 28 unless he
has not selected his running mate yet -- at which point the trip
could be amended.
</P>
<P>
   Bush used the news conference to raise questions about Gore's
performance Sunday on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' as aides said they
saw a side of Gore they hope to exploit in fall debates.
</P>
<P>
   On the show, the vice president awkwardly declined to say
whether he supported a federal law that bars the execution of
pregnant women. Bush said the answer is easy. ''No matter what your
position is on abortion or the death penalty, you shouldn't put a
pregnant women to death,'' said Bush, who has presided over more
than 130 executions as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore on Monday said he does support the law, and he noted that
such a woman also would have the right to choose whether to have an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I support the statute to spare that hypothetical person,''
Gore said in Nashville. ''It should be her right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was in Arkansas to promote ''paternity registries'' in
Texas and other states.
</P>
<P>
   Fathers of out-of-wedlock children must sign the registry to
maintain a legal claim of parenthood. Bush says the registry
prevents absent fathers from coming forward after months or years
to challenge adoption proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Bush helped create a registry in Texas. Arkansas began its
registry program in 1989, when Clinton ran the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''You beat us to the punch,'' Bush joked with his Arkansas
hosts.

<HEADLINE> Serb Offers Election Assurances  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The leader of the largest
Serb community left in Kosovo assured international officials
Monday that he will not stand in the way of Serbs who may want to
register and take part in municipal elections in October.
</P>
<P>
   However, Oliver Ivanovic, leader of the Serbs in this ethnically
divided city, also said he did not believe many Serbs would sign up
to vote in the election until the United Nations takes steps to
allow more than 200,000 Serbs to return here.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic gave the assurances to Daan Everts, head of the Kosovo
mission of the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe, which will oversee the election and which is registering
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Everts said Ivanovic told him he would not pressure Serbs who
wanted to register but would not endorse the process. ''But that's
progress,'' Everts told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Ivanovic has promised that he would do what he can to
avoid any violence or intimidation and let people at least have the
freedom of choice so those who want to register, for good reasons I
think, they should be allowed to do so,'' Everts said.
</P>
<P>
   Everts said that during his meeting with Ivanovic, he raised the
issue of an incident Saturday in Leposavic, a Serb town where local
leaders had expressed a willingness to support registration.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian troops evacuated election registrars from an OSCE office
in Leposavic after a group of militant Serbs came from Kosovska
Mitrovica to try to close the registration office. They turned back
after the Belgians intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gave them by condemnation of any violence,'' Ivanovic said.
At the same time, he expressed frustration that Everts would not
assure him that significant numbers of Serbs could be returned
soon.
</P>
<P>
   In order to encourage non-Albanians to register, the United
Nations extended the registration deadline from Saturday to the
close of business Wednesday. The United Nations needs substantial
participation from all ethnic groups to give legitimacy to the
balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the apparent support of Serb leaders in Leposavic, U.N.
officials expressed skepticism that significant numbers of them
would register because doing so might threaten their ties to
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   OSCE officials in Leposavic said as of Monday, only 388 Serbs
had registered out of an estimated eligible population of 11,000 to
12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Associated Press reporters visiting OSCE registration offices in
three Serb communities -- Kosovska Mitrovica, Zvecan and Leposavic --
found all of them closed. U.N. officials in Pristina said the
offices would open later in the day under increased security.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Frank Thomas hit his 29th homer and rookie Jon
Garland got his first major league victory Monday night as the
Chicago White Sox beat Milwaukee 11-2 for their third straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, selected AL Player of the Week earlier Monday, hit a
two-run homer in the sixth off reliever Steve Woodard to raise his
AL-leading RBI total for July to 20.
</P>
<P>
   Garland (1-1) gave up two runs on three hits and five walks in
seven innings, striking out three in his second big league start.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Lee hit a two-run homer, his 18th, off Curtis Leskanic in
the seventh, and Jose Valentin drove in three runs for the White
Sox. Chicago has outscored opponents 37-14 over the last three
games.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Bere (6-7) pitching for the first time against his former
team, allowed six runs on seven hits and six walks in 3 1-3
innings. The wildness continued a yearlong trend for Milwaukee,
which leads the majors with 465 walks.
</P>
<P>
   Magglio Ordonez singled leading off the second and scored two
batters later on shortstop Jose Hernandez's throwing error. One out
later, Bere walked three straight batters to force in the second
run.
</P>
<P>
   Lee doubled to open the fourth, stole third and scored on
Herbert Perry's single, making it 3-0. Mark Johnson singled to put
runners at the corners and Ray Durham singled to score Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin singled through the drawn-in infield to drive in
Johnson and Durham and make it 6-0, finishing Bere.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Belliard hit a sacrifice fly in the fifth to bring Milwaukee
within 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Hayes hit his eighth homer, a solo shot to left in the
sixth to make it 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin hit an RBI double to score Durham in the bottom of the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bere was hit in the left calf by Paul Konerko's line drive
in the second, but stayed in the game. He threw 38 pitches -- 21
balls -- in the second. Bere's six walks tied a season high. ...
Garland worked only three innings in his major league debut July 4
at Kansas City, a 10-7 loss. ... Chicago committed an unusual
inning-ending double play in the first. With Thomas on first and
Valentin on second, Valentin attempted to steal third, but was
caught in a rundown. When Valentin returned to second, Thomas was
already standing on the bag. Third baseman Hayes tagged Valentin,
who was called safe by second base umpire Bill Welke. Hayes then
tagged Thomas, who was called out. Valentin, apparently confused
about who was out, then left second for the dugout and was tagged
by Hayes for the final out of the inning.

<HEADLINE> Agent: Titans, George Reach Deal  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans reached an
agreement Monday that will make Eddie George the highest-paid
running back in the NFL, his agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamont Smith confirmed that terms had been reached for a
six-year contract extension worth $42 million, including a $14
million signing bonus that will be paid out over the next 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing we're most pleased about is the deal places him in
that elite category, which he deserves,'' he said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   A news conference was scheduled for 4 p.m. CDT Tuesday at the
Titans' practice facility to announce the extension.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans had made signing George, a three-time Pro Bowl
selection, their top priority after signing coach Jeff Fisher to a
new contract this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   George, the 1995 Heisman Trophy winner from Ohio State, has been
the focus of the offense since he was drafted in 1996, and he had
said he wanted the deal done before reporting for training camp
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   George, who turns 27 in September, has not missed a game in his
first four seasons and has 25 100-yard games. The Titans are 20-5
when he has rushed for 100 yards, and he turned in a career-high
with 1,762 combined yards and a career-best 13 touchdowns last
season as the franchise reached its first Super Bowl in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   George also is one of only four running backs to rush for at
least 1,200 yards in each of their first four seasons, joining Eric
Dickerson, Earl Campbell and Barry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Indianapolis Colts signed rookie Edgerrin James to
a seven-year, $49 million contract, while the St. Louis Rams signed
Marshall Faulk to a seven-year, $45 million deal. Jamal Anderson of
the Atlanta Falcons signed a five-year, $32 million contract last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The signing bonus equals the $14 million cornerback Ty Law
received from the New England Patriots and tops the $13 million to
receiver Keyshawn Johnson of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers or Joey
Galloway's $12 million from the Dallas Cowboys.

<HEADLINE> Protester Climbs Down Building  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A man who spent 11 days on the ledge of a
downtown building in a protest over logging descended Monday into
the waiting arms of dozens of cheering supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a purple flower in his hair, the man who calls himself
''Tre Arrow'' rappelled barefooted from his 9-inch-wide,
30-foot-high perch on the U.S. Forest Service building.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not over by a long shot,'' he said after climbing off
the building.
</P>
<P>
   Arrow was taken into custody and is expected to face charges of
misdemeanor trespassing and contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   He climbed to the ledge July 7 to focus attention on plans to
log 1,030 acres of forest in the shadow of Mount Hood. Several
people camping outside the building had been hoisting food and
water up to him.
</P>
<P>
   Arrow assumed his perch after the forest service used dozens of
armed officials to break up a protest in the forest's Eagle Creek
area, where the logging is planned.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters say cutting the Eagle Creek timber will endanger
wildlife and pollute a drainage that provides water to 185,000
residents in the Portland area. The city's primary water supply
originates in a lake near 11,240-foot Mount Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Chris West, a vice president of the Northwest Forestry
Association, said that the disputed timber stands have been
extensively studied and that logging would pose no danger to water
quality or endangered species.

<HEADLINE> Barrows takes medical leave, city announces new temporary chief  </HEADLINE>
By RICH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - City Manager Saundra Key Borges appointed
a new acting chief of police Monday, relieving Capt. Deborah
Barrows of a role Barrows said she would fight to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Borges said late Monday that Capt. Robert Rudewicz had been
appointed to lead the troubled department. Rudewicz, who has been
with the department for 19 years, has served as head of the
department academy and most recently was in charge of its national
accreditation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Borges said she had left messages for Barrows and sent a
hand-delivered letter, but did not know Monday afternoon whether it
had been received.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is still a member of the force, unless she decides that's
not what she wants to do,'' Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrows said she was upset by how she was treated, but pledged
to support her successor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm devastated,'' Barrows said. ''My support now goes to the
acting chief to help him make the transition as easily as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Barrows had sent the city a request for 10 days
of medical leave, which was accompanied by a note from her doctor
stating she was under his care and taking medication. The note
arrived minutes before a scheduled meeting between Barrows, Borges
and Mayor Michael Peters.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Barrows was briefly hospitalized with chest
pains. She said nevertheless that she planned to fight to keep the
chief's job.
</P>
<P>
   Barrows, who took the job in April 1999 after former Police
Chief Joseph Croughwell went out on sick leave, was under fire on a
number of fronts. The chief state's attorney has been sharply
critical of the department's failure to turn over guns, money,
drugs and other property seized during arrests, and Barrows' use of
compensatory time is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Barrows attributed her troubles over the past 14 months to a
staff shortage and inadequate direction from city hall. She has
said she will fight to retain her position.
</P>
<P>
   Peters had said he wanted Barrows out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have to put a team together for the next
couple-three months, to make sure the right things happen, and then
get on and find a real chief ... to run this department,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said Saturday that Barrows has used more than 25
days' worth of comp time in the past 12 months. She is allowed only
10. Barrows said she was unaware of the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Borges suspended Barrows' use of comp time and vacation time
until the investigation is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Barrows said she was recovering time spent working from home, on
weekends and in the community.

<HEADLINE> Spain Protests Separatist Violence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALAGA, Spain (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of people marched in
Malaga and other Spanish cities Monday evening to protest a string
of attacks blamed on Basque separatists, including the slaying of a
politician.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest rally was in Malaga, the southern city where
town councilor Jose Maria Martin Carpena was shot dead Saturday
night as he waited with his wife and daughter for a ride to a
party.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Carpena's death was the sixth blamed on ETA since the
group ended a 14-month truce in December. ETA has killed around 800
people in its 30-year-old fight for an independent homeland in
northern Spain's Basque region.
</P>
<P>
   Police said an estimated 400,000 people snaked through the
streets of Malaga, including Health Minister Celia Villalobos,
whose name was found on a Basque separatist hit-list in 1998 while
serving as Malaga's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The current mayor, Francisco de la Torre, addressed himself
directly to the separatist group ETA in a speech Monday night in
which he mourned the slain councilor.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can kill one of our people. You can kill many of our
people. But so long as a single man or woman of Malaga breathes,
you cannot rob of us our freedom,'' de la Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke similar rallies were held in Madrid, where a car
bomb Wednesday injured nine people, and other cities such as
Zaragoza, Burgos and Cuenca.
</P>
<P>
   In Madrid's Puerta del Sol, a plaza just 100 yards or so from
where the car bomb exploded, hundreds of protesters waved placards
with anti-ETA slogans such as ''Basques, Yes; ETA, No'' and
''Without Guns You are No One.''
</P>
<P>
   The rallies followed solemn midday vigils in which civil
servants folded their hands and bowed their heads as they observed
15 minutes of silence in memory of Martin Carpena.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest of a string of attacks blamed on ETA, a car bomb
exploded Sunday outside a police barracks and injured one woman in
the northern town of Agreda.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja blamed ETA for all three of
the attacks over the past five days.

<HEADLINE> Gore Tours Campaign Headquarters  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A corsage for his mother, a Ronald
Reagan impersonation and T-shirts for his interns marked Al Gore's
tour of campaign headquarters, where he promised his troops: ''I am
not going to spare any effort to make sure that we win this
battle!''
</P>
<P>
   As aides whispered that internal polls were showing his race
with Republican George W. Bush tightening, the Democratic
presidential candidate spent Monday meeting with campaign
organizers from all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   A new CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll showed the two virtually tied
among likely voters, 48 percent for Bush and 46 percent for Gore,
largely based on the Democrat's gains among women and independents.
Bush had led in the same poll in late June.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his aides have been intently projecting the image that
they've gotten back on track. One aide even cited the occurrence of
the two-day, 50-state staff meeting, which would typically happen
closer to the party's national convention, as proof the team has
its act together after a lackluster post-primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the Gore campaign released plans for a Great
Lakes and Mississippi River boat tour of the Midwest battleground
states after the Aug. 14-17 Democratic National Convention,
although his plans between now and then -- including the critical
decision on a running mate -- remain up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   In between Monday's Nashville meetings and a $400,000 pair of
Democratic National Committee fund-raisers in Memphis, Gore called
a news conference in order to bash Bush for an opinion column in
Monday's Washington Post by Bush economic adviser, Martin
Feldstein.
</P>
<P>
   Feldstein wrote in defense of Bush's plan to allow workers to
invest some of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock
market. Selectively quoting Feldstein's words, Gore called it
confirmation that, under Bush's plan, the Social Security ''trust
fund runs dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Assessing Bush's fiscal agenda of major tax cuts and new
spending, Gore predicted deficits: ''Been there, done that, seen
the results, still paying the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has lately blamed Bush for a Texas budget shortfall
and wrinkles in the state's summer school lunch program, was asked
to square that criticism with his comment to The Associated Press
some months ago that Bush is unqualified to be president because
the Texas governorship is one of the nation's weakest and ''more
symbolic than powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What power he does have he has used to ill effect,'' Gore
shrugged on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He was also asked to respond to Bush's contention Sunday that,
if his record in Texas decides the presidential election, ''I'll
win in a landslide.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore grinned and said, ''People in the other 49 states vote in
this election.''
</P>
<P>
   At a $25,000 per person fund-raiser in Memphis, Gore referred to
the Bosnians as ''Bosniacs.'' A spokeswoman, aware of the ridicule
Bush faced for calling Greeks ''Grecians,'' hastened to clarify for
reporters that Bosniacs is a common and acceptable term in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Gore told about 150 aides, ''I understand very well how
hard the challenge is and how hard the work is.'' Their strategy
session was held at a Nashville hotel, where Gore also lunched with
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Pauline Gore, 87, wore the corsage of white roses her son had
given her that morning. They walked into headquarters hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Interns there whistled and cheered, all of them outfitted in new
T-shirts reading, ''Our vice president deserves a promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, bracing himself atop a wobbly office chair, cheered them
in return: ''Give it everything you have got and then some.''
</P>
<P>
   He admired the headquarters' open main floor, broken up only by
a walled-off pen for David Ginsberg, who heads up research on
Bush's record.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly in a good mood, Gore mimicked to uproarious laughter
Reagan's demand of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev at the Berlin
Wall: ''Mr. Ginsberg, tear down that wall!''

<HEADLINE> Phillies Players Hurt, Leave Game  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Desi Relaford
and catcher Mike Lieberthal left Monday night's game against the
New York Yankees with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Arias replaced Relaford, diagnosed with inflammation in his
right shoulder, in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been sore for about a month,'' Relaford said. ''It wasn't
any worse tonight. I never want to come out of a game. But that's
(manager Terry Francona's) decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Relaford, whose 21st error started the Yankees' five-run,
ninth-inning rally on Sunday, made a wild throw in the first, but
avoided an error when first baseman Pat Burrell caught the ball off
the bag and tagged out Chuck Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the first inning with that throw I started to think we
can't keep giving these guys extra outs,'' Francona said. ''So I
asked him how much it was bothering him. He said, no worse than
usual but it was sore.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal, who hit a two-run homer in the second off David
Cone, left for pinch-hitter Tom Prince in the fourth with a
sprained left ankle after a collision at home plate with Bernie
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and two outs in the third, Tino Martinez
singled to right field for the Yankees. Lieberthal caught Bobby
Abreu's throw home on the fly, braced himself and was knocked over
by Williams. Lieberthal's glove fell off and the ball rolled loose,
allowing Williams to score on the error.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer came out to check on Lieberthal, who stayed in the
game for the rest of the inning before leaving for a pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was having trouble running,'' Francona said. ''We took him
into the hall and asked him if he could go. It was obvious he was
in pain so we took him back to the hotel. It is pretty safe to say
he is not going to play tomorrow.''

WTO: US Acted Illegally in Dispute
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The United States acted illegally when it announced it was
going to impose sanctions on imports from the European Union in a dispute over
bananas, the World Trade Organization ruled Monday. The ruling said the United
States had effectively imposed unilateral retaliatory sanctions, which WTO rules
prohibit, requiring a country to get permission from the joint membership. The
United States applied in January 1999 for permission to impose sanctions worth
$520 million per year in the long-running banana dispute, claiming that the EU
had not complied with a WTO ruling that it should change its import policies.

Marriage Tax Relief Nears Vote

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed Monday for congressional approval of a
bill to slash income taxes by $248 billion over 10 years for married couples,
including those now paying more than two single taxpayers in hopes to draw sharp
contrasts with Democrats over tax cuts. The Senate began by defeating a number
of Democratic amendments, including a 50-46 vote against a less costly
alternative that would have given married couples a choice of filing taxes as
singles or jointly. Final Senate passage was set for Tuesday, with swift action
expected to follow in the House.
