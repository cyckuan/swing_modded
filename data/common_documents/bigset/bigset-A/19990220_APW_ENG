<HEADLINE> Rockies, Walker Discuss Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Upon hearing secondhand about Larry  
Walker's candid contract concerns, Colorado Rockies owner Jerry 
McMorris feared the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	A face-to-face meeting with Walker on Saturday helped alleviate  
some of the anxiety, but McMorris admitted the Rockies are far from 
reaching a contract extension with the reigning NL batting 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what they want,'' McMorris said. ``We've had  
inferences of what they want, but we've never had an official offer 
that Larry would sign. We're kind of negotiating with ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, 32, the National League MVP in 1997, says he would like  
to play until he's 40 and prefers to finish his career in Colorado. 
He also was straightforward about his doubts of returning to the 
Rockies next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There haven't been pleasant things said about me from the  
ownership,'' Walker said Friday. ``Right now I don't see myself in 
this clubhouse next year. This is my last year as far as the way I 
see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The not-so-pleasantries apparently came from Rockies co-owner  
Charlie Monfort during contract negotiations with Walker's agents. 
Walker and Monfort, incidentally, are close friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of like it was a disagreement in the family,''  
McMorris said. ``Things are taken perhaps out of context, but I 
think I helped put that behind us to get back to letting the 
professional people work on getting this done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, who will make $5.075 million in the final year of a  
five-year contract, said his meeting with McMorris was intended to 
clear up any misconceptions stemming from his frank comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to make sure there was nothing that offended him  
or ownership or the fans because that's not the way I wanted 
anything to come across,'' he said. ``I knew it was borderline to 
whether it did or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter where Walker ends up in 2000, odds are he will be paid  
handsomely. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles pitcher Kevin Brown (seven years, $105 million), New  
York Mets catcher Mike Piazza (seven years, $91 million), New York 
Yankees outfielder Bernie Williams (seven years, $87.5 million) and 
Anaheim first baseman Mo Vaughn (six years, $80 million) have set 
the standard. 
</P>
<P>
	McMorris would not discuss specifics, but he said the offer  
extended to Walker would surpass the richest contract agreement in 
Rockies history. Pitcher Darryl Kile is in the second year of a 
three-year, $24 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the economics of baseball have changed,''  
McMorris said. ``I know people think we should have tore up 
(Walker's) contract two years before it was up. If we had, do you 
really think he would have been happy with the one he would have 
signed two years ago? Come on. I don't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, who has hit .365 with 72 homers and 197 RBIs in the past  
two seasons, said he stands behind his comments but does not want 
Colorado fans to look at him as a whining superstar. 
</P>
<P>
	He emphasized his joking demeanor, and it was hard to argue with  
him as he went through workouts with a sanitary sock wrapped around 
his forehead like a karate headband. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think unless you know me personally, you might think I'm a  
real jerk,'' he said. ``That's something that I wanted to clear up 
with Jerry because I can do that face-to-face with him. I can't do 
it face-to-face with all the fans. It would take a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a warm handshake and friendly chat with McMorris, there  
still is no telling when Walker's future will be settled. He has 
set April 4 as his negotiating deadline, saying he can resume talks 
with the Rockies after the season if a deal isn't reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm done talking (publicly) about my contract,'' Walker said.  
``Next time I talk contract, hopefully it's because I'm going to be 
signing it.''

	Kosovo Deadline Pushed to Tuesday  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Unable to win Serb concessions on a  
NATO peacekeeping force but reporting ``substantial movement'' 
toward Albanian autonomy, the United States and five other nations 
agreed to extend to Tuesday a deadline for a Kosovo peace 
agreement. NATO had threatened airstrikes against the Serbs if they 
did not reach an agreement with ethnic Albanian insurgents by noon 
today. French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said the Yugoslav 
government of Slobodan Milosevic has not yet agreed to the NATO 
peacekeeping troops that would enforce a settlement, but ``we have 
not given up on convincing the government of Yugoslavia.''

<P>
	LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- Results are expected tomorrow from  
elections for a democratic legislature, moving Nigeria one step 
closer to civilian rule. The vote came one week before the 
presidential vote that is to complete Nigeria's transition to 
civilian rule. Many Nigerians, hardened by numbing poverty and the 
constant threat of political and ethnic violence, chose not to take 
part in the election of 360 representatives and 109 senators. 
Figures were not available, but foreign observers and Nigerian 
electoral authorities reported an unusually low turnout in many 
cities and towns after voting ended.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Film critic Gene Siskel, who wrote movie reviews  
for the Chicago Tribune and reviewed movies along with Roger Ebert 
on a syndicated television show, died today. Siskel, 53, had 
surgery in May to remove a growth from his brain, but returned to 
``Siskel &AMP; Ebert'' soon afterward. He announced earlier this month 
he was taking time off from that show to spend time recuperating

	NAACP May Sue Gun Makers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Since gun-related crimes hit minority  
communities at high rates across the country, the NAACP is 
considering joining the growing number of cities filing lawsuits 
against gun makers, NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said. He said he 
would present to the NAACP's 64-member Board of Directors several 
options, ranging from issuing a resolution that voices concern 
about guns to joining suits that filed by cities including Chicago 
and New Orleans. The NAACP also could file a separate suit.

<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- In an attempt to prevent further damage to  
a once pristine stretch of coast, salvage crews began pumping gooey 
fuel oil from a grounded freighter into storage tanks on the beach. 
The operation, which began about 6 p.m. today, was expected to last 
into early tomorrow. The salvage effort has been plagued by bad 
weather, broken equipment and environmentally-costly delays since 
the New Carissa grounded Feb. 4 and began leaking oil.

	Russia Wins No Promises at G7 Talks  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Western lenders understand that rescheduling  
Russia's debts is crucial to economic recovery, a Russian official 
said after talks today with finance ministers from creditor 
nations. The Group of Seven wealthiest nations issued a statement 
today that said creditors will reschedule Russia's debt once it 
meets demands of the International Monetary Fund. The IMF wants 
Russia to come up with a viable budget, improve government revenues 
and make progress in institutional and structural reforms.

Jordan's official Petra News Agency reported. The meeting between 
Gen. Henry Shelton and King Abdullah came a day after President 
Clinton asked Congress to quickly approve $300 million in economic

89-84 over the banged up New Jersey Nets. Kemp added 11 rebounds 
and scored nine of his points in the final quarter as the Cavs 
overcame a seven-point deficit. Keith Van Horn had 21 points and 
Kerry Kittles 19 for New Jersey, which has been plagued with injury 
problems this season.

with a 92-86 victory over Oregon to clinch their 12th consecutive 
20-win season. The Wildcats (20-4, 11-3 Pac-10) won their 30th in a 
row at home and their 14th straight over the Ducks in Tucson, but

	Kosovo Peace Deadline Extended  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Unable to win Serb concessions on a  
NATO peacekeeping force but still reporting ``substantial 
movement,'' Western nations extended the deadline for a Kosovo 
peace agreement to Tuesday. NATO had threatened airstrikes if the 
Serbs and ethnic Albanians were unable to reach an agreement by 
noon today. But the talks continued for more than seven hours 
beyond that deadline. French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said 
the Yugoslav government of Slobodan Milosevic has not yet agreed to

between the two countries in 51 years. Indian Prime Minister Atal 
Bihari Vajpayee crossed into Pakistan aboard a bus loaded with

	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Italian firm Olivetti Spa announced a $58

Italia, a former state monopoly, is the world's sixth-largest phone 
company. Earlier today, the Italian news agency ANSA reported that 
Telecom Italia's cellular subsidiary, Telecom Italia Mobile, might 
make a takeover bid for the parent company to block the expected

often fraught with ethnic and political tension, government 
officials ordered shops to remain closed and vehicles to stay off 
the roads until after the voting ended later today. Nigeria, a 
nation of 110 million people, has been ruled by the military for

8-1 in the Big East on the road this season and won at Connecticut 
for the first time ever. Tim James of Miami (18-6, 13-3) made two 
free throws with 1:40 left, the final points of the game. They came 
after the Huskies (23-2, 14-2) had scored eight straight points. 
Richard Hamilton, again struggling from the field, missed a

short jumper as the shot clock ran out.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Promise Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Impeachment behind them, Republican  
congressional leaders will promise in a paid newspaper 
advertisement this week to work with the president to save Social 
Security, cut taxes, improve schools and address the nation's 
defense needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The pledge will take the form of ``An Open Letter to the  
American People,'' signed by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert. It is to appear Tuesday in USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
	The undisclosed cost of the ad will be paid by the Republican  
National Committee. Its appearance will coincide with Congress' 
return to Washington after a weeklong break that followed the end 
of President Clinton's Senate impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to saving Social Security for today's  
seniors, tomorrow's baby boomers and for their children,'' the two 
leaders say in the letter. They also say the nation needs to 
``create the world's best schools for our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plan to ease the tax burden will put more money in the  
pockets of middle class Americans so they can provide more for 
their families while making government less wasteful and more 
efficient,'' Lott and Hastert wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	As for national security, the two men wrote that ``shrinking  
defense resources have worn down our equipment and hurt troop 
morale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the coming months we look forward to working with the  
president, our colleagues ... and you on these and other issues,'' 
Lott and Hastert wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders are weeks or months away from bringing some of their  
legislation to the floor. As of now, for example, no specific GOP 
plan exists for tax cuts or for shoring up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	One measure that will get early attention in the Senate is a  
plan to raise armed forces pay by 4.8 percent, effective Jan. 1, 
2000, more than the 4.4 percent contained in President Clinton's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Democrats will be looking beyond impeachment, as  
well, when they return to the Capitol this week. They are expected 
to launch a pre-emptive strike against GOP calls for a sweeping tax 
cut by saying it would provide benefits for the rich at the expense 
of Clinton's proposals for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is expected to journey to Capitol Hill the following  
week for a pep rally with rank and file Democratic lawmakers to 
help trumpet their legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes Social Security and Medicare, as well as a  
``Patient Bill of Rights'' that died last year, in part over 
Republican opposition to a proposal that would have allowed 
individuals to sue their HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the Democratic agenda is a union-backed increase in the  
minimum wage. That's an issue that could cause Republicans 
difficulty in the House, where the GOP holds only a six-seat 
majority, and in the Senate, where 19 Republicans are on the ballot 
in 2000 including several first-termers from industrial states. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, the Illinois Republican who led the impeachment  
prosecution team against Clinton, made some unusually strong 
comments in an article that appeared last week in the Chicago 
Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	``That no member of the Cabinet felt obliged in conscience to  
resign after the president had lied to them is a cause for 
concern,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``That many members of the Senate were unfamiliar with the facts  
of the case despite months of hearings in the House and extensive 
media coverage is a cause for concern. ... That the Senate 
Democrats treated this as a party-line vote is a matter of 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What I cannot understand, frankly, is why not a single Senate  
Democrat, including those who condemned the president in language 
even harsher than their House colleagues proposed, called upon the 
president to resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the House who voted to impeach, he added, ``have  
nothing to apologize for. We did our duty.''

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Women and children fled new fighting  
in southwest Kosovo, witnesses said Saturday, while ethnic 
Albanians in the provincial capital boarded buses for the 
countryside fearing NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	With negotiations for a peace agreement continuing past a noon  
deadline in Rambouillet, France, Serb security forces and ethnic 
Albanians fought in at least two villages Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortars and automatic weapons fire rocked the village of  
Studencane about 1 1/2 miles northwest of Suva Reka, said Beatrice 
Lecoste, a spokeswoman for the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said women and children were seen fleeing the village.  
Lecoste said it was unclear which side was attacking. However, the 
village is located near where two Serb brothers were found dead 
Saturday -- apparently kidnapped and murdered by ethnic Albanians -- 
and where the Serbian Media Center said police came under fire 
earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting was also reported Saturday near Podujevo, about 25  
miles north of Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are afraid the Serbs will make a massacre of civilians,''  
said one ethnic Albanian commander near Podujevo, who gave his name 
only as Isak. ``We are ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the provincial capital, Pristina, Serb police stopped  
vehicles and checked papers in the center of the city for the first 
time in months. They also set up new checkpoints on highways 
leading into the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of ethnic Albanian students were crowding aboard buses  
heading for home villages where they feel safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility of NATO attack is real,'' one student, Ymet  
Veliu, said. ``I'm worried what is going to happen after that, 
especially because of the threat from the Serb side to retaliate 
against Albanians for NATO attacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others loaded cars to drive to nearby Macedonia.  
</P>
<P>
	Serbs were also frightened that NATO airstrikes, which could  
follow the collapse of the Rambouillet talks, might encourage the 
Kosovo Liberation Army to target members of their minority 
community. The KLA is fighting Kosovo's independence. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Serbian town of Mdalenovac, 25 miles south of Belgrade,  
speakers told a gathering of the Serbian Radical Party that the 
United States was using the Rambouillet conference to extend its 
control to Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans' only goal is to have NATO troops stationed in  
Kosovo,'' one speaker, Stevo Dragisic, said. ``They do not care 
about the fate of Kosovo ... All they care about is fulfilling 
their own national goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Americans were ``Nazis,'' and said American policies  
toward Serbia were worse that Hitler's.

<HEADLINE> Angels Catcher Recovering Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Angels catcher Todd Greene says he's  
throwing without difficulty, 18 months after undergoing shoulder 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, 27, played only 29 games last season after undergoing  
the surgery following the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the Angels' top prospect in 1995, hitting 40 home runs in  
the minor leagues. In 1997, he hit nine homers and 24 RBIs for the 
Angels in 124 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shoulder has responded pretty well because I'm taking care  
of it,'' Greene said Saturday. ``I'm anxious to get to the point 
where I'm back to business as usual, but I feel like I'm getting 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angels manager Terry Collins has placed Greene under a strict  
regimen of throwing every other day in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he can't throw, he will still catch, but somebody else  
will throw the ball back to the pitcher,'' Collins said. ``We'll 
also try him in the outfield on those days, so he can work on 
moving around out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins has not ruled out using Greene as a designated hitter,  
but it appears that Tim Salmon, Garret Anderson and Dave Hollins 
will also occupy that role. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels are stocked at catcher as well, with veteran Charlie  
O'Brien, Matt Walbeck and Phil Nevin. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it's not like we're in a panic mode,'' Collins said. ``Todd  
is still a young man with a heck of future. We'd hate to ruin it 
all by rushing him back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might take some time. Who knows how long. But he'll be back  
strong.''

<HEADLINE> Logger Killed in Oregon Landslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNES CITY, Ore. (AP) -- One logger was killed and another was  
still missing today after they were hit by a landslide of mud, 
trees and heavy brush. 
</P>
<P>
	The slide near Siltcoos Lake, about 50 miles west of Eugene, was  
not discovered until the loggers failed to return from their work 
site Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Robert George Winona, 48, of Florence, was found  
early Friday. But 25 searchers aided by tracking dogs found no sign 
of Charles Max Lee, 60, of Florence. The search was continuing 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're treating this like we would an avalanche, with a safety  
person up top watching for movement and an engineer keeping an eye 
on things in the search area,'' said John Miller, a 
search-and-rescue coordinator for the sheriff's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities estimated the slide was 150 feet long, 50 feet wide  
and 20 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men worked for Davidson Industries Inc. of Mapleton. The  
company shut down its sawmill operations Friday while employees 
assisted the search, said Aubrey Pendergrass, property manager for 
Davidson.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Gets Drivers License </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REGENSDORF, Switzerland (AP) -- Martina Hingis, the world's No. 1  
women's tennis player, had her first day of freedom on the roads 
Saturday after getting her drivers license. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old had won nearly everything possible in her sport,  
but she had not always been able to profit from her success. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis has four vehicles -- two Opels and two Porsches -- won or  
presented to her during the course of her tennis career, but she 
has not been allowed to drive them unaccompanied until now. 
</P>
<P>
	She passed her test on the first attempt Friday. The minimum age  
to drive in Switzerland is 18, and Hingis has been taking lessons 
between tournaments since her birthday Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis said her biggest fear had been not sticking to the speed  
limits. 
</P>
<P>
	She drove away in an Opel with red and black leather and her  
name on the side.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Explores Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Yes, her potential Republican opponent for  
the U.S. Senate seat is strong, but she is riding high in the polls 
and has name recognition to die for. 
</P>
<P>
	Her supporters say fund raising should be easy and her stature  
will make her an instant force in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton, 1999? No, Geraldine Ferraro, 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	As Mrs. Clinton contemplates running for the Senate seat being  
vacated next year by fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, she 
can look to Ms. Ferraro's experience for guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	In late 1997, Ms. Ferraro was riding high.  
</P>
<P>
	The statewide polls showed her leading all comers for the  
Democratic nomination to take on three-term Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. 
She was the only Democrat ahead of the GOP incumbent. As a former 
vice presidential candidate, she was known to most New Yorkers. 
Given that celebrity status, Ms. Ferraro said she would need less 
money than most, but would be able to quickly raise as much as she 
would need. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, a cash-strapped Ms. Ferraro was beaten 2-1 by  
Charles Schumer in the Democratic Senate primary. Schumer went on 
to oust D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
	There is almost no chance Mrs. Clinton would be contested in a  
primary. The only other Democrat seriously looking at the race, 
Rep. Nita Lowey, has said she would support Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are several similarities between Ms. Ferraro's failed  
run and the circumstances surrounding Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll released Thursday from Marist College's Institute for  
Public Opinion showed the first lady leading New York City Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani, a possible Republican opponent, 49 percent to 38 
percent. Just 4 percent of those polled said they didn't know 
enough about her to form a favorable or unfavorable opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's supporters say money -- even the $10 million or  
more she might need for a New York Senate run -- is not an issue. 
Also, she has relationships with some of the top campaign 
consultants in the business thanks to her experience with national 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``She would be a leader right from the beginning,'' former New  
York Mayor Edward Koch says. ``She wouldn't have to go through five 
years of carrying coffee for other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton could find herself facing one key problem that  
plagued Ms. Ferraro throughout her campaign -- the rationale for her 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schumer camp portrayed Ms. Ferraro as someone whose time had  
passed and a candidate without a concrete agenda. Schumer, then a 
congressman, was presented as the experienced officeholder with 
up-to-the-minute ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Candidate Clinton has to answer the questions: Why New York  
and why now?'' Marist pollster Lee Miringoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	```Why New York?' is the so-called carpetbagger issue,'' he  
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	His poll found that 46 percent of voters had concerns about her  
being a non-New Yorker. At the moment, according to Miringoff, 
``she's not from anywhere, she's from TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	```Why now?' is: What is the issue? What is she running for?''  
Miringoff added. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview airing Sunday on the New York City CBS  
affiliate, Giuliani hinted at the kind of campaign he would wage 
against the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Last spring, Mrs. Clinton said she thought ``it will be in the  
long-term interests of the Middle East for Palestine to be a 
state,'' a point of view from which the Clinton administration 
quickly distanced itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani called Mrs. Clinton's remarks ``a very big mistake ...  
of basically siding with the Palestinians against the Israelis. ... 
Obviously it's an issue ... You've either got to stick with it or 
you've got to work yourself out of it and explain your change of 
mind about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ferraro, for one, thinks Mrs. Clinton should consider  
passing up the New York Senate race in favor of taking time off to 
write a book after her White House years are over and then run for 
the Senate from her home state of Illinois in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's got two more years in the White House. She's got an  
incredible bully pulpit ... She would give that up'' if she ran for 
Senate, Ms. Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has promised a decision ``later this year.''

<HEADLINE> Official: Clinic Threats From Ky. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- At least 14 letters claiming to include  
anthrax and mailed to abortion and Planned Parenthood centers 
across the nation this week were postmarked in Lexington, a postal 
inspector said. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial tests show that the threats received Thursday and Friday  
were hoaxes, similar to the anthrax warnings sent to clinics in 
Louisville and other U.S. cities in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Ostwalt, who heads the Louisville postal inspection office  
and is a member of a federal task force investigating the letters, 
said authorities believe all the threats are connected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lexington-postmarked letters containing explicit threats  
were reported at abortion clinics or Planned Parenthood centers 
Thursday in Milwaukee; Cincinnati; Washington, D.C.; Manchester, 
N.H.; Rapid City, S.D.; Asheville, N.C.; Charleston, S.C.; and 
Sioux Falls, S.D., Ostwalt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other letters was received Friday in Birmingham, Ala., Des  
Moines, Iowa; and several cities in Vermont, Ostwalt said in 
today's Lexington Herald-Leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax mostly affects farm animals, but its germs, when inhaled  
by humans, can cause flu-like symptoms and can lead to death if not 
treated early enough with antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	Phony anthrax threats have been very common in recent months,  
including the October incidents affecting abortion clinics in four 
states. It is a federal felony to send an anthrax threat, even if 
it is a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno has created a national task  
force to prosecute and prevent threats against other abortion 
providers.

                           *Kurt Eissler    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kurt Eissler, the founder and former director of  
the Sigmund Freud Archives, died Wednesday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Eissler was relatively unknown outside of professional circles  
but by the 1980s had collected thousands of tapes, letters and 
papers for the Sigmund Freud Archives, which he founded with other 
psychoanalysts after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	A staunch defender of Freud's theories, Eissler's papers covered  
topics including the treatment of schizophrenics and delinquents, 
and he wrote many books within his field and on Freudian history. 
Among them are ``The Psychiatrist and the Dying Patient'' (1955) 
and ``Talent and Genius,'' about Viktor Tausk, Freud's troubled 
student (1971). 
</P>
<P>
	His intense interest in Freud led to a friendship with Sanskrit  
scholar and psychoanalyst Jeffrey Mousaieff Masson, the man Eissler 
handpicked to succeed him as director of the Freud archives. That 
friendship ended when Masson criticized Freud as having moved away 
from reality and opined that Freudian psychoanalysis had come to a 
dead halt. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend of Eissler remembered him as being disappointed by  
Masson, because he had not found a person who understood Freud the 
way he did to succeed him as director of the archives.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andreas Feininger, a pioneering photographer  
known for his richly detailed images of New York City featured in 
Life magazine in the 1940s, died Thursday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Paris and raised in Germany, Feininger moved in 1939 to  
the United States where he worked as a free-lance photographer with 
the Black Star Picture Agency. His clients soon included Life, and 
he joined its staff in 1943. From then until he left in 1962, he 
completed 346 assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	His renowned photographs of the New York skyline and of the  
streets and sidewalks of mid-Manhattan caught in rush-hour gridlock 
first appeared in the magazine, exhibiting experimental techniques 
and equipment Feininger devised and perfected. 
</P>
<P>
	The author of more than 30 books, Feininger's private  
photographs focused on the form of neutral objects, like feathers, 
bones and shells. 
</P>
<P>
	His work has been shown throughout the country. Most recently he  
chose 80 of his favorite photographs from his 60-year career for a 
retrospective that has toured Europe since 1997.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Teruo Kawamoto, who fought for people sickened by  
mercury poisoning in Japan, has died of liver cancer, a family 
member said Friday. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Kawamoto headed a group of victims of Minamata disease, which  
resulted from tons of mercury being dumped into the sea surrounding 
the town from 1932 into the '60s. Hundreds died and thousands were 
disabled by the disease, which caused nervous system damage in the 
victims and birth defects in their children. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kawamoto suffered from mercury poisoning, his death from  
cancer was not directly related to Minamata disease.

<P>
	HENDERSONVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Ralph F. Reikowsky, a longtime  
editor with the Washington Post, has died. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Reikowsky, a native of Uniontown, Ohio, died Friday at a nursing  
home. The cause of death was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	A graduate of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., he was  
an editor for the Washington Post for 32 years until his retirement 
in 1982. After his retirement he moved to Hendersonville. 
</P>
<P>
	He served in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II.  
</P>
<P>
	Reikowsky is survived by a son, two daughters, two sisters and  
two brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	John Charles Reikowsky of Springfield, Va; two daughters,  
Suellen Daugherty of Fairfax, Va., and Kathleen Ann Mahoney of 
Centreville, Va., and his two sisters and two brothers.

                            *Gene Siskel    	
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Film critic Gene Siskel, known for the thumbs-up  
and thumbs-down reviews he and Roger Ebert shared on their popular 
TV show, died Saturday. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel had surgery in May to remove a growth from his brain, but  
returned to the syndicated television show ``Siskel &AMP; Ebert'' soon 
afterward. He announced earlier this month he was taking time off 
from that show to spend time recuperating from the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He died at Evanston Hospital near Chicago, surrounded by his  
family. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel wrote movie reviews for the Chicago Tribune and also did  
reviews for ``CBS This Morning'' and WBBM-TV in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	He had said when he announced his leave on Feb. 3 that he  
expected to return to writing his reviews and the television show 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel and Ebert are likely the most recognizable movie critics  
in the nation. Their trademark ``thumbs-up'' and ``thumbs-down'' 
reviews became a benchmark for the movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Their show's continuing success was largely attributed to the  
chemistry between the tall, balding Siskel and the heavyset Ebert. 
They appeared to practice a one-upmanship that was in the tradition 
of the rivalry of their newspapers. Ebert is a critic for the 
Chicago Sun-Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Their conflicting opinions often prompted the other to respond  
with biting sarcasm. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Paul Schmidt    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Paul Schmidt, who translated Arthur Rimbaud's  
poems and Anton Chekhov's plays and worked in avant-garde music and 
theater for much of his life, has died. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt died from complications of AIDS at St. Luke's-Roosevelt  
Hospital Center on Friday, said his brother Jim. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert in Slavic languages, he spent many years translating  
the writings of Velemir Khlebnikov, an obscure Russian poet who 
died in 1922. He brought Khlebnikov's play ``Zangezi'' to the stage 
in Los Angeles in 1986. It later ran at the Brooklyn Academy of 
Music. 
</P>
<P>
	For the academy's 1995 Next Wave Festival, he composed a  
libretto for the opera ``Alice,'' which was based on Lewis 
Carroll's ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ``Through the 
Looking Glass.'' Composer Tom Waits and director Robert Wilson 
collaborated on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Playwrights Horizons and the Music Theater Group presented  
``Black Sea Follies,'' a play Schmidt wrote, in 1986. His 
collection of Rimbaud translations, titled ``A Season in Hell'' 
after the poet's masterpiece by the same name, was published in 
1997, with photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe.

<HEADLINE> Person Claims Being Fiat Passenger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A person claiming to be a passenger in the mystery  
car that brushed against Princess Diana's Mercedes the night of her 
death has contacted a lawyer for Mohamed Al Fayed, the lawyer said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The person, who was not further identified, appeared ``more  
trustworthy'' than dozens of others who have made such claims, said 
the lawyer, Bernard Dartevelle. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the person could simply be someone seeking the reward  
money put up by Al Fayed, Dartevelle acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Fayed, the father of Diana's companion Dodi Fayed, who also  
died in the crash, has offered a $1.65 million reward to help find 
the driver of the white Fiat. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests have confirmed that the Mercedes carrying Diana and her  
companion, Dodi Fayed, did have a brush with a Fiat Uno before 
crashing in a Paris tunnel on Aug. 31, 1997. However, it is not 
known to what extent the incident caused the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have questioned almost 3,000 owners of Fiat Unos, with no  
luck. The purported passenger told Dartevelle they were in a white 
Citroen AX, not an Uno.

<HEADLINE> Facts About Bioterrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Experts say the United States is at risk of a bioterrorist  
attack -- using germs to kill instead of bombs. It will fall to 
doctors, not the military or police, to spot that an attack has 
occurred and fight off the diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	But doctors aren't prepared, experts told 1,000 health and  
terrorism workers gathered last week at the first medical 
conference on bioterrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk of a mass attack killing thousands is low but possible;  
smaller attacks are more likely, they said. The worst agents would 
be smallpox and anthrax. 
</P>
<P>
	Smallpox is a highly contagious, untreatable virus. Wild  
smallpox was eradicated decades ago, but the Soviet Union and 
others experimented with turning laboratory supplies of smallpox 
virus into bioweapons, so the virus still exists. If the virus was 
used by terrorists, the world would be vulnerable because no one 
has been vaccinated in decades. Vaccine a few days after exposure 
to smallpox can protect, but there are only 6-7 million doses left 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax is more deadly if people inhale the germ spores -- 80  
percent of the infected die -- and is believed more readily 
available than smallpox. But the infection is not spread 
person-to-person like smallpox. The military is getting vaccinated, 
but there isn't enough for civilians. However, antibiotics given 
before symptoms appear can prevent disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Health and Human Services is spending $158  
million this year to prepare for possible bioterrorism. A top 
priority is creating a national stockpile of treatments and 
vaccines.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Woman Claims Clinton Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's lawyer says allegations  
that the president sexually assaulted an Arkansas woman more than 
20 years ago are ``absolutely false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her first published accounts, Juanita Broaddrick said ``I was  
sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton'' at a Little Rock, Ark., hotel 
in 1978 when he was state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of the alleged attack on Mrs. Broaddrick has been  
circulating for years. She has refused to comment until now. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Mrs. Broaddrick, she first met Clinton when he  
visited the nursing home she operated in 1978. He was running for 
governor at the time and she was a campaign worker. Clinton invited 
her to visit him sometime at campaign headquarters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Broaddrick said she was in Little Rock for a nursing home  
seminar and called the headquarters and arranged to meet Clinton 
for coffee at her hotel. He suggested they have coffee in her room, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hotel room, Clinton forced her to have sex, Mrs.  
Broaddrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton lawyer David Kendall issued a denial as The Associated  
Press and today's Washington Post and New York Post ran stories 
based on interviews with Mrs. Broaddrick. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any allegation that the president assaulted Mrs. Broaddrick  
more than 20 years ago is absolutely false,'' Kendall said. 
``Beyond that, we're not going to comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart was dismissive of the first  
published account of Mrs. Broaddrick's story, which appeared in 
Friday's Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spend very little time reading the Wall Street Journal  
editorial page,'' Lockhart told reporters. ``They lost me after 
they accused the president of being a drug smuggler and a 
murderer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Mrs. Broaddrick's story emerged, Paula Jones said Friday  
night she has few regrets about her sexual harassment lawsuit 
against the president and would go through it again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a hard, hard world. ... it was really hard, because  
I knew what the truth was; people didn't want to believe me,'' Mrs. 
Jones said on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She called the $850,000 that settled the case ``somewhat of an  
apology. I don't think I would have ever gotten it from (Clinton's) 
mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the AP interview, Mrs. Broaddrick said she did not go to the  
police at the time ``because of the mentality of the '70s. There I 
was, I was married, I was also in a relationship with another man, 
and ... I was there alone in a hotel room with the attorney general 
and I didn't think anyone would possibly believe me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why she was telling her story now, she said she was  
countering rumors that she had been bribed and intimidated to stay 
quiet. In a second interview with the AP today, Mrs. Broaddrick 
added that going public with her story has ``been therapy for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also did an interview with NBC that has not been broadcast.  
Mrs. Broaddrick said she felt the network had let her ``hang out to 
dry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC spokeswoman Alex Constantinople said, ``We don't comment on  
our news gathering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Clinton, Mrs. Broaddrick said, ``I don't have an agenda  
where he is concerned. I could care less what happens to the man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Broaddrick's name first came to light in the 1992  
presidential campaign, when a friend to whom she had confided wrote 
a letter recounting her story. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Mrs. Jones subpoenaed Mrs. Broaddrick and obtained  
an affidavit in which she denied that Clinton made ``unwelcome 
sexual advances toward me in the late seventies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, during Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's  
investigation of the Monica Lewinsky matter, Mrs. Broaddrick told 
investigators that the affidavit was false, according to a written 
summary of their interview with her. Starr sent some materials 
relating to Mrs. Broaddrick to the House of Representatives, where 
they were available for members to review before voting on 
impeachment.

<HEADLINE> Ho Chi Minh Poster Feud Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A shopkeeper whose display of Ho Chi Minh's  
photo and the Vietnamese flag sparked weeks of protests denied a 
connection to the Vietnamese government and said his family fought 
communism in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every morning I would get up and hear bombs, like fireworks,''  
Truong Van Tran said Friday. ``But that was the past. You cannot 
live in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tran's video store has been closed since mid-January, when  
protests began. Many residents of the Little Saigon area are angry 
because he hung a portrait of the late communist leader and the 
flag in his front window last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The shopkeeper heeded a judge's order to take down the display  
but she reversed her decision last week. Tran said he planned to 
reopen the store and rehang the items, but he would not say when. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been slapped or punched at least twice in confrontations  
with protesters and police this week refused to let him return to 
the store. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran also is fighting eviction by his landlord over proof of  
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran said he displayed the items to support his beliefs that  
Vietnam under communist rule is better than most 
Vietnamese-Americans believe and the community should be trying to 
foster better relations with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my idea, I control my own ideas,'' Tran said in a news  
conference at the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern 
California. ``If we are all free to express ourselves, the 
community will be stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tran's support of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a  
minority view in Little Saigon, a community of 200,000 dominated by 
anti-communist exiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Many lost relatives to communist soldiers and they despise Ho  
Chi Minh, comparing Tran's act to displaying a picture of Hitler in 
a Jewish neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran, who grew up in South Vietnam and is now 37, said some of  
his relatives were killed or injured by communist soldiers in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran said he sent a taunting fax to anti-communist groups before  
the protests began because someone knocked down the Ho Chi Minh 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here, I dare all of you ... if you all think you are great,  
then go ahead, come over to clear me out,'' he said in the fax.

<HEADLINE> Threat Stops 2 Trains in Montana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVRE, Mont. (AP) -- Two passenger trains were halted in north  
central Montana on Saturday after Amtrak received a threat that a 
train was carrying radioactive material, federal authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threats were received in California against the train that  
was going to be going through Havre, Montana,'' said George 
Dougherty, FBI special agent in Salt Lake City. ``We weren't given 
an exact train number on the threat, so we took precaution and went 
ahead and (stopped) both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Tim Solomon said eastbound and westbound Amtrak Empire  
Builder trains, which run between Chicago and Seattle, were stopped 
in Havre at about 6 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	The trains were carrying a total of up to 350 passengers, who  
were being taken to a National Guard armory while crews made 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told us first it was a drug bust,'' said Amtrak sleeping  
car attendant Melvin Roberts. ``Then we found out later it had 
something to do with radioactivity. Any time you hear anything 
about nuclear devices and all the problems today -- you don't know 
what to think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors did not immediately report finding any radioactive  
material. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the process of conducting a search of the trains to  
make sure that the trains are 100 percent safe before they leave 
Havre and head to their destinations,'' Dougherty said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Berates Driver for Infraction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- William Bristol may not be the best judge  
of how to handle traffic infractions -- that's according to a driver 
he chased down after a conflict on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol, a judge in Monroe County, said he was just doing his  
civic duty when he followed Johanna Goosey home and was trying to 
teach her some manners. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Goosey, 20, accused him of harassing her and being mean  
and condescending. 
</P>
<P>
	American Automobile Association official Jim VerSteeg criticized  
the judge's behavior, saying ``it definitely has the tone of a 
possible aggressive driving incident.'' VerSteeg cautioned drivers 
against personal confrontations and recommended instead calling 
911. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 54-year-old Bristol, who has been a judge since 1980,  
said he's not the one to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's odd that I'm trying to do the right thing and teach a  
good lesson so that someone doesn't get hurt in the future and that 
I was somehow looked at as being someone who shouldn't do that,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute began Nov. 28 when Bristol was driving behind  
Goosey. She started to make a left turn but came to a halt, 
thinking she was headed the wrong way down a one-way street -- which 
she wasn't. Her car was blocking traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol said when he honked his horn, Goosey shouted, cursed and  
made an obscene hand gesture. She denied cursing or gesturing. 
Goosey said he followed her for 10 minutes and when she stopped at 
a traffic light, he walked up and began ``beating on the windshield 
like a lunatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said he merely tapped on her windshield, showed his  
business card and asked to speak with her. When Goosey screamed at 
him, he said, he called police from his cellular telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	He followed her home, parked across the street and waited for  
police. Because officers didn't witness the errant driving, they 
said they couldn't fill out a reckless driving report as Bristol 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
	In a police report, the judge is quoted as calling her  
``stupid'' and saying, ``All we are dealing with are people with 
just a high school education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goosey opted not to press charges. ``I didn't think it would do  
any good,'' especially since Bristol is a judge, she said in 
Saturday's Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. ``I just wanted it 
over with.''

<HEADLINE> Loot From $17M Heist Auctioned Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The expensive toys bought with the loot  
from a $17 million robbery at an armored car company went on the 
auction block Saturday, with thousands of people bidding for cars, 
boats, tanning beds and a velvet Elvis painting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of history, man,'' said Mike Hartness, who was  
taking snapshots of his friends in front of Elvis, which was the 
biggest crowd pleaser. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the items came from Steve and Michelle Chambers, who  
have pleaded guilty to helping former Loomis, Fargo &AMP; Co. vault 
supervisor David Scott Ghantt steal the money from the company's 
building in Charlotte on Oct. 4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction's proceeds will be used to reimburse insurance  
company Lloyds of London, which had to pay out after the robbery, 
according to the U.S. Attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen people, including Ghantt and the Chamberses, have  
pleaded guilty in the case. Most of them will be sentenced this 
week in Charlotte federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction of more than 1,000 items drew thousands of bidders  
and several network television news crews. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Elvis, this auction featured 15 vehicles, including a  
BMW, pickup trucks, minivans, two boats and six motorcycles. Four 
tractor-trailers were needed to haul all the furniture, big screen 
televisions and other items to the flea market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, how many tanning beds do you need?'' asked auction  
attendee Melanie Snyder, looking at a row of tanning beds taken 
from the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weeks following the robbery, the Chambers moved from a  
small mobile home in nearby Gaston County to a $635,000, 
7,000-square-foot home in tony Cramer Mountain. They also went on a 
frantic spending spree, buying artworks, big-screen TVs, furniture 
and expensive cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Loomis robbery has taken on an almost legendary status, as  
seen by the crowd checking out the merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	``This proves that even though you can steal millions of dollars  
you can't buy class,'' said Monica Debi, who put in a bid in on a 
mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	The BMW ragtop that Michelle Chambers bought for herself  
following the heist went for $32,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A black sport-utility vehicle went for $27,500, followed by a  
winning bid of $16,000 for a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, it came time for Elvis.  
</P>
<P>
	The bidding started at $200. Two minutes later, the bids were  
more than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Charlotte pawn shop owner Tom Shaw bought the painting  
with a $1,600 bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to display it in my shop,'' he said. ``I'll put a plate  
under it to let my customers know where it came from.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton is the choice over New  
York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in a hypothetical New York state 
election for the U.S. Senate, and 78 percent of Americans think she 
would be at least somewhat effective as a senator, according to 
polls released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Time/CNN poll of registered voters in New York state, 52  
percent said they would vote for Mrs. Clinton, 43 percent said 
they'd vote for Giuliani if the election were held now. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek magazine found in a national poll that 41 percent of  
respondents said Mrs. Clinton would be very effective if elected to 
the Senate, 37 percent said she'd be somewhat effective, 9 percent 
said she would be not too effective and 7 percent said she would be 
not at all effective. 
</P>
<P>
	The Newsweek poll interviewed 502 people age 18 and older on  
Feb. 19. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 5 percentage

<HEADLINE> Kennan To Lead NFL Coaches Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Longtime assistant coach Larry Kennan has  
become executive director of the NFL Coaches Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennan, whose last assistant coaching tenure was with the New  
England Patriots, was appointed to a five-year term. Kennan said 
Saturday that this was an important step toward league recognition 
of the association, which was started to help coaches operating in 
the high-job-turnover world of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``The five-year commitment is very significant because we have  
felt all along that a lot of people were just waiting for us to go 
away,'' Kennan said Saturday from the NFL Scouting Combine. ``This 
says to everybody in the world we are not going to go away, we are 
here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's here for the purpose to benefit coaches both active and  
retired in all areas of their life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main issue the Coaches Association is trying to address is  
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL benefits committee is reviewing the association's  
proposal and will pass it along to the NFL's finance committee at 
the league's March meetings in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The current benefits for coaches are the same as any employee at  
any team. But because coaches get fired on average every three 
years and less than 7 percent of all the assistant coaches are ages 
60 or above, the association believes standard benefit plans are 
not effective. 
</P>
<P>
	The association wants to see the retirement age -- currently 65 --  
calculated using a formula that combines the coaches ages and years 
of experience coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	The association also is seeking a health insurance system that  
will cover coaches if they're fired and a better system for 
severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen of the league's 31 coaches are dues-paying members of  
the Coaches Association. Three teams -- Cincinnati, Dallas and New 
Orleans -- won't allow their coaches to join the organization.

<HEADLINE> eBay Halts Online Sales of Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Concerned about its ability to comply  
with firearms laws, Internet auction company eBay says it will no 
longer allow the sale of guns or ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Jose-based company said Friday that firearms sales was  
an area of growing concern because online sellers cannot guarantee 
that buyers meet all the qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we started, the firearms categories were targeted  
primarily to serious collectors,'' said Steve Westly, vice 
president of marketing and business development at eBay. ``Now 
we're starting to see standard-issue firearms that are not 
collectible and are not appropriate for sale online.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certain guns and ammunition are illegal to sell in some states,  
and federal laws govern many aspects of firearms purchases, 
including how weapons can be shipped and who may purchase them. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the largest online auction sites do not carry firearms,  
or carry only limited listings. 
</P>
<P>
	eBay, the leading online auction house, has been under  
investigation by at least four states for the use of the service by 
con artists.

<HEADLINE> Piazza Is Main Draw at Mets Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- There's some debate whether the  
three-hour workout or the following autograph session was tougher 
on Mike Piazza as the New York Mets opened their spring training 
camp Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza, seven other catchers and 22 pitchers rotated work  
stations during the Mets first practice session from 10 a.m. until 
after 1 p.m. under the direction of manager Bobby Valentine and his 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	But it took Piazza 40 minutes to get from the back fields at  
Thomas J. White Stadium to the clubhouse as he stopped to sign more 
than 500 autographs for fans of all ages who formed a line to get 
the slugger's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt that Mike brings a different aura to our  
group,'' Valentine said. ``He's special, he's that marquee player, 
he's a superstar. He's personable, talented and good looking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance of Piazza on the first day had a notable affect  
on the crowd of more than 1,500 who meandered through the complex, 
many of them in the catcher's wake as he moved from field to field 
to go through the rigors of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine also took notice of his pitchers who took went through  
their first-day workouts which included throwing, fielding and 
hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really like the conditioning of the guys, good conditioning  
and good strength base,'' Valentine said. ``They looked super 
strong today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said that Paul Wilson and Jason Isringhausen, injured  
the past few years, looked good and also praised projected Hideo 
Nomo, who was very inconsistent last year.. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't sure what I was going to see with Nomo,'' Valentine  
said. ``He looked better today than he did at any time last year in 
both his command and velocity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said it appeared that Nomo had better balance and  
strength in his delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said that another reliever Derek Wallace, another  
young pitcher recovering from an arm injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really lean, I've never seen him in that type of physical  
condition,'' Valentine said. ``His arm looked really in shape, he 
must have changed diet, strength and conditioning; done everything 
different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the left-handers took to the bullpen, Valentine gave out  
rapid-fire praise as they went through their 10-minute hurling 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had six pretty good left-handers, all with stripes, all  
veteran status,'' Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Rigo) Beltran handles himself like he's been around for 10  
years, he has a little bit of history, I guess. They were throwing 
that pitch low and away which is what you want to see left-handers 
do that first day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korean pitcher Jae Weong Seo was the only opening day absentee,  
as he is still trying to obtain his visa from the U.S. Embassy.

<HEADLINE> Top Thoroughbred Trainer Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dick Dutrow, the nation's leading thoroughbred  
trainer in 1975, has died of cancer. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	He died Friday at his home in Laurel, Md.  
</P>
<P>
	Dutrow became the first Maryland-based trainer in nearly 60  
years to become the nation's leading trainer, saddling 352 winners, 
a total which was then a record. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutrow ran a successful claiming stable in Maryland until coming  
to New York in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his best known horses was King's Swan, who rose from the  
claiming ranks to become a multiple stakes winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutrow returned to Maryland in 1997 and tied for leading  
stakes-winning trainer there last year with eight victories. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Vicki, and sons Tony, Rick and Chip.  
Tony trains in Maryland and Rick in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services were pending.

<HEADLINE> Agee Gives Up Basketball for Acting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Arthur Agee, whose high school basketball career  
was chronicled in the acclaimed documentary ``Hoop Dreams,'' has 
given up the hardwood court for the silver screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Agee plays a high school player in a new made-for-TV movie,  
``Passing Glory,'' which airs Sunday on TNT. 
</P>
<P>
	He's had several small roles in other recent movies, including  
Spike Lee's ``He Got Game,'' and says he likes his new profession. 
</P>
<P>
	``With my personality and the way I am, a lot of people were  
thinking I should take it seriously,'' says Agee, 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 film ``Hoop Dreams'' tracks Agee and William Gates  
through their struggles in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Agee went on to play at Arkansas State, the U.S. Basketball  
League and the International Basketball Association. In September, 
he had a tryout scheduled with a team in the Continental Basketball 
Association -- one step short of the NBA. But he was offered the 
``Passing Glory'' role at the same time and took that instead.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Plan Bioterrorism Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Here's the nightmare: Terrorists contaminate  
an auditorium with silent, odorless smallpox just before a 
political rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, emergency rooms see mysterious illnesses. By the time  
doctors diagnose smallpox, coughing patients are spreading the 
lethal virus around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it was a test-run.  
</P>
<P>
	Doctors, hospital workers and U.S. health leaders used that  
fictional scenario, set in Baltimore, to test how they would 
control disease if bioterrorists ever attack -- debating step by 
step how to quarantine, shut down airports, control panic when 
vaccine runs out. 
</P>
<P>
	How did the trial run go?  
</P>
<P>
	``We blew it,'' said a grim Dr. Michael Ascher, California's  
viral disease chief. 
</P>
<P>
	If an attack really had happened, it would have taken just three  
months for 15,000 Americans to catch smallpox, 4,500 to die and 14 
countries to be re-infected with a disease thought wiped out 
decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be irresponsible if we left this room and didn't  
remedy this,'' said Jerome Hauer, New York City's emergency 
management director. 
</P>
<P>
	How can doctors prepare? The test-run offers clues.  
</P>
<P>
 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The fictional scenario begins:  
</P>
<P>
	April 1. The FBI gets a tip that terrorists might release  
smallpox during the vice president's speech at a Baltimore college. 
The tip is too vague to warn health officials. Smallpox incubates 
for two weeks so no one has yet become sick. 
</P>
<P>
	April 12. A college student and electrician come to the  
emergency room with fever and other flu-like symptoms. Doctors 
suspect mild illness, maybe flu, and send them home. 
</P>
<P>
	April 13, 10 a.m. Both patients are back, sicker and covered in  
a rash. Doctors now suspect adult chickenpox. The two are 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	6 p.m. An infectious disease specialist is puzzled. That rash  
doesn't really look like chickenpox, and it's popping up in places 
chickenpox normally doesn't afflict, like the soles of the feet. 
More testing suggests it might be smallpox. 
</P>
<P>
	8 p.m. Because smallpox is spread through the air, officials  
seal the hospital, telling visitors and staff they can't leave but 
not why. Frightened hospital visitors alert TV news crews, who 
report rumors of the dread Ebola virus. 
</P>
<P>
	3 a.m. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms  
it's smallpox, and ships some of the nation's 6 million doses of 
smallpox vaccine to Baltimore. The mayor will announce the bad news 
at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Is this scenario realistic? It's optimistic, said Dr. Gregory  
Moran of the University of California, Los Angeles. A typical 
hospital would take at least another full day to even suspect 
smallpox. Labs would test for other diseases first, and many don't 
have the equipment to hazard a smallpox guess. 
</P>
<P>
	``Half of the health care workers would try to leave the  
hospital out of panic,'' added Minnesota state epidemiologist 
Michael Osterholm. 
</P>
<P>
	Who's in charge? The governor should go on TV and tell the  
public the truth fast -- what are the symptoms, who's at risk, how 
are doctors fighting back -- to limit panic, advised former 
Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
	But a smallpox outbreak can only be terrorism, so watch  
Washington seize control, others say. After all, the FBI has to 
hunt the terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Sealing the hospital actually fuels fear, Osterholm contends.  
Getting vaccinated a few days after breathing smallpox is soon 
enough to stay healthy and not spread infection, so let visitors 
and staff go home until the vaccine arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	No, get everybody vaccinated: ``That's total damage control,''  
Ascher argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Could anyone quarantine the city? If this happened in Minnesota,  
thousands would flee to Canada, Carlson said, but the governor 
couldn't seal the state's borders. Canada might. 
</P>
<P>
 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The scenario continues:  
</P>
<P>
	April 16, 7 a.m. FBI, CDC, White House and hospital workers are  
debating via conference call. Do they vaccinate everyone? No, just 
people who came into contact with sick patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals report other cases of mysterious fevers and rashes. By  
day's end, CDC counts 48 smallpox cases -- 10 in nearby states, so 
it's spreading. 
</P>
<P>
	Noon. The president addresses the nation, saying the attack may  
have occurred April 1. It's too late for vaccine to help anyone 
exposed that day. 
</P>
<P>
 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder the fictional epidemic is spreading -- notice that  
nobody closed the airport. Dr. John Bartlett of Johns Hopkins 
University can't believe that other cities would accept travelers 
from a region experiencing smallpox. 
</P>
<P>
	You're seriously underestimating public panic, Osterholm adds.  
He recalled watching a simple, tiny meningitis outbreak paralyze a 
Minnesota town, as traffic snarled while people demanded vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors need to know what to do,'' added Moran: Hospitalize  
everyone with mild fevers, or send them home? 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitalization would require rooms with special ventilation  
systems to keep the virus from spreading through the building. Such 
rooms are rare, 450 in all of Minnesota, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Back to the pretend scenario:  
</P>
<P>
	April 18. The first victim, the college student, dies.  
</P>
<P>
	April 29. Two hundred are ill in eight states. Canada discovers  
two victims, Britain another. 
</P>
<P>
	People with mild fevers jam hospitals. Doctors tell them to stay  
home so they don't breathe on others -- there are no hospital beds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	Unvaccinated health workers walk off the job.  
</P>
<P>
	CDC announces there's not enough vaccine for the millions  
demanding it. Governors ration the shots. Public anger is fueled at 
press reports that the president, Congress and military were 
quietly vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
	April 30. A well-known college basketball player dies of  
hemorrhagic smallpox, massive bleeding instead of the more typical 
rash. TV stations get confused and report he died of hemorrhagic 
fever like Ebola. Doctors scramble for a correction. 
</P>
<P>
 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	This daylong role-playing is doctors' first chance to learn how  
complex fighting bioterrorism could be, said Hopkins' Dr. Tara 
O'Toole, who wrote the test case. Cities and states are used to 
dealing with earthquakes or plane crashes, but a spreading 
infection is totally different. 
</P>
<P>
	Who's in charge? How do you physically vaccinate 100,000 people  
in a day? How do you ration scarce vaccine so only the at-risk get 
it, not the hysterical healthy or the pushy politicians? 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's even a possibility this could happen, health  
departments have to prepare. ... But they've never looked at the 
big picture,'' O'Toole said. ``You're hearing everybody confess 
they need to do a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	In the fictional scenario, a month has passed:  
</P>
<P>
	May 15. All U.S. vaccine is gone. The president declares the  
worst-hit states are disaster areas. Thousands more become sick 
before the epidemic finally slows in June. 
</P>
<P>
 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The real-life doctors absorb the grim ending with brief silence.  
Then come calls for state health workers to plan how they would 
better fight bioterrorism in case it really happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want the audience walking away thinking, 'Damn,  
there's nothing we can do,''' Osterholm said. ``If this meeting 
does nothing else, it should ensure we get an adequate supply of 
smallpox vaccine (stored) as soon as possible.''

<HEADLINE> Pataki: First Lady Not Needed in NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- New York Gov. George Pataki has a  
message for Hillary Rodham Clinton as she mulls a run for the U.S. 
Senate in his state --New York doesn't need her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's thinking about moving to New York to straighten things  
out. Well, let me say with all due respect, we don't need liberal 
Democrats moving from Washington to the states to straighten out 
the states,'' Pataki said Saturday at a gathering of Missouri 
Republicans. ``We need Republicans from Missouri and New York and 
across the country moving to Washington to straighten it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady said last week she is considering running for the  
Senate seat from New York being vacated next year by Democrat 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusually impassioned speech that had local Republicans  
cheering, Pataki also criticized Missouri Democratic Gov. Mel 
Carnahan for granting the Pope's recent request to commute a 
murderer's death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York governor, with his eye on a possible run for  
national office next year or in 2004, used his appearance to urge 
Republicans to return to ``policies as old as Lincoln and as real 
as Reagan'' and throw out of the White House what he called 
``stealth Democrats'' who sound ``more and more like Republicans.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Tyson Throws TV at Guards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson was  
put in an isolation cell after a disturbance Saturday night at the 
Montgomery County Detention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Several TV stations in Washington reported that Tyson became  
upset, either in his cell or a break room, and threw a television 
set. The set narrowly missed jail guards, and there were no 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing on the disturbance has been set for Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, 32, was sentenced Feb. 5 to a one-year jail sentence for  
assaulting two men after a minor traffic accident in August in 
Gaithersburg. Tyson pleaded no contest to the charges, but might 
appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxer is on probation in Indiana for raping a beauty pageant  
contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. He served three 
years in prison and was released in March 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson won a comeback fight last month against Francois Botha,  
his first since losing his boxing license for biting Evander 
Holyfield during a championship bout in June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was scheduled to fight April 24 in Las Vegas against an  
opponent to be determined.

<HEADLINE> Clemens Tries To Blend With Yanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *AP Sports Writer.    	
</P>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- No one could have blamed Roger Clemens for  
feeling like a runway model as cameras whirred and fans craned 
their necks to get a glimpse of the new star in Yankee pinstripes. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Cy Young Award winner reported to spring training  
Saturday, whisked into the team's complex in a sports utility 
vehicle and eventually slipped into the uniform he says he's always 
admired. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he just wants to blend in with the defending world  
champions, but on this day he commanded all of the attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great,'' teammate David Cone joked. ``I can slither  
right in and hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans lined a walkway stretching across nearby Dale Mabry Highway  
to Legends Field, while others scrambled for spots along stadium 
railing to watch Clemens throw to catcher Joe Girardi for 13 
minutes (59 pitches) in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	His news conference was telecast live in New York and a horde of  
photographers and reporters tracked as much of his first day on the 
job as the Yankees would allow. Later, he signed autographs for 
nearly half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to get the circus out of the way and get on with  
business,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``He can't be anonymous. I'm 
just glad to see he's wearing our uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees acquired the 36-year-old right-hander in a stunning  
trade that sent pitchers David Wells and Graeme Lloyd and infielder 
Homer Bush to the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens was 20-6 with a 2.65 ERA in 1998, leading the American  
League in wins, strikeouts and ERA for the second straight season. 
He won the Cy Young Award both years, giving him a record five -- 
one more than the Yankees pitchers have won in team history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just real exciting to walk in and be a part of the  
tradition ... I feel very fortunate,'' Clemens said, adding one of 
the things he's always admired about the Yankees is their 
professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I'm a grinder. I'm going to take the mound whether my  
arm feels good or bad,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see a lot of professionals that I'm fixing to have the  
opportunity to play with. They seem like they come every day and 
know their responsibilities and are going to answer the bell 
whether they feel good or bad. As a pitcher you can see that 
sometimes in certain situations with a pitching staff. But it works 
all the way through with this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens turned down a chance to play for the Yankees two years  
ago, instead going to Toronto where he was frustrated by the Blue 
Jays' inability to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of New York winning its third World Series title in  
four years wasn't the only factor in his decision to accept the 
trade to the Yankees. But it was major consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a great deal of individual success in my career, and  
I feel very fortunate. ... But I haven't done it collectively. And 
each year that I am at home and see these guys celebrating, that's 
what I remember the most,'' Clemens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens arrived in Tampa carrying a poem that his sister wrote  
after learning he was headed to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's from a sister to a brother,'' he said, declining to read  
it aloud. ``It's really neat. It's about pinstripes, and the 
tradition, and Yankee Stadium. She knows how I carry that in my 
heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting he already knows most of his new teammates, Clemens  
doesn't anticipate having any problem blending into the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner George Steinbrenner has said Clemens won't receive special  
treatment. And, Clemens isn't interested in getting it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Joe I'm trying as best I can to slide in the side door.  
This is a great machine. They've got some great players here,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously this is a great opportunity. ... But I don't know  
that what everybody has been saying the last couple of days, about 
it's going to be easy, is true. You still have to go out and play 
the game. You still have to go out and work hard and do what it 
takes to win.''

<HEADLINE> Hawks' Smith Injures Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Steve Smith, Atlanta's leading scorer, left  
the Hawks' game against Philadelphia on Saturday night with a 
strained right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith got his feet tangled up with Eric Snow's as the two chased  
a long pass while running toward the Hawks' basket with eight 
minutes left in the third quarter. He returned with the team to 
Atlanta for X-rays after the Hawks beat the Sixers 76-69. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith led Atlanta with 14 points even though he didn't play the  
final 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric Snow stepped on my ankle,'' Smith said. ``It doesn't look  
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates gathered around as Smith lay under the basket, and  
the 6-foot-8 swingman got up after a few minutes and limped to the 
dressing room. Smith, who has led the Hawks in scoring every game 
this season, had 14 points on 5-for-7 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred one possession after Philadelphia's Matt  
Geiger leveled a cameraman under the same basket. Geiger was diving 
for a loose ball, and the cameraman was shaken up.

<HEADLINE> Titanic Whistle Sounds Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The voice of the Titanic, silenced for  
nearly 87 years, boomed deep and steady as one the ship's bronze 
whistles recovered from the ocean floor was sounded twice Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people standing in city streets responded with  
cheers, applause and whistles after the 10-second blasts, which 
occurred about two minutes apart shortly after 4 p.m. The free 
whistle-sounding ceremony was held outside the old Union Depot 
where other artifacts from the Titanic are on display. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's great, that's great, that's great,'' enthused Thomas  
Goulding, who said he has been intrigued by the Titanic since he 
heard stories about the sunken ocean liner as a boy in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sound was not as impressive as some had expected.  
</P>
<P>
	``It made a smooth, low roar that just kind of built. It wasn't  
as loud as I had hoped, but it was nice,'' said Dennis Horn, 51. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Helen Horn, celebrated her 51st birthday by attending  
the whistle-sounding ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it sounded like a foghorn,'' she said from her  
vantage point at a Union Depot doorway. 
</P>
<P>
	Police estimated the crowd on the cold but sunny afternoon to be  
between 80,000 and 100,000 -- much higher than the 2,000 to 3,000 
organizers had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid damage, workers sent compressed air rather than steam  
through the 750-pound whistle and used less pressure than it was 
designed to withstand. 
</P>
<P>
	Local promoter Erich Mische said his research shows the last  
time one of the Titanic's whistles was heard was 12:15 a.m., April 
15, 1912, after the liner's collision with the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Other experts said the whistles remained quiet after the crash.  
They say the whistles probably sounded at noon April 14 during a 
routine test. 
</P>
<P>
	The whistle, which had adorned the forward smokestack, was  
recovered from the wreck in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The whistle, which is only slightly higher than 2 feet, sat  
outside the Union Depot on a 6-foot-high platform for the ceremony. 
It will go back on display with other artifacts from the ship in 
``Titanic - The Exhibit,'' which began Jan. 1 and will run through 
April 30.

<HEADLINE> Film Critic Gene Siskel Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Film critic Gene Siskel, known for the thumbs-up  
and thumbs-down reviews he and fellow critic Roger Ebert shared on 
their popular TV show, died Saturday. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel, 53, had surgery in May to remove a growth from his  
brain, but returned to the syndicated television show ``Siskel &AMP; 
Ebert'' soon afterward. He announced earlier this month he was 
taking time off from that show to spend time recuperating from the 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel wrote movie reviews for the Chicago Tribune and also did  
reviews for ``CBS This Morning'' and WBBM-TV in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	He had said when he announced his leave on Feb. 3 that he  
expected to return to writing his reviews and the television show 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in a hurry to get well because I don't want Roger to get  
more screen time than I,'' Siskel said then. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Dergarabedian, spokesman for Exhibitor Relations Co. which  
compiles box office receipts, called Siskel's death a great loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``He, along with his partner Roger Ebert, took film criticism  
into the mainstream,'' he said. ``The average person would look 
toward them about whether to take their hard-earned dollars to the 
box office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel and Ebert are perhaps the most recognizable movie critics  
in the nation. Their trademark ``thumbs-up'' and ``thumbs-down'' 
reviews became a benchmark for the movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel graduated from Yale University in 1967. He joined the  
Tribune in 1969. He and Ebert began their partnership in 1975 with 
the public television program ``Sneak Previews.'' The left the 
program in 1982, when their show went into syndication. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel is survived by his wife, Marlene, and two children.

<HEADLINE> United Jet Has Engine Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A London-bound United Airlines jet returned to  
Kennedy Airport shortly after takeoff Saturday because of engine 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people on the ground reportedly saw flames coming from the  
plane, said Port Authority spokesman Alan Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not know whether there had been a fire in the engine. The  
pilot decided to turn back after noticing problems with an engine. 
</P>
<P>
	The 767, carrying 192 passengers, landed safely just a few  
minutes after taking off at 7:25 p.m., Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines headquarters was closed Saturday night, and  
officials there could not be reached for further details.

<HEADLINE> Hawks' Smith Injures Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Steve Smith, Atlanta's leading scorer, left  
the Hawks' game against Philadelphia on Saturday night with a 
strained right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith got his feet tangled up with Eric Snow's as the two chased  
a long pass while running toward the Hawks' basket with eight 
minutes left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates gathered around as Smith lay under the basket, and  
the 6-foot-8 swingman got up after a few minutes and limped to the 
dressing room. Smith, who has led the Hawks in scoring every game 
this season, had 14 points on 5-for-7 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred one possession after Philadelphia's Matt  
Geiger leveled a cameraman under the same basket. Geiger was diving 
for a loose ball, and the cameraman was shaken up.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- American military engineers that  
helped rebuild roads destroyed by Hurricane Mitch completed a 
pullout from Nicaragua on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,800 service personnel had worked in north and northwest  
Nicaragua since Dec. 9. and completed 75 miles of roadway. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams also built 23 separate sewer systems in Nicaragua and  
a health center in the northern community of Wiwili, a U.S. Embassy 
statement said. The area was devastated in the October hurricane, 
which killed more than 9,000 people across Central America.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexican federal prosecutors have asked a  
court to issue arrest warrants for suspected members of the Juarez 
drug-trafficking cartel. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of those being sought were not released. A statement  
Friday from the federal Attorney General's office said only that 
former officials and businessmen were among the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	The Juarez cartel, based in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, is  
one of the top two Mexican groups responsible for sending cocaine 
into the United States.

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Environmentalists urged the Mexican  
government Saturday to investigate whether a chemical reportedly 
used to mark drug shipment points was responsible for the deaths of 
several gray whales. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths could have been caused by a cyanide-based chemical,  
known as Natural Killer-19 or ``NK-19,'' that make fluorescent 
marks in the water for ships and planes used by traffickers, said 
the environmental organization known as the Group of 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven whales recently have been found dead along the coasts of  
Sinaloa, Sonora and Baja California Sur states, the Mexico 
City-based group said. The region along the Pacific Coast is a 
prime trafficking route for drugs being sent north to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Whales currently are migrating into the area to mate and give  
birth.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A federal judge in Brazil has  
annulled the appointment of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's 
daughter to a government post, a newspaper reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Lana Ligia Galati ruled Luciana Cardoso's appointment as  
assistant to the President's General Secretary broke a public 
morality code, said the Folha de Sao Paulo daily. The Presidential 
Palace's office has appealed the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Luciana Cardoso started her job in 1995, giving her a monthly  
salary of $1,950 and rights to an apartment, said the daily. It was 
not clear why the ruling was made now.

Samayoa were part of a criminal gang that also included four El 
Salvadorans, who remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men, who were arrested in February 1996, were convicted  
in 10 murders and found guilty of assault and of carrying illegal 
weapons.

	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- Three epidemiologists from the  
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating a 
cholera outbreak that has killed two Salvadorans and affected at 
least 55 others this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Americans and one Peruvian are working to identify the  
source of the outbreak and help prevent its spread. They arrived in 
El Salvador on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bacteria has been traced to vegetables grown near the Las  
Canas River in the communities of Soyapango and Tonacatepeque but 
there could be other sources, U.S. scientist Ellen Steimberg told 
reporters Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pan-American Health Organization said more than 400 cases of  
cholera have been reported across Central America in recent months, 
primarily in regions that were hit by Hurricane Mitch last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Cholera, an intestinal infection spread through contaminated  
water, causes severe diarrhea and vomiting and can lead to death if 
not treated.

<HEADLINE> NYC Makes Homeless Work for Shelter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Homeless people who sleep in city shelters will  
have to work at city jobs or be expelled, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of making workfare a condition to sleep in shelters say  
the move would force thousands into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Under workfare, those who receive public aid are required to  
work at city jobs, including cleaning parks and performing clerical 
tasks, in exchange for their benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The workfare condition would require city-funded homeless  
shelters to expel any homeless adult or family cut from public 
assistance for failing to comply, and as a result require officials 
to report any child to child protective services in jeopardy of 
ending up on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said officials try to reincorporate homeless people  
into the work force. ``Maybe that will do more for them ultimately 
than all the fancy government programs that were keeping people 
dependent for 30, 40 and 50 years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,600 families and 7,100 single adults use the city's  
homeless shelters at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the mayor has not set a date to implement the plan,  
critics blasted the plan, saying it would destroy families and the 
little stability that homeless people have. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sick. The thought that because you are cut off public  
assistance, you would then lose your place to sleep too is sick,'' 
said Mike Polenberg of the Coalition for the Homeless in New York 
City.

<HEADLINE> Union Basketball Coach Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Tenn. (AP) -- A Union University women's basketball  
coach was found dead at her home after she failed to show up for 
Saturday's game against Lyon College in Batesville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson police found the body of co-coach Lisa Hutchens, 37, at  
about 1:30 p.m. Saturday. They had been called by Hutchens' family 
members after she missed the team's scheduled departure time. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were reserving comment on Hutchens' death until more  
family members could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyon women's coach Randy Gatling said both men's and women's  
games against Union were called off Saturday because of the death. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to play the game, but there's a far greater need that  
needs to be addressed by the families and the players at Union 
University,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchens coached the NAIA Division I team with David Blackstock.  
The team is ranked second in the division in last week's Associated 
Press Poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Union University is a private college with 2,500 students and is  
affiliated with the Tennessee Baptist Convention.

<HEADLINE>  Fall Fashion Week: It's a Wrap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What will the woman of style wear in the year  
2000? 
</P>
<P>
	A futuristic, astronaut-styled jumpsuit? A NASA-photo dress  
depicting Mars, accessorized with minicomputer hookup? Clothing 
coated in rubber? 
</P>
<P>
	Those are some of the millennial options offered by designers  
Helmut Lang, Stephen Sprouse, and Donna Karan among the nearly 80 
previews for Fall '99/Winter 2000 New York Fashion Week, which 
wrapped Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's another, perhaps nostalgic, side to a season  
preoccupied with high-tech fabrics and styles. Old-softie favorites 
are also inspiring anew. Cashmere is looking comfortable 
everywhere; cozy wool felt is practically blanketing the runways; 
and so are clothes that even look like blankets. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first collections of the new millennium, the future lies  
in techno-minded treatments. Trench coats in white canvas are waxed 
at Ellen Tracy; Donna Karan's DKNY line offers coats in 
``neo-cotton,'' laminated with water-repellent resins; fall's 
trendy capes are coated with Teflon at Yeohlee. 
</P>
<P>
	For evening, gowns with draped backs and trains are cast in  
paper-like silk at Calvin Klein, while sparkling metal thread wends 
its way through formal wear at Hailstone and Scotch Lite-finished 
separates at Nicole Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the techy stuff are cuddle clothes, built for  
old-fashioned comfort. Ralph Lauren says felt is the essence of his 
collection, and it covers everything from his slim pants to gowns 
in a snowy white or bright. Designers are likewise bringing a 
flurry of fleece, fur, mohair and shearling to the catwalks. 
Carolina Herrera opened her show with a pullover sweater made 
entirely of mink. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic looks are also abundant. Drawstrings show up on waxed  
leather pants from Tommy Hilfiger and ball skirts from Ralph 
Lauren, while a hood tops off Marc Bouwer's pun-intended metallic 
``knight gown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The refined yet rugged mix also goes by the name of surplus or  
utility chic, which designers are enlisting for yet another season. 
Cargo pants with ``survival pockets'' show up at Cynthia Rowley; 
Barbara Bui offers khaki lacquered ``protective'' pants; and Marc 
Jacobs has military-inspired capes and skirts cut like utility 
aprons. 
</P>
<P>
	Even for evening wear, the functional, sportswear spin  
continues. Formal skirts are unexpectedly teamed with tops 
traditionally for day, such as Ralph Lauren's sequined down vests 
or tiny ski sweaters; Oscar de la Renta's snow parkas; Halston's 
cashmere turtlenecks; and Dana Buchman's sleeveless mohair 
sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the cues for comfort, the structured suit is pretty  
much sitting this season out, replaced by relaxed, practically 
sleep-inducing styles. Donna Karan's baggy white ``cotton slip 
cover duvet'' coats resemble down-filled comforters. Tse New York 
designer Hussein Chalayan dreamed up a collection called ``The 
Bed,'' full of dresses and skirts finished with blanket stitching 
and labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, designers are envisioning so many other times and  
places that the collections read like a fashion encyclopedia. As 
nostalgia sets in, Anna Sui dedicates her folklore-singer 
collection to early-hippie ponchos, and the b Michael line revives 
mod ``Jetson jackets.'' Betsey Johnson reworks the Victorian era 
with corsets, bloomers and tattered puffed-sleeve velvet gowns, 
while Mary McFadden opened her show with her version of a 13th 
century Mongolian wedding coat. 
</P>
<P>
	Some designers go West. Michael Kors rounds up pony-print skirts  
and cashmere fishing vests for his ``Park Avenue meets Wyoming'' 
collection; John Bartlett salutes the Southwest with chunky 
turquoise necklaces and boiled wool serapes; and cowboy boots are 
the favored footwear at BCBG by Max Azria.

<HEADLINE> NAACP May Sue Gun Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Since gun-related crimes hit minority  
communities at high rates across the country, the NAACP is 
considering joining the growing number of cities filing lawsuits 
against gun makers, NAACP president Kweisi Mfume said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We represent a significant constituency that is  
disproportionately affected by gun violence. The time has come for 
us to look at the proliferation of handguns,'' Mfume said at the 
association's annual meeting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume said he would present to the NAACP's 64-member Board of  
Directors several options, ranging from issuing a resolution that 
voices concern about guns to joining suits that filed by cities 
including Chicago and New Orleans. The NAACP also could file a 
separate suit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to put forth some legal theories we've been presented  
and ask the board for its consideration,'' Mfume said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, The New York Times reported in Sunday's editions that  
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is ready to report that 
51 percent of the guns used in crimes by juveniles people aged 18 
to 24 were purchased illegally over the last three years from 
licensed dealers by people acting as intermediaries for the real 
owners. Additionally 35 percent of guns used in crimes by juveniles 
and young adults were stolen. The rest were acquired from 
non-licensed private sellers not required to obtain identification 
or subject their customers to background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtailing gun violence was among several issues presented at  
the 90th annual meeting of the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
	In speeches to the 200 branch leaders and members from NAACP  
branches around the country, Mfume and NAACP Board Chairman Julian 
Bond outlined an energetic campaign for the nation's oldest and 
largest civil rights group to combat racism, save affirmative 
action, register voters and work against police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite 90 years of fighting for and sometimes dying for  
justice and fair play, we know that all is not well in the land in 
which we live,'' Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
	NAACP scrutiny of the gun industry could lend additional  
momentum to recent movements against the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In a landmark ruling this month, gun makers were found liable  
for shootings in a case closely followed by cities across the 
nation eager to make the firearms industry pay for gun-related 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury in New York returned a $4 million verdict based  
upon a new strategy by plaintiffs -- that the industry's negligence 
in marketing and distribution allowed weapons to flow illegally to 
states with strict anti-gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	As with massive tobacco litigation that pressured cigarette  
companies to pay for treating sick smokers, the cities want to 
force gun makers to pay the costs of treating shooting victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago, New Orleans, Bridgeport, Conn., and Miami-Dade County  
are suing the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-gun groups have fired back by lobbying state legislatures to  
pass laws prohibiting such suits. Georgia approved such a law and 
derailed the efforts of Atlanta officials to file suit against the 
firearms industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond, in his report on the overall health of the organization,  
said the fiscal picture was rosy but corrected figures he gave 
earlier in the week of the increase in foundation and corporate 
donations over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both corporate and foundation giving is up from $3.2 million to  
$3.4 million and not the 40 to 50 percent which Bond had told 
reporters earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a mathematician,'' Bond said. ``I misinterpreted some  
figures I had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NAACP revenues outstripped its expenses by $1,160,469 last year.

<HEADLINE> Intel Execs To Testify at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top executives from Intel Corp. will testify  
at the computer chip-maker's antitrust trial, set for March 9. 
</P>
<P>
	The government and the company identified their witnesses Friday  
for the trial. High-profile names include Andrew Grove, Intel's 
co-founder and chairman, and Craig Barrett, who took over as chief 
executive officer last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest chip-maker, with $26.2 billion in  
sales last year, also identified 16 more of its own executives and 
15 others from outside the company who will appear as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The government identified two dozen witnesses. Daniel Wall, an  
antitrust lawyer in San Francisco, said the sheer number suggests 
the government plans a far broader case against Intel than 
originally believed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to,'' Wall said. ``It doesn't take that many people to  
cover the issues pleaded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows you that Intel has guts to put their top guns on the  
stand,'' said Robert Litan, an economist with the Brookings 
Institution. He said Grove, who escaped communist Hungary as a 
20-year-old chemistry student, ``has a terrific life story to bring 
into the courtroom. I would suspect he would be a very impressive 
witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission's case against Intel will take  
place in a courtroom just blocks from the federal courthouse where 
Microsoft Corp. is fighting its own antitrust case against the 
Justice Department and a group of 19 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Microsoft's trial, where Chairman Bill Gates has not  
testified in his own company's defense, Intel put both its CEO and 
former CEO on the witness list. 
</P>
<P>
	``These witnesses present very tempting targets in the sense  
that if you can obtain some admission or concession, it weighs very 
heavily,'' said Richard Gray, an antitrust lawyer in San Jose, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added: ``I strongly suspect the FTC will have a much  
tougher time with (Grove and Barrett) than the Justice Department 
has had with Microsoft executives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wall said it was impossible to gauge Intel's risks in exposing  
Grove and Barrett to tough questioning by the FTC's lawyer, Richard 
Parker, because ``you don't know what the FTC might have from their 
e-mail and documents and so forth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This might indicate that Intel is just not worried that Andy  
Grove and Craig Barrett can be impeached, that they're clean,'' 
Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will use testimony from executives at rival  
Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Compaq Computer Corp., Micron 
Technology Inc. and others to try to prove that Intel abused its 
market influence to freeze out and punish competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC sued Intel in June, accusing it of denying three of its  
competitors access to important technical information about 
upcoming Intel chips. It said Intel sought to punish the 
competitors for refusing to license key patents on Intel's terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies were Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph  
Corp. and Compaq, which now owns Digital. Intergraph's chief 
executive officer, James W. Meadlock, will also be a government 
witness.

<HEADLINE> No Mo, No Problem for BoSox Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Boston manager Jimy Williams spent the  
winter in which the Red Sox lost Mo Vaughn enjoying the weather 
about two hours north of the team's spring training complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really nice down here,'' he said Saturday. ``Florida's  
nice in the winter but it didn't really get cold at all. Anyway, 
it's behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he glanced up at the sunny sky and out at the practice  
field and said, ``this is pretty good today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what if Pedro Martinez probably will report two days after  
the other pitchers? And why worry that Vaughn won't report at all 
or that the team hasn't replaced his power? And why get drawn into 
commenting about the trade of ex-Boston ace Roger Clemens to the 
New York Yankees? 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had just arrived in town from his home the previous  
night, but was in midseason form handling potentially thorny 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The first workout for pitchers and catchers is set for Sunday,  
but Martinez had to attend to personal business and probably won't 
arrive until Tuesday, Williams said. The manager was quick to point 
out that his best pitcher, 19-7 with a 2.89 ERA last season, and 
all his players, aren't required to report before March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a big deal. This guy has been working out,'' Williams  
said. ``I have no problem whatsoever. I really don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not about to create a problem by saying how he views the  
trade of Clemens to Boston's archrival. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I think you'd have to go ask the New York Yankees that,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor does he seem stressed by the absence of Vaughn, who signed  
with Anaheim after leading Boston with 40 homers and a .337 batting 
average while driving in 115 runs. Barring a trade, his replacement 
at first base probably will come from Mike Stanley, Reggie 
Jefferson and Jose Offerman. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a club that just traded a Cy Young award winner  
(Clemens) for two consecutive years, and they're going to go on and 
play,'' he said of Toronto. ``You take the club that you have, the 
players that you have and you go out and perform the best you can. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to replace Mo. He was a tremendous player  
here, but he's not here now so we have to move on. Does it do any 
good to get down on it? I don't believe so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Williams wouldn't mind replacing Vaughn's power, he thinks  
the team's strengths might have shifted to other areas -- pitching 
and speed. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisitions of Mark Portugal and Pat Rapp, added to  
Martinez, Bret Saberhagen and Tim Wakefield, give Boston five 
proven starters. Offerman, who had 45 stolen bases last year, 
provides a dimension that Vaughn, who had no steals, couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	And although Boston won its home opener last season on Vaughn's  
grand slam in the bottom of the ninth inning, Williams doesn't see 
power as the key to success. 
</P>
<P>
	``The keys are base hits with two outs and guys in scoring  
position. That's how you win,'' Williams said. ``If they happen to 
be home runs, then that's fine, but they don't have to be home 
runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't expect Nomar Garciaparra, the only remaining hitter  
who combines power and average, to see less attractive pitches with 
Vaughn's production gone. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's not getting caught up in offseason criticism of the  
team that lost one of baseball's best players and didn't replace 
him with a comparable talent. Lowered expectations by fans don't 
bother Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what my expectations are. It's kind of like the  
word `potential.' Those two words really don't mean a whole lot to 
me,'' Williams said. ``We can't please everybody. Certainly, we 
have to please ourselves first.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Tall Order for 5-Foot-4 Rogers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a straight face, George Washington coach  
Tom Penders calls Shawnta Rogers ``simply, unquestionably the most 
dominant player in college basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Say what? The kid's only 5-foot-4.  
</P>
<P>
	``The best 5-foot-4 player who ever lived,'' La Salle coach  
Speedy Morris said after his team lost to the Colonials on Rogers' 
game-winner at the buzzer. ``He just took over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Rogers arrived as a freshman three years ago, he was  
5-foot-3 and proclaimed the next Muggsy Bogues. Both were the same 
height and from Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Rogers has since topped Bogues in height and  
legend -- at least at the college level -- with a remarkable year. 
He's on pace to become the first player ever to lead the Atlantic 
10 in scoring, steals and assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was an assistant at Wake (Forest), we had Muggsy,'' Old  
Dominion coach Jeff Capel said. ``And there hasn't been anybody 
like Muggsy until Shawnta. He can get from A to B quicker than 
anybody and recover back to A. He's a weapon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The snow drifts were higher than Rogers when he made his  
Colonials debut at the Smith Center on the heels of the Blizzard of 
'96. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,500 stir-crazy fans who made it out to that January game  
were rewarded with a show by Rogers, who leaped on the press table 
to save a ball and chased down every wayward rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebounds? You bet. Rogers once grabbed an incredible 14 in a  
game his sophomore year, one of two times in his career he's led 
all players on both teams. His career rebounding average is just 
under five per game, and this season he is third in rebounding 
among the 14 point guards nominated for the Wooden award. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Rogers is a contender for the Wooden award, presented to  
the nation's top college basketball player. He led the nominated 
point guards in assists (6.9) and steals (3.9) and was second in 
scoring (21.7) going into Saturday's game at Temple. He leads the 
A-10 in all three categories, and is George Washington's all-time 
leader in assists and steals. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, beyond whatever college accolades come his way, there is  
the NBA, where Bogues has made a living for 12 seasons and 5-foot-5 
rookie Earl Boykins has earned some playing time this month with 
the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	Scouts, now a regular fixture at the Smith Center, love the way  
Rogers is unafraid to drive in the lane among the trees, then make 
a last-minute, airborne, body-swivel that gives him just enough 
daylight to sink his shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Ask Rogers about his height and he'll roll his eyes. His focus  
is on playing the game -- and his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The NBA) always crosses my mind,'' Rogers said. ``That's what  
I'm going to be working for. But I'm not going to mess up the game 
because I'm worried about NBA scouts. I'm going to try to win the 
game whether they're here or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, size wasn't the only thing working against  
Rogers, who was already a father when he emerged from the streets 
of Baltimore and Lake Clifton High School. 
</P>
<P>
	His college-entrance test scores weren't high enough. But  
because of a learning disability that makes it difficult for him to 
read, he was allowed to take the test orally and passed in time to 
enroll at George Washington in the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the street-smart, run-and-gunner was confronted by a  
virtual United Nations of a locker room recruited by coach Mike 
Jarvis. With 7-footer Belarussian Alexander Koul the centerpiece, 
and players from Spain, Portugal, Israel, Canada and the 
Netherlands on the roster, Rogers was playing a strange game -- the 
half-court offense -- with strange people. 
</P>
<P>
	Things said on the playground back home don't always come across  
the right way to someone from Minsk, Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't realize how tough that is, getting everybody on  
the same page,'' Rogers said. ``It would be much easier if I had 
guys from the States. I wouldn't have to say as much. With the team 
I've got, I have to lead them, and try not to upset them with the 
way I say things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Koul has graduated, Jarvis has moved on to St. John's, and  
new coach Tom Penders has given Rogers the freedom to run, control 
and create. It took him only 21 seconds to force the first turnover 
in George Washington's 78-72 victory over Massachusetts on 
Wednesday, the 13th win in 15 games for the Colonials (17-6). 
</P>
<P>
	In five games in February, Rogers has averaged 26 points.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have never, ever seen a player in this league take a team on  
his back and carry them like he did in the second half,'' Virginia 
Tech forward Andre Ray said after Rogers scored 29 of his 31 points 
in the second half and made six 3-pointers in a 77-75 Colonials 
victory Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rogers is juggling basketball with fatherhood and  
books. While he remains on course to get his sociology degree this 
fall in the prescribed four years -- a plan that could be 
interrupted by the NBA -- his 5-year-old son, Terrell, lives with 
the boy's mother in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm close. That was one consideration in coming here,'' Rogers  
said. ``I can go home and see my son and be a dad, but I still 
don't see him as much as I'd like to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Rogers' former coach would prefer not to come  
across the diminutive playmaker, at least not during the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only player I don't want to see in March,'' Jarvis said,  
``is Shawnta Rogers.''

<HEADLINE> Steve Lewis Wins 400 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Steve Lewis, the 1988 Olympic 400-meter  
champion, appears to have regained his form after years of injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Lewis was impressive Saturday in winning the 400  
in 46.48 seconds at the Armory Track Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy with my performance,'' Lewis said after one of  
his rare indoor appearances. ``It gives me confidence going into 
the national championships next week (at Atlanta).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis was only 19 when he won the gold medal at Seoul, the  
youngest male runner to win an Olympic title since 1908. His time 
of 43.87 was a career best and led a 1-2-3 U.S. sweep, with world 
record-holder Butch Reynolds second and Danny Everett third. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the victory, Lewis was ranked only third in the world  
that year. He was No. 2 in 1989, won the NCAA title for UCLA and 
the U.S. championship in 1990, and again was ranked second in 1992, 
when he won the Olympic silver medal, finishing behind Quincy 
Watts. 
</P>
<P>
	But since then he has failed to crack the top five.  
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's two-heat race, Lewis won his heat by outkicking  
Deon Minor, the 1992 NCAA runner-up from Baylor. Minor finished 
second in the heat and was second overall at 46.69. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other feature race on the program, Rich Kenah, the 1997  
world championship bronze medalist at 800 meters, won at 1:48.11. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenah outdueled Einars Tuperitis, the 1996 NCAA outdoor champion  
from Wichita State and a 1996 Latvian Olympian. Tuperitis was 
runner-up at 1:48.36.

<HEADLINE> Film Critic Gene Siskel Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Film critic Gene Siskel, known for the thumbs-up  
and thumbs-down reviews he and Roger Ebert shared on their popular 
TV show, died Saturday. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel had surgery in May to remove a growth from his brain, but  
returned to the syndicated television show ``Siskel &AMP; Ebert'' soon 
afterward. He announced earlier this month he was taking time off 
from that show to spend time recuperating from the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He died at Evanston Hospital near Chicago, surrounded by his  
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a bedrock of respect that developed over the  
years,'' Ebert said, explaining their unique relationship, in a 
telephone interview with The Associated Press from his home in 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel wrote movie reviews for the Chicago Tribune and also did  
reviews for ``CBS This Morning'' and WBBM-TV in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	He had said when he announced his leave on Feb. 3 that he  
expected to return to writing his reviews and the television show 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in a hurry to get well because I don't want Roger to get  
more screen time than I,'' Siskel said then. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Altman, director of ``M A S H'', ``The Player'' and  
``Nashville'', said from his Los Angeles home that ``I didn't think 
critics ever died.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't like my stuff too much. I don't pay much attention  
to critics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Altman said Siskel, with Ebert, changed the way movie  
criticism is viewed by both moviemakers and the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that they were a positive thing,'' he said. ``Several  
shows tried to emulate them and failed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Dergarabedian, spokesman for Exhibitor Relations Co. which  
compiles box office receipts, called Siskel's death a great loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``He, along with his partner Roger Ebert, took film criticism  
into the mainstream,'' he said. ``The average person would look 
toward them about whether to take their hard-earned dollars to the 
box office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel and Ebert are likely the most recognizable movie critics  
in the nation. Their trademark ``thumbs-up'' and ``thumbs-down'' 
reviews became a benchmark for the movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Their show's continuing success was largely attributed to the  
chemistry between the tall, balding Siskel and the heavyset Ebert. 
They appeared to practice a one-upmanship that was in the tradition 
of the rivalry of their newspapers. Ebert is a critic for the 
Chicago Sun-Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Their conflicting opinions often prompted the other to respond  
with biting sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had lots of big fights,'' Ebert said in an interview with  
WLS-TV. ``We were people who came together one day a week to work 
together and the other six days of the week we were competitors on 
two daily newspapers and two different television stations. So 
there was a lot of competition and a lot of disagreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the death of Siskel, the show's future is uncertain.  
</P>
<P>
	``The show will continue with revolving guest critics,'' Ebert  
said. ``In the future, we will see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel was known for his outspoken opinions of not only movies,  
but of the people who made them. 
</P>
<P>
	He voiced objections to the Oscar awards, presented annually by  
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He once told 
Playboy magazine the awards were overrated and the system of 
selection meant the nominations can be bought with advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel said critics have more right than the academy to pick the  
Oscars, saying critics have given their lives to film and have an 
advantage over the people who vote -- the critics have seen all the 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel graduated from Yale University in 1967. He joined the  
Tribune in 1969. He and Ebert began their partnership in 1975 with 
the public television program ``Sneak Previews.'' They left the 
program in 1982, when their show went into syndication. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Marlene, two daughters and a son.

<HEADLINE> Girl Scout Cookie Shipment Stolen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A kind of cookie monster has left Girl  
Scout patrons without their thin mints. 
</P>
<P>
	A shipment of 1 million Girl Scout cookies worth $108,000 was  
packed in a tractor trailer stolen from a warehouse early Friday. A 
warehouse manager said the thieves probably thought the truck 
contained electronics or furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cookie monster has struck,'' said Michelle McCormick, of  
the Girl Scout Council of Santa Clara County. She said the 
truckload accounted for about 3 percent of Silicon Valley's Girl 
Scout cookie shipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the wrong product to steal,'' Ms. McCormick said.  
``With so many volunteers and Scouts, anyone trying to sell those 
cookies will really stick out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The theft occurred in a warehouse district east of San Jose  
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McCormick assured that customers eagerly awaiting their  
cookies needn't fret. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will get their cookies on time. We're pretty  
synchronized,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Owners Win Final Arbitration Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball owners won the final two salary  
arbitration cases of the year Saturday, finishing with an 
overwhelming 9-2 advantage over players. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore catcher Charles Johnson, who won in arbitration in  
1998, will get a $300,000 raise to $3.6 million instead of his 
request for $5.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota outfielder Matt Lawton, who had asked for an 11-fold  
increase from $215,000 to $2.4 million, will instead get the team's 
offer of $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson slumped to .218 with 19 homers and 58 RBIs last season  
for Florida and Los Angeles and had his worst defensive season of 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawton hit .278 last season with 21 homers, 77 RBIs and 16  
steals. 
</P>
<P>
	Other arbitration losers were, Montreal infielder Shane Andrews  
($1.25 million), Boston outfielder Midre Cummings ($450,000), 
Kansas City outfielder Johnny Damon ($2.1 million), Los Angeles 
shortstop Mark Grudzielanek ($1.9 million), Cincinnati reliever 
John Hudek ($800,000), Detroit outfielder Brian Hunter ($1.75 
million), and St. Louis pitcher Darren Oliver ($3.55 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Owners lost only to a pair of New York Yankees' stars, shortstop  
Derek Jeter ($5 million) and closer Mariano Rivera ($4.25 million). 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 cases this year were the most since 1994. Since the  
beginning of arbitration in 1974, owners lead players 236-181. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's case was decided by Anthony Sinicropi, James Duff and  
Mort Mitchnick. Lawton's was ruled on by Sinicropi, Elizabeth 
Neumeier, Alan Symonette.

<HEADLINE> British Balloonists Fly Over Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Two British balloonists making a nonstop,  
around-the-world bid climbed out of their balloon's capsule 
Saturday for repairs and maintenance work as it floated 8,000 feet 
above Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Equipped with harnesses and parachutes, pilots Colin Prescot and  
Andy Elson scaled down the side of the craft to check the fuel 
system, adjust the camera attached to the solar panels and make 
other minor repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	They carried out the 10-minute ``skywalk'' as the balloon  
drifted at a speed of 15 mph above Mauritania in northwest Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's absolutely incredible out there. We could see miles and  
miles of desert and not a car or human or any life form was 
visible, not even vehicle tracks,'' Prescot said by radio after he 
was safely back in the capsule. ``It was nerve-wracking but 
incredibly beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 200-foot balloon is waiting for the right jet stream to come  
along and sweep it eastward. The balloonists intend to float south 
of the Himalayan mountain range and across India. 
</P>
<P>
	They began their adventure Wednesday with a trouble-free launch  
in Almeria in southern Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well, a successful touchdown after traveling around  
the globe could come in the North Sea or the Mediterranean in the 
next two to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Elson, 45, and Prescot, 48, have planned a route that will avoid  
flying over China. Elson's last attempt foundered on Chinese 
restrictions last year, when he was on board the Swiss Breitling 
Orbiter balloon.

<HEADLINE> Sheep Growers Want To Stop Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Basking in a trade commission ruling that  
increased lamb meat imports are harming U.S. producers, the 
American sheep industry this week will recommend increased tariffs 
to stave off the import surge. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimously this  
month for a petition by the sheep farmers that cheap lamb imports 
have hurt their industry. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the U.S. industry will appear before the commission  
to offer its recommended remedy, massively higher import tariffs. 
Officials from Australia and New Zealand, where 95 percent of the 
foreign lamb originates, also are expected to make suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission will then make its recommendations to President  
Clinton, who has final authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``The imports came, and the prices just crashed,'' said Lorin  
Moench Jr., president of the American Sheep Industry Association 
and a Salt Lake City sheep farmer. ``This window of opportunity 
will help us get back in (the market).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has complained that tariffs currently assessed on  
imports are much too low -- less than 1 percent. The sheepherders 
are requesting a four-year period of a 30 percent tariff on imports 
up to 40 million pounds, increasing to 50 percent for imports over 
40 million pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, the proposal would make those who import more pay  
more. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. sheep growers said the remedy will give them an opportunity  
to recover after facing an onslaught of imports.

	``The provision of relief for the full four-year period is  
essential to give the U.S. industry an adequate amount of time to 
implement initiatives ... that will ultimately enable it to compete 
more effectively with imports,'' attorneys for the American sheep 
industry wrote in a brief to the ITC last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheep producers said that during the first nine months of last  
year, 76.9 million pounds of imports entered the United States -- 19 
percent more than the first nine months of 1997. Imports now 
comprise almost one-third of the domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports from Australia and New Zealand consistently undersold  
the U.S. product, officials said, particularly loins and racks, the 
largest revenue-generating products for domestic producers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the time since the import surge started, producers said they  
watched prices drop from $1 a pound to 65 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices paid to American producers fell during the 1998  
Easter-Passover season, the market's traditional peak, and reached 
a four-year low of 60 cents a pound for slaughter lambs, the 
industry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheep producers said the import increase came at a particularly  
bad time -- when farmers were just beginning to recover and adjust 
after losing years of government subsidies in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wrecks our markets,'' said Cindy Siddoway, a Terraton,  
Idaho, sheep producer who also serves as vice president of the 
sheep association. ``It's just really hard to do any long term 
planning, to make some of the changes we want to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problems of low prices and imports are hitting the entire  
U.S. livestock industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork producers, stuck with their lowest prices in four decades,  
have accused Canadian farmers of sending their hogs across the 
border to use up slaughter capacity and help drive down prices. A 
group of cattlemen recently won a round in a petition to the ITC 
that they were being hurt by imports of live Canadian cattle. Some 
cattlemen also have complained about imports from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had producers and we've had whole states contemplate  
trade actions against Canada,'' said Nick Giordano, international 
trade counsel for the National Pork Producers Council. ``Right now 
no, we're not on the precipice of filing, but it is something that 
producers are considering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Lambert, an economist, with the National Cattlemen's Beef  
Association, said the organization was watching the lamb proceeding 
``fairly closely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Cases like this are very much a watermark case,'' Lambert  
said.

<HEADLINE> Bailey Subpoenaed in Sheppard Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Prosecutors trying to clear up the 45-year-old  
case against the late Dr. Sam Sheppard are seeking records from 
defense attorney F. Lee Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey was subpoenaed Friday for any documents he has about  
Sheppard, whom he successfully represented in a 1966 murder 
retrial. Sheppard was found innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard was charged with murder for the 1954 beating his wife,  
Marilyn, to death in their suburban home along Lake Erie. The case 
was the basis for the television series and movie ``The Fugitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuyahoga County Prosecutor William D. Mason is seeking Bailey's  
records in an effort to defend the county against the Sheppard 
family's lawsuit claiming he was wrongfully imprisoned for 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	If Sheppard's son, Sam Reese Sheppard, 51, win a formal  
declaration of innocence, he could collect an estimated $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard died of liver cancer in 1970.  
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said he has no records and that everything he knows was  
in two books he wrote or contributed to, one about Sheppard and the 
other about himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney-client privilege is not an issue, Bailey said, because  
Sheppard told him to speak openly with the media about every aspect 
of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is scheduled for trial on Oct. 18.

<HEADLINE> Glenn Marks Anniversary of Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- John Glenn celebrated the 37th  
anniversary of his first space flight at a Saturday night 
get-together attended by more than 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the biggest,'' Glenn said of his anniversary bash,  
coming four months after he rocketed into orbit at age 77. ``But 
I'm sure it will be the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America's first and oldest man in orbit said he and his family  
always mark Feb. 20, the day he rode his Friendship 7 capsule into 
orbit and the history books back in 1962, but seldom in such grand 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a historical day in my own day, at least,'' Glenn  
said. ``Glad this year to be here and take part in this little 
larger celebration than we usually have, for a good purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fund-raising dinner and gala at a Disney World hotel  
attracted not only astronauts, space program officials and other 
notables, such as legendary TV newsman Walter Cronkite, but also 
school children who witnessed Glenn's Oct. 29 launch aboard space 
shuttle Discovery during a week at Space Camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the $250-per-person event went to the U.S. Space  
Camp Foundation and the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference before dinner, Glenn said he still cannot  
believe how much attention his space shuttle trip generated. His 
star appeal was evident Saturday night: He was besieged by 
youngsters and their parents seeking pictures and autographs. He 
happily obliged as many as he could. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not expect the outpouring of emotion we had on this  
flight,'' said Glenn, who was a medical guinea pig aboard 
Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The retired senator from Ohio said he hopes his autobiography --  
due out this fall from Bantam Books -- will encourage more young 
people to go into public service and public policy careers.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Hits Pa. Industrial Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Rescue crews picked through tons of  
twisted steel and rubble early today, trying to find four people 
buried by an explosion that leveled their chemical processing 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight other workers were hospitalized -- two in critical  
condition -- after the blast Friday night at Concept Sciences Inc. 
in an industrial park about 50 miles north of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still holding out hope for those victims unaccounted  
for, but we're making preparations to go from a rescue mission to a 
recovery mission,'' state police Cpl. Theodore Kohuth said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers were relying on a helicopter equipped with infrared  
equipment and police dogs to try to pinpoint the location of the 
victims. Six of those sent to hospitals were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
	The force of the explosion dug a crater 4 feet deep and blew out  
25-foot-high walls, collapsing the concrete roof. Debris was 
scattered 100 yards away and only portions of the steel framework 
remained. 
</P>
<P>
	Three nearby buildings had windows blown out and siding torn  
away. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast was triggered during distillation of a volatile  
chemical used by the company for processing salt in water heaters, 
said John Conklin, director of the Lehigh County Emergency 
Management Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees at Railroad Packing and Shipping, a business adjacent  
to the blast site, were among those who scattered on foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was a plane crashing into our building,'' said  
employee Mike Giuffrida. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion was so loud that Richard Hageman, a police officer  
at Lehigh International Airport, couldn't tell where it came from. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a combination of panic and being dumbstruck,'' he said.  
``I was telling everybody, `Get out of here, start walking down the 
road.' No one was screaming, there was more talking back and forth. 
I would say that they were in shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy Miklus, who lives about five miles from the site, said her  
house shook from the explosion. ``We looked outside and we could 
see a big cloud just going over the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities did not immediately know what the chemical was and  
ordered people within a one-mile radius of the explosion to stay 
indoors for two hours. Conklin said the blast released a mixture of 
chemicals, but that the material posed no danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Grover Stainbrook, executive vice president of the industrial  
park, said Concept Sciences only recently moved into the building. 
Company officials could not immediately be reached for comment.

<HEADLINE> Five Die in Chemical Plant Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Rescue workers searching through tons of  
rubble and twisted steel today discovered the bodies of five people 
killed in an explosion that leveled a chemical processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Friday night blast at the Concept Sciences Inc. facility at  
the Lehigh Valley Industrial Park -- about three miles southwest of 
Allentown and 50 miles north of Philadelphia -- could be felt miles 
away and left at least 13 others injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehigh County Coroner Scott Grimm the dead were among seven  
people in the building at the time of the explosion. Two others 
were pulled from the debris, including one who was in critical 
condition. The condition of the other was not known. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believed the explosion was triggered during the  
distillation of the volatile chemical hydroxylamine, a substance 
used by the company for processing salt in water heaters, said John 
Conklin, director of the Lehigh County Emergency Management Office. 
They also believed another chemical -- potassium hydroxide -- was 
involved in the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion created a 4-foot crater in the building and blew  
out 25-foot high concrete walls and caused two stories of concrete 
ceiling to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The morning light showed just how devastating the explosion was:  
Twisted steel and chunks of concrete littered the area for at least 
100 yards in each direction and only parts of the steel framework 
stood; three other adjacent buildings were damage, with windows 
blown out and siding torn from the structures. Cars in an adjacent 
parking lot were covered in rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue crews in protective air masks and clothing searched all  
night for the missing people, but they were hampered by the 
unstable remains of the structure, as well as fatigue and 
temperatures in the 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	Infrared equipment was used by search and rescue specialists  
from the Philadelphia and Harrisburg fire departments to pinpoint 
where they believed the victims were, while crews used small hand 
tools to dig through the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Janice Nisbet, spokeswoman for the Lehigh County Emergency  
Management Office, had said that workers had gone ``through every 
air pocket'' looking for any survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen unidentified people, including five rescue workers,  
were taken to area hospitals. Conklin said most were treated and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	David Lesak, chief of the Lehigh County hazardous materials  
team, said most of the injuries ``were blast related as opposed to 
chemical related.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By daybreak, Lesak's crew had decontaminated about 80 workers  
with a water and soap solution. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports of a chemical cloud that drifted toward  
Allentown, and people within a one-mile radius were asked by police 
going door-to-door to stay indoors for about two hours Friday 
night. Conklin said the blast released a mixture of the chemicals 
into the air, but no one was ever in any danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Concept Sciences officials could not immediately be reached for  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Indians Sign Hershiser to Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians on Saturday  
signed former Indians pitcher Orel Hershiser to a minor league 
contract, adding depth to their pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser, 40, is expected to join the team Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander spent last season with the San Francisco  
Giants, posting a record of 11-10 with a 4.41 ERA in 34 starts. 
Before that, he pitched three seasons in Cleveland, compiling a 
record of 45-21. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians general manager John Hart said there is no guarantee  
Hershiser will make the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have a job. He'll have to compete for one,'' Hart  
said. ``But this gives us some protection and some depth for our 
staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's starting rotation is virtually set with Charles  
Nagy, Bartolo Colon, Jaret Wright, Dave Burba and Dwight Gooden the 
expected starters. Steve Karsay is also in the mix. 
</P>
<P>
	But after that, the Indians don't have any experienced major  
league starters. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians manager Mike Hargrove said Hershiser's chances of  
winning a job with the Tribe are ``50-50.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to make the club it's going to be an uphill battle,''  
Hargrove said. ``But we'll bring him to camp and see where it 
goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser won the 1988 National League Cy Young Award after  
going 23-8 with a 2.26 ERA for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed with Cleveland as a free agent in 1995, going 16-6  
with a 3.87 ERA for the American League champion Indians. In five 
postseason starts that year, he was 4-1 with a 1.53 ERA, and was 
chosen the most valuable player of the American League Championship 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know Orel, and he knows us,'' Hart said. ``He has had some  
other offers, but he is intrigued by coming back to us.''

<HEADLINE> George Breaks World Pole Vault Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian pole vaulter Emma George  
begged her coach for one more jump and then used it to break her 
own world record at the Sydney Grand Prix track meet today. 
</P>
<P>
	George cleared 15 feet, 1 inch on her first attempt after easy  
clearances on her two previous heights. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a 16th world record -- outdoors or indoors -- for George,  
who set the previous outdoor mark at 15 feet, 3/4 inch last March. 
</P>
<P>
	Her coach, Alex Parnov, told her she should stop after winning  
the meet with a 14-foot, 7-inch clearance but she asked for another 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said maybe we should stop now because you've got a  
competition next week,'' George said. ``I counted my jumps and I 
said can I have just a couple more, so it was nice to get it in 
just one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jump set her up for the world indoor championships in Japan  
next month, where George hopes to improve on her silver medal from 
the previous titles in Paris in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	George went on a record breaking spree early last year but then  
put height aside to work on the quality of her run-up. 
</P>
<P>
	She took her time getting used to the shortened run up and lost  
twice 
</P>
<P>
	to former Russian athlete Tatianta Grigorieva, now qualified for  
Australia, in the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure's off a little bit now. I know I had a slow start  
off eight steps but it was what I was working towards,'' George 
said.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Games Bid Probe May Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- After insisting for months that they have done  
nothing wrong in securing the 1996 Olympic Games, Atlanta Olympic 
officials are now dealing with the disclosure that they might have 
bent the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	And the fallout might be a another look into their bid, which  
beat out Athens, Greece, for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A probe into the bid was all but complete, but investigators  
might want to know more, U.S. Olympic Committee Executive Director 
Dick Schultz said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Battle, former vice president for international affairs  
for the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, has admitted that 
officials routinely violated the then-$200 gift limit for IOC 
members while trying to secure the 1996 Games. It is now $150. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators ``have already interviewed a number of people in  
Atlanta, but they'll probably want to go back and ask Charlie a few 
more questions,'' Schultz said. ``They'll probably want to know to 
what extent this went to, and that will go into the report to the 
IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Battle  
acknowledged IOC members received expensive gifts, including $475 
sets of golf clubs, first-class airline tickets, clothing and even 
a bulldog that was sent to a Cuban delegate. 
</P>
<P>
	Battle insisted that there was no wrongdoing because IOC rules  
were vague and other bid cities were doing the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never any effort or intent to abuse the process or  
to do anything which we felt was not the right thing to do,'' said 
Battle, an attorney who is now head of Central Atlanta Progress, a 
downtown development group. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta organizers ``stayed within the spirit of the relevant  
guidelines and accepted practices at that time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to WSB-TV, former Atlanta Mayor Andy Young, who was  
also a member of the bid committee, defended the gifts as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we exceeded the guidelines, it was in the spirit of  
generosity, not out of any sense of bribing people,'' Young said. 
``Remember, we did not have any money and not a lot of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is investigating the Olympic bid process after last  
December's revelations that Salt Lake City Olympic officials 
provided college scholarships, free health care and other gifts to 
IOC members and their families while securing the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members have either been expelled or resigned from the IOC.  
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound has requested all bid cities  
dating back to the 1996 Games review their dealings with IOC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said the Atlanta Olympic officials had all but completed  
their investigation when Battle's comments were first reported in 
Friday's Washington Post, and a letter was to be sent to the IOC 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Battle said he welcomes the investigation, and further questions  
about the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll acknowledge what we did and confirm everything we did  
was proper,'' Battle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake City investigation also has unveiled possible  
improprieties involving the USOC's selection of the city to present 
to the IOC. But Schultz said no such wrongdoing has been found with 
the Atlanta bid.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Ponzi Schemers Fined $52M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A judge has slapped a $52 million fine on  
the operators of an alleged Ponzi scheme that defrauded 600 
investors across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Chief Judge David Sam signed a judgment Thursday  
after the defendants failed to respond to a complaint filed last 
year by a court-appointed receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	The case began in 1997 with a U.S. Securities and Exchange  
Commission civil complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint alleged that a group of companies and people  
raised more than $20 million by promising investors a 20 percent 
return on three-year notes. The money was purportedly earmarked for 
oil and gas drilling projects in Kansas and California. 
</P>
<P>
	At the SEC's request, Sam earlier made Salt Lake attorney Robert  
Wing receiver for Capital Acquisitions Inc., Laser Leasing Inc., 
Fund Line International Inc., Capitol Investment Partners Inc., 
Chaparral Petroleum Inc., K&AMP;B Gas Company Inc., Donna Lee Petroleum 
Inc., and Capital Kansas Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	In his order, Sam ordered Pete J. Buffo, Wayne C. Notwell, the  
Somerset Group and Surety Underwriters and Control Corp. to pay $50 
million and $2 million in interest. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left at Wing's office Saturday wasn't immediately  
returned and the relationships between those fined and those in 
receivership wasn't clear. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the SEC, the principals behind Capital Acquisitions  
and Laser Leasing operated a classic Ponzi scheme, where early 
investors are paid with money collected from later investors to 
build up credibility. Eventually, the pyramid can no longer be 
sustained, and the large number of new investors at the bottom are 
left with nothing.

	PARKSIDE, Pa. (AP) -- A suburban Philadelphia police department  
is under investigation following the discovery of pornographic 
pictures of young girls on a police computer, authorities said.

Philadelphia.

Authorities said since all officers have access to the computer, it

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Probe Head Looks Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- An elite ethics panel report on  
the Salt Lake Olympic bribery scandal will focus on how to make 
sure such cases don't recur, the head of the investigation said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said the details  
and focus of his commission's two months of work will be finalized 
over the next week, with the report issued on schedule March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe personally and strongly in the high ideals of the  
Olympic movement,'' he said. ``We are deeply concerned about the 
adverse affect of all the recent revelations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, whose commission is an independent ethics council to  
the U.S. Olympic Committee, briefed the USOC's executive committee 
in closed-door session. 
</P>
<P>
	Revised drafts will be finished early in the week, with final  
work then done on detail and focus, he told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to talk about specifics or to say if new cases of  
wrongdoing by bidders was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators met in the USOC's headquarters city Friday and  
Saturday, spending more than 13 hours going over evidence, 
according to Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a ``substantial number'' of people the commission asked  
for information refused to cooperate because of a Justice 
Department inquiry into the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there is more than enough information in the public record  
to provide a sufficient basis and support for our conclusions and 
recommendations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said he had read hundreds of media stories about the  
scandal. The USOC's own inquiry, conducted by the law firm of Hogon 
&AMP; Hartson, also has turned over 22 boxes containing 200,000 
documents to the Mitchell commission. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC president Bill Hybl said the committee's own investigation  
was 96-97 percent complete and would contain no new bombshells. 
</P>
<P>
	While there's a week to go, Mitchell said he had not seen  
anything in the investigation that that shocked him. But he 
acknowledged that the Salt Lake case had hit the Olympics hard and 
must never happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our small way, we want to make sure that the staging of the  
Olympic Games is in accordance with the same high standards and 
integrity expected in the performance of athletes during the 
games,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why the report would focus on looking ahead rather than  
finding new evidence of improper actions, Mitchell replied: 
``That's what we were asked to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC said it had no plans to investigate Atlanta's  
successful quest for the 1996 Summer Games. Charlie Battle, the 
head of International Relations for Atlanta's bid, said this week 
that his group gave gifts in excess of IOC rules but had not tried 
to buy votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's response to the IOC's request for information on  
possible improper activities by committee members during the bid 
would be sent to the international panel by the end of next week, 
USOC spokesman Mike Moran said. Atlanta officials already have said 
that their reviews failed to find any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mitchell commission is one of at least five sports and  
government bodies investigating the bribery scandal surrounding 
Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	A Salt Lake ethic commission found 24 International Olympic  
Committee members took some $1.2 million in cash, medical care, 
lavish gifts and other improper inducements from Utah bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled and 13 others  
remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported Saturday that the FBI has expanded  
its investigation and is looking into allegations that Tom Welch, 
the bid committee president, and his secretary, Stephanie Pate, 
forged the name of Welch's ex-wife to a joint bank account. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the money was sent to Pate's address but that it  
wasn't clear how it was used. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile Mitt Romney, the Boston venture capitalist who took  
over earlier this month as Chief Executive Director of the Salt 
Lake Organizing Committee, said his job was to restore trust in the 
2002 Games and return the focus to sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few people in Salt Lake's bid made some serious errors and  
that has drawn attention away from the athletes,'' Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Salt Lake Games would prove to be ``the best Winter  
Games in history,'' even though they will be conducted under 
unprecedented scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think any time there is a breach of trust at the top of an  
organization that organization is placed under a microscope,'' 
Romney said. ``I believe we deserve special review, and I believe 
we will come through with flying colors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new SLOC Chief said he would make sure each organizing  
committee member has an annual ethics review and that he expected 
any board member will conflicts of interest between private and 
Olympic work to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC, meanwhile, said it was convinced that commitments to  
U.S. athlete training and support made by Salt Lake bidders had 
been honored in full. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Page, the committee's assistant executive director for  
sports, said at least 20 American winter athletes were attending 
the University of Utah under aid programs and that up to half of 
the 2002 U.S. Winter Games team would be living and training in the 
Salt Lake area by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Page also released documents showing that Howard Peterson, then  
executive director of U.S. Skiing, had signed off on the program in 
1993. Peterson alleged last week that Salt Lake owed $3 million for 
training and support programs it never instituted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this has fulfilled a spirit of the documents and  
taken it a step further,'' Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson however, said he remained concerned that Salt Lake's  
pledge has not been fully met. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't doubt there are a number of programs that the USOC has  
funded,'' Peterson said from his Park City, Utah home. ``But that 
is a lot different from some of the promises in Salt Lake's bid 
document.''

<HEADLINE> Olivetti Bids for Italy Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Italian firm Olivetti Spa announced a $58  
billion hostile takeover bid Saturday for rival Telecom Italia in 
what would be Europe's richest telecommunications deal ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's bid was made public in a five-page filing to the  
Italian stock market regulatory body, Consob. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia, a former state monopoly, is the world's  
sixth-largest phone company, but has endured three management 
shakeups in the past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Saturday, the Italian news agency ANSA reported that  
Telecom Italia's cellular subsidiary, Telecom Italia Mobile, might 
make a takeover bid for the parent company to block the expected 
takeover bid. Telecom Italia owns 60 percent of TIM. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of both Telecom and TIM gathered Saturday evening in  
hastily convened meetings. Officials indicated that more 
information was needed on the bid by Olivetti, which scheduled 
another board meeting for very late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti on Friday announced its board would meet Sunday  
afternoon to review a ``strategic investment'' regarding Telecom 
Italia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources have said that Olivetti, which only has $9 billion  
currently available for the takeover, would raise some $10 billion 
by selling its existing phone company investments in Infostrada and 
Omnitel to Mannesmann AG. Olivetti and Mannesman control those two 
via a holding company 50.1 percent owned by Olivetti and 49.9 
percent owned by Mannesmann. 
</P>
<P>
	The four banks advising Olivetti on Telecom Italia -- investment  
bankers Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette, Lehman Brothers, Italy's 
Mediobanca and Chase Manhattan Bank -- are expected to submit a 
letter Sunday to Olivetti declaring that they are ``highly 
confident'' that they can raise the necessary financing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about a possible deal have building over the past two  
months. Last month, Olivetti said a report that it was planning to 
buy Telecom Italia was ``unfounded and impracticable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consob is now evaluating Olivetti's denial in light of current  
developments, and also said it had opened a preliminary inquiry 
into insider trading of Telecom Italia shares after a large block 
changed hands Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays Pushing Wacky Promos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Attorneys will be charged double --  
and billed by the third of an inning -- on Lawyer Appreciation 
Night. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be Conversion Day, when fans are rewarded for getting  
rid of New York Yankees caps. 
</P>
<P>
	And yes, Disco Demolition Night returns, 20 years after its  
infamous debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Veeck, the son of Hall of Famer Bill Veeck, has scheduled  
special events or giveaways on 70 of 81 home dates for the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays in his new role as senior vice president of sales 
and marketing. The campaign is dubbed ``Off the Wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	```Off the Wall' is a term we hope will endear the fans to get  
them to realize that it is about fun, that we are willing to take a 
chance,'' said Veeck, whose late father was one of baseball's most 
colorful owners for more than three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody asked: `What about the tradition of the game?' The  
fact is the tradition of the game is all about the fans. The game 
doesn't belong to the players, and it doesn't belong to the 
owners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay, starting its second season, will spend more than $2  
million in the biggest promotional campaign in major league 
baseball. As far as the Devil Rays are concerned, the sillier the 
idea the better. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thrust of Lawyer Night is we're going to have a special  
gate. You have Sexgate, Travelgate, Watergate. We're going to have 
Lawyergate,'' Veeck said, adding that every attorney will be 
charged double. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is counting on lawyers to admit their profession in the  
name of fun and charity. All proceeds go to Legal Aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``The umpires obviously should come out in flowing robes. ...  
We'll have kangaroo court down the first base side, and down the 
third base side we'll have the hanging judge,'' Veeck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Veeck, who owned the Chicago White Sox, St. Louis Browns  
and Cleveland Indians at different times, was known as the P.T. 
Barnum of baseball and angered some in the game with zany 
promotions. In 1951, he had 3-foot-7 Eddie Gaedel bat for the 
Browns wearing the number one-eighth. Gaedel walked on four 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Veeck carried on the tradition with several minor league  
teams, including the highly successful St. Paul Saints of the 
independent Northern League. His promotions included having a pig 
deliver baseballs to umpires and having a nun give massages. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, his Charleston RiverDogs planned giving away a free  
vasectomy in honor of Father's Day, then canceled the promotion 
after complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	While the majority of the Devil Rays' promotions are  
traditional, there are some, such as Christmas in May, that are 
planned for no particular reason -- except fun. 
</P>
<P>
	A Labor Day special will include free admission for pregnant  
women; Twins Night will honor sets of twins; and Turn Back The 
Clock Day will feature the visiting New York Mets in their vintage 
uniforms while the Devil Rays pay homage to the Tampa Tarpons, a 
former minor-league team. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans are sketchy for Disco Demolition 20 Years Later Night,  
although there will definitely be a band to get fans to 
shake-shake-shake their booties. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Veeck was the mastermind behind the anti-disco party at  
Comiskey Park in 1979, which ended with a White Sox forfeit after 
fans refused to leave the field. 
</P>
<P>
	For Tampa Bay's home opener, about 2,500 people are expected to  
take part in the ceremonial first pitch. They'll pass the ball 
through downtown St. Petersburg until it winds up with Hall of 
Famer Larry Doby, who broke the color barrier in the American 
League when Bill Veeck signed him to play for the Cleveland 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	A Beanie Babies giveaway is scheduled the following night, and  
Henry Aaron will be honored before the third game, three days 
before the 25th anniversary of homer No. 715. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our opening weekend is the best I've ever seen,'' Veeck said.  
</P>
<P>
	Owner Vince Naimoli is excited about drawing three large crowds  
so early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays sold out the opener a year ago, then went 12 home  
games without a crowd of more than 36,599. After attracting 45,369 
for the first game, attendance was announced as 30,109 and 28,261 
the following two days. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is counting on the lure of Beanie Babies to keep the  
turnstiles clicking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traditionally in baseball, the second night's always a downer.  
So we thought: `Why not have the second night be as big as the 
first night,''' Naimoli said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you attract that many people early in the season, they  
say: `You know, this is kind of fun. I'm going to go back and do it 
again.' It comes off as fun, but there's a lot of thought to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veeck has no fear of failure. After the original Disco  
Demolition Night, he can't imagine any promotion turning out worse 
-- unless it involves a bunch of empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``That ultimately will tell us how successful we are,'' he said.  
``If nobody shows up to enjoy the fun, all those empty seats just 
voted.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Talks Up His Education Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton urged Congress on Saturday  
to embrace and advance federal initiatives in public education that 
he said have roots in states and classrooms across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging some need for a federal role, Republican  
governors said they want the government to be no more than a 
limited partner in the drive to mend the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
	As governors of both parties gathered in Washington for their  
annual winter meeting, Clinton said state efforts to improve 
education must be underpinned by commonsense federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``All across our nation, we're seeing a grass-roots revolution  
in education -- a revolution in accountability and rising 
expectations,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, we have a rare opportunity to use our new  
prosperity to help this revolution spread to every single school 
district, every classroom, every child,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trick is helping more communities to put these proven  
solutions to work in their own public schools,'' the president 
said. ``I believe the national government has an obligation to help 
them do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a morning news conference, Utah Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a  
Republican, said the goal of improving education will be easier to 
achieve once federal politicians and bureaucrats impose fewer rules 
and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like them as limited partners, not as managing  
partners,'' Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Gov. Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, this year's head  
of the National Governors' Association, said governors will get 
their chance to endorse or critique Clinton's plans when they meet 
with him this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that it makes sense, we'll support it,'' he  
said. ``To the extent it needs changes, we'll tell them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Carper added a caution: ``For us to maximize our success, we  
need to speak as one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, he appeared with about 10 Democratic governors at an  
afternoon news conference with Education Secretary Richard W. 
Riley. There, the governors endorsed the president's plan to link 
funds with performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are reasons and then there are excuses,'' said Gov. Paul  
Patton of Kentucky. ``Some of the things you hear, they are 
excuses. We know you can't run a school system from Washington, but 
you cannot take federal funds and just use them for anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley insisted the administration is not mandating performance.  
``We want to be a junior partner,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposals include building or modernizing 6,000  
classrooms, hiring 100,000 teachers, reducing class size in the 
early grades, starting more after-school programs, connecting all 
classrooms and libraries to the Internet, stopping social promotion 
and insisting on effective discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans in Congress have seized on education  
as a top political priority while differing in their approach. 
</P>
<P>
	At a nearby meeting, GOP governors insisted they were already  
spending state funds to reduce class sizes and stop the automatic 
promotion of failing students. ``The president assumes in his 
proposal that Congress has the ability to know what is going on all 
over the country in education and to precisely target dollars,'' 
said Michigan Gov. John Engler. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging the differences, Clinton said, ``Some in Congress  
believe the national government has no business helping communities 
to improve their schools, but I think strengthening education is a 
national priority.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Carves Out Role As Statesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- A motorcade carrying the U.S.  
politician and five Cabinet secretaries speeds along a highway in 
Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
	Ensconced behind the bulletproof windows of a black limousine,  
an American flag fluttering on its fender, is not President Clinton 
but presidential contender Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	While the field of Democratic and Republican candidates for the  
2000 presidential elections gels, Gore -- the Democratic 
front-runner -- is busy polishing his image as a statesman and 
foreign policy maven. 
</P>
<P>
	The globetrotting Gore was in South Africa to co-chair a meeting  
Thursday of the U.S.-South Africa Binational Commission, which 
regulates the two countries' relations. The other co-chair is South 
Africa's own would-be president, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Gore's third foreign trip in four months.  
</P>
<P>
	In November, the vice president flew on Air Force II to Malaysia  
for a summit of Asian heads of state. There, he denounced the host 
country's government for repressing democratic reform. Major 
American newspapers applauded his righteous boldness. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Gore jetted to the World Economic Forum in Davos,  
Switzerland, to raise his profile on international economic issues. 
In a speech to dozens of heads of state, he called for cuts in 
international agricultural tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also met on the sidelines with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny  
Primakov and other leaders. On the way home, he spent an afternoon 
with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at No. 10 Downing Street. No 
Monica Lewinsky scandal dogged his steps. 
</P>
<P>
	It is crucial for a president to be good at foreign policy, and  
Gore is ``a pro'' at it, said Thomas E. Mann, director of 
governmental studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	That might translate into more votes for Gore, but not because  
voters are obsessed with foreign policy, the analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absent an international crisis ... foreign policy issues per  
se tend not to be terribly important in determining the outcome of 
a presidential election,'' Mann said. ``Certainly, the continued 
economic expansion will be the most important single factor in the 
2000 election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But voters don't yet consider Gore a ``presidential figure,''  
and his continued meetings with foreign leaders will help change 
that perception, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some foreign officials offer praise for the Oval Office hopeful.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has a good grasp of foreign policy, especially regarding  
American-South African issues,'' South African Foreign Minister 
Alfred Nzo said Thursday during a break in the Binational 
Commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, meanwhile, has established a close relationship with  
Mbeki, who is virtually assured of succeeding the retiring 
President Nelson Mandela when South Africa holds elections within a 
few months. No date has been set, but they are expected in May. 
</P>
<P>
	During a joint television interview Thursday, Gore joked about  
their aspirations. ``I wished my chances were as good as Thabo's,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can communicate at any time about anything. Nothing is  
barred,'' Mbeki said. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks opening the Binational Commission's meeting, Gore  
trumpeted the importance of such relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenges of combatting AIDS, international terrorism and  
damaging shifts in global economies are best met by 
``person-to-person contacts and conversations,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to state how vital these friendships are,'' he  
declared.

<HEADLINE> Women's College To Launch Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Hoping to add more women to an overwhelmingly  
male-dominated profession, Smith College officials on Saturday 
voted to open the nation's first engineering program at a women's 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith officials said women represent about one in six college  
engineering students and less than one in 10 professional engineers 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, it's a matter of national import that our country not  
only produce more women engineers, but also develop new, truly 
effective models for educating them,'' Smith President Ruth Simmons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes are expected to start this fall, and the first  
engineering majors would graduate in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,700 women attend the prestigious all-women's school in  
Northampton, Mass. It was founded in 1875. 
</P>
<P>
	The college's board of trustees voted to approve the program,  
which will be named after the late Jean Sovatkin Picker, a 1942 
graduate and former United Nations official. Picker's husband, 
Harvey Picker, gave $5 million to support an endowment. 
</P>
<P>
	The new program will focus on three engineering fields:  
computer, electrical and environmental. Once the programs are 
established, the college expects to maintain about 100 engineering 
majors, graduating approximately 25 women each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1985, the school has offered an engineering minor and has  
offered a dual degree program with the engineering college at the 
University of Massachusetts at Amherst. 
</P>
<P>
	Physics professor Malgorzata Pfabe, who is helping to launch the  
new engineering program, said Smith will join the ranks of a small 
number of liberal arts schools offering the major. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's very important that they will be trained in a  
liberal arts environment,'' she said. ``They should speak a foreign 
language. They should know economics and they should know some 
social sciences.''

<HEADLINE> Jerseyans Can't Live Without Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIDGEFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- His first meeting out of the way, Gio  
Bussanich stretches out and settles into his favorite chair with a 
cup of coffee and the morning paper. 
</P>
<P>
	That Bussanich is lounging in the driver's seat of his red  
Chevrolet Lumina raises no eyebrows. A dozen other travelers at the 
Vince Lombardi service area off the New Jersey Turnpike are doing 
the same, happily ignoring the benches, picnic tables and indoor 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	They prefer to stay in their parked cars on this unusually warm  
and sunny day, eating, chatting on cell phones, reading, sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
	On each side of their little corner of heaven lie the main  
arteries of the New Jersey megalopolis -- multiple lanes of Turnpike 
traffic zooming to New York and points north, more lanes pouring 
southward to Philadelphia and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the grassy island in between, ``It's my piece of the  
world,'' says Bussanich. ``You're like in your bubble here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 46-year-old seller of hydraulic parts, he drives 500 miles a  
week and doesn't get out of his car unless he has to. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jerseyans LOVE their cars. They take exquisite care of them,  
buying high-tech stereos, televisions and other accessories that 
offer some of the comforts of home. They rarely park for fast food; 
they'd rather drive through. Gas is cheap here, and they don't have 
to pump it. People may think of California as the ultimate car 
culture, but New Jersey is the state that gave the world the 
drive-in movie theater and the cloverleaf interchange. 
</P>
<P>
	So accustomed are New Jerseyans to the driver's seat that few  
distances are too short to drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I have to go across the street, I do walk,'' says Pierre  
Chidiak, a bagel-shop owner from Wayne. ``But if I have to go a 
block and a half, I'll take my car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Jerseyans HATE their cars. They pay the nation's highest  
auto insurance rates to drive in the nation's thickest traffic. 
Drivers are intimately familiar with honking, tailgating and vulgar 
gestures, with terms like road rage, HOV and EZ Pass. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, cars outnumber the drivers; there are 6.4 million  
registered cars for 5.8 million licensed drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, 2.6 million cars travel on every mile of every lane  
of every road in New Jersey, according to a study by the nonprofit 
Road Information Program. That's 72 percent above the national 
average. New Jersey, already crowded with more people per square 
mile than any other state, is equally crowded with cars. 
</P>
<P>
	More are coming. By 2010, highway travel in New Jersey will be  
up 18 percent, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic and the inability to cope without a car have made  
driving ``a bigger quality-of-life issue,'' says John Tiene, 
executive director of the Insurance Council of New Jersey, an 
industry group. ``Driving has become so much more stressful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So stressful that the state Psychological Association has its  
own task force dedicated to angry driving. So stressful that a 
recent newspaper poll, dubbed the ``Middle Finger Index,'' tried to 
quantify the prevalence of that vulgar gesture on the roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the rage was fomented by the HOV (High Occupancy  
Vehicle) lanes that tried to put New Jerseyans in a sharing frame 
of mind. The highway lanes were set aside for car pools and 
entitled the state to more federal road funding. But they never 
caught on. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, New Jersey scored another first: First state to  
abolish HOV lanes without having to refund the federal aid. No 
longer did drivers have to sit seething at a bottlenecked 
standstill while lone cars sailed by in the HOV lanes. No wonder 
the rejoicing seemed more appropriate to the lifting of a siege. 
One newspaper celebrated by hiring a Dixieland band to play at a 
highway rest stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``No more government-designed traffic jams on Routes 80 and  
287!'' declared U.S. Rep. Marge Roukema, R-Ridgewood. 
</P>
<P>
	If HOV lanes were the stuff of political battles, so were those  
sky-high auto insurance rates, averaging $1,099 a year and 
sometimes rising to $4,000, which threatened to derail Gov. 
Christie Whitman's re-election in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	And when Whitman proposed to raise the gasoline tax by 2 cents a  
gallon to protect undeveloped land, lawmakers of both parties shot 
it down, fearing public outcry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I'd like to preserve open spaces, but I'm a motorist,''  
says Pamela Fischer, spokeswoman for the American Automobile 
Association's New Jersey chapter, one of many groups and lawmakers 
who opposed gas money going to anything other than transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	So New Jerseyans can continue to tank up on regular unleaded for  
90 cents a gallon -- or as little as 75 cents in some places. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's getting harder to find a quiet corner of unspoiled  
countryside in the nation's most densely populated state, jammed 
between Philadelphia and New York and serving as a major corridor 
for the nation's East Coast traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	The traffic gets better the farther one gets from the suburbs of  
those two cities. Off the most heavily traveled roads, people can 
still enjoy the state parks, beaches, mountains and farmland that 
gave New Jersey the title of Garden State. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the air clean, lawmakers toughened the state's emissions  
test last year, but tried to appease motorists by scheduling them 
every two years instead of one. The complicated new timetable only 
confused things, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeners who called New Jersey 101.5 talk radio begged for  
guidance. When do cars made in an odd-numbered year get inspected? 
What color sticker? When do the tests get tougher? 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, we don't know what to tell them,'' radio host Jeff  
Deminski says. ``It turns into kind of a farce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roads themselves don't help ease tempers. Road signs are  
often faded, misleading or downright baffling, as anyone trying to 
reach Newark International Airport from the heavily traveled Garden 
State Parkway can attest. The overused roads on major shopping 
routes often have lanes closed for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Route 22 is a nightmare. Route 46 is a nightmare. Route 17 is  
a nightmare,'' says Victor Friedman, of Saddle River. ``I have 
rage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It only takes one accident to trigger chaos. On the day after  
Christmas a truck flipped on a commercial strip of Route 46, 
stalling cars for 10 miles on one of the busiest shopping days of 
the year and giving new meaning to what New Jerseyans call 
mall-to-mall traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	The pavement is black with skid marks where Routes 4 and 17  
converge, squeezing three lanes into two, and four lines of cars 
slow to a crawl so drivers won't miss their turnoff and have to 
drive another 30 minutes to make a U-turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst cloverleaf I've seen any place in the world,'' says  
Howard Goldman, a manager at a computer store near the 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
	So why does he drive? After all, buses go to Paramus.  
</P>
<P>
	Because cars are more convenient. Many of the nearly 360,000  
daily commuters on New Jersey Transit buses and trains have to 
drive to their stop anyway, and then find a parking place. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Union County suburb of Westfield, Mayor Tom Jardim says,  
the railroad station's 470-car parking lot has a four-year waiting 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people drive to other towns where the parking is  
easier,'' Jardim says. ``Some people decide that they're just going 
to drive. Other people actually change jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NJ Transit ridership has risen every year, especially on the new  
Midtown Direct rail line linking Essex, Morris, Union and Warren 
counties directly to New York. More than $1 billion is invested in 
train concourses for Newark and New York's Penn Station, two more 
rail lines with direct service into New York, and a Hudson River 
light rail line, spokesman Steve Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	But mass transit can't compete with cars in a state that is  
really a loose agglomeration of suburbs, Coleman acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jobs are so dispersed that I don't think there's any way  
we can ever serve every single person,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the trains ran twice as often, many New Jerseyans say,  
they wouldn't dream of giving up cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Bussanich wants to control his schedule, saying buses and trains  
are less reliable than the road, even in traffic. ``You just feel 
so secure in your car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Rockland, a Rutgers professor of American Studies who  
has written a book about the New Jersey Turnpike, says the 
dependence is dangerous. The car as bubble isolates people from 
their neighbors, making them identify more with the road than their 
hometowns. Among the many stereotypes New Jerseyans must endure is 
the joke that when asked for their address, they give their exit 
number. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many towns in New Jersey have a vital center?'' says  
Rockland. ``The reason why people love their cars is they don't 
have neighborhoods. They don't have communities. If they did, they 
would much rather sit on a park bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in New Jersey, it's so easy to stay in the car. Ray Saadeh's  
Car Toys in Union will install not just your car stereo, but TV 
screens on the back of each seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people have two cars. Ron Spethmann has three: A Chrysler  
minivan for family trips, a 1998 Jeep Wrangler for work and a 1995 
Chrysler Concorde for ... for extra. 
</P>
<P>
	He is 30 and says he has never ridden a bus or train; ``never  
had the need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A precious few rebels abandon cars on principle. John Bergan, a  
pedestrian advocate, walks around his hometown of Princeton, takes 
the train elsewhere and brags about being a rich man. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm buying furniture while everyone else is paying tolls,'' he  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockland, an urban adventurer, has walked the length of Broadway  
in Manhattan and bicycled all of Route 1 in New Jersey. He eschews 
malls and all places drivable, and shops exclusively in the center 
of Morristown, three blocks from his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go to the bank, I walk to the bank,'' he says.  
``It's such a warm and fuzzy experience just to be able to walk 
somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even Rockland can't get away from cars. He drives his 1992  
Honda to work every day, 32 miles from Morristown to New Brunswick. 
Says he can't get there any other way. 
</P>
<P>
	He says parking is a nightmare.

<HEADLINE> $2.5M Gift Sends Kids to Space Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YPSILANTI TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- If any of the 2,500  
fifth-graders getting a free ride to space camp ever become 
astronauts, they may not know who to thank. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the donors who are footing the $2.5 million bill  
to send the Detroit-area children to U.S. Space and Rocket Center 
camps wish to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something I thought about, but I didn't think I could  
go because it cost too much,'' said Kyle Mizer, 10. ``I can't 
believe it. I feel it's a dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All 2,500 students and their teachers are being offered free  
tuition and air fare to attend the one-week camps, which are in 
Alabama, California and Florida. The first batch of kids leave next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle's school, Rawsonville Elementary School, erupted with  
shouts of joy when Principal Theresa Green took to the intercom 
Friday and made the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole class went, `Yes!''' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The schools are in Wayne County, a mostly urban district where  
Detroit is. 
</P>
<P>
	The students immediately began peppering the principal with  
questions -- Would snacks be free? Would they have to wake up early? 
How much would they have to pack? 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Bennett-Henderson, 11, said she has developed a deep  
interest in the world beyond Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot about Mars,'' she said. ``Mars is my home  
planet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The camps are run by a nonprofit established by the state of  
Alabama in 1965. About 30,000 children spent time in then last 
year, said spokesman Gene Pinder.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Talks Up His Education Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Improving America's schools should be ``a  
national priority,'' President Clinton said today, dismissing 
criticism that education strictly is a local matter. 
</P>
<P>
	In his weekly radio address, Clinton urged Congress to embrace  
his proposals to reduce class size, modernize school buildings, 
improve teacher quality and make schools accountable for results. 
Clinton said his proposals were based ``on proven experience. 
They're common sense. We have to make them common practice in every 
school district in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans alike have seized on education as a  
top political priority but they differ in their approach. A House 
Republican bill aims to give local schools and states more control 
and flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging differences, Clinton said, ``Now, some in Congress  
believe the national government has no business helping communities 
to improve their schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think strengthening education is a national priority,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is calling on schools to provide report cards on their  
own performance to parents, end social promotion, invest more in 
summer and after-school programs, and adopt and enforce 
disciplinary codes. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wants local school districts to fix or close  
underperforming schools and ensure that teachers are qualified in 
the subject matters they teach. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton strived to cast his proposals as grassroots-based and  
not instructions trickling down from the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``As both a former governor and a parent, I know the greatest  
innovations in education do not start in Washington,'' he said. 
``They start in local schools and school districts, in community 
councils and parent-teacher groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the nation's governors gathering in Washington this  
weekend, he noted that Delaware is already putting an end to social 
promotion, Pennsylvania is improving school safety and North 
Carolina has been working to improve teacher quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I have said many times, every problem in education in  
America has been solved somewhere, by somebody, in America,'' 
Clinton said. ``The trick is helping more communities to put those 
proven solutions to work in their own public schools. I believe the 
national government has an obligation to help them do that.''

<HEADLINE> Campaign Spending Law Struck Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A judge has struck down a federal law limiting how  
much political parties can spend to back candidates, likely 
triggering a showdown over the use of so-called ``hard money'' in 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Edward Nottingham issued the ruling Thursday  
on the 1986 lawsuit filed by the Federal Election Commission 
against the Colorado Republican Party. Nottingham wrote that there 
was no evidence spending limits were needed to prevent corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't immediately clear whether the ruling would be  
appealed, but advocates of campaign spending limits predicted it 
would be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be an important case to watch,'' said John  
Bonifaz, executive director of the Boston-based National Voting 
Rights Institute. ``If we allow political parties to spend up to 
the sky to influence federal election campaigns, we've invited only 
a further erosion of the integrity of our democratic process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Curtis, chairman of the Colorado Republican Party, said he  
was ``delighted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, after 13 years, we've got a decision on this which  
should have just been common sense to begin with,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case began when the FEC sued the Colorado GOP in Denver  
after state Democrats complained about a political advertisement 
criticizing Democratic Senate candidate Tim Wirth. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats argued that the advertisement, which was paid for by  
the Republican Party, violated spending limits set forth by 
Congress in 1974. Those limits address the use of ``coordinated'' 
party spending -- money the party spends in consultation with the 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans argued that the spending limits violated the First  
Amendment guarantees of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Darryl Eskin, executive director of the Colorado Democratic  
Party, said he hadn't seen the ruling but was thankful that it came 
well in advance of the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the ruling does stick, it will at least give the parties  
plenty of time to digest it and understand,'' Eskin said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that political parties  
could spend hard money -- or money used specifically to influence 
elections -- without limits if they were not working in consultation 
with the candidate. The high court bypassed the debate about the 
federal law and whether parties could be limited if they were 
consulting with the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Limit advocates like Bonifaz argue that there is no such thing  
as uncoordinated spending. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear what impact the ruling would have on the 1976  
Supreme Court decision known as Buckley vs. Valeo. That case capped 
individual donations to federal candidates at $1,000 in order to 
remove the perception of corruption.

<HEADLINE> Small Plane Emergency Lands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL MONTE, Calif. (AP) -- When flames shot out of the  
single-engine plane she was riding in above a San Bernardino 
freeway, traffic reporter Megan Reyes gasped for air and thought 
she was going to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were flying over an accident on (Interstate) 10. When I  
turned on the (panel) light, I heard it pop and flames just started 
shooting out,'' Ms. Reyes said Friday. ``I just remember thinking 
this was how I was going to die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pilot Hector Fuentes immediately took off his shirt and used it  
to try to smother the flames. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't breathe,'' Ms. Reyes said. ``We were both gasping  
for air. We couldn't open the windows because that would fuel the 
fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Cessna 172 made an emergency landing at El Monte  
Airport, Ms. Reyes and Fuentes managed to run to safety before the 
plane burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right after we jumped out, no more than five seconds, the  
plane was totally engulfed,'' Ms. Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two work for Shadow Broadcast Services, which provides news  
and traffic reports for Los Angeles-area radio stations. They were 
not on air at the time, said editor Aki Kiriyama. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the fire probably started in the electrical  
system before igniting fuel in the aircraft after landing. 
</P>
<P>
	El Monte is about 20 miles east of Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> 1864 Killing Probed With Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EADS, Colo. (AP) -- Somewhere amid the fallow grain fields that  
checker this windy, high plains sage country, the Big Sandy Creek 
once ran red with the blood of Cheyenne and Arapaho men, women and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores were killed, scalped and mutilated by volunteers of the  
Colorado militia. Unknown to most Americans, the Sand Creek 
Massacre that cold morning of Nov. 29, 1864, is as fresh as 
yesterday to the Cheyenne and Arapaho. No one, however, is sure how 
many died or where the attack occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the National Park Service is working with tribal advisers to  
pinpoint the exact site so it can be nominated as a national park. 
The agency is using high-tech tools, aerial photographs and oral 
histories of the tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never has justice been done to satisfy the spirits'' of those  
slain, said Robert Tabor, vice chairman of the Cheyenne-Arapaho in 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sand Creek itself defined the United States' relations to all  
Indian people. It is time we set the ground aside and made it a 
national park,'' said state historian David Halaas. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill to finance the Sand Creek study and search for the  
massacre site was pushed through Congress last fall by Sen. Ben 
Nighthorse Campbell, a Colorado Republican who's part Cheyenne. 
</P>
<P>
	``The massacre was a shameful part of American history. The  
women and children slaughtered there, many of whom were my 
ancestors, should respectfully be remembered and honored,'' 
Campbell said last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1864, two cultures -- Indian hunters and pioneer farmers -- had  
collided on the plains, with atrocities committed on both sides. 
Raids on wagon trains, ranches and farms were increasing. Far to 
the East, the Civil War was raging, leaving frontier Army posts 
lightly garrisoned and poorly equipped. 
</P>
<P>
	On that bitter November sunrise, the Colorado volunteers, led by  
Col. John M. Chivington and supported by four howitzers, attacked 
the camp of Cheyenne Chief Black Kettle and 500 or more Cheyenne 
and Arapaho along the creek, now called Big Sandy. 
</P>
<P>
	Chivington and his volunteers had been spurred to action by the  
slaughter of the Hungate family on a ranch southwest of Denver, an 
attack most believe was unconnected to Black Kettle and his people. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounts of the day said the man was shot, the woman stabbed and  
``violated.'' Both were scalped; their two young daughters were 
nearly decapitated. Their bodies were put on display in Denver, 
rousing panic and vengeance in the populace, and the calling up of 
the militia by Territorial Gov. John Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	The massacre toll at Sand Creek varies widely, from 63 to 500.  
Halaas believes about 160 were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the tragedy was Black Kettle's belief he had a peace  
agreement with the U.S. Army. Historians say when the first shots 
were fired, Black Kettle raised an American flag and a white cloth 
of truce. 
</P>
<P>
	It only drew more fire. Black Kettle escaped with many others.  
</P>
<P>
	If the slaughtered Hungate family was the battle cry of the  
Colorado volunteers, Sand Creek became the rallying cry of the 
plains tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Halaas said famously fierce Cheyenne Dog Soldiers united with  
Sioux and Arapaho. 
</P>
<P>
	``About 2,000 warriors stayed together from January through  
October 1865. Hundreds (of white settlers) were killed'' across the 
plains, Halaas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact of Sand Creek ended 12 years later at the Little  
Big Horn,'' where Lt. Col. George Custer and his 7th Cavalry unit 
were massacred, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of the site, long thought to be on the private  
property of James Dawson northeast of Eads, arose recently when a 
search by the state Historical Society failed to turn up conclusive 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Laird Cometsevah, a chief of the Southern Cheyenne in Oklahoma,  
is the great-grandson of a Cheyenne who escaped. ``We know where it 
is ... but according to the National Park Service, they have to 
document ... the Sand Creek area,'' he said. ``As far as the 
Cheyenne are concerned, the Dawson site was the main camp area of 
Chief Black Kettle when they were attacked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tabor is not so sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even nowadays you don't camp with the wind at your face. ...  
The way the bluffs are established (at the Dawson site) the camp 
would have been in the open. 
</P>
<P>
	``The site we located is south. I visited that location and  
there are bluffs that would block the north wind, plenty of 
vegetation and water available,'' Tabor said. He has asked the park 
service to check that site. 
</P>
<P>
	Periodic flooding has washed away evidence over the last  
century, but searchers are hoping to find tools, bone fragments or 
other relics by using core samples, maps, metal detectors and other 
methods. The search committee -- Tabor, Cometsevah, Park Service 
coordinator Rick Frost and representatives of the Northern 
Cheyenne, Northern Arapaho, landowners and the Colorado Historical 
Society -- must report to Congress by August 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabor said the final determination will be made by the old ways.  
</P>
<P>
	``We usually listen to the wind and watch the animals. There is  
a lot of eagle sightings there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Native Americans believe spirits come and visit'' their death  
site, ``especially when there's been sudden, unexpected or untimely 
deaths. The spirits are not ready to rest. The creator has a time 
for each of us. There is still a lot of unrest.''

<HEADLINE> China Businessmen Want Better Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- They were periodically bankrupted and persecuted  
after the Communists took power in 1949, but China's capitalists 
are rising in status thanks to economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Drawing on their growing economic and political clout, private  
entrepreneurs have been lobbying for better legal protections, and 
they appear to be succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The National People's Congress is expected to approve an  
amendment to the constitution enshrining the rights of private 
business when it convenes its annual two-week session on March 5. 
</P>
<P>
	By turns praised for showing initiative and excoriated for  
becoming wealthy, entrepreneurs have until recently operated on the 
fringes of the economy, surviving on loans from family and friends 
and scrounging for niches not already taken by state industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps no one better exemplifies the precarious place of  
capitalists in Communist China than Mou Qizhong, the 57-year-old 
chairman of the trading company Land Economic Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Mou has careened between celebrity and calamity throughout his  
career. He learned early in life the hazards of doing business: His 
father, a former banker, was persecuted after the Communists' 1949 
victory and starved to death during the great famine of the early 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	During the tumultuous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when  
``capitalist roader'' was one of the worst epithets possible, Mou 
was jailed for criticizing ultraleftists then in power who had 
destroyed what little was left of private business. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced to death, but regained his freedom when  
political winds shifted in the late 1970s. He returned to his 
hometown, Wanxian, in the reform-minded southwestern province of 
Sichuan and opened a small shop that eventually grew into Land 
Economic Group. 
</P>
<P>
	China began allowing small private businesses in 1980, but those  
who dared to test the waters of entrepreneurship did so at their 
own peril. Police and local officials often seized their property 
and business licenses or charged them exorbitant and arbitrary 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mou was jailed again in 1983, charged with ``speculating,'' but  
was released a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving on to bigger projects, he won praise from the  
state-controlled news media for his creative moneymaking, such as a 
1989 swap of 500 freight car loads of factory surplus socks, shoes 
and other items for four Tu-154 Russian aircraft that netted Land 
Economic Group $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Mou, millions of entrepreneurs have found ways to make  
money on the margins of the state-dominated economy during two 
decades of economic restructuring. Most have tiny, family-run shops 
and street stalls. But others have built up substantial corporate 
empires, such as the Hope Group, a Sichuan-based animal feed 
conglomerate that is now China's biggest private company. 
</P>
<P>
	China's private sector now accounts for one-quarter of the  
country's total output of goods and services, according to 
government estimates. There are about 1 million registered private 
businesses employing 40 million workers. In addition, 28 million 
people are registered as self-employed. 
</P>
<P>
	Private businesses now are lauded for providing jobs for many of  
the millions of workers being laid off by defunct state factories 
and for nurturing high-tech industries and services. 
</P>
<P>
	The Communist Party acknowledged the increasing importance of  
private business during a September 1997 congress, when President 
Jiang Zemin gave a speech approving private takeovers of some state 
enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, state-owned banks have starved startups of financing, and  
bureaucrats banned them from direct foreign trade until this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need equal competition. State firms had more than 40 years.  
Now, attitudes need a period of transition,'' said Wu Yijian, 
president of Ginwa, a diversified private company in the central 
city of Xi'an. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading the campaign for better legal protection is Jing  
Shuping, chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and 
Commerce, the main representative of private business in China. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech last spring, the 80-year-old pre-revolutionary  
capitalist proposed amending the constitution to ensure ``equal and 
nondiscriminatory treatment for all enterprises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A petition signed by 30 members of the National People's  
Congress echoed his call for equal competition. 
</P>
<P>
	This March, the legislature is expected to approve a  
constitutional amendment acknowledging private business is ``an 
important component of the socialist market economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run Xinhua News Agency said another amendment before  
the congress reads: ``The country should protect the legitimate 
rights and interests of the self-employed and private enterprises 
and the country should also exercise guidance, supervision and 
management over them according to law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the increasingly business-friendly environment,  
Beijing's city government recently announced it would give 
preferential treatment to private businesses and encourage them to 
take stakes in state-owned firms through acquisitions, mergers, 
leases and equity holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the beginning of the year, 61 private companies, among  
them Hope Group, have been given the right to conduct their own 
exports and imports -- the first time private Chinese firms have 
been allowed to engage in foreign trade on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	While once-closed doors have been creaking open for other  
entrepreneurs, Mou's fortunes have taken another downturn. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he was stopped by immigration officials at Beijing  
airport and prevented from leaving the country pending resolution 
of various legal disputes. His company's internal newspaper, Land 
Economic Digest, likened that year to ``standing by a burning 
stove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Undaunted, Mou proclaimed in 1997 that Land intended to become  
one of the world's 10 biggest companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the era of Mou-style barter arrangements appears to be  
ending. A deal to lease channels on Russian satellite transmitters 
apparently failed. Mou's proposals for dynamiting a pass through 
the Himalayas to help draw humidity into arid northern China and 
for building a Sino-Russian version of Hong Kong in remote Siberia 
have come to naught. 
</P>
<P>
	According to state-run media reports, Mou is in police custody  
again. Police and other officials declined to comment on Mou's 
whereabouts or about his legal situation, but company executives 
say Land owes about $48 million in unpaid debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees at Land confirmed Mou had disappeared. They said staff  
were showing up at company headquarters in Beijing mainly in hopes 
of collecting overdue salaries.

<HEADLINE> Couch Seeks Advice from Manning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch, a strong  
candidate to be the first choice in the NFL draft, recently sought 
the advice of last year's top pick. 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, Couch has consulted with Indianapolis Colts  
quarterback Peyton Manning by telephone and in person at the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just told me there are going to be tough times early on,  
and be patient with it,'' Couch said Saturday at the NFL Scouting 
Combine. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning, a former All-American at Tennessee, has been a friend  
of Couch for several years. With the Colts, Manning started every 
game and was the only quarterback in the league to take every one 
of his team's offensive snaps. 
</P>
<P>
	While Manning set numerous rookie passing records, the Colts  
finished 3-13. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just be patient with it -- be yourself,'' Couch said Manning  
told him. ``Keep working through it, and you will overcome it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch and University of Texas running back Ricky Williams are  
considered the front-runners to be the No. 1 pick by the expansion 
Cleveland Browns in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch had a lengthy interview with Browns coach Chris Palmer on  
Friday night in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it went really well,'' Couch said. ``I got to meet  
Coach Palmer, sit down and talk with him a little bit. I thought it 
went great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without tipping their hand, the Browns have given indications  
they will select a quarterback with the first pick. Mainly because 
they hired a head coach who has groomed such established passers as 
Drew Bledsoe and Mark Brunell. And, in the expansion draft, 
Cleveland took one quarterback -- untested Scott Milanovich, 
formerly with Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``That looks pretty good that they are going to take a  
quarterback,'' Couch said. ``But you never know until April, and 
it's a long way between now and then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the combine, Couch took his physical and interviewed with  
teams. But he did not perform any drills. He has scheduled a March 
11 workout date at Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	There he hopes to convince the NFL that his arm is strong enough  
to throw the deep and out passes at the professional level. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, a native of Hyden, Ky., set national passing records in  
high school and confounded conventional wisdom by staying in-state 
for college, passing up scholarship offers from traditional powers 
like Florida, Tennessee and Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	After struggling his freshman season, Couch blossomed, throwing  
for 73 touchdowns and more than 8,500 yards over the last two 
seasons. He finished fourth in the balloting for this season's 
Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch says the fact he didn't throw many deep passes at Kentucky  
had to do with the offensive system, not a lack of arm strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it hurt me a little bit for what I'm going through now  
that people are doubting my arm strength because we didn't throw 
the ball down field a lot,'' he said. ``But that is all going to be 
over in a day when I have my workout.''

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Tax Cut To Benefit Rich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than half the benefits of the  
Republican-proposed 10 percent cut in all income tax rates would go 
to people who earn more than $100,000 a year, according to a 
nonpartisan congressional analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by the Joint Committee on Taxation was circulated by  
Democrats on Friday to bolster their claim that the proposal, 
introduced by House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, 
is tilted too heavily toward the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is an across-the-board tax cut, then the board must  
have a lot of knotholes in it,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., 
senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The analysis says that in 2001, the first full year the rate cut  
would be in effect, 52.5 percent of the dollars would go to 
taxpayers with incomes over $100,000. People making between $50,000 
and $100,000 would get almost 31 percent of the tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, 48 million taxpayers -- three-quarters of them  
earning less than $20,000 a year -- would get no tax cut. However, 
most of these people don't pay any federal income taxes now. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, the 8 percent of taxpayers with incomes above $100,000  
pay two-thirds of all income taxes, an average of $41,600 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of an anticipated budget surplus estimated at $2.6  
trillion over the next decade, Republicans argue it is appropriate 
to return a portion of the money in tax cuts to the people who paid 
it. They contend Democrats are engaging in political class warfare 
to portray the cut as skewed to the rich. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the Republican Party ought to be about the  
redistribution of wealth,'' Kasich said in a telephone interview 
Friday from Iowa, where he was exploring a bid for the 2000 GOP 
presidential nomination. ``Liberals are about the redistribution of 
wealth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich added that a broad tax cut would help the U.S. economy  
continue growing while preventing use of the surplus to create more 
government programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``People shouldn't be punished for working and trying to get  
ahead. They should be rewarded for it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats such as Rangel contend that a dollar means much  
more to the people on the lower income rungs and that targeted tax 
breaks reach them best. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also note that the working poor pay federal payroll  
taxes for Social Security and Medicare and deserve relief as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like these people do not exist to the Republicans,''  
Rangel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Joint Committee on Taxation analysis pegs the 10-year cost  
of Kasich's tax cut at $775.7 billion. President Clinton and GOP 
leaders have agreed that 62 percent of the surplus should be 
reserved until Social Security is saved, but the president opposes 
use of so large a chunk of the remainder for a broad tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans are also questioning the wisdom of pushing the  
10 percent tax rate cut, given Clinton's opposition and the charges 
that it benefits the wealthy. Many are pushing alternatives, such 
as relief from the marriage penalty, in which many two-earner 
couples pay more than if they were single. 
</P>
<P>
	The study indicates that 91.8 million taxpayers would see some  
tax reduction under the proposal, but 24.7 million would get less 
than the 10 percent promised. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 177,000 would actually see a tax increase, mainly  
because they would be subject to the alternative minimum tax 
intended to prevent taxpayers from escaping Uncle Sam because of 
deductions and credits.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Governor Calls for Lower Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York Gov. George Pataki urged Washington  
today to follow the example of Republican-led states that 
successfully have slashed taxes, reduced government bureaucracy and 
returned more power to their citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weekly GOP radio address, Pataki saluted the  
accomplishments of his fellow Republican governors, whose states 
now have more than two-thirds of the U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
	From New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman -- who cut income tax in  
her state by 30 percent -- to Gov. Tommy Thompson's success in 
slashing welfare rolls in Wisconsin, Republican leaders have helped 
preserve the freedoms of the individual, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But freedom is never more than a generation away from  
extinction,'' Pataki added, and cautioned against the tendency of 
big-government Democrats to expand their reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``As Republicans, as Americans, we must challenge the mind set  
of an administration which says that a handful of bureaucrats in a 
faraway capital can manage our lives and manage our money better 
than we can manage them ourselves,'' Pataki said. 
</P>
<P>
	As one example, he said the federal government has taxed working  
families beyond their means to finance more programs and bigger 
bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can freedom endure in a land where government seizes 48  
cents of every dollar earned?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his own state, Pataki said, he has worked to streamline  
bureaucracies by reducing the size of government by more than 
20,000 positions and even eliminating the state's Energy 
Department. New York taxpayers have reaped the benefits with 36 tax 
cuts, said the governor, whose name has been floated as a potential 
presidential candidate in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki said measures passed by congressional Republicans, such  
as welfare-overhaul legislation, have enabled state leaders to 
craft their own legislation and make dramatic improvements. In New 
York alone, he boasted of welfare rolls dropping by 640,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor called on Washington to continue passing power on  
to the states, by approving such measures as a Republican-favored 
``ed-flex'' bill. The proposal would let states that receive 
federal education aid to excuse themselves from regulations they 
consider burdensome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must return the government in Washington to its legitimate  
functions -- its limited function -- and turn the rest over to the 
states, the people, and the private sector where it can be done 
wiser and better,'' Pataki said.

<HEADLINE> Heisman Winner: I Should Be No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams doesn't  
know if he'll be the first pick in the NFL draft. But the 
recording-setting running back from Texas believes he should be. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say I'm the best, but there is no one better  
than me out there,'' Williams said Friday at the NFL Scouting 
Combine. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch are widely believed  
to be the expansion Cleveland Browns' top two prospects for the 
first overall pick in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the NCAA's all-time leading rusher with 6,279 yards,  
clearly wants to impress the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be on my knees doing this,'' Williams said, making a  
praying gesture. ``Once you get to the top of your game, and you go 
on to the next level, it is always an honor to be taken No. l.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Couch has all but campaigned for the Browns to  
take him first. Williams took exception to Couch's lobbying after 
arriving at the combine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have to campaign like that to be taken ... ,'' Williams  
said. ``Hopefully, my play and the way I carry myself speaks 
volumes for me. Hopefully, the Browns will see that and take me 
with the first pick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 NFL hopefuls will be participating in the combine  
before it ends Monday. The NFL supplies shorts, T-shirts, sweats 
and an itinerary packed with activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule includes medical exams, seminars, interviews with  
team personnel, written tests and drills in the RCA Dome that gauge 
their potential to play in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns Executive Vice President and Director Football Operations  
Dwight Clark said what happens at the combine will not sway the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the guys that are in the running are even  
working out here,'' Clark said. ``Their individual workouts will 
determine it. The running around, it's all fine. But we do most of 
our grading from the game tapes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he was measured at 5-foot-10, 244 pounds Friday.  
He plans on leaving Indianapolis on Saturday, and will not 
participate in any drills. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with being a football star, Williams plays baseball in the  
Texas Rangers organization. NFL teams are asking Williams about his 
baseball interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Football comes first,'' he said. ``Baseball is my hobby.  
Nobody is telling me not to play baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before meeting with officials from the Browns, Williams  
interviewed with coaches from the Kansas City Chiefs, New Orleans 
Saints, New York Giants and Indianapolis Colts.

<HEADLINE> Raiders May Move Yet Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis has  
indicated he wants to move his team again, the Los Angeles Times 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis recently met with Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown and told him  
city and county officials have not delivered sellout crowds since 
the team moved back to Oakland in 1995 after a dozen years in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city would very much like to keep the team in Oakland,''  
mayoral spokeswoman Stacey Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said Davis indicated to the mayor ``he may simply move  
on,'' which the team believes it has the right to do. 
</P>
<P>
	To move, the Raiders simply must give notice within 90 days of  
the Super Bowl and agree to pay a $500,000 termination fee, Raiders 
attorney Joseph Alioto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials did not return a message left Saturday by The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	R.D. Hubbard, chairman of Hollywood Park, which wooed the  
Raiders in 1995, said he is interested in negotiating if Davis is 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has signaled it will award an expansion team next month,  
either to Los Angeles or Houston. The team would begin play in 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	At NFL owners' meetings earlier this week in Atlanta, NFL  
commissioner Paul Tagliabue said, ``I don't see the Raiders' 
situation as a factor in Los Angeles. The Raiders have a long-term 
arrangement in Oakland, and I think our priority would be to make 
that work up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland and Alameda County officials brought suit against the  
Raiders in 1997, accusing the Raiders of threatening to break the 
16-year lease they signed in 1995 and blocking the sale of the 
Oakland Coliseum's naming rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders responded that the city and county fraudulently  
promised sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Raiders returned to Oakland, local officials said the  
deal posed no threat to taxpayers. Sagging ticket sales have led 
officials to project a $21 million bill for debt service and 
operating costs this year alone.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Sign Infielder Pat Meares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates on Saturday signed  
free-agent infielder Pat Meares, all but ensuring that Al Martin 
and Tony Womack will be traded to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Pirates did not formally disclose terms of the  
one-year deal, the Pirates had offered Meares a $1.5 million 
contract that he repeatedly spurned in hopes of landing a multiyear 
deal. The Pirates have said they would consider extending the 
contract at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates want Meares to play shortstop so they can move Mike  
Benjamin to his preferred position of second base and trade Womack 
and Martin to the Diamondbacks for outfielder Bernard Gilkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares, who drove in 70 runs last season for Minnesota, also had  
two other suitors: Anaheim, which offered $750,000, and Cincinnati, 
which offered $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona trade was contingent upon the Pirates signing  
Meares, who made $2.5 million with Minnesota last season but was 
not tendered a 1999 contract.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Speaks at NAACP Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asked civil rights leaders  
Friday night to support his education and neighborhood investment 
initiatives, saying they would help close the gaps in opportunity 
and give all Americans a ``chance to live their dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, helping the NAACP celebrate its 90th anniversary,  
warned against falling into the lull of economic prosperity or 
becoming too complacent with the gains already made in furthering 
equality for all. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a lot better shape than we used to be in, but we're  
nowhere near where we ought to be,'' Clinton told the annual 
meeting of the nation's largest civil rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
	As evidence that lingering racial inequality, Clinton pointed to  
incidents of qualified African-Americans being turned away for home 
loans or of being stopped in their cars without cause. He lamented 
the state of African-American children in failing schools, who are 
blocked from reaching their full potential. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been successes, such as decreased crime in  
neighborhoods and more educational opportunities, ``but it takes 
time to get it all fixed,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the nation's current prosperity provides the best  
backdrop to push plans aimed at ending racial and ethnic 
disparities. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting his education initiatives, Clinton said ending  
social promotion, hiring new teachers and modernizing classrooms 
would help give students of all backgrounds the chance to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also asked for support in pushing through a plan he  
touted on Wall Street last month aimed at spurring $15 billion in 
private investment in neglected urban and rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that some neighborhoods have not had enjoyed the fruits  
of the booming economy, Clinton said his plan would encourage 
corporations and investment groups to reach out to untapped 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	If the country doesn't do it now, ``we will never get around to  
doing the job,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Julian Bond, president of the National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People, praised Clinton for his commitment 
to civil rights and his support for affirmative action and 
increased trade with Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	To the cheers of the 350 people gathered at the dinner, Bond  
also credited Clinton for being well-versed in song. 
</P>
<P>
	``This president can sing hymns,'' said Bond. ``And he doesn't  
need the hymn book.''

Friday night to support his education and neighborhood investment 
initiatives, saying they would help close the gaps in opportunity 
and give all Americans a ``chance to live their dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, helping the NAACP celebrate its 90th anniversary,  
warned against falling into the lull of economic prosperity or 
becoming too complacent with the gains already made in furthering 
equality for all. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a lot better shape than we used to be in, but we're  
nowhere near where we ought to be,'' Clinton told the annual 
meeting of the nation's largest civil rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
	As evidence that lingering racial inequality, Clinton pointed to  
incidents of qualified African-Americans being turned away for home 
loans or of being stopped in their cars without cause. He lamented 
the state of African-American children in failing schools, who are 
blocked from reaching their full potential. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been successes, such as decreased crime in  
neighborhoods and more educational opportunities, ``but it takes 
time to get it all fixed,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the nation's current prosperity provides the best  
backdrop to push plans aimed at ending racial and ethnic 
disparities. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting his education initiatives, Clinton said ending  
social promotion, hiring new teachers and modernizing classrooms 
would help give students of all backgrounds the chance to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also asked for support in pushing through a plan he  
touted on Wall Street last month aimed at spurring $15 billion in 
private investment in neglected urban and rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that some neighborhoods have not had enjoyed the fruits  
of the booming economy, Clinton said his plan would encourage 
corporations and investment groups to reach out to untapped 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	If the country doesn't do it now, ``we will never get around to  
doing the job,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Julian Bond, president of the National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People, praised Clinton for his commitment 
to civil rights and his support for affirmative action and 
increased trade with Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	To the cheers of the 350 people gathered at the dinner, Bond  
also credited Clinton for being well-versed in song. 
</P>
<P>
	``This president can sing hymns,'' said Bond. ``And he doesn't  
need the hymn book.''

<HEADLINE> Finance Leaders Fight Global Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Finance officials from the world's richest  
nations met in Bonn today to try to find ways to prevent economic 
crises like the ones that have swept across Asia, Russia and 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, the host of today's meeting of finance officials from  
the seven leading industrialized nations, was pushing an ambitious 
campaign to regulate exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is staunchly opposed by the United States.  
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine has proposed setting trading  
``bands'' for major currencies, which would call for central banks 
to buy and sell their own currency on the open market in order to 
limit fluctuations against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said this week that the  
idea of creating more stability between the dollar, the Japanese 
yen and the euro had ``enormous'' practical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	France appeared to be somewhere in between the two positions.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite disagreements, Rubin said the Group of Seven -- the  
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- 
was committed to overhauling the global financial architecture to 
prevent more currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Bonn meeting, Germany's influential central bank  
president Hans Tietmeyer was to present a report outlining ideas 
for policymakers to improve coordination in an effort to provide 
earlier warnings of developing crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants in Bonn are expected to approve the report, which  
the G-7 asked Tietmeyer to prepare last autumn. 
</P>
<P>
	The main recommendation calls for setting up an international  
forum of officials from governments and international financial 
institutions that would meet about twice a year, said officials who 
have seen the report. The forum would be created under the auspices 
of the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland, a 
coordination body for the world's major central banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposals to stabilize the dollar-euro exchange rate are also on  
the agenda. The single European currency has weakened to 1.11 to 
the dollar from 1.1776 after being launched Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also were discussing debt relief for poor countries,  
which is supported by the new center-left German government, as 
well as the United States and Britain. Officials were to consider a 
proposal for the International Monetary Fund to finance debt relief 
by selling part of its gold reserves.

                          *Curtis Carlson    	
</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Curtis Carlson, who started with a $55 loan  
during the Great Depression and built it into the giant Carlson 
Companies Inc. that included Radisson Hotels Worldwide, died 
Friday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, with 147,000 employees, also includes Carlson  
Marketing Group, Carlson Wagonlit Travel franchises, A.T. Mays 
travel agencies, Country Inns and Suites, Radisson Seven Seas 
Cruises, and TGI Friday's and Italianni's restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson started with the Gold Bond Stamp Co. and built it into  
Carlson Companies with $7.8 billion in annual revenue in 1998. The 
Carlson name was worth another $14.2 billion in annual revenue to 
franchises and other businesses licensed by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1938 to 1978, Gold Bond grew at a rate of 30 percent a  
year, never failing to meet sales goals set by the founder. During 
the post-World War II era when trading stamps were in their heyday, 
Gold Bond broke new ground by signing up such non-traditional 
accounts as rural movie theaters, feed mills, turkey hatcheries and 
mortuaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson turned over control of the company last year to his  
daughter, Marilyn Carlson Nelson. 

</P>

</P>
<P>
	LAUREL, Md. (AP) -- Richard ``Dickie'' Dutrow, the Maryland horse  
trainer who worked with such winners as King's Swan and Lite the 
Fuse, died Friday of cancer. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	He came into prominence in the early 1970s by winning four  
consecutive training titles at Laurel Park and Pimlico Race Course. 
Dutrow set what was then a record in 1975 by training 352 winners, 
Laurel Park said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutrow moved his training operation to New York in 1984,  
training several stakes winners, including King's Swan, who retired 
with earnings of almost $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Dutrow relocated his stable to Maryland, where he won  
58 more races on the circuit. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Kurt Eissler    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kurt Eissler, the founder and former director of  
the Sigmund Freud Archives, died Wednesday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Eissler was relatively unknown outside of professional circles  
but by the 1980s had collected thousands of tapes, letters and 
papers for the Sigmund Freud Archives, which he founded with other 
psychoanalysts after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	A staunch defender of Freud's theories, Eissler's papers covered  
topics including the treatment of schizophrenics and delinquents, 
and he wrote many books within his field and on Freudian history. 
Among them are ``The Psychiatrist and the Dying Patient'' (1955) 
and ``Talent and Genius,'' about Viktor Tausk, Freud's troubled 
student (1971). 
</P>
<P>
	His intense interest in Freud led to a friendship with Sanskrit  
scholar and psychoanalyst Jeffrey Mousaieff Masson, the man Eissler 
handpicked to succeed him as director of the Freud archives. That 
friendship ended when Masson criticized Freud as having moved away 
from reality and opined that Freudian psychoanalysis had come to a 
dead halt. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend of Eissler remembered him as being disappointed by  
Masson, because he had not found a person who understood Freud the 
way he did to succeed him as director of the archives. 

</P>
<P>
                         *Andreas Feininger    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andreas Feininger, a pioneering photographer  
known for his richly detailed images of New York City featured in 
Life magazine in the 1940s, died Thursday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Paris and raised in Germany, Feininger moved in 1939 to  
the United States where he worked as a free-lance photographer with 
the Black Star Picture Agency. His clients soon included Life, and 
he joined its staff in 1943. From then until he left in 1962, he 
completed 346 assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	His renowned photographs of the New York skyline and of the  
streets and sidewalks of mid-Manhattan caught in rush-hour gridlock 
first appeared in the magazine, exhibiting experimental techniques 
and equipment Feininger devised and perfected. 
</P>
<P>
	The author of more than 30 books, Feininger's private  
photographs focused on the form of neutral objects, like feathers, 
bones and shells. 
</P>
<P>
	His work has been shown throughout the country. Most recently he  
chose 80 of his favorite photographs from his 60-year career for a 
retrospective that has toured Europe since 1997.

<P>
                            *Glenn Flint

<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Minn. (AP) -- Glenn Flint, a pioneer in TV news in  
Fargo, N.D., and later an executive of KCMT-TV, died Wednesday from 
complications of cancer treatment. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Flint worked at WDAY radio in Fargo as a member of the station  
orchestra while attending Moorhead State. In 1949, he was hired as 
the station's news director. When WDAY added television in 1953, 
Flint became its first news anchor and was one of its first news 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, he became an administrative assistant to North  
Dakota Sen. Milton Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Flint returned to broadcasting in 1958 as general manager and  
vice president of KCMT-TV in Alexandria. 
</P>
<P>
	He was past president of the Minnesota Broadcasters Association  
and the Northwest Radio-TV News Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Avis Swanson Flint, and four  
children.

                          *Teruo Kawamoto    	
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Teruo Kawamoto, who fought for people sickened by  
mercury poisoning in Japan, has died of liver cancer, a family 
member said Friday. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Kawamoto headed a group of victims of Minamata disease, which  
resulted from tons of mercury being dumped into the sea surrounding 
the town from 1932 into the '60s. Hundreds died and thousands were 
disabled by the disease, which caused nervous system damage in the 
victims and birth defects in their children. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kawamoto suffered from mercury poisoning, his death from  
cancer was not directly related to Minamata disease.

<P>
                        *James Kenneth McLean    	
</P>
<P>
	POINT CLEAR, Ala. (AP) -- James Kenneth McLean, a pioneer in the  
creation of containerized shipping, died Wednesday at 80. 
</P>
<P>
	McLean built McLean Trucking Co. from the ground up with his  
brother and sister during the 1940s. By 1955, the McLeans had moved 
to Mobile to purchase Waterman Steamship Co. and its 
then-subsidiary, Pan-Atlantic Steamship Co. 
</P>
<P>
	While shipping goods to the Far East, the Mediterranean, Pacific  
ports and Northern Europe, the McLeans had the idea of outfitting 
steamships to carry tractor-trailer containers. They converted 
ships with what they called ``cells'' -- holding bays for hundreds 
of truck containers onboard each vessel. The containers, once 
off-loaded, could be shipped over land by trucks or trains. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his many business interests, McLean owned the Grand  
Hotel, a tranquil resort near Point Clear on the eastern shore of 
Mobile Bay, from 1966 to 1981. He most recently was chairman of the 
Corporation of Magnolia Trace Inc., a real estate development 
company.

                          *Geoffrey Moore    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Geoffrey Moore, a writer and academic who was  
instrumental in pioneering American studies as a discipline in 
British universities, died Feb. 5. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1940s, he accepted an invitation to teach English  
literature at the University of Wisconsin. It was there he became 
captivated with American lifestyle and culture. 
</P>
<P>
	He later moved to Tulane University in New Orleans for four  
years. In New Orleans, he produced a radio program that put him in 
touch with writers, including a young Gore Vidal. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore returned to Britain in 1952 as an advocate of American  
literature, and the years following were central in his career. He 
worked as a producer for the British Broadcasting Corp., wrote for 
the Times Literary Supplement and edited the first of his 
influential anthologies of American writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore founded the Department of American Studies at the  
University of Hull, which is the longest surviving program of its 
type in Britain.

</P>
<P>
	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Norman Roth, an award-winning  
interior designer, died of heart failure Wednesday. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norman Roth &AMP; Associates design studio primarily decorated  
homes in the San Francisco Bay area but had clients as far away as 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth also did the interior design for the Napa Valley Wine  
Train, a popular restored set of vintage Pullman carriages 
featuring polished woods, etched glass, and velveteen high-backed 
chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth was a president of the West Coast chapter of the National  
Society of Interior Designers, which in 1990 honored him with its 
Designer Excellence Award.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Skiing Postponed by Rain </HEADLINE>

<P>
	GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) -- Warm weather and drizzle  
led to the postponement of Saturday's super-G World Cup race. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions also led to a downhill being canceled.  
</P>
<P>
	Organizers were doubtful that the temperatures would drop enough  
to hold the super-G Sunday as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather spoiled a showdown between Norway's Lasse Kjus and  
Austria's Hermann Maier, the circuit's two dominant skiers, who are 
battling for the overall World Cup title. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ex-Ukraine PM Detained by U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ukraine wants the United States to return former  
Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko, who it says is trying to escape 
being prosecuted for allegedly stealing $2.1 million from his own 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazarenko was being detained Saturday by immigration officials  
after trying to enter the country with an invalid visa the day 
before, said Yurii Schkuremko, vice consul of the Ukrainian Mission 
to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazarenko is suspected of large-scale corruption and  
embezzlement, and an arrest warrant was issued last week for him by 
Ukraine's chief prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to meet with Ukrainian diplomats in New York City and  
apparently planned to appeal for political asylum, the vice consul 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An embassy official in Washington D.C. told The Associated Press  
the Ukranian government was appealing to the U.S. State Department 
for Lazarenko's return. The State Department could not immediately 
confirm the request. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Immigration officials would neither confirm nor deny  
Lazarenko was in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, parliament stripped Lazarenko of his legislative  
immunity, clearing the way for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazarenko, 45, is suspected of stealing $2.1 million of  
government money and illegally stashing about $4 million in a Swiss 
bank between 1993 and 1997. He was prime minister from 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
	He left Ukraine two days before the parliament vote on a  
chartered plane, and said in a letter released in parliament 
Wednesday that he was in a Greek hospital recuperating from a 
``sudden heart attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Ukrainian embassy in Greece later said it had no  
information about Lazarenko's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mykhailo Potebenko, the chief prosecutor in Ukraine, said Friday  
that Lazarenko's family is in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Roger Clemens whisked in to Yankees camp like a celebrity, while  
Orel Hershiser and Pat Meares finally found homes Saturday for the 
upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameras whirred and fans craned their necks to get a glimpse of  
the baseball's only five-time Cy Young Award winner in his first 
day in Yankees pinstripes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans lined a walkway stretching across nearby Dale Mabry Highway  
to Legends Field, while others scrambled for spots along stadium 
railing to watch Clemens throw 59 pitches in 13 minutes to catcher 
Joe Girardi in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to get the circus out of the way and get on with  
business,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``He can't be anonymous. I'm 
just glad to see he's wearing our uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees acquired the 36-year-old right-hander in a stunning  
trade that sent pitchers David Wells and Graeme Lloyd, and 
infielder Homer Bush to the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens was 20-6 with a 2.65 ERA in 1998, leading the American  
League in wins, strikeouts and ERA for the second straight season. 
He won the Cy Young Award both years, giving him a record five -- 
one more than Yankees pitchers have won in team history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just real exciting to walk in and be a part of the  
tradition ... I feel very fortunate,'' Clemens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares, the free-agent shortstop who has spent his six-year  
career with Minnesota, agreed to a one-year contract with the 
Pirates worth $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Meares' signing apparently clears the way for the Pirates to  
trade second baseman Tony Womack and outfielder Al Martin to 
Arizona for outfielder Bernard Gilkey and $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just waiting to get approval,'' Arizona owner Jerry  
Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner's office must approve the plan to pay Gilkey's  
deferred salary as he has a $9 million annuity in his contract that 
will eventually pay him $25 million over 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares, 30, became a free agent in December, when Minnesota  
declined to tender him a contract. He made $2.5 million last 
season, hitting .260 with nine home runs and 70 RBIs in 149 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing about Pat Meares is he's been a  
consistent major league shortstop for a number of years,'' Pirates 
GM Cam Bonifay said. ``You know what you're going to get with him 
year in and year out, solid defensive play and decent offensive 
production for a middle infielder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser, 40, signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland  
Indians, adding depth to their pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander spent last season with the San Francisco  
Giants, posting a record of 11-10 with a 4.41 ERA in 34 starts. 
Before that, he pitched three seasons in Cleveland, compiling a 
record of 45-21. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have a job. He'll have to compete for one,''  
Indians GM John Hart said. ``But this gives us some protection and 
some depth for our staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other baseball news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Kerry Wood began his second season with one goal in mind:  
finishing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to stay healthy and finish the season. I'm 0-1 trying  
to finish the season,'' the Cubs' right-hander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood's rookie season was full of memorable numbers. Thirteen  
wins, 233 strikeouts, including a major league record-tying 20 in a 
single game when he was just 20 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	But he missed the final month of last season because of a  
sprained ligament in his pitching elbow, before returning to pitch 
in Game 3 of the playoffs against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, who pitched 166 2-3 innings last season -- 52 more than his  
previous high in the minors -- has been answering questions about 
his arm since last August. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just knew I was OK,'' he said. ``I'm the only person in the  
world who knows my body and what my arm feels like. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was really concerned about it, it probably would have  
gotten to me. I wasn't worried about it, I knew it would be OK and 
that's how I went about handling it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Colorado Rockies owner Jerry McMorris met with star Larry  
Walker one day after Walker expressed concern about getting a 
contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	The face-to-face meeting helped alleviate some of the anxiety,  
but McMorris admitted the Rockies are far from reaching a contract 
extension with the reigning NL batting champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what they want,'' McMorris said. ``We've had  
inferences of what they want, but we've never had an official offer 
that Larry would sign. We're kind of negotiating with ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Owners won the final two salary arbitration cases of the year,  
finishing with an overwhelming 9-2 advantage over players. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore catcher Charles Johnson, who won in arbitration in  
1998, will get a $300,000 raise to $3.6 million instead of his 
request for $5.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota outfielder Matt Lawton, who had asked for an 11-fold  
increase from $215,000 to $2.4 million, will instead get the team's 
offer of $1.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Fishermen Worry About Oregon Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- For the 5,000 people who work in the  
beleaguered Coos Bay fishing industry, the spill of fuel oil from a 
grounded freighter is just the latest bad news. 
</P>
<P>
	The richest oyster beds in Oregon have been shut down because of  
the spill of 70,000 gallons of molasses-like bunker oil. Regulators 
could decide the oyster is an indicator of ocean health and move to 
shut down the remaining fisheries, including crab and bottom fish. 
</P>
<P>
	The grounding of the New Carissa comes on the heels of a  
disastrous year for fisherman, who were hit hard by federal 
restrictions on what they can catch. And then there was last 
summer's tuna glut, when local fishermen filled their boats only to 
find a market flooded by Asian fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talk about adding insult to injury,'' said Onno Husing,  
director of a Newport-based Oregon Coastal Zone Management 
Association. ``That's what the New Carissa is. It's like God, 
what's next?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ocean Beauty fish processing plant used to be busy with  
trawlers unloading their catch. Now it's silent, shut down a year 
ago. The nearby Hallmark Fisheries facility employs only a third of 
the people it did five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	From his window, Hallmark manager Scott Adams can see mountains  
of oyster shells, evidence of an industry that is one of the few 
bright spots in the Coos Bay economic picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past dozen years, the Coos Bay oyster beds have  
quadrupled in size to 1,240 acres. They began supplying markets in 
Florence to Gold Beach, and then to San Francisco and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the New Carissa went aground Feb. 4 and fuel has seeped  
into the water, oyster shuckers, washers, processors and sales 
clerks have been sent home. Nobody knows exactly when they'll be 
called back. 
</P>
<P>
	Oysters consume microscopic plants, which they filter from the  
water at high tide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything else in the water will also get filtered,'' said Jan  
Hodder, a marine biologist at the University of Oregon's marine 
laboratory here. 
</P>
<P>
	Oyster metabolic rates are slow; contaminants hang in their  
tissues for three to five weeks. Biologists worry about 
accumulations that don't kill the oyster but may cause ill effects 
both to the shellfish and to the people who eat them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to be sure there's no chronic impact,'' said Deb  
Cannon, the shellfish specialist at the state Agriculture 
Department, which closed down the oyster harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Qualman, who took over his father's 62-year-old business,  
Qualman Oyster Farms, said the spill could devastate his company 
and his crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't have them around without any income for very long,''  
he said. ``It doesn't take long without any income to fold.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Warns About Frozen Mamey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration warned  
consumers Saturday not to eat El Sembrador brand frozen mamey from 
Guatemala, or drinks made from the product, due to reports of 
typhoid fever in South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Mamey is a tropical fruit with pulp that is salmon pink to red  
and soft and smooth in texture. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from the FDA said it has determined that El  
Sembrador brand frozen mamey has been found either in the freezers 
of the homes of the victims or in the restaurants where some of the 
victims ate this product. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said its warning is based on epidemiological data in  
the South Florida cases that shows a strong link between eating 
frozen mamey and getting typhoid fever. It said the 13 reported 
illnesses so far -- all of which required hospitalization -- occurred 
between mid-December and early February, mostly in Hispanic 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection that causes persistent  
and high fever, abdominal cramps, loss of appetite and fatigue. It 
most often is acquired by eating contaminated food and drinking 
contaminated water or beverages.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Wood Ready for New Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood's rookie season was full of  
memorable numbers. Thirteen wins, 233 strikeouts, including a major 
league record-tying 20 in a single game when he was just 20 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
	There's another record he'll remember as well.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to stay healthy and finish the season. I'm 0-1 trying  
to finish the season,'' Wood said Saturday as pitchers and catchers 
reported to the Chicago Cubs' spring training complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood missed the final month of last season because of a sprained  
ligament in his pitching elbow. But he returned to pitch in Game 3 
of the first-round playoffs series against Atlanta, proving there 
was no major damage to his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	The NL Rookie of the Year began his off-season conditioning  
program earlier than usual and the elbow has passed all the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was running, throwing and lifting. That was the plan but  
unfortunately I got sick the last couple of weeks and haven't been 
able to do things. But now we're back on track,'' Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asthmatic bronchitis and pneumonia kept Wood too pooped to pitch  
or do much of anything for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was struggling. I had no energy, I was done. I was out of  
breath and was just sick, coughing up stuff. It was nasty,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, who pitched 166 2-3 innings last season -- 52 more than his  
previous high in the minors -- has been answering questions about 
his arm since last August. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just knew I was OK. I'm the only person in the world who  
knows my body and what my arm feels like. If I was really concerned 
about it, it probably would have gotten to me. I wasn't worried 
about it, I knew it would be OK and that's how I went about 
handling it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood admitted he might have to modify his ``slurve'' pitch, a  
combination of a slider and curve, because it puts a lot of stress 
on his arm. It was a pitch he used effectively to offset a 100 mph 
fastball that day in May he fanned 20 Houston Astros in just his 
fifth major league start. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wood doesn't think his innings or pitches will be limited  
because of the problems he had at the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see how the spring goes. I've been throwing and  
everything feels great. I've even been airing it out a bit and have 
had no problems,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect them to keep me from throwing a lot of innings.  
I got 160 last year so probably 10 or 15 more innings. I got to 
build up to that 200-inning mark,'' Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood's offseason didn't include any major commercial  
endorsements, despite his increasing notoriety. He's still more 
comfortable keeping a low profile, one reason he turned down talk 
show invitations last season after his 20-strikeout game. 
</P>
<P>
	He admits he's recognized more frequently in public now. He even  
has an extra locker stall in the Cubs' spring clubhouse to 
accommodate large boxes of fan mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood also says he's not given much thought to how much money he  
may be able to command someday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a `this is what I need or this is what I demand' type  
guy. Whatever I get, that's what I deserve,'' Wood said, adding 
he'll allow his agents handle his financial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood did buy a home in the Phoenix area this winter and has been  
spending time getting it in shape. Just like his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he just wants to pitch and let that answer all the questions  
about his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in great shape a couple of weeks ago. I'm coming in  
probably a little under what I weighed in last spring,'' said the 
6-foot-5, 230-pound right-hander, who began last season in 
Triple-A. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more excited that I am nervous,'' he said. ``Last year I  
was just more nervous.''

<HEADLINE> Long-Lost Preserved Brain Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The preserved brain of Ishi, an American  
Indian known as ``the last wild man in America,'' has been found in 
a Smithsonian Institution warehouse more than eight decades after 
it vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	Methodical sleuthing by a pair of academics solved a mystery  
that may finally permit a proper burial of the last survivor of the 
Yahi Indian tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery, revealed Friday by the University of California  
at San Francisco, has electrified Northern California tribes who 
struggled for years to locate Ishi's remains. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put Ishi back together, to get his remains back will be  
something that people will feel good about,'' said Larry Myer, 
director of the state's Native American Heritage Commission. ``It 
will give us a sense of healing, a sense of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1911, Ishi wandered out of the foothills of the Sierra Nevada  
and into American legend. He had been hiding in the wilderness for 
years after the last of the Yahi were thought to have been killed 
by settlers or disease. 
</P>
<P>
	He became a nationwide sensation as a living example of ``the  
last wild man in America.'' Ishi lived in a museum at UCSF, giving 
demonstrations of American Indian life for throngs of visitors. He 
died of tuberculosis in 1916. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy was performed -- against Ishi's final wishes -- and his  
brain was removed. But scientists lost track of the brain, and 
Indian leaders refused to go through with a burial ceremony without 
it. Ishi's body was cremated and his ashes are stored in a cemetery 
in Colma, south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, administrators at UCSF asked historian Nancy  
Rockafellar to determine whether the brain was at the university. 
</P>
<P>
	She learned that Duke University anthropologist Orin Starn was  
researching a book on Ishi and told him about the autopsy. Starn 
found a file at the University of California at Berkeley that 
cataloged the transfer of Ishi's brain to the Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Starn confirmed the brain was being kept in a tank  
in Maryland by the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural 
History. It is one of nine American Indian brains and thousands of 
skeletons collected for research. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not uncommon to study brains in the early 20th  
century,'' Starn said. ``Some people thought that different races 
had different brain sizes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Smithsonian spokesman said Friday that the institution has  
been in touch with tribes in California's Butte County to discuss 
repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starn said he didn't think there any ``bad intent'' on the part  
of the institution, which apparently didn't know people were 
seeking the remains. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Ishi is important as a symbol a reminder of what  
happened to indigenous people during the white takeover and 
conquest,'' Starn said. ``He really was a victim of a holocaust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the place where Ishi lived his final years, Rockafellar said  
UCSF has an obligation to his memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``He captures your imagination,'' she said. ``His basic  
humanness is what shines through in these accounts of him left by 
the whites who knew him, his humanness and his resiliency.''

<HEADLINE> D-Backs, Pirates Near 3-Player Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks were waiting  
Saturday for approval from the commissioner's office of a trade 
that would send outfielder Bernard Gilkey to the Pittsburgh Pirates 
for infielder Tony Womack and outfielder Al Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, in the works for at least two weeks, was finalized  
Friday but was held up while the commissioner's office reviewed 
provisions that reportedly have the Diamondbacks paying a large 
portion of Gilkey's salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade was designed to give Arizona some much-needed speed  
and to clear up salary room for Pittsburgh to sign Pat Meares. 
</P>
<P>
	The free-agent shortstop, who has spent his entire six-year  
career with Minnesota, agreed to a one-year contract with the 
Pirates worth $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing of Meares put the Pirates over their projected  
player payroll of $23 million. The perception has been they must 
trade Womack, who will make $1.65 million this season, to get back 
under budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares, 30, became a free agent in December when Minnesota  
declined to tender him a contract. The Twins were fearful Meares' 
salary could reach as high as $3.5 million if he went to a salary 
arbitration hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares made $2.5 million last season as he hit .260 with nine  
home runs and 70 RBIs in 149 games. He broke into the major leagues 
with the Twins in 1993 and has a .265 lifetime batting average with 
41 homers and 303 RBIs in 742 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing about Pat Meares is he's been a  
consistent major-league shortstop for a number of years,'' Pirates 
general manager Cam Bonifay said. ``You know what you're going to 
get with him year in and year out, solid defensive play and decent 
offensive production for a middle infielder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meares' agent, Steve Comte, said eight teams had shown interest  
in his client. However, Meares reportedly had only two other firm 
offers -- one year and $1 million from Cincinnati and one year and 
$750,000 from Anaheim. The Reds and Angels both wanted Meares to 
move from shortstop to second base. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack, 30, a second baseman who likely would play right field  
for the Diamondbacks, has led the NL in stolen bases the last two 
seasons. He had 58 last year and 60 in 1997. The entire Arizona 
team had only 77 last season. The Diamondbacks' team leader with 22 
was Devon White, who has since left to sign with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack hit .282 last year and played in all but three games for  
the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who has pushed for a trade since the Pirates dealt for  
outfielders Brant Brown and Brian Giles, probably would be the top 
reserve outfielder for Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 31, had 20 steals last season and had a career best 38  
in 1996. He hit only .239 with 12 home runs last year, his lowest 
average in his seven big-league seasons, all with the Pirates. He 
hit a career-best .300 in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates want to shift Mike Benjamin to his preferred  
position of second base. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks reportedly agreed to pick up the $5 million  
difference between the $11 million Gilkey is owed over the 
remaining two years of his contract and the $6 million Martin is to 
get. Half of Gilkey's money is deferred. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilkey, 32, hit .248 in 29 games with the Diamondbacks last  
season after being acquired in the trade that sent Willie Blair and 
Jorge Fabregas to the New York Mets. Gilkey underwent laser eye 
surgery at the end of last season to correct a vision problem and 
he was hopeful the improved eyesight would help him return to his 
1996 form, when he hit .317 with 30 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks are expected to replace Gilkey in left field  
with Luis Gonzalez, obtained in the offseason in a trade that sent 
Karim Garcia to Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Newspapers Urged To Correct Errors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Newspapers can improve their credibility by  
correcting errors quickly and telling readers how stories are 
chosen and covered, an editor said Saturday during a roundtable 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people expect us to be perfect, but they expect  
us to be honest and straightforward,'' said Karen Baker, senior 
editor of The News Tribune of Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more newspapers are explaining how they make  
judgments, and that helps our credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Baker was among 10 journalists who took part in a discussion  
of media credibility. The Scripps Howard Foundation sponsored the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Panelists discussed national surveys that indicate many  
Americans have lost faith in newspapers and broadcast news outlets. 
Many people doubt the fairness and accuracy of news reports because 
they see obvious errors and simple misspellings, the surveys say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly we have problems,'' said Louis D. Boccardi, president  
and chief executive officer of The Associated Press. But he also 
said the United States has the most free, vibrant press in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people may be turned off by the level of news saturation,  
Boccardi said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flow of news has accelerated to the point where our  
audiences are having trouble dealing with it,'' he said. ``I think 
that's reflected somewhere in those numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Woodruff, a CNN anchor who moderated the discussion, said  
every newsroom needs to have safeguards to ensure accuracy and 
fairness. CNN stepped up its awareness after retracting a report 
that the U.S. Army used chemical weapons on suspected deserters 
during the Vietnam War, she said.

<HEADLINE> Records Fall at Sydney Track Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Frankie Fredericks got a strong start  
to the year, winning the 100-meters in 9.94 seconds -- the fastest 
time ever on Australian soil -- at the Sydney Grand Prix today. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuning up for a rare outing at the world indoor championships  
next month, Fredericks got a fast start and ran away with a 
tailwind to better the 9.99 mark run by American Maurice Green in 
Sydney last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels really good. Every time you run under 10 seconds it's  
wonderful,'' Fredericks said. ``It means that everything in my 
preparation up to this point is going well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World 110-meter hurdles record holder Colin Jackson won his  
event in 13.30 seconds, beating compatriot Ross Baillie by .36 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt I ran very scratchy,'' Jackson said. ``That was  
probably worth .20 seconds. I made a few mistakes and after seeing 
what Frankie ran out there it would have been nice to have a smooth 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australian pole vaulter Emma George broke her own world record,  
clearing 15 feet, 1 inch on her first attempt after easy clearances 
on her two previous heights. 
</P>
<P>
	Her coach, Alex Parnov, told her she should stop after winning  
the meet with a 14-foot, 7-inch clearance but she asked for another 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said maybe we should stop now because you've got a  
competition next week,'' George said. ``I counted my jumps and I 
said can I have just a couple more, so it was nice to get it in 
just one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a 16th world record -- outdoors or indoors -- for George,  
who set the previous outdoor mark at 15 feet, 3/4 inch last March.

<HEADLINE> Ca. Hospital Admits 3 Baby Mix-Ups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORANGE, Calif. (AP) -- A hospital that accidentally sent a  
newborn boy home with the wrong mother last week has admitted three 
other baby mix-ups in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Joseph's Hospital sent a newborn home with the wrong mother  
Feb. 14 before officials discovered the error 90 minutes later. Two 
nurses were fired and officials assured the public this was the 
first time in the facility's 70-year history that it sent a baby 
home with the wrong family. 
</P>
<P>
	But a hospital official acknowledged Friday that three other  
minor mix-ups have occurred, although those incidents did not 
involve taking newborns home with the wrong family, the Los Angeles 
Times reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's different about the most recent incident is that it  
wasn't one error, it was a series of errors and the baby got 
discharged. That, clearly, we've never had any exposure to,'' said 
Katie Skelton, St. Joseph's vice president of patient care 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Department of Health Services has asked the Joint  
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations to look 
into the Feb. 14 baby switch.

<HEADLINE> Keating Endorses Bush for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, chairman of the  
Republican Governor's Association, on Saturday endorsed Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush for the Republican nomination in the 2000 
presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of very good people running. But George has been  
elected and re-elected the governor of a country. Texas is a 
country,'' Keating said during an appearance on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's done an excellent job as governor. He's been able to  
appeal to a cross-section of the people. He is a very, very good 
governor, very effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keating, who was in Washington for the winter meeting of the  
National Governor's Association, said he thought Elizabeth Dole, a 
potential presidential candidate, would be '' a very good running 
mate'' for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of people would be very good running mates.  
Elizabeth Dole is very bright, very knowledgeable, has a lot of 
national and international experience. But fortunately, we have a 
lot of good people,'' Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said Wednesday that he was ``warming to the task'' of  
running for president, but neither he nor Mrs. Dole had said they 
will be candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Other likely candidates for the GOP nomination include  
businessman Steve Forbes, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, 
Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, former Vice 
President Dan Quayle and social activist Gary Bauer.

<HEADLINE> Oil Pumped From Grounded Freighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- In an attempt to prevent further damage to  
a once pristine stretch of coast, salvage crews on Saturday began 
pumping gooey fuel oil from a grounded freighter into storage tanks 
on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation, which began about 6 p.m., was expected to last  
into early Sunday morning, said Frank Reed, spokesman for the joint 
operations center set up by the Coast Guard, federal and state 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is going smoothly,'' Reed said.  
</P>
<P>
	A smooth operation would be a welcome change for the salvage  
effort, which has been plagued by bad weather, broken equipment and 
environmentally-costly delays since the New Carissa grounded Feb. 4 
and began leaking oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest glitch came Friday, when after a day of hurried  
preparations, crews were too exhausted to begin pumping as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Huge pumps were set to drain the remaining 135,000 gallons of  
fuel oil off the Japanese-owned ship beginning at evening low tide. 
Some of the black oil has already fouled some of the most 
environmentally sensitive beaches in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Carissa ran aground about two miles north of the  
entrance to Coos Bay, where the captain had been waiting for a 
break in the weather to pick up a load of wood chips for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after the ship ran aground, a Navy explosives team set it  
afire with napalm in an attempt to consume the fuel on board. Heavy 
seas broke the fire-weakened hull in two later that night, but only 
half of the 400,000 gallons of oil aboard burned up. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 70,000 gallons have spilled, shutting down four oyster  
farms inside Coos Bay and washing up tar balls as far up the coast 
as the Siltcoos River, about 25 miles north.

<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Olympic bronze medalists Mark Grimmette  
and Brian Martin lead an attack on the 2002 Winter Olympic luge 
track Saturday night, and won their second straight national 
doubles title. 
</P>
<P>
	The event, sponsored by Bell Atlantic, took place on a clear,  
cold Wasatch night creating perfect conditions for lowering the 
standards the team set at a qualification series back in October. 
They repeated that effort in all three disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimmette and Martin, who also added to their resume this winter  
by winning the overall World Cup crown and a world championship 
bronze medal, shattered the doubles mark by .8 of a second with a 
44.149 seconds opening heat. 
</P>
<P>
	They came back with 44.341 for a two-heat total of 1 minute,  
28.490 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Thorpe and Gordy Sheer took the silver medal in 1:28.930  
after briefly holding the course record in the first run. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Anderson and Jon Laflam won bronze in 1:31.103.  
</P>
<P>
	Clay Ives was crowned men's national champion with two runs  
totaling 1:32.597. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Benshoof grabbed silver in 1:32.636 aided by a record  
46.244 second leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Heidt of Northport finished in 1:33.046 for the bronze  
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Becky Wilczak had a track-record 45.131 opening heat en route to  
victory in the women's event in 1:30.347. Brenna Margol was second 
in 1:30.649. Courtney Zabocki wound up third in 1:31.158.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Monitorin Hundley Closely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers are cautiously  
optimistic about catcher Todd Hundley's progress after the first 
two days of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundley batted .161 in 124 at-bats and spent most of the year in  
the outfield or on the disabled list last season after undergoing 
surgery on his right elbow. The Dodgers acquired him from the New 
York Mets during the offseason to take over as the starting 
catcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always have concern, but at this point I think he's looked  
fine,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers traded catcher Charles Johnson and outfielder Roger  
Cedeno to the New York Mets in exchange for Hundley and minor 
league pitcher Arnold Gooch. The Mets later traded Johnson to the 
Baltimore Orioles for reliever Armando Benitez. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundley isn't a Gold Glove fielder like Johnson, but the  
switch-hitter is expected to provide much more offense and add some 
balance to a lineup heavy with right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundley, 29, belted 41 home runs in 1996 to set National League  
single-season records for homers by a catcher and homers by a 
switch-hitter. He hit .273 with 30 homers and 86 RBIs the following 
year before slumping in limited duty last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's ready to play now,'' said Dodgers coach Rick Dempsey, who  
managed Hundley last season at triple-A Norfolk. ``He had his year 
off. I really think you're going to see him get back to where he 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's already proved his elbow is strong,'' Dempsey said. ``He  
proved it to me at the end of last season with two outstanding 
throws. He got it to second base in less than two seconds, and 
that's very acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundley is just happy to spend a season behind the plate after  
last year's disastrous move to left field. The Mets acquired former 
Dodger Mike Piazza to be their starting catcher midway through last 
season, so Hundley was forced to play the outfield after returning 
from the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too boring out there,'' Hundley said. ``I've got to be  
moving around. I can't just stand out there. My body probably hurt 
me more in the outfield than at catcher because my feet would be 
killing me.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Australian pitching prospect Luke Prokopec, who had 
experienced trouble getting his visa, arrived at Dodgertown on 
Saturday for the second day of camp. ... Closer Jeff Shaw continues 
to work out at his home in Washington Court House, Ohio, while his 
wife, Julie, prepares to deliver their third child. ... The rest of 
the team is scheduled to report to camp Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Vicar Wins Fountain of Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Vicar won a two-horse duel with Cat  
Thief to go wire-to-wire and win by a neck Saturday in the $200,000 
Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream Park, an early prep race for 
the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Shane Sellers, Vicar saw Cat Thief close within a head  
near the sixteenth pole but refused to give another inch as he 
covered the 1 1-16 miles in 1:45 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, trained by Carl Nafzger, paid $11.20, $6.20 and $4 for  
his third win in five career starts. Cat Thief, the D. Wayne 
Lukas-trained betting favorite, returned $4.80 and $3.40. Certain 
was three-quarters of a length farther behind to finish third and 
pay $4.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Grits'n Hard Toast, winner of the Holy Bull Stakes on Jan. 16 at  
Gulfstream, finished fourth. Each of the top four finishers ran 
strongly enough to warrant a run at next month's $750,000 Florida 
Derby, one of the key Kentucky Derby preps. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a measure of redemption for Vicar, who finished a  
disappointing fifth in the Holy Bull as the 6-5 favorite. Vicar was 
bumped at the start of that race and had a rough trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, starting from the No. 3 post, led by a length going to  
the first turn with Cat Thief on his outside and Certain third. Cat 
Thief moved within a half-length midway through the backstretch and 
the duo fought things out the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar still led by a half-length on the far turn before Cat  
Thief closed within a neck turning for home. But despite the urging 
of Pat Day, his jockey, Cat Thief never could move in front.

<HEADLINE> Five Die in Chemical Plant Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Five people were found dead Saturday in a  
chemical processing plant leveled by an explosion that blew out 
windows in nearby buildings and could be felt for miles. Fourteen 
people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The walls of the 25-foot high building at the Lehigh Valley  
Industrial Park collapsed inward and buckled after the explosion 
Friday night. Metal studs, concrete, glass and insulation flew 
through the air. A large chemical cloud rose above the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it could get much worse than what it was,'' said  
Capt. Dan Hartman, one of the first emergency workers to arrive at 
the scene. ``Debris was strewn more than 100 feet around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The building housed Concept Science Inc., a chemical processing  
company. State police were meeting with company executives, who 
weren't available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company was only operating about a week (in the building)  
so it's too early to make a judgment about the safety and propriety 
of the business operation there,'' Lt. Gov. Mark Schweiker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the five victims worked at Concept Sciences. The fifth  
worked in the building but not for that company. They were 
identified as: Anthony Mondello Sr., 55; his son Paul Mondello, 25; 
Paul Wanamaker, 43; Rubin Soto Sr., 52; and Terry Bowers, 48. The 
company Bowers worked for was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen people, including six rescue workers suffering from  
chemical burns and chest pains, were taken to hospitals. One person 
was in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe the explosion was triggered during the  
distillation of a volatile chemical, hydroxylamine, which Concept 
Science uses to make an etching solution for computer chips. 
Investigators also believe potassium hydroxide was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby residents were asked to stay in their homes for about two  
hours while authorities determined the chemicals spewed into the 
air from the explosion were not harmful. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 workers were decontaminated with a water and soap  
solution. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast at the industrial park, about 3 miles southwest of  
downtown Allentown and 50 miles north of Philadelphia, was felt and 
heard throughout the area for miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the street from the plant, Nichola Pierce, 24, was on the  
phone with her supervisor at Inter-Media Marketing when the 
explosion happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a flicker of light and a big bang and then the power  
went out,'' Mrs. Pierce said. ``You could actually feel the ceiling 
come down and go back up again. It felt like a plane had landed on 
our roof. That's what we thought it was.''
