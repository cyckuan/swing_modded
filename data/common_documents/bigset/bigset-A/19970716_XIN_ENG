<HEADLINE> Former Irish PM Haughey Apologizes at Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Former Irish Prime Minister Charles
Haughey apologized at a Dublin tribunal today for misleading an
official tribunal over the case of Haughey receiving a large sum
of cash from an Irish tycoon.
</P>
<P>
Haughey, who had been Irish prime minister between 1979 and
1992, told the tribunal that he was sorry for previously denying,
through his lawyers, that he had received 1.3 million Irish pounds
(about 2 million U.S. dollars) from Irish businessman Benn Dunne
between 1989 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why he had earlier denied the allegations,
71-year-old Haughey said that his financial affairs had been
handled by his former partner Des Traynor in an accountancy firm.
</P>
<P>
Haughey noted that Traynor, who was "widely regarded as a
financial expert of exceptional ability," had complete control of
his money since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"He saw it as his personal responsibility to ensure that I
would be free to devote my time and ability to public life and
that I would not be distracted from my political work by financial
concerns."
</P>
<P>
"Traynor had total discretion to act on my behalf without
reference to me. In hindsight, it is clear that I should have
involved myself to a greater degree in this regard," Haughey said.
</P>
<P>
The once most powerful Irish leader made a statement last week
through his legal team, admitting for the first time that he was
recipient of the cash.
</P>
<P>
Dunne, who had earler admitted that he gave Haughey the money
in the form of three bank drafts of about 70,000 pounds (about
112,000 dollars), repeatedly stressed that he never expected "any
favor or benefit" from the former Irish leader.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Leader Arrives in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition Labor Party
leader Ehud Barak arrived here today to start a visit to Egypt,
his first in this new capacity, the Egyptian Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa welcomed him at the
airport. In a statement upon arrival, Barak expressed appreciation
of Egypt's "pioneering and effective" role in the Mideast peace
process which took off 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Barak visited Cairo before when he was foreign minister in the
previous Labor government.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Barak is expected to discuss with
Egyptian officials on Egypt's fresh proposals to salvage the peace
process which came to a halt after Israel broke ground for the
construction of a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in
March.
</P>
<P>
Both U.S. and Egyptian efforts have so far failed to get the
two sides back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party decided two months ago to recognize the
Palestinians' right to self-determination and leave open the
possibility of establishing a Palestinian state, which has been
adamantly rejected by the Likud government.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who was elected on June 4 to succeed former Labor Party
leader Shimon Peres, is widely regarded as the only person that
could pose a strong challenge to Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Now the Labor is working to mobilize Israeli public opinion for
an early election which many hope will bring it back to power.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Cellular Network Achieves Fast Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Vodacom, one of South
Africa's two leading cellular network operators, has experienced
a fast growth, achieving its 10-year economic development
commitments in just three years.
</P>
<P>
Vodacom Managing Director Alan Knott-Craig said here today the
cellular network had surpassed its one billion Rand (about 222
million US Dollar) credit commitment to the government negotiated
as part of its cellular licence agreement.
</P>
<P>
Vodacom had undertaken to contribute one billion Rand in
development generating activity within 10 years, and deploy some
22,000 phones in underserviced areas within five years.
</P>
<P>
Knott-Craig said Vodacom had already earned more than one
billion Rand in development "credits" and was currently on target
with the rollout of community service telephones.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenal growth of the cellular industry in South Africa
would continue into the next century, and new cellular
connections could exceed fixed line connections as early as next
year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the cellular industry in South Africa
breached the one million subscriber mark in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications and Broadcasting Minister Jay Naidoo had
said the communications sector was set to become the driving
force of the South African economy, and formed the backbone of
the African technological "renaissance".

PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Jan Ullrich of Germany won
the 10th stage of the Tour de France and took the leader's yellow
jersey as the competition went to Arcalis, Andorra, on Tuesday.

</P>
<P>

Riis, who finished three minutes 22 seconds behind Ullrich to be
fifth in the stage.

The 23-year-old German unleashed a devastating attack 10
kilometers from the finish to break away from the others in the
leading pack.
</P>
<P>
Cedric Vasseur, who had worn the yellow jersey for five days,
made a series of attempts in vain to keep up with Ullrich.

<HEADLINE> Fashion Designer Versace Shot Dead in Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- World-renowned fashion designer
Gianni Versace was shot to death today outside his mansion on
Miami Beach, Florida, said reports from Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
Jackson Memorial Hospital said the Italian fashion designer,
50, was shot in the head at close range.
</P>
<P>
Police were seeking a white man aged about 25 who approached
Versace and shot him in the back of the head at the gates of the
mansion when Versace was returning to his home from a nearby
restaurant on the Ocean Drive strip.
</P>
<P>
Versace, who dressed some of the world's most beautiful women,
was not a permanent resident of Miami Beach but frequently stayed
at the white stone mansion, the most sumptuous private residence
in the area.
</P>
<P>
Along with Giorgio Armani, Versace was considered Italy's
leading ready-to-wear designer and a symbol of Italian fashion.
</P>
<P>
A native of Reggio Calabria in southern Italy, he began
designing ready-to-wear for other firms in 1972 in Milan. He
launched the Gianni Versace label with an autumn-winter collection
in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Besides women's and men's wear, his lines include children's
clothing, lingerie, beachwear, accessories and perfume. He also
designed fabrics, linens and chinaware. He gained fame in the
1980s.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Hold Elections Despite Opposition's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian government today
reiterated it will hold the parliamentary elections as scheduled
despite opposition's boycott threat.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a recent statement by opposition party the
Muslim Brotherhood to boycott the elections, a government
spokesman told Radio Jordan that the elections will be held as
scheduled in November no matter the Muslim Brotherhood
participates or not,
</P>
<P>
The opposition party`s general supervisor Abdul Majeed Thneibat
said Saturday that the Press and Publication Law, the
one-person-one-vote election system, the normalization of ties
with Israel and "the government`s measures to marginalize
political parties" were the main reasons behind the movement`s
decision to boycott the 1997 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Other opposition parties, including the biggest one the
Islamic Action Front, are also considering to go after the
Muslim Brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
The government spokesman stated that the government`s
committment to hold the elections on time is based on voluntary,
irreversible option of broadening the basis of constitutional
democracy as a way of political life in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The true committment to democracy of the government requires
the respect to the opinion of the minority, but this does not
contradict with making decision in accordance with the majority`s
opinion, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Publication and Press Law passed by the government in May
has forced most weekly tabloids to close down. The government
accused the publications of instigating sectarianism and
destructing the image of the state and its institutions.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that if these malfunctions were not addressed,
it would lead to the collapse of social values.
</P>
<P>
As to the one-person-one-vote election system, the spokesman
said that it was endorsed by a comfortable majority in
Parliament, which meant that it was not controversial as it
looked in the Muslim Botherhood`s statement.
</P>
<P>
As to Jordan`s peace treaty with Israel that was concluded in
1994, the spokesman said that the government does not see any link
between it and the call to stay away from the elections, because
the peace treaty was also approved by Parliament and went through
all its constitutional stages.
</P>
<P>
The government still believes that the Muslim Brotherhood is
a political spectrum in Jordan, but it should rethink its decision
to boycott the elections, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Puts Forth Suggestion for Curbing Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children
Fund (UNICEF), in a press release here today that 20-25 percent
of child deaths caused by malaria could be avoided if children
slept under bed-nets impregnated with insecticide.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that every year malaria causes the
deaths of one million children under five in Africa alone.
</P>
<P>
It said that dipping nets in the insecticide known as Pyrethroid
is more effective and practical than spraying the walls of the
home.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF is launching a major renewed effort to prevent
malaria and provide care for its victims.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF envisaged that every year the lives of 500,000
children in Africa will be saved by virtue of the new initiative
early in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The new initiative will support the global target of a 20
percent cut in malaria deaths by the year 2000 in at least 75
percent of affected countries, the release added.

<HEADLINE> Arab Journalists Urge UN to Halt Israeli Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Journalists Union today
called on the United Nations and international human rights
organizations to force Israel to halt its "criminal aggression"
and "punitive measures" in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian MENA news agency reported today that in a
statement, the union said the Israeli "criminal campaign" against
unarmed Palestinians and Palestinian journalists in particular is
aimed to thwart the uprisings against Israel's intransigent
policies.
</P>
<P>
Five Palestinian journalists employed by foreign news media
were among 16 Arabs wounded by Israeli troops in clashes in the
divided West Bank city of Hebron on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians accused the Israeli army of deliberately
shooting the journalists on duty, but the Israeli side denied the
charges.
</P>
<P>
The union called upon the International Journalists Union to
support it in its campaign for defending the freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
Violence and demonstrations have become a daily scene in the
occupied Palestinian territories since Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks collapsed after Israel broke ground on a Jewish settlement
in East Jerusalem four months ago.

<HEADLINE> Timber Industry's Turnover Increases in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's timber industry
registered an increase in turnover of 37.7 percent to 90 million
U.S. Dollars in the financial year ended in June.
</P>
<P>
Timber Producers Federation Chairman Bursary Mamvoto today
said the industry was undergoing further expansion involving huge
capital outlays.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, would result in a significant increase in the
production of sawn timber and in the demand for skilled
labor-force.
</P>
<P>
He said the drive for exports remained a strategic goal for
the industry which registered a 10 increase in exports this year.
</P>
<P>
Mamvoto said the area under commercial plantation in Zimbabwe
increased to 112,000 hectares this year after realizing a one
percent marginal increase.
</P>
<P>
He commended the government for giving the industry an
assurance that it would facilitate the expansion of its forestry
base.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the volume of timber log harvesting
increased by 6.3 percent to 1.32 million cubic meters, of which
three percent was exported as pulpwood. At the same time, sawn
timber production went up by 6.7 percent to 396,000 cubic meters.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official: Peace Would Be Finally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 15 (Xinhua) - A visiting top Palestinian official
said here today that the Palestinians will finally be able to
reach peace with Israel, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
"Eventually justice would prevail and Israel will be forced to
accept what it had signed", the political advisor to Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat, Mohammod Abbas, told the press after
holding talks with Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali
here today.
</P>
<P>
Abbas also renewed the Palestinians` demand that Israel stop
its hostile activities in the West Bank and urged it to resume
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Implementing peace accords is an international responsibility
since several countries were involved in its developments,
Abbas added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the political advisor, who arrived here
Monday on a short visit, briefed Majali on his recent meetings
with Israeli officials and his visits to some Arab countries as
part of the Palestinian efforts to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also exchanged views on the latest developments of
the peace process and means to overcome the hurdles in achieving
a just, lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jordan mediated the Hebron accord in January this year, under
which Israel promised to evacuate most areas of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But the peace process stalled Later in March when Israel began
to build Jewish settlements in the Arab East Jerusalem that
sparked violent protests of the Palestinians who take the city as
their future capital.

LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
said here today that European countries should use the powerful
economic card in urging Israel to stop building new settlements in
occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a London conference on Middle East, Arafat, who is
on a two-day visit to Britain, said, "Seventy percent of the
economy of Israel is with European countries and this card has not
been used until now."
</P>
<P>
"Why not? You have only to wave this economic card and they
will listen to you directly," Arafat said. "At least wave it."
</P>
<P>
Arafat also expressed his commitment to the Middle East peace
process by saying, "Peace is the strategic choice for the
Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
"We are in need of international support because peace is not
only our need, it is an Israeli need, an Arab need, an American
need, a European need and an international need," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Arafat held talks with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and both sides exchanged views on the Middle
East peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Concept for White Homeland Discussed in S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Liu Yegang)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) has held talks on possibility of
setting up an Afrikaner homeland with the rightwing Freedom
Front, ANC officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
They said the talks were successful, adding that ANC Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki and Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen
were leading the talks yesterday in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
"This is the start of a process, but not something in which
one can expect immediate answer, solutions or agreement," Freedom
Front chief whip Joseph Chiole said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Front's top policy structure, its Federal Council,
last year decided to negotiate with the ANC on a package of
proposals to give concrete efforts to the principle of setting up
the Afrikaner homeland in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Freedom Front officials said the party will be seeking
agreement in principle to the creation of an Afrikaner homeland,
or an ANC acceptance of an Afrikaner homeland as a solution to
the culture and political aspirations of the white community.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela said last year that he
was ready to accept the concept of Afrikaner homeland, but he
will discuss the matter with other political parties.
</P>
<P>
Chiole said yesterday the talks between Mbeki and Viljoen
started the drive for "Afrikaner self-determination".
</P>
<P>
Afrikaners are mostly descendants of the Dutch settlers who
set foot in South Africa in the 1650s.
</P>
<P>
Their leaders introduced apartheid in the country in 1948,
which was abolished with the all-race general elections in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Embarks on Five-year Housing Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The National Housing Construction
Trust, an affiliate of the Zimbabwe Government Employees Union
(ZIGEU), has embarked on a 336 million Zimbabwe Dollars (30.5
million U.S. Dollars) five-year plan to build 1,200 houses a
year.
</P>
<P>
ZIGEU Executive Director Witness Socks today said the trust
had targeted production of 100 houses a month countrywide to meet
demand for affordable accommodation by its 30,000 members.
</P>
<P>
"The trust wishes to embark on a five-year extensive housing
construction program in 30 points throughout the country and has
over 8,950 stands at different stages of construction," Socks
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the trust was seeking external funding to finance the
surveying and servicing of stands and construction of the houses.
</P>
<P>
"The five-year plan should see a minimum of 1,200 houses
constructed each year with a total of 6,000 houses completed in
five years," he added.
</P>
<P>
The houses will vary from medium, low cost and ultra low cost
with the majority falling within the low cost category, he said.

<HEADLINE> Busy Parents Blamed for Rising Numbers of Shy Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The number of people who consider
themselves shy has increased by 20 percent over the past 15 years
and the reason for that is nowadays children are neglected and
given too little time by their busy parents, according to a
psychology conference.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference on shyness at Cardiff University was
told Monday that the number of people growing into shy adults has
risen because their parents spend an average of only eight minutes
a day talking to them as they are too involved in their busy
lives.
</P>
<P>
The conference heard that parents' neglect of their children
comes at a vital time in their lives and most children become shy
when they reach adolescence, between 11 and 14, which are the
years when they need most help from their parents.
</P>
<P>
Studies in the early 1970s showed that 40 percent of adults
felt that shyness was affecting their behavior, but recent studies
put the figure at between 55 and 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
The conference, run by the British Psychological Society,
called on parents to find time for their children, because
otherwise, children are going to spend more and more of their time
alone in their bedrooms and they cannot acquire social skills to
enable them to relate to people.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the conference is Britain's first one on
shyness and is attended by 70 researchers from all over the world.

</P>
<P>
The index, used as a barometer of the performance of the
Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, the second largest in Africa, was riding
on a wave of bullish sentiment caused by hopes that Zimbabwe
could soon strike a deal with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and prospects of a firming dollar.

The IMF has announced it would resume key balance of
payments support suspended in September 1995 after it questioned

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Minister Confronts Parliament Grilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's parliament and
cabinet run into confrontation today as Deputy Prime Minister and
Financial Minister Naser Al-Roudhan fiercely fought back the
interpellation by liberal parliament members.
</P>
<P>
The parliament grilling was riddled with "gaps and faults, it
derailed from pertinence and is full of exaggeration, defamation
and false charges," Al-Roudhan said.
</P>
<P>
Three members of the Kuwaiti National Assembly staged an open
questioning against Al-Roudhan over alleged mismanagement,
irregularities in handling public funds and negligence.
</P>
<P>
The financial minister is now chairing the Kuwait Investment
Authority which manages the state's foreign investments of about
40 billion U.S. dollars, the Central Bank and the Kuwait Airways.
</P>
<P>
Those who initiated the grilling were aimed at "overthrowing
the government," retorted Al-Roudhan.
</P>
<P>
Insisting his hands were clean from any ill-gotten gains, he
said the grilling was "strange in its timing, circumstances,
content, subjects, language and objectives."
</P>
<P>
All the three parliament members took floor to question the
minister on a number of accusations, including his failure to
retrieve a sum of 25 million dollars deposited in a "Tunisian bank
suffering from financial problems."
</P>
<P>
They insisted that the interrogation motion, the first since
the election of the current parliament in October 1996, was
necessary for "it reflects the public opinion's keenness on
protecting public funds."
</P>
<P>
However, Kuwaiti Acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah earlier this month played
down the questioning, saying it was "nothing more than the
exercise of a constitutional right."
</P>
<P>
Twenty four lawmakers have filed 12 grilling motions in nearly
four decades since Kuwait exercises legislative democracy, leading
to the resignation of only one government minister.

<HEADLINE> Abnormal High Cholesterol Popular in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has the highest
incidence of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) in the world,
according to a survey by pharmaceutical laboratories in Cape
Town.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 120,000 South Africans have abnormal high
cholesterol and are in danger of developing serious and possibly
fatal heart disease.
</P>
<P>
"Yet of these, only 5,000 have been identified and only about
half of them are receiving treatment," the laboratories said in a
joint statement, noting that most of these sufferers were in the
Asian, Afrikaans and Jewish communities in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
They are the inheritors of a gene which prevents correct
processing of cholesterol, causing it to collect in the blood
stream, deposit on the walls of blood vessels, and lead to heart
attacks, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that a belief that only overweight
people will develop high blood cholesterol was not true, saying
many people with high cholesterol were slim, trim, fit and
followed a prudent diet.
</P>
<P>
High cholesterol is the major risk factor for heart disease, but it
is not as dangerous on its own as when it is associated with
other risk factors, such as being male, smoking, high blood
pressure and stress.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the condition is identified and managed adequately,
men tend to have heart attacks in their 30s and 40s, and women
have heart attacks in their 40s and 50s," medical workers warned.
</P>
<P>
The only way to control high cholesterol is drug therapy, they
said.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales in UK Expected to Increase in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The UK motor industry is looking
forward to a healthy increase in new car sales this August, helped
by cash windfalls from building societies converting to banks.
</P>
<P>
The all-time high for new car sales in August was back in the
long hot summer of 1989 when 500,112 units were registered.
Altogether 2.3 million cars were sold that year.
</P>
<P>
The recession which followed hit annual sales of new cars quite
hard, but there has been a steady rise since 1993, back up
towards the 2 million mark which was passed last year.
</P>
<P>
The motor industry is looking for sales of around 490,000 in
August, which should pass 2.1 million sales by the end of the
year, according to a forecast by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders Limited.
</P>
<P>
It also said this year could well be the last time that
customers wait up until midnight on August 1 for their new
registration letter because the "year identifier" might soon be a
thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
As a tradition, around one quarter of all sales are made in
August, which puts enormous strain on the supply chain to fulfill
customers' requirements exactly.
</P>
<P>
Very often the customer is forced to take the vehicle which is
available rather than the exact model wanted.
</P>
<P>
The UK motor industry agrees that the letter should change
twice a year on 1 March and 1 September starting in 1998. So look
out for `S' reg next spring and `T' reg in the autumn.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Government is looking at the proposal right now and
customers are waiting for the go ahead any day. If the system
receives the green light now, then car owners will start the new
run next March, and that will take customers to September 2001.
</P>
<P>
Historically the letter changed on 1 January which caused a
huge build-up in sales, so manufacturers proposed a year
identifier change to 1 June. The retailers wanted 1 October.
</P>
<P>
The government compromised and decreed 1 August, at the time it
was a month with few sales (typically 7 percent of annual sales).
The revised system has been in operation since 1967.

<HEADLINE> Statue of Egypt's Pharaoh Ramses II to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian archaeological
sub-committee decided today to return the statue of Ramsis II, one
of Egypt's greatest pharaohs, to its original home village in
Rahina, Giza, south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The selection of the resting place for the colossal was made
after months of heated debate and careful scientific research that
negated other two options, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The 125-tonne and 11.4-meter-high rosy granite statue was
unearthed in Rahina, the ancient Egyptian capital of Menf in 1888.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Rahina, an area free of pollution, is the
best possible choice for the statue, which has graced a Cairo
square bearing his name for 43 years.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the sanctuary could spare the status its present
daily sufferings of erosion, air pollution and the vibrations of
the metro operating underneath.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Culture Farouq Hosni, also head of the
Higher Antiquities Council, told reporters today that a
comprehensive plan will be implemented to develop Rahina into a
fully-equipped tourist and archeological resort.
</P>
<P>
Ramsis II, whose reign (1304-1237 BC) was the second longest in
Egyptian history, lived for 95 years. He had eight wives, 52 sons
and 48 daughters.

<HEADLINE> EU May Ban Importing Nile Perch From Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
granted Tanzania more time to improve the quality of the Lake
Victoria Nile Perch, otherwise may ban its imports in its member
states by February 28 next year.
</P>
<P>
Christian Herbin, the first counselor in the EU delegation in
Tanzania, told reporters here today that the EU Commission has
extended its decision on announcing the ban or continuing to
import the Nile Perch from July 1 this year to next February 28.
</P>
<P>
In April this year traces of Salmonella and pesticides were
detected in the Nile Perch in EU member states and this led to a
team of experts from EU to come to Tanzania and inspected four
fish processing plants at Mwanzan and Musoma in northwestern
Tanzania, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that exporters send the right Nile Perch or
else they will get huge loss if a container is detected at the
point of entry to have a bad product, it will be destroyed," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Herbin explained that since detection of poor quality Nile
Perch from Lake Victoria shared by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, EU
member states were allowed to individually deal directly with
exporting countries.

<P>
BONN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The German Defense Ministry said
today that Germany and the Unites States would sign an accord
later this year to complete the building of a joint air defense
unit in 1999 with a view to strengthening their post-cold war
military ties.
</P>
<P>
The US military presence in Europe has been declining since the
fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, with American forces
based in Europe reduced to about 100,000 now from 336,000.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Bonn is increasingly concerned over the threat of
short- and medium-range missiles which could be fired from the
Middle East at European targets.
</P>
<P>
"Besides the German, American and a small number of Dutch
systems, there are no further Patriot systems in the entire NATO
alliance," said the Defense Ministry statement. "This is the only
system which at present offers limited protection against tactical
ballistic missiles."
</P>
<P>
The first ever fully integrated German-American forces, modeled
on a 5,000-man Franco-German armored brigade, will comprise 500
troops armed with Patriot, Hawk and Roland air defense missile
systems.
</P>
<P>
The joint forces would be available for deployment with
international peacekeeping missions under the approval of both
sides, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said that commandership of the joint unit would
rotate every three years.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Government Releases Top Islamic Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Algerian government today
released the country's top Islamic leader, Abassi Madani, who was
the number one of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) before it was
outlawed in March 1992.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made by a military tribunal of Blida south of
Algiers, was announced early this morning, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Madani, 66, was arrested in June 1991 for launching an appeal
for general strike after the Algerian army canceled the results of
the second round of legislative elections, in which the FIS got
most of the votes. He was condemned to 12 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
The cancelation of election results triggered a war between
government forces and Islamic militants over the past six years,
in which at least 60,000 people were killed, according to
estimations made by Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Madani's release came one week after another key FIS leader,
Abderkader Hachani, was released from jail. It also coincided with
a wave of terrorist attacks in Algeria over the past five days, in
which 120 people were reportedly killed.
</P>
<P>
But some observers said that the release was both a clemency
from President Liamine Zeroual and an indication that Zeroual has
consolidated power after his supporters won an absolute majority
in the legislative elections on June 5.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the political scenery of Algeria today is totally
different from that six years ago: FIS's political network has
been completely dismantled and what remains of its leadership is
living in exile.

<HEADLINE> E. African NGOs dealing with AIDS Open Office in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Network of Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs) in East Africa region (ANNEA) dealing with
Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has opened an office
at Arusha in Northern Tanzania, which will cater for the region.
</P>
<P>
A networking official, Susan Malya told the Tanzania News
Agency at Arusha today that the role of the office will be to
coordinate the fight AIDS activities in the three east African
countries which are among the badly affected nations in Africa.
</P>
<P>
She said that ANNEA was founded in 1994 by 19 AIDS related
NGOs from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania to fill the gap of lack of
collaboration and coordination which have been the drawbacks to
the success of the NGOs ever since the organization has had no
permanent office.
</P>
<P>
According to the June 1997 Newsletter by the organization, the
region enjoys the existence of many NGOs formed to complement
government efforts to fight the AIDS scourge. The newsletter
entitled "ANNEA newsletter" reports that each of the three
countries had 42,000 AIDS cases so far.
</P>
<P>
While the first case in the region was reported in 1982, the
cumulative new infections according to the newsletter is very
alarming as it stands today.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's projection are 2.4 million HIV infected people,
800,000 AIDS cases and 450,000 to one million orphans by the year
2000, while Kenya projects to have 1.5 million HIV infected cases
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has reported a cumulative new HIV infection on 673,000
adults and 294,000 children below 15 years from 1993-1998.

<P>
OTTAWA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadians reported a median total
income of 18,900 Canadian dollars (13,800 US dollars) in 1995, up
400 dollars (292 US dollars) from 1994, Statistics Canada reported
today.
</P>
<P>
However, adjusting for inflation, "there was virtually no
change from a year earlier," the federal agency noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the gap between men and women narrowed slightly as
median total income fell for men and increased for women.
</P>
<P>
The national median for men declined marginally to 25,400
dollars (18,540 US dollars) in 1995 from 25,433 dollars (18,560 US
dollars) a year earlier, with inflation taken into account.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the median for women rose to 14,600 dollars
(10,660 US dollars) from 14,504 dollars (10,590 US dollars), a 0.7
percent increase compared with a gain of 4.0 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Total income for Canadians comprises employment income,
investment income, transfer payments, retirement savings and other
income.
</P>
<P>
Median income represents the middle point at which half the
incomes are above and half are below the median.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Junta Cabinet Sworn In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
FREETOWN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Eight secretaries of state of
the Sierra Leone junta took an oath for office Monday before
their military leader Major Johnny Paul Koroma here in the
capital#,state television reported today.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is headed by Koroma with Foday Sankoh as deputy
head of state. The latter has been the leader of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) who is detained in Nigeria under
unexplained circumstances.
</P>
<P>
All the secretaries of state or ministers were appointed by
Koroma last week.
</P>
<P>
Captain Solomon Musa, a one time chief secretary in the
military regime of Captain Valentine Strasser who left office in
1996, again becomes the chief secretary or prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The entire cabinet has six civilians and seven military
officers, two of whom are retired officials and five from the
people's army.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the cabinet secretariat said, the remaining
five secretaries of state will take their oath shortly.
</P>
<P>
The portfolio of foreign secretary goes to Paolo Bangura,
formerly Sierra Leonean ambassador to the United Nations while
the attorney general is Manley Spaine. Finance Secretary Joe
Amara Bangali has held a similar position under the civilian
government of Siaka Stevens in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Koromah told the cabinet members
that since they have accepted "a huge responsibility to serve the
nation at this crucial period, you cannot afford to fail."
</P>
<P>
The junta's Secretary General Colonel Abdul Sesay hailed the
occasion which "officially confirms the establishment of the
(military) government and ministers are now empowered to fulfil
their fullest responsibility."
</P>
<P>
Political observers analysed that the background of the new
ministers and their rich experiences will help the junta grapple
with many urgent tasks that need solutions quickly, which include
getting the country back to its economic track and embarking on
negotiations to return the country back to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
A Sierra Leone delegation headed by Solomon Musa is expected
to leave for Cote d'Ivoire on July 17 to start talks on the
formation of a broad based government that will take on board all
interested parties to end the current political impasse,
political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Major Victor King, the new secretary of state,
accused the ousted government headed by Tejan Kabbah of
"injustice, nepotism and mismanagement of state funds", which
consequently brought forth the May 25 takeover.
</P>
<P>
Addressing administrative staff today at the state house, he
blamed former President Kabbah for "neglecting his own military
forces by bringing in Nigerians to serve as bodyguards with a
monthly salary of 2,000 U.S Dollars, whereas Sierra Leonean
soldiers who have been in the war front, received a salary of 15
Dollars with only a bag of rice."
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 13 under-secretaries of state including Matilda
King, a women, were also sworn in.

ADDIS ABABA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- OAU chief Salim Ahmed Salim
today commended the cease-fire agreement signed on July 12
between President of the Republic of Congo Pascal Lissouba and
his predecessor Denis Sassou Nguesso.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Salim, Secretary General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), referred to the accord as
"an encouraging step in the search for a peaceful and lasting
solution to the crisis."
</P>

for the Great Lakes region, he said.
</P>
<P>
At this critical juncture in the peace efforts, Salim noted,
"I wish to solemnly appeal to all parties involved in the
conflict to fully commit themselves to a peaceful solution, to
put the unity and cohesion of their country beyond any other
consideration and to seize the opportunity offered to them by the
international mediation."
</P>
<P>
Salim also urged them to scrupulously observe the cease-fire
pact so as to spare the people of Brazzaville further suffering
and devastation and put an end to the ordeal they have been

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns Bosnian Serbs Against Revenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today warned the Bosnian Serbs not to retaliate for a recent
attack by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on
suspected Bosnian Serb war criminals.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before a White House meeting with
congressional leaders, Clinton said that any retaliation would be
a "grave mistake."
</P>
<P>
"They have no call to take any retaliatory action and it would
be a grave mistake to do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
During an operation last week, British soldiers of the alliance
arrested one Bosnian Serb and killed another. The two were charged
by the West with war crimes during the Bosnian civil war.
</P>
<P>
Since the swoop, tensions have been high on the Bosnian Serb
territories against international monitors.
</P>
<P>
A bomb exploded Sunday night, destroying a pick-up truck
outside offices belonging to the international monitors.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was worried about possible backlash from the
Bosnian Serbs, Clinton said, "I am concerned about it, of course I
am. But the representatives of the Serbs signed the Dayton
agreement."
</P>
<P>
"The Dayton agreement says that if someone is charged with a
war crime, they should be turned over for trial," Clinton added.

NEW YORK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Microsoft Corporation, the
largest computer software maker in the United States, announced
today the introduction of a test version of its Internet software
that will bring millions of new users to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The product's new features include what Micro officials are
calling "true Web integration," which is more closely linked to
the company's Windows 95 operating system, according to a report
of the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
The tested version will permit Internet content to be embedded
directly onto the basic control surface of the computer screen.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Promises New Air Safety Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- United States Vice President Al
Gore and transportation officials today promised new air-safety
measures, including the installation of 500 systems for checking
baggage for explosives.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how safe aviation is, we must make it even safer,
said Gore at a press conference at suburban Washington's Dulles
airport, where he received an updated catalogue of steps taken by
the National Aeroautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to tighten airline safety.
</P>
<P>
The action was taken shortly before the anniversary of the
crash of the Trans World Airlines (TWA) flight, which killed all
230 people aboard. The TWA 800 crash on last July 17 off New York
City was widely believed by an explosion that originated in a
nearly empty center fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said that by the end of
this year the FAA will finish work on new regulations requiring
smoke detectors and fire-extinguishing devices in the cargo and
baggage compartments of large jetliners.
</P>
<P>
He also promised hiring of 375 additional inspectors to
increase security oversight at airports nationwide and awarding of
contracts to purchase more than 480 trace-explosive detection
devices, plus some 20 automated dual energy X-ray machines.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the NASA Aviation Safety Program, a joint
initiative of NASA, the FAA, Defense Department and airline
industry, also showed new safety technologies.
</P>
<P>
The technologies include systems for finding cracks in aging
planes, for allowing pilots to navigate in near-zero visibility
conditions and for giving pilots advance weather information.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Hails Nigeria's Leadership in W. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Ambassador to Liberia
Joshua Iroha today said his country's efforts for security in
west Africa is just for leadership and should be viewed as
investment for benefits.
</P>
<P>
Whatever sacrifice Nigeria might have made to ensure normalcy
in the west African sub-region is a necessary price for
leadership, Iroha said in Monrovia, capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"No one could lead from behind and whoever is in front must
justify the prominence that position conferred on him," the envoy
said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Iroha did not elaborate on the sacrifice Nigeria has made but
observers noted it has some connections with the country's
contribution to the sub-region's peace-keeping operations
particularly in Liberia and Sierra Leone recently.
</P>
<P>
During the operation in Liberia in the past seven years,
Nigeria shouldered the bulk of billions of Dollars of financial
expenditure, materials and more than 10,000 peace-keeping troops.
</P>
<P>
The operation has resulted in the successful disarmament and
demobilization of Liberia's warring factions, paving the way for
the post-war elections in the tiny west African country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigeria-led west African peacekeeping force known as
ECOMOG is now in firm control of that country, providing a
favorable environment for a free and fair election scheduled for
July 19.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops were also sent to Sierra Leone in a bid to
restore the elected civilian government that was toppled in a
military coup on May 25.
</P>
<P>
Repeated fightings have been reported between ECOMOG troops
and soldiers loyal to Sierra Leone's military government, with
casualties from both sides.
</P>
<P>
If all this is related to Nigeria's sacrifice, "such a
sacrifice should be seen as an investment whose benefits might
come early or later," said Iroha.
</P>
<P>
As to what Nigeria can do to derive some benefits from a
country for which it has done so much, Iroha said Nigeria should
assist interested and suitable Nigerian outfits to go and operate
in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The success of such outfits would have a positive effect on
the Nigerian economy by enhancing its growth and contribution to
its prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
The envoy suggested that early planning would help achieve
this type of objective as restoring to ad hoc measures much later
would not produce the desired result.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
today met with 17 religious leaders to discuss issues relating to
constitutional reforms, Kenya News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Christian and Moslem religious leaders
here today, both sides agreed that violence must be condemned and
emerging culture of incitement, provocation and confrontation be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Contentious issues affecting peace and security in the east
African country should be phased out amicably in a principled and
democratic manner, they declared.
</P>
<P>
Moi and religious leaders agreed that time and mechanism for
affecting constitutional reforms would be discussed in subsequent
meetings.
</P>
<P>
They said that it is necessary to review the country's
constitutional reforms with a view to serving the needs,
requirements and aspirations of modern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government should look at the legislative and
administrative framework to ensure a free and fair General
Election while religious leaders would make proposals for
consideration by the government.
</P>
<P>
President Moi agreed to meet religious leaders frequently
before the coming General Election to be held later this year to
continue the consultations.
</P>
<P>
During the past month, violence has been escalating as
opposition parties have repeatedly organized mass rallies in the
country to press for minimum constitutional reforms before the
General Election.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting held at the Nairobi State House was the first
which President Moi had with religious leaders on reforms since
the start of an Opposition-backed campaign pressing for change.

<HEADLINE> Rules on Indirect Taxation Be Uniform in EU: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Steps have to be taken to ensure
that the current rules governing indirect taxation are applied
uniformly throughout the European Union (EU), an EU official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Mario Monti, EU commissioner responsible for taxation, made
the remark after the EU's executive body, the European Commission,
proposed a new procedure for the adoption of certain implementing
measures relating to indirect taxation.
</P>
<P>
The EC Tuesday proposed that the directive on the common system
of VAT (value-added tax) and that on the general arrangements for
products subject to excise duty be amended so as to give the
Commission wider implementing power that would be exercised
together with the committees representative of EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Following the adoption of general rules by the European Council
in consultation with the European Parliament, detailed technical
provisions would be adopted by the EC if the relevant committee
approved the draft proposal.
</P>
<P>
These implementing measures should ensure uniform application
of the directives, particularly in those areas where the
possibility of differing interpretations might undermine the
smooth functioning of the single market, according to the EC.
</P>
<P>
At present, the common systems of VAT and excise duty are
applied differently from one member country to another, which is
incompatible with the single market concept.
</P>
<P>
Traders are suffering as a result of this legal uncertainty and
the frequent cases of double taxation of cross frontier
transactions.

WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in the U.S. rose
by 0.5 percent in June, reversing three straight declines, the
U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that retail sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted 210.3 billion dollars last month, up from 209.3 billion
in May.
</P>
<P>
Sales of durable goods -- items expected to last more than
three years -- were up 0.5 percent in June after falling 0.9
percent a month earlier. Auto dealers posted a 1.1 percent gain in
the month. Excluding autos, sales rose 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nondurable goods such as food and fuel rose 0.4 percent, also
the third increase in a row.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales in the U.S. declined in March, April and May. The
three consecutive drops signaled the end of what had been a
consumer spending spree that propelled the economy at a sizzling
5.9 percent annual rate during the January-March quarter.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales, about one-third of the nation's economic
activity, had shot up 1.6 percent in January and 1.3 percent in
February.
</P>
<P>
The drop of retail sales in the past months was a major signal
that the U.S. economy was slowing down and more moderate economic
growth recently has permitted U.S. Federal Reserve policy-makers
to leave interest rates unchanged, rather than boost them to keep
inflation under control.

<HEADLINE> Health System Reform Causes Waves of Strikes in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Doctors and pharmacists are
continue their strikes today in protest against the Greek
government's plan aimed at restructuring the National Health
System (ESY).
</P>
<P>
Greek Health Minister Costas Geitonas today submitted a bill to
the Parliament with the aim of reforming the ESY. The bill has
provoked a storm of protest and three weeks of strikes by doctors
employed by the state system.
</P>
<P>
Doctors argued that the key problems were their salaries and
the fact that newly-hired doctors would not enjoy permanent status
right from the start.
</P>
<P>
Pharmacists said that the government's plan would trim their
profit margins on medicines.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government today stressed that it would persist in
its policy of reducing the retail price of medicines.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that in order to
reduce retail prices, the government was making an effort to
overhaul the entire system.

<HEADLINE> Britain Remains Ban on Contacts with Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The British government said today
it had not changed its decision to ban official talks with the
IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, despite renewed contacts with the
latter.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Northern Ireland Office said: "There has
been no change in policy because we have said there would be no
meetings and there have not been any meetings."
</P>
<P>
Britain severed official contacts with Sinn Fein on June 16
after IRA gunmen shot and killed two policemen on the street in a
daylight ambush.
</P>
<P>
But Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam acknowledged on Monday
that officials had been in touch with Sinn Fein after the group
initiated the contact seeking clarification of the requirements
for its admission to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman explained that the contacts with Sinn Fein were
undertaken in writing form and on telephone. "At no point could
this be seen as a negotiation," she added.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has been barred from attending the multi-party peace
talks since February of last year when IRA quit a 17-month
ceasefire. British Prime Minister Tony Blair has said Sinn Fein
can only join peace talks if it persuades its Irish Republican
Army allies to lay down arms and call for a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks resumed today in the provincial capital Belfast
with preliminary discussions before a plenary session on
Wednesday.

MOSCOW, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today Russia attached great importance to the survey
and demarcation work of the Sino-Russian border.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, speaking during a meeting with visiting Chinese
Deputy Foreign Minister Zhang Deguang, also said Sino-Russian
relations are developing at a good momentum with more and more

<P>
The forthcoming visit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to
China scheduled for this autumn will further advance bilateral

Zhang, also head of the Chinese government delegation for
border negotiations, held talks on Tuesday with Grigory Karasin,
Russian deputy foreign minister and head of the joint delegation
for border negotiations composed of Russia, Kazakstan, Kirghizstan
and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The two sides affirmed the results of border talks over the
past five years and agreed to continue efforts to solve the

<HEADLINE> Forum Discussing Chinese President's Important Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A forum was held in Beijing today
by "People's Daily" and "Seeking Truth" magazine, mouthpieces of
the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee, on President
Jiang Zemin's recent speech urging the Chinese people to hold high
the banner of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Jiang spoke on May 29 to senior provincial and
ministerial-level officials who were attending the Party School of
the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Theorists and ministerial-level officials at today's forum said
they agree that Jiang's speech came at an important moment in
Chinese history and offers guidelines for the 21st century.
Jiang's remark about holding high the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory
of building socialism with Chinese Characteristics points to
the direction the Party should follow, they said.
</P>
<P>
The speech prepares the theoretical and ideological groundwork
for the Party's 15th national congress, and has great practical
and historical significance for uniting the Party and the people
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
They said that the matter of the banner is extremely important,
because it relates to the Party's and the nation's destiny, and
that Jiang has adhered to Deng's thought of seeking truth from
facts, which is helpful for the Party in solving problems, and in
providing a basis for drawing up Party's policies and decrees.
</P>
<P>
To make headway in economic system reforms, the banner must be
held high, they noted, and state-owned enterprise reforms will no
doubt make headway if we move forward boldly and practice
bravely in accordance with Deng's theory and Jiang's speech.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that improving the Party leadership, which was
something Jiang called for, is the fundamental guarantee in
pushing socialism into the next century.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Credit Agricole Indosuez, a
leading French merchant bank, has defined the Hong Kong market as
a priority in its global business expansion.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Claude Gruffat, chairman Asia-Pacific of Credit Agricole
Indosuez, said today, "Our bank seeks growth. Asia is the world's
fastest growing area, and that's why we bump into this area."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the business front in Asia under the bank's new
strategy implemented since the first half of 1996. A level playing
field, least regulated economy, and a free and open financial
environment make Hong Kong the ideal choice, according to Gruffat.
</P>
<P>
Credit Agricole Indosuez came into being after Caisse Nationale
de Credit Agricole and Banque Indosuez integrated in June this
year. As the largest and most profitable branch of the newly
merged bank, the Hong Kong branch is active in all business lines
ranging from corporate financing to debt market, asset management,
equity business and private banking.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov today denied any direct link between the North Atlantic
Treat Organization's (NATO) eastward expansion, which Russia
opposes, and more active Russian diplomacy in the East, the Itar-Tass
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists with leading Japanese newspapers,
Primakov said that despite NATO expansion, Russia should pay more
attention to developing ties with countries in the east in view of
the movement towards a multi-polar world.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also reiterated Russia's objection to NATO's plans to
expand eastward to take in countries from the former Warsaw
Pact. "We are against NATO's enlargement to the east. We don't
conceal it and we are not changing our stand."
</P>
<P>
At a summit in Madrid earlier this month, NATO invited Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic to join the military alliance. The
three countries hope to become new members of NATO in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Russia opposes NATO's expansion into eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union states, and believes European security should
be safeguarded by promoting mutual trust among regional countries
instead of by NATO enlargement.

BONN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Thomas Muster was upset in
his first match at the 1.04-million U.S. dollar Mercedes Cup in
Stuttgart on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Spaniard Alberto Portas downed the Austrian laycourt aura 6-4,
7-5 to move into the the third round.
</P>
<P>
Muster saved two match points in the 10th game of the second
set, but couldn't hold onto his momentum after levelling at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
World No. 52 Portas, who lost the Barcelona final in April to
fellow Spaniard Albert Costa, broke back for 6-5, then finished
the second-round upset in the next game when Muster sent a return
long.
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, beaten finalist here last year,
needed three sets to finally stop Frenchman Fabrice Santoro 2-6,

<HEADLINE> Sweden Says EU Enlargement Outweighs NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Early membership of the European
Union for the three Baltic states and Poland is more important for
European security than NATO enlargement, Swedish Foreign Minister
Lena Hjelm-Wallen said in a newspaper commentary today.
</P>
<P>
Writing in Dagens Nyheter, the minister said EU enlargement
would reduce the dangers of creating new borders in a post-Cold
War Europe and was a key factor in achieving European security.
</P>
<P>
She welcomed NATO enlargement and reform as a move away from
the defense of western democracies toward ensuring the security of
Europe as a whole.
</P>
<P>
But although NATO's military security guarantees for its
members were essential in the context of war, they were not
central to ensuring the general security of Europe.
</P>
<P>
She added that the biggest threat to European security would by
and large cease to be military and therefore NATO's expansion into
central and eastern Europe was not a crucial issue.
</P>
<P>
Hjelm-Wallen said Sweden would support Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania and Poland to be among the first batch of countries
invited to join the EU early next century.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission -- the EU's executive body -- agreed on
Tuesday to recommend the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland,
Slovenia and the Mediterranean island country of Cyprus as the
first wave of countries to take part in EU membership talks
beginning next year. Reports said Latvia and Lithuania were not
included because of economic problems.
</P>
<P>
But the plan has to be approved by the heads of government of
all EU members at a meeting in December when the final decision
about who will be in the first wave will be made.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, a neutral country in the Baltic since the early 19th
century, has faced growing domestic pressure for a seat within
NATO.
</P>
<P>
But Hjelm-Wallen said Sweden would stay out of any such
military alliance but would continue its cooperation within NATO's
Partnership for Peace program -- a cooperation program with former
eastern bloc countries and other European non-NATO countries on
regional defense.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's FM Says He Will Replace Ranariddh as First PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Foreign Minister Ung
Hout said today that he was willing to accept the job of first
prime minister, replacing Prince Norodum Ranariddh who was ousted
by his rival, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen last week.
</P>
<P>
Ung Hout, a senior member of First Prime Minister Ranariddh's
FUNCINPEC party, said he still respected Ranariddh, but put the
interests of the people and the country first.
</P>
<P>
"I accept to be first prime minister because I put the
interests of my people and my country first," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He added that 10 million Cambodian people didn't want the
current turbulent situation to continue.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said he would actively cooperate with Hun
Sen to tackle the problems facing Cambodia as soon as his
appointment was ratified by the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said as long as everything was done in accordance with the
Constitution and laws, the international community would respond
and the situation in Cambodia would take a turn for the better.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh was ousted on Sunday July 6 while he was in Paris
after a weekend of fighting in the Cambodian capital between
troops loyal to him, and forces loyal to Second Prime Minister Hun
Sen.
</P>
<P>
But Hun Sen said he wanted the coalition government between his
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and the FUNCINPEC to remain in
place and for FUNCINPEC to choose a new first prime minister to
replace Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
The CPP would support Ung Hout's nomination in the National
Assembly, an adviser to Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that he is acceptable," Hun Sen's adviser Om Yentieng
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, FUNCINPEC officials said they agreed on Ung
Hout's nomination for the post of first prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Ung Hout's nomination will be submitted to the National
Assembly for approval when it reconvenes on July 28.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Leader Pledges to Serve Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition Labor Party
leader Ehud Barak promised here today that he will reopen talks on
further Israeli redeployment and security cooperation with the
Palestinians if he is elected prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the pledge after a meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa. However, he skirted
the more controversial issue of settlement building.
</P>
<P>
Barak, on the second day of his two-day visit here, told
reporters that he would have taken into account the Israel's
security concern and other parties' interests if he was in the
shoes of incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has been
blamed for his obsession with Israel's sole interest.
</P>
<P>
"I would have revived immediately cooperation between the
Israeli and the Palestinian security authorities and allowed
the Palestinian police access to the Hebron cordon to help quell
street violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I would have also done my utmost to resume negotiations over
the second stage of re-deployment which should have been done some
months ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under a timetable outlined in a January Palestinian-Israeli
agreement on Hebron redeployment, the second phase of the
three-stage Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank should
start in March and the last be completed no later than mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
When answered questions on his plans to improve economic
conditions for the Palestinians if he becomes prime minister,
Barak said he believes there is a long way ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Labor leader expressed hope of good neighborly relations
with the Palestinians in the future when pending problems are solved.
</P>
<P>
"Neighbors, like parents, cannot be chosen. We have to work on
developing mutual respect and cooperation and creating a good
relationship as neighbors, and proof of this is our relationship
with Egypt," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is clear, we want to separate from the Palestinians and
we want them to define their identity and shape their lives while
taking into consideration the security of Israel," he added.
</P>
<P>
But he deliberately avoided the settlement issue, saying that
"it is improper to comment on it in Cairo."
</P>
<P>
He said the Labor party strongly believes in "Israel's right
to build settlements, but not on Arab-owned lands."
</P>
<P>
"We also believe that through the final status negotiations,
most of the settlements, not necessarily all of them, should come
under Israel's sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party decided in May to recognize the Palestinians'
right to self-determination and leave open the possibility of
establishing a Palestinian state, which has been adamantly
rejected by Israel's Likud government.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who was elected on June 4 to succeed former Labor Party
leader Shimon Peres, is widely regarded as the only person that
could pose a strong challenge to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Now the Labor is working to mobilize Israeli public opinion for
an early election which many hope will bring it back to power.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Cleared of Implication in Death of Kuwaiti Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Investigations have cleared Iraqis
of implication in the death of a Kuwaiti boy in a plush Cairo
hotel Tuesday, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Major General Ahmad Hammam Ateya, security chief of Giza, where
the hotel is located, told a press conference that the death of
the Kuwaiti child was caused by asphyxiation and not by alleged
play of Iraqi agents.
</P>
<P>
The four-year-old child drowned Tuesday in the room's bathtub
of Pyramisa Hotel where his family was staying. His mother had
alleged that she woke up to find her boy dead in the room with a
note scrawled on the wall.
</P>
<P>
The message, addressed to the Kuwaiti Emir, suggests the
implication of Iraqi agents in the death.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Ateya refuted reports by foreign news
media that the boy was deliberately killed in the hotel's swimming
pool and then taken to the room he shared with his family.
</P>
<P>
He said that the police found in the room two pens that were
used to write the message, and the mother later recanted her
statement and confessed she had lied for fear of being charged
with negligence and of retaliation from the boy's father, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Kuwait have been at odds since Iraq invaded this Gulf
neighbor in 1990.

<HEADLINE> EC President Urges Improved EU World Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Jacques Santer, president of the
European Commission, today urged the European Union (EU) countries
to seize the opportunity of enlargement to improve its economy and
status in the world.
</P>
<P>
In presenting a communication today to the European Parliament,
the president of the EU's executive agency said, "Enlargement
represents a historic turning point for Europe, an opportunity
which it must seize for the sake of its security, its economy, its
culture and its status in the world."
</P>
<P>
He explained that the EU's internal and external environments
were both changing fast and that it must set about "adapting,
developing and reforming itself."
</P>
<P>
The commission today submitted the communication entitled
Agenda 2000, together with opinions on each of the applications
for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
The publication constitutes the commission's comprehensive
response to requests from the European Council meeting in Madrid
in December of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Taking account of the prospect of an enlarged EU, the
commission outlines the broad outlook for the EU's development and
its policies beyond the turn of the century, the impact of
enlargement on the EU as a whole and the future financial
framework beyond 2000.
</P>
<P>
The commission maintained that the negotiations on EU
membership should start with six candidate countries -- Hungary,
Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Cyprus,
according to Santer.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Santer said that it would not be necessary to resort
to an increase of the actual budgetary ceiling -- 1.27 percent of
GDP of the union -- in order to face the multiple challenges.

<HEADLINE> German Schlappner Resigns as Vanguard Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, Central China, July 16 (Xinhua) -- German Klaus
Schlappner has resigned as the coach for China's Professional
League side Vanguard Huandao on Wednesday, becoming the second
coach to quit in four days in the league.
</P>
<P>
Schlappner, who had made Chinese soccer history by becoming the
first foreigner to coach the Chinese national team in early 1990s,
submitted his letter of resignation to the Vanguard management
Tuesday morning, the club said.
</P>
<P>
A club spokesman said the 56-year-old Schlappner told the club
in his letter that the pressure in the coming second half of the
season would be too much for him as the performance of the team
was far from satisfactory in the first nine of the 22 rounds.
</P>
<P>
He was replaced by Vanguard's team leader Yan Dejun but like a
Bulgarian who quit as Shanghai Shenhua coach on Sunday, stays in
the team as an advisor.
</P>
<P>
Yan told Xinhua that his top priority is to prevent Vanguard,
now eighth in the 12-team league, from being relegated.
</P>
<P>
Schlappner took over the Chinese national squad on June 15,
1992. He was fired by the Chinese Football Association after the
team failed to qualify for the second stage in the Asian
qualifying tournament for the 1994 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
He returned to Germany to train second-division side Waldhof
Mannheim last season and returned to China to coach Vanguard since
January.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank to Lower Borrowing Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' top monetary
official said today the central bank is to lower its overnight
borrowing rate to 28 percent Thursday from a four-year high of 32
percent.
</P>
<P>
Central bank governor Gabriel Singson was quoted by the local
SNN television as saying that the hefty borrowing rate will be
lowered considering the signs of recovery in the foreign currency
market.
</P>
<P>
The central bank hiked its overnight borrowing rate four times
in a week since the start of this month in a bid to repulse
speculative attacks on the Philippine peso. The key interest rate
was lifted to a four-year high of 32 percent from 30 percent last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The television reports said commercial banks are expected to
follow suit and lower their interest rates, which have been
raised following the spiral of the central bank's borrowing rate.
</P>
<P>
Economists have warned that continued high interest rates will
affect corporations and the property sector and then hurt the
local stock market.
</P>
<P>
Due to volatility in the currency market and continued high
interest rates, investors today remained shy away from the local
bourse. The Philippine Stock Exchange composite index (Phisix)
today plummeted by 68.5 points to close at 2,587.36, the lowest
since January 1996.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Leader Meets With Japan LDP Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Chairman of the Central
Military Commission Chi Haotian hopes Japan will follow a
route of peaceful development and prevent tragedies
from repeating themselves.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also State Councilor and Minister of Defense, made
the remarks today when meeting with Koto Koichi, secretary-general
of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on the 25th anniversary
of the normalization of relations between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that China and Japan are neighbors separated by a strip
of water and that China has always attached great importance to
the friendly cooperative relations with Japan.
</P>
<P>
The older generation of leaders of the two countries have
thrown all their energy into developing bilateral relations, he
said, and that development momentum of friendly co-operative
relations has maintained over the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Promoting the long-term, healthy, stable, friendly
co-operative relations not only conforms to the basic interests of
the two peoples, but is also significant for Asia and the world as
a whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that bilateral relations over the past 25 years were
generally in good shape, despite some ups and downs, and that
three generations of Chinese leaders have emphasized that " past
experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for the future" and that a
correct understanding of history is the basis of development of
relations.
</P>
<P>
However, there are always people in Japan who attempt to deny
historic facts and confound black and white, he said, pointing out
that the Chinese people will not forget history.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to conclude the past, open up the future and establish
Sino-Japanese friendly co-operative relationship on a long-term,
stable and healthy basis, thus maintaining friendship between the
two peoples for generations to come," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chi expressed his concern over the security treaty between
Japan and the United States, and noted that those who fell victim
to Japanese aggression are highly sensitive about this issue, and
he called the so-called "China threat" theory a "sheer
fabrication."
</P>
<P>
Koto said that, generally speaking, bilateral relations have
witnessed smooth development for the past 25 years, and that he
hopes the two sides can continue to increase exchanges and enhance
mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he said, the cabinet of then Prime-Minister
Tomiichi Murayama made it clear that Japan should be deeply
introspective about its past.

Manila, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso today showed
some signs of normalization, with its exchange rate against the
U.S. dollar appreciating to 29.352 pesos compared with Tuesday's

</P>
<P>
The Philippine Bankers Association said the reference rate
between the peso and the dollar appreciated by 31 centavos today

</P>
<P>

increased slightly to 23.25 million dollars from Tuesday's 18.35
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The central bank today sold 4 million dollars to help stabilize
the peso, which has devalued more than 11 percent since the bank
announced the peso's floatation last Friday.
</P>
<P>
At his weekly press conference, President Fidel Ramos today
said the floating of the peso has normalized after a frenzy
speculative attack by investors.
</P>
<P>
"There is now limited buying and selling but a lower rate is
being seen, " he said.
</P>

He said the government is not going to revise its economic
targets for the year, including those for inflation, economic
growth and budget surplus, despite the attacks on the peso.

Ramos said officials of HongkongBank Manila assessed that
commercial banks are now more confident that the peso has
stabilized at a range of 29 to 29.50 pesos to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also ruled out the possibility of Singson to resign due
to the de facto depreciation of the peso, saying he did not think
Singson should do that.

<HEADLINE> Injuried Kenya's Aguta Still Unconscious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's marathon star Lameck Aguta
has been unconscious for four days by Wednesday after he was
admitted to hospital following a car accident last Sunday,
according to his twin brother Zachary Nyambaso.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said his condition was still stable and they would
issue a bulletin if there were any changes.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Aguta, the Boston Marathon and also the Commonwealth
10,000 meters champion, sustained head injuries in the crash but a
brain scan showed no serious damage.
</P>
<P>
Doctors, who had said on Monday they were encouraged by his
condition, were concerned on Wednesday that the athlete was still
unconscious and that his condition remained largely unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Police said Aguta was injured when his car went out of control
and landed in a ditch in his native Rift Valley province. The
driver of the car and another man were slightly injured.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sees Prison Congestion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is faced with over-congestion in
its prisons where at least 22,675 persons are being detained while
over 15,000 others are in police custody.
</P>
<P>
Quoting an unnamed security chief, the Punch newspaper today reported
that the majority of those in prison were suspects awaiting
trial and the situation has aroused concern from the government.
</P>
<P>
The staggering number of the prison inmates was unacceptable to the
government and some measures were now being devised to stem the trend,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The over-congestion of prison in the country could be attributed
to the fact that the nation's prinsons were built about a century ago
and were designed not to hold more than a quarter of their current
population.
</P>
<P>
However, Nigeria's police boss, Inspector-General of Police Alhaji
Ibrahim Coomassie, expressed disbelief in the staggering figure
released by the security chief.
</P>
<P>
"It's alarming, it shouldn't be so; I will follow it up," Coomassie
said.

MANILA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers are trekking the 1,253
meter Mountain Natib, in the northern Philippines, to look for 22
university students who were missing after they went up the
mountain over the weekend, police sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the students, all club mountaineers of
the University of the Philippines, were reportedly trapped by a
landslide last Saturday.
</P>

<P>
They said that the amateur radio enthusiast informed the police
of the students' plight in Mountain Natib, Bataan province.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Vodacom to Be Botswana Cellular phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Botswana Telecommunications
Corporation (BTC) has selected South Africa's largest cellular network
operator Vodacom as its joint venture partner in a bid for a license
to operate a cellular network in Botswana.
</P>
<P>
BTC Chief Executive Olebile Gaborone announced today in Gaborone,
capital of Botswana, that Vodacom had been selected because of its
experience in southern Africa, which could enable a cellular network
to be set up in Botswana relatively quickly.
</P>
<P>
The Botswana Telecommunications Authority (BTA) is expected to
make a decision on awarding the license in September this year.
</P>
<P>
Two licenses would be awarded and each successful tenderer will
have to pay one million Pula (about 280,000 US Dollar) for a 15 year
licence, said the BTA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The BTA said it had tried to ensure that the network would cover a large
part of this vast, mostly desert country with a population of only 1.5
million people.
</P>
<P>
"The minimum requirements are that both operators will have to
establish a network that covers a mandatory section along the line of
rail and main road from Lobatse in the south to Francistown in the
north," the BTC spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Muslim Rebel Group Splits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) has broken into two factions, the hawks and the
moderates, due to a profit-sharing struggle, the military said
today.
</P>
<P>
Col. Nestor Castillo, chief of the Armed Forces' Civil
Relations Service (CRS), said that the division came about when
MILF leaders began fighting over shares of fund support generated
from kidnap-for-ransom activities.
</P>
<P>
The MILF leadership squabbles also surfaced over tax collection
and other criminal activities, Castillo said.
</P>
<P>
"Each MILF unit wanted a big slice of the money to support
their logistical needs to support their operations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting military intelligence reports, Castillo also said that
Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs, was today
blamed for the debacles and recent battlefield defeats suffered by
the MILF.
</P>
<P>
He said that the MILF Central Committee convened and discussed
courses of action to take by the beleaguered organization.
</P>
<P>
Both Murad and Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for
political affairs, were admonished for betrayal of Islam by
"engaging in activities for personal aggrandizement and enriching
themselves at the expense of the MILF," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is so far no immediate response from the MILF on the
military report.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the larger Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), which forged a peace deal with the
government last September.
</P>
<P>
The MILF refused to be included in the MNLF-Manila peace accord
and began its own initial peace talks with the government this
January. The rebel group has been accused by the military of being
involved in many kidnap-for-ransom cases.
</P>
<P>
But the MILF withdrew from the peace talks after a major MILF
camp in central Mindanao, the southern Philippines, was overrun by
the military late last month.

<HEADLINE> Expert Calls for Dialogue on Human Rights (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhu said a lasting impression left by the talks is that people
in those countries know little about the situation in China and
that numerous rumors have resulted in serious misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
Among the rumors that Zhu named are: trials in China are not
open to the public, appeals are not allowed after a court issues a
verdict, and prisoners are executed without investigation into
their cases.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the Tibet issue is just one of the many that are
misinterpreted by the European countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu cited one media report which asked why school classes in
Tibet have been conducted in Chinese rather than in the Tibetan
language since this year. He called the report "ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the public listens to the propaganda of the Dalai
Lama and his followers, but they do not know that Tibet has not
been an independent state since the 13th century. He added that
Tibet under the Dalai's rule was a serf society more oppressive
than Europe in the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
Also, the public does not know that the Dalai was the leading
serf owner in Tibet under whose rule numerous Tibetans and people
of other nationalities were killed. The Dalai is absolutely not an
"angel of peace" who "could not harm a fly."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the public does not know the wishes and hopes of the
more than two million Tibetan people who do not regard the Dalai
as their representative, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu continued that the dialogues conducted by the delegation
during the visit were widely regarded as successful, because all
sides showed their respect for each other and conducted the talks
on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
All sides participating in the dialogue, including the
representative of Amnesty International, agreed upon the
principles of mutual respect and equality, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said his delegation based its discussions on truth.
</P>
<P>
"We stressed that we do not ask others to accept our opinions,"
Zhu noted. "We just hope they know what our opinions are and why
we have them."
</P>
<P>
He said that when touching on the human rights situation in
China during the talks, the delegation did not dodge the country's
shortcomings while presenting its achievements.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, the speeches of the delegation members often
were applauded by the listeners, which "created a favorable
environment and is very encouraging."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the prospect of resolving the disputes between
different countries on the human rights issue, Zhu quoted an old
saying in the West, "All roads lead to Rome," and said that only
when people agree that various countries should follow their own
ways of improving human rights according to their own situation
can a correct way of resolving the disputes be found.
</P>
<P>
To regard only one point of view on human rights as a defining
creed will not help eliminate disputes, but rather intensify them,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the growing trend of dialogue provides a good prospect
for resolving the disputes on the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
He added that dialogue will finally overcome confrontation and
pave the way for properly resolving the disputes -- even though
the disputes cannot be resolved overnight.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the China Society for Human Rights Studies will more
actively maintain contact and engage in dialogue with both
government and non-government organizations in other countries in
an effort to help increase mutual understanding of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The society will also conduct studies on some fundamental
issues relating to China's human rights policies, such as
judicial, ethnic minority and women's issues -- all areas which
are deeply misunderstood by some other countries, Zhu said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The first half of this year saw a spectacular 27.8
percent increase in credit card spending in Cyprus, compared with
that of last year, and it reached 80.6 million Cyprus pounds
(about 161.2 million U.S. dollars), Cyprus Financial Mirror
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Spending with locally-issued cards in the first half of 1997
rose by 49 percent over the same period in 1996, standing at
47.7 million pounds (about 95.4 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase is attributed to the better awareness of
the Cypriot cardholders about the cards and the fact that credit
cards are now widely accepted at most retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
In addition, card-issuing banks have widened the choice of
cards offered to their customers, which in turn has enticed more
customers to resort to the use of plastic money, instead of the
traditional cash.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Trade between Greece and Cyprus has marked a rising
trend in recent years, totaling 171.6 million Cyprus pounds
(about 343.2 million U.S. dollars) in 1996 from 153.4 million
pounds (about 306.8 million dollars) in 1995, and 136.9 million
pounds (about 273.8 million dollars) in 1994, a Greek diplomat in
Cyprus said today.
</P>
<P>
Chrysanthi Passadi, economic and commercial attache of the
Greek Embassy in Nicosia told the press that exports of Greece,
which ranks the fourth among countries exporting to Cyprus,
account for 7.21 percent of the volume of the island's imports in
1996 against 7.18 percent in 1995 and 6.81 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot exports to Greece, the island's fourth largest
foreign market, were 37.6 million Cyprus pounds (about 75.2
million U.S. dollars) in 1996 from 33.4 million pounds (about
66.8 million dollars) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Former Jordanian prime minister Abdul Karim Kabariti
has been elected board chairman of the Jordan-Kuwait Bank here
at the bank's meeting, according to Jordan's news agency Petra.
</P>
<P>
The seven-member bank board also consists of three Kuwaitis
and three other Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti has recently made important contributions in
attracting investors from Kuwait and other Arab countries to
raise the bank`s capital from 10 million Jordanian dinars (about
14 million U.S. dollars) to 20 million dinars (about 28 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait's state reserves has registered an
increase of 21 percent during the past four years to reach 17
billion dinars (56.1 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of last May.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Finance Minister Nasser Al-Roudhan attributed, at a
National Assembly session late last night, the increase to the
improved gain of returns for the Kuwaiti Reserve Fund for Future
Generations and the State Public Reserve which recorded 11.7
billion U.S. dollars during the period.
</P>
<P>
The minister said growth rate of the returns on the two
reserves were around 15 percent on average during these years.
</P>
<P>
He also declared that returns on the state investments in the
1996/97 fiscal year ending on June 30 even surpassed oil revenues
realized during 1995/96 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Oil revenues in 1995/96 in the oil-rich Gulf state were over 3
billion Kuwait dinars or about 10 billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Jiang Chunyun told a
meeting here today that arrangement for possible big floods and
droughts in the near future must be made.
</P>
<P>
The current situation is already serious and officials must try
to guess the consequences, and should "mobilize people to join in
the work," he said.
</P>
<P>
China has been suffering badly from droughts in northern areas
and floods in the south this summer. Some 4.2 million hectares of
farmland have been affected by flood waters and heavy rains, and 38
million people have been mobilized daily to fight the drought.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that because of the El Nino influence from the
Pacific Ocean, various disasters may occur in China this year at
the same time, so the nation must be fully prepared.
</P>
<P>
Officials should be especially clear headed, he said, and the
nation must work hard for a good harvest by dealing with the
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
He gave specific instructions for reservoir and flood
prevention projects, and ordered electric power, agriculture,
transportation, and civil affairs departments to provide aid.
</P>
<P>
"We must get good results in the work to greet the opening of
the Chinese Communist Party's 15th national congress," he
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Ruling Party MPs Endorse Draft Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- People's Alliance (PA)
parliamentarians and organizers unanimously endorsed the draft
constitution for Sri Lanka which seeks to devolve part of the
authority of the central government with a view to solving the
complex ethnic problem, according to a news release from the
Presidential Secretariat this evening.
</P>
<P>
The release said a resolution was adopted at a two-day workshop
held on Monday and Tuesday at Kalutara, over 20 kilometers from
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said since the present Constitution of Sri Lanka
is wholly inadequate to promote a solution to the ethnic problem
which has emerged as the principal impediment to the progress of
the country and its people, and the achievement of justice, fair
play and democracy.
</P>
<P>
All PA MPs expressed their unanimous endorsement of the new
draft constitution which seeks to devolve part of the authority of
the central government as the basis of a solution to the complex
ethnic problem, while the war against the Tamil rebels is
vigorously prosecuted, the release noted.
</P>
<P>
This meeting offered its assistance and support for all
measures taken by the government to accomplish this objective, the
release added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Defense Secretary William S. Cohen will recommend General
Henry H. Shelton of the Army, who commanded the American military
operation in Haiti in 1994, to be the next chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, a senior Administration official said.
</P>
<P>
-- The head of the Russian Space Agency proposed that the
American astronaut Michael Foale participate in a tricky space
walk to repair the stricken Mir space station. The Russian
commander has been judged unable to carry out the job because of
heart irregularities. NASA officials said they needed to be
persuaded of the urgency of the repair before they would allow
Mr. Foale to take on the potentially risky mission.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton resumed budget negotiations Tuesday and
insisted the deficit would not be eliminated without the plan he
is crafting with Congress, despite new reports suggesting the
booming economy may erase the red ink on its own.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The Veterans Affairs department has begun processing the
first in a potential tidal wave of compensation claims for
smoking-related diseases and deaths. The claims could cost the
government billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
-- Whitewater prosecutor Starr ruled that the 1993 death of
White House aide Vincent Foster was a suicide. Three previous
investigations reached the same conclusion, and Starr's nearly
three-year inquiry proceeded as numerous conspiracy theories
developed. An appeal court is reviewing his report.

<HEADLINE> Hijackers Returned To Mainland From Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan handed over two suspected
hijackers to representatives of the Red Cross Society of China
(RCSC) today at Jinmen (Quemoy) in the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The action is in accordance with the Jinmen Agreement signed in
September 1990 between Red Cross organizations across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers, Huang Shugang and Han Fengying, together with
accomplices, hijacked a China Southern Airlines plane and a
Sichuan Airlines plane on April 6 and September 30, 1993,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the RCSC, serving as a witness for the
return procedure today, said that hijacking is regarded as a
serious crime everywhere in the world, and hijackers must be
severely punished.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We welcome the Taiwan side's actions of sending back
Huang Shugang and Han Fengying after our side returned the
suspected hijacker, Liu Shan-chung, to Taiwan on May 14."
</P>
<P>
On March 10, Liu Shan-chung hijacked a plane belonging to
Taiwan's Far Eastern Airlines, forcing it to land at Gaoqi Airport
in Fujian Province's Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Taiwan's departments concerned, for the general
purpose of doing things in favor of jointly combating the crime of
hijacking and safeguarding the lives and property of people across
the Taiwan Straits, will send all suspected hijackers staying in
Taiwan back to mainland areas," the representative said.
</P>
<P>
After being sent back to the mainland, Huang and Han, the two
suspected hijackers, will be prosecuted for their criminal
liability by the judiciary on the mainland according to law.

<HEADLINE> Suspect in Slaying of Fashion Designer Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 12 hours after
Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace was shot and killed at
Miami Beach in southern United States, Miami Beach police named
one of the Federal Bureau of Investigations' most wanted fugitives
as their leading suspect.
</P>
<P>
Beach police chief Richard Barreto identified the suspect as
Andrew Phillip Cunanan, 27, who was already being sought in the
slaying of four men from Minneapolis to New Jersey and was known
to move in gay circles.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they didn't know of any previous link
between Cunanan and the designer who was gay.
</P>
<P>
Versace, 50, was returning home from the News Cafe on South
Beach's Ocean Drive after buying an Italian newspaper when he was
slain outside the gates of his Mediterranean-style mansion Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Authorities contacted gay and lesbian organizations in South
Florida to see if anyone recognized Cunanan. Police said he was a
male prostitute who frequented gay bars, and the FBI distributed
2,000 fliers with the suspect's picture and information about the
previous killings.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a senior official of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), meeting this afternoon with a
delegation from Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), headed by
its secretary-general Kato Koichi, said that the CPC is willing to

four principles guiding party-to-party relations.
</P>
<P>
Hu is a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau and a member of the Secretariat, of the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
In welcoming the delegation, he said that this year is the
25th anniversary of the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic
relations. For the past 25 years, Sino-Japanese relations have
developed well and accomplished things that were not easily come
by.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is the historical responsibility of the
two countries' statesmen to remember both the positive and
negative historical experience and to review the past and looking
forward to the future, understand the general trends for the
development of bilateral relations on the basis of the principles
set forth in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the Treaty of
Peace and Friendship to bring a long-term, sound and stable
Sino-Japanese good-neighborly friendship to the next century.
</P>
<P>
This is in the fundamental interests of the two peoples and
also conducive to peace, stability, and development in Asia and in
the world as a whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his appreciation for Kato's contributions to
bilateral friendship, Hu said he hopes that both sides can make a
joint effort to increase mutual understanding and trust, and
remove interference, to push the development of Sino-Japanese
good-neighborly friendship farther forward.
</P>
<P>
Kato said that bilateral relations have developed smoothly in
general for the past 25 years, especially bilateral economic and
trade relations, which have had extensive development.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes to further bilateral exchanges and
co-operation in various aspects like politics, to increase
exchanges between the two ruling parties, especially visits by
young statesmen, and to promote the establishment of a firm
bilateral friendship to make it conducive to the two countries,
and to peace and stability in Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the older generation of statesmen of the two
countries have made a great effort in bilateral friendship, and
that his generation should make an effort to continue Japan-China
friendship from generation to generation as the earlier generation
did.
</P>
<P>
Kato and his party arrived here yesterday as guests of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The head of the International Department of the CPC Central
Committee, Li Shuzheng, held discussions with the delegation
yesterday afternoon.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese leading human rights
expert stressed here today that the divergent opinions on human
rights issues should be settled through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Muzhi, president of the China Society for Human Rights
Studies (CSHRS), said during an interview that active and
extensive dialogue should be conducted among different countries
in a bid to deepen mutual understanding, eliminate
misunderstandings, reduce differences, strengthen cooperation and
finally to promote human rights.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and the human rights studies delegation he led have
returned from a visit to Norway, Sweden, Italy and Spain. During
the June 8-27 visit, the delegation met with the respective
governments, parliaments, non-governmental organizations and
people from all trades. It also met with representatives of
Amnesty International in Norway.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a Chinese non-governmental human
rights group has held discussions with foreign countries on the
specific issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China has made much progress in the area of human
rights, and facts will show that China's attitude toward this
issue has won sympathy and support from many countries, especially
the developing countries and insightful personages from the West.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China strongly opposes confrontation on the
human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
China has maintained a sound relationship with the above four
countries, Zhu said. However, due to lack of contact and
exchanges, differences of opinion remain between the two sides
regarding human rights.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the extensive contacts carried out this time have
helped to make each side's viewpoints known and deepen mutual
understanding, and his views were well received by all four
countries.
</P>
<P>
This will benefit not only the mutual understanding of the
human rights issue, but also the nation-to-nation friendly
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, the crowning achievement of this visit is
that dialogue has been initiated, thus the road for further talks
has been broadened and confidence strengthened.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the delegation exchanged views and discussed
many important issues concerning China's human rights with their
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Several questions were discussed:
</P>
<P>
-- How should the human rights condition in China be evaluated?
</P>
<P>
-- Is it or is it not a noteworthy achievement for China to be
able to feed and clothe 22 percent of the world's population with
seven percent of the world's arable land, and to give its 1.2
billion Chinese people their right to life and development?
</P>
<P>
-- How should China's democracy be evaluated?
</P>
<P>
-- Does China have a developing economy and a non-democratic
political life, or is it economic development that meets the
Chinese people's desire for a better life and a prosperous
country, and thus best reflects the democracy?
</P>
<P>
-- Has the rapid economic progress proved that the People's
Congress system is a democratic one that conforms with the
specific situation of China and ensures the government operates at
the will of the people?
</P>
<P>
-- How should China's rapid economic growth be evaluated?
</P>
<P>
-- Is it beneficial for a prosperous China to provide a big
market and enormous job opportunities to the world, and to develop
its friendly relationship with all countries, or is it beneficial
for a weak and disintegrating China to become the source of
millions of refugees?
</P>
<P>
All these questions are crucial for a correct understanding of
China's human rights situation, Zhu said.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held here today
to mark the end of term for the Hong Kong Regional Affairs
Advisors engaged by the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was attended by Zheng Guoxiong, vice director of
the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, and some 200 Regional
Affairs Advisors from "New Territories" area.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Zheng said that all the Regional Affairs

</P>
<P>
"You have won the people's respect and your names will be
recorded in history," he said.
</P>
<P>
Between March 1994 and July 1995, the Xinhua News Agency Hong
Kong Branch engaged a total of 670 Hong Kong residents from
various social circles as Hong Kong Regional Affairs Advisors.
</P>
<P>

high degree of autonomy," Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, he said, various offices of the Xinhua

<HEADLINE> IPR Violators Penalized by Courts in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to show its strong
stand against violations of intellectual property rights, China's
Supreme People's Court (SPC) made public today five of the
country's court rulings on disputes concerning piracy, trademarks
and other related issues.
</P>
<P>
Two of the cases were won by foreign companies against Chinese
litigants.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Guoguang, SPC vice-president, courts nationwide
have handled 5,296 first-instance trials relating to intellectual
proper in the past 17 months, about 10 percent of which involved
overseas people.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese courts not only protect the intellectual property
rights owned by Chinese citizens in accordance with law, they
also, by referring to international treaties China has ratified,
provide equal safeguards for rights owned by overseas people,"
said Li in a press conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
One of the cases involved the unauthorized production of laser
discs on 19 American blockbuster films, including "Commando," "Die
Hard" and "Top Gun," by two Beijing companies, which did not
receive permission from the producers including the 20th Century
Fox Film Corporation and Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 Beijing Intermediate People's Court ruled at the end
of last year that the two Beijing companies must reimburse the US
movie producers with more than 290,000 yuan (around 34,900 US
dollars), and immediately put a halt to the sales of the pirated
discs. Their pirated discs in stock were also confiscated by the
court.
</P>
<P>
Another case concerned a dispute between a company in east
China's city of Nanjing and two foreign toy production and selling
companies, the Interlego AG of Switzerland and the Lego Overseas
A/S of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign companies were compensated with 20,000 US
dollars for infringement upon their rights to patent, trademarks
and copyrights. The manufacturing facilities of the Baogao
International INC in Nanjing which were used for the illegal
activities have been destroyed under the supervision of the local
court.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company has been ordered to publish a letter
of apology in a newspaper to the foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Three internal cases involved the theft of geological
prospectors results in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the
illegal editing and printing of "The Besieged City," a popular
novel by Qian Zhongshu, and the illegal use of a trademark owned
by a Beijing company by Shanghai businesses.
</P>
<P>
In addition to paying compensation for loss, violators have
also received civil punishments according to law, the senior judge
said.

the direction of interest rates, he had not done so in the past
and would not be doing so today.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Vows to Restore Kabbah at All Costs, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government, with its
troops in Sierra Leone as part of the west African peacekeeping
force (ECOMOG), has vowed to give all it takes to restore ousted
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to power, the Nigerian Tribune
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that Nigeria will be abdicating its sense of
mission and responsibility as a sub-regional power, if it holds
its arms and watches helplessly and unconcerned its geo-political
environment being threatened by destructive interests," said
presidency sources on Tuesday, quoted by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Nigeria is in Sierra Leone in
fulfillment of its bilateral pact with that country and as part
of the sub-region's efforts to restore the elected government.
</P>
<P>
"From Momoh to Tejan Kabbah, those variously in power in
Sierra Leone have solicited Nigerian security assistance,
culminating in a security/defence pact between both countries,"
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The pact was in the process of being strengthened in order to
stabilize the democratically elected government of Kabbah when he
was ousted in the coup on May 25, they said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria also intervened in Sierra Leone at the instance of
some (unnamed) foreign countries to protect their citizens
trapped in Sierra Leone in the wake of the coup.
</P>
<P>
The sources disclosed that Nigeria's intervention in Liberia
and Sierra Leone was consistent with the principle of its foreign
policy and in consonance with the protection and safeguarding of
its geo-political environment, which is a component of its
national interest.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha said recently that
his government would do all within its powers to ensure that the
nation continues with its leadership role in the continent and
that the country's primary concern was peace and stability in the
sub-region, without which no meaningful development could take
place.
</P>
<P>
The coup in Sierra Leone has received wide condemnation around
the world and west African leaders have since engaged in
persuading the military junta to step down.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has
decided to place economic embargo on Sierra Leone. If it fails,
the use of force will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS Committee of Four on Sierra Leone is expea a cted to
hold a meeting tomorrow in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, for a solution
to the crisis in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait's State Reserves Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's state reserves have
registered an increase of 21 percent during the past four years to
reach 17 billion dinars (56.1 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of
last may.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Finance Minister Nasser Al-Roudhan attributed the
increase to the improved gain of returns for the Kuwaiti Reserve
Fund for Future Generations and the State Public Reserve which
recorded 11.7 billion U.S. dollars during the period.
</P>
<P>
He was responding grillings by parliamentary members over his
ministry's alleged mismanagement of public funds during a
marathon debate at the National Assembly late last night.
</P>
<P>
The minister said growth rate of the returns on the two
reserves were around 15 percent on average during these years.
</P>
<P>
He also declared that returns on the state investments in the
1996/97 fiscal year ending on June 30 even surpassed oil revenues
realized during 1995/96 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Oil revenues in 1995/96 in the oil-rich Gulf state were over 3
billion Kuwait dinars or about 10 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti Reserve Fund for Future Generations used to have a
reserve of more than 100 billion U.S. dollars before the Gulf
War. Since then, the government has been reportedly taking 80
billion U.S. dollars from the reserve to meet the budget deficit
resulted from the war cost and the post-war rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's financial reputation dramatically improved and its
credit rating increased from 38.9 percent to 45.2 percent,
Al-Roudhan said.

HONG KONG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- An international fashion trade
fair opened here today in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center, drawing more than 370 exhibitors from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Henry Tang, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry,
said at the opening ceremony that Hong Kong, with a total export
of 170 billion HK dollars (22 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, is
the second largest clothing exporter in the world after China's

The garment industry is still the largest foreign exchange
earner in Hong Kong, where many leading international labels are
manufactured and exhibited.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that Hong Kong garment manufacturers are well
positioned to tap the world largest market -- the inland
areas of China with 1.2 billion potential consumers.
</P>
<P>
Apart from catwalk shows, a young designers' contest and

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS FMs to Meet on Sierra Leone Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) are expected to meet
tomorrow in Abidjan, capital of Cote d'Ivoire, to discuss
solutions to the crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that the meeting is likely to break new
grounds for the sub-regional body to achieve a peaceful
resolution of the crisis, local newspaper This Day reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigeria's Defence Headquarters said on Tuesday the
sub-regional peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG had not got
orders from ECOWAS to take military action against coup leaders
in that country.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops were sent to Sierra Leone in the wake of the May
25 coup in a bid to restore the toppled civilian government led
by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Fightings have been reported between ECOMOG troops and
soldiers loyal to coup leader Major Johnny Koroma, but Nigeria's
acting defence spokesman, Col. Godwin Ugbo, said ECOMOG merely
defended its positions when they were attacked.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping force would maintain its defensive positions
until a contrary directive from ECOWAS high command was received,
Ugbo added.
</P>
<P>
The last clash broke out last weekend when soldiers of Sierra
Leone's military government and ex-rebels of the Revolutionary
United Front attempted to enter ECOMOG-controlled Lungi
internatioinal airport near the capital Freetown, in search of a
radio station alleged to be launched for anti-government
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
About 100 persons were reportedly dead during the fighting,
but Ugbo said on Tuesday the figure was exaggerated to undermine
the efforts by ECOWAS for restoring ousted President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
It is noted this is the first time the Nigerian military
admitted casualties in Sierra Leone though Ugbo declined to
provide the actual figure.
</P>
<P>
According to him, ECOMOG will start economic blockade on
Sierra Leone next week following the action plan by the ECOWAS
Committee of Four on that country.
</P>
<P>
The sub-region will not embark on the use of force to oust the
Koroma-led military government until it is convinced that
economic embargo option has failed, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that tomorrow's Abidjan meeting is likely to be
a forum for working out a truce because Ghana, one of the
Committee of Four, has said it will not support the use of force
in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The other memebers of the Committee are Nigeria, Guinea and
Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The people in Cote d'Ivoire are also said to have close
relations with the young hot-heads that sacked Kabbah's
government, which would make them reluctant to take a hardline
against them.
</P>
<P>
The military government in Sierra Leone has consistently
rebuffed appeals by regional leaders and the international
community to quit government and restore President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Koroma sworn in 12 ministers of the 17-member
cabinet appointed by him last week. The other five will soon take
oath of office.
</P>
<P>
Koroma has said his government will leave but only after
organizing election and installing another government.
</P>
<P>
No timetable has been announced although the military junta
was reported to ask for a period of 18 months to step down
shortly after the coup.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Press Welcomes Land Sales Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong major's newspapers
today devoted full pages to a massive land sales program unveiled
Tuesday by the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government.
</P>
<P>
Under the five-year program, the fresh land supply for the
private sector will reach 433 hectares, more than doubling the
total land supply over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
In the next 21 months, the SAR government is scheduled to sell
100 plots of public land, enough for the construction of nearly
65,000 flats.
</P>
<P>
"To improve the land supply is the only and fundamental way to
ease the surge of housing prices," the Hong Kong Daily News said
in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po's commentary said the sufficient supply of land
shows that the SAR government is determined to meet Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa's objective to increase the overall annual
supply to not less than 85,000 units in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"The land sales program is also good news for industrial and
commercial investors in Hong Kong. The rocketing property prices
have somewhat weakened the competitive edge of Hong Kong," the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Tin Tin Daily said The SAR government is now taking the first
step to tackle the housing problem which has aroused general
concern. The plan to increase the land supply has brought hopes to
the local people, who have long-cherished dreams to have their own
houses.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Industrial Zones in Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's Thanlyin-Kyauktan
Industrial Zone, situated 50 kilometers from Yangon, the capital
of the country, is making progress with investment from Singapore
and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Of the 17 container wharves to be set up at the Thilawa Port in
the 1,230-hectare industrial zone, 10 are being built by three
Singaporean companies and four others undertaken by a Malaysian
company.
</P>
<P>
The remaining three wharves are to be built by the Italian-Thai
Development Public Co. Ltd. of Thailand under an agreement with
the Myanmar Port Authority, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Of the Singaporean investment, the first 500-meter container
wharf, built by the C and P Holding Pte Ltd. of Singapore, has
been completed and put into service, and the second 500-meter
wharf, being built by the same company, is scheduled for
completion at the end of this year with a total handling capacity
of 500,000 containers per year.
</P>
<P>
Another Singaporean company -- the Myanmar Integrated Port
services -- has also completed a wharf there.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Mitsui Company is building another industrial zone at
the Mingaladon area, about 18 kilometers from Yangon, utilizing 89
hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some other industrial zones in Yangon for local
entrepreneurs at Hlaingtharya, Shwepyithar and Dagon Myothit are
also being set up to boost domestic products and exports and
generate more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Of these, the Hlaingtharya Industrial Zone is regarded as the
most successful one with over 50 factories already set up by
local investors engaged in the food processing, textile,
engineering, electrical goods, chemical, forest products and
animal feed industries.
</P>
<P>
Multinational companies are also joining in the development of
the zone leasing land from the Myanmar Housing Development
Authorities and setting up factories making dairy products,
galvanized iron sheet and sanitary products.
</P>
<P>
In addition to those around the capital, industrial zones are
also planned in other parts of Myanmar, including Mandalay, Bago,
Myaungmya, Hinthada, Myeik, Yenangyaung and Pyay.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Myanmar plans to establish 17
industrial zones in the country.
</P>
<P>
The latest official statistics show that the country's growth
rate of the industrial sector was registered at 5.2 percent in
1996-97 fiscal year ending March and is targeted at 10 percent in
the next fiscal.

<HEADLINE> China's IPR Disputes Up: Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese courts nationwide have
handled 5,296 intellectual property rights (IPR) disputes in the
past 17 months and concluded 4,735 cases during the same period, a
senior judge said here today.
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits involving IPR disputes are on the rise, and the number
of disputes on rights violations is climbing, said Li Guoguang,
vice-president of the Supreme People's Court (SPC), at a press
conference today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of court battles over IPR
violations in 1996 was 11.8 percent higher than in 1995, and the
figure for the first five months this year had rocketed by 15.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
"The rising rate of litigation indicates that, on the one hand,
the IPR owners are more and more aware of the role of law and are
taking up legal means for the protection of their interests. On
the other hand, quite a small number of businesses are still
illegally exploiting other people's labor for their own profit,"
Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li claimed that Chinese courts' timely crackdowns on piracy and
other IPR violations have protected the legitimate rights of both
domestic and foreign owners of intellectual properties, and played
an important role in maintaining the country's economic order and
cultural markets.
</P>
<P>
According to the senior judge, such disagreements usually occur
in prosperous areas: In Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Guangdong
alone, IPR cases handled by local courts account for one fourth of
the total in the country.
</P>
<P>
And a variety of unexpected cases are emerging, ranging from
stealing geological prospecting results to theft of computer
software rights, Li said. And because rights violations are
sometimes intertwined with disputes on rights ownership and
contracts, it is sometimes difficult for a judge to make a ruling,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Also, the fact that these cases always involve hi-tech matters
and large sums of money causes even more headaches for judges.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said that to improve the legal system for
IPR protection, the Supreme People's Court has set up a special
IPR Court Office, and local courts now have similar organizations
and their own specialized personnel.
</P>
<P>
"Providing a sufficient judicial guarantee for IPR is a
long-term heavy task for the Chinese courts," Li admitted,
pledging that the Chinese courts will continue their tough stance
against IPR violations in the years to come.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Meets Israeli Opposition Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held a meeting today with visiting Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud
Barak on the stalled Mideast peace process, the Egyptian MENA news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Barak, on the second day of his two-day visit, will discuss
with Egyptian officials on the efforts to salvage the peace
process which came to a halt after Israel planned and broke ground
for the construction of a new Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa held talks with the Israeli
opposition leader on Tuesday evening, which he later described as
"favorable and constructive."
</P>
<P>
He called on Israel to halt the settlement project which has
triggered waves of Arab unrest in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to halt all practices that frustrate the
Palestinians and open the way to violence," Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Moussa, Barak expressed appreciation for
Egypt's effective role in the Mideast peace process and urged all
parties to work for resuming peace negotiations in a bid to stop
violence.
</P>
<P>
He added that stopping violence needs some effort by
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat, with whom
he had a telephone conversation Tuesday on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Both U.S. and Egyptian mediation efforts have so far failed to
get the two sides back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party decided two months ago to recognize the
Palestinians' right to self-determination and leave open the
possibility of establishing a Palestinian state, which has been
adamantly rejected by Israel's Likud government.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who was elected on June 4 to succeed former Labor Party
leader Shimon Peres, is widely regarded as the only person that
could pose a strong challenge to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Now the Labor is working to mobilize Israeli public opinion for
an early election which many hope will bring it back to power.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Stage Military Maneuvers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 20,000 Iranian military
forces are to launch a two-day maneuvers from July 31 to August 1
in Iran's southwestern province of Chaharmahal-Bakhtiyari, a
local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Jomhuri Islami said that the maneuvers,
code-named Ashura, will be jointly launched by the Islamic
Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) and the grassroots mobilization
forces, including women's battalions named Az-Zahra.
</P>
<P>
"The most active forces chosen during these maneuvers will
take part in the Fat-Hol-Mobin (Manifest Victory) grand maneuvers
which will be held before March 21, 1998," Brigadier Gholmreza
Solaymani was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention what kind of weapons will
be used and what purposes of the war games.
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's official news agency IRNA, the army's
ground forces have actively controlled any "unauthorized movement"
in the southern and western borders of the country.

<HEADLINE> Austria Pledges to Back Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima
said today that Austria supports Palestinians' efforts to push
further the Middle East peace process and would vote against
Israel in the United Nations and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat today, Klima
told reporters that Austria condemned Israel for building Jewish
settlements in the Palestinian occupied territories and supported
a Palestinian resolution calling for the United Nations sanctions
upon Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said he had assured Arafat that Austria would do its utmost
to help restart the Middle East peace negotiations, which broke up
in March when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered
construction of a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Klima said the international community should provide economic
aid and favorable investments needed by the Palestinians, who are
suffering an unbearable unemployment rate of 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the 90-minute talks, Klima and Arafat discussed
cooperation in irrigation, education, health care and
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who is in his first day of a two-day visit to Austria,
called for European intervention in the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing some troubles and I am looking to (Viktor
Klima), to Europe, to the international community to protect the
peace process. We are in need of help," Arafat said after meeting
Klima.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union should more and more push its role in the
peace process. We have reached a stalemate."
</P>
<P>
Before the trip to Vienna, Arafat had met British Prime
Minister Tony Blair in London, asking the European countries to
exert pressure on Israel by imposing economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Austria will both hold the European Union's
six-month rotating presidency next year.

<HEADLINE> Brutal Killer's Identity Confused in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The killer of 11 women in Tehran
has been officially identified as an Iranian man instead of
previously-described Afghan, giving a relief to the Afghan
community terribly fearful of a retaliation.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation by Iranian Interior Minister Ali Mohammed
Besharati came amid allegations by the Iranian press that the man,
identified by the Iranian police as Abdullah Abdurrahman, was from
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The man is from Qouchan city, Khorassan province, northeastern
Iran. His name is Gholamreza Khoshrouy Kouran Kordiyeh," Besharati
was quoted in Persian daily Akhbar today.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister said that the murderer had been
introduced as an Afghan because he gave conflicting accounts about
his identity.
</P>
<P>
Kordiyeh was arrested in Tehran two weeks ago and charged with
killing 11 Iranian women.
</P>
<P>
Posing as a night-time cab driver, Kordiyeh would drive his
female victims outside of the city. After raping and stabbing
them, he would burn their corpses, in an attempt to destroy the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian police has come under fire from the public for
issuing delayed warning to citizens of Kordiyeh's murders.
</P>
<P>
Since the publication of the murder story in the past two
weeks, the Afghan community in the country has lived under
constant fear of being retaliated for the murder blame.
</P>
<P>
The editorial published by Akhbar last week said that murders
and rapes by a group of Afghan criminals are an unfair way of
responding to what the paper called the gracious reception
offered by Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures issued by the Interior
Ministry, 1.28 million Afghans live in Iran. They have provided a
constant supply of cheap labor in fields like construction.

<HEADLINE> One Injured in Parcel Bomb Blast at Japan's TV Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A parcel bomb exploded at the
headquarters of Nippon Television Network Corp. here around noon
today, injuring one person, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
The parcel, addressed to Yumi Ida, one of Japan's most popular
female newscasters, exploded at about 12:05 on the third floor of
the building in Tokyo's Chiyoda Ward.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred when Masamichi Maeda, manager of the TV
company's department of services to viewers, tried to open the
envelope, which contained what appeared to be a video-cassette
tape, police said.
</P>
<P>
The blast left Maeda with wounds to his head and thumb.
</P>
<P>
The parcel, which reached the company Monday, had been sent to
the department handling services to viewers because the newscaster
claimed she had no idea of the sender of the parcel.
</P>
<P>
Police said they have launched an investigation into the case
on the basis of bodily injury and attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
In December 1994, a parcel sent to a popular child actress,
exploded at the TV station, leaving three people wounded. No
arrests have been made regarding that case.

<HEADLINE> International Funds To Help Protect China's Wetlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The UN sponsored Global
Environmental Facility (GEF) today started a project to help
protect China's wetlands, to which GEF will donate 18 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands are an important ecological system and regarded by
experts as the "kidney of the earth." Wetlands not only play a
crucial role in adjusting climate and controlling flood, but also
are home to many waterbirds and have rich bio-diversity resources.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhibao, vice-minister of forestry, today told a press
conference that the GEF's donation will be spent to better protect
several experimental nature reserves for wetlands in China.
</P>
<P>
These reserves include Xingkai Lake and Sanjiang Plain in
Heilongjiang Province, Yancheng in Jiangsu Province, Ruoergai in
both Sichuan and Gansu provinces, and East Dongting Lake in Hunan
province.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, these reserves for wetlands are all of
international importance.
</P>
<P>
China has some of the richest wetlands resources in the world,
the total area of which reaches 63 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
"So far, 152 natural reserves for wetlands have been
established in China," said the vice-minister, adding that the
protection of wetlands has been listed as one of the priorities on
China's 21st century agenda.

<HEADLINE> Australia Takes India to WTO over Trade Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia has challenged India in
the World Trade Organization (WTO) over more than 2700
quantitative trade restrictions applied by India on imports,
Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister For Trade Tim
Fischer announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Australia, along with several other countries including the
United States and New Zealand, has formally requested WTO
consultations with India on the issue, Fischer said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The restrictions are denying Australian exporters fair access
to the Indian market for a whole range of goods including
agricultural commodities, processed foods, precious stones,
automotive components, various electrical and mechanical items,
and textiles," the deputy prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the restrictions are "a major obstacle, and can no
longer be justified".
</P>
<P>
The Indian restrictions have been in place for about 50 years.
They were intended to provide India with a breathing space to
address balance of payments problems, but have become a permanent
feature of India's trade regime, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
"India no longer has a balance of payments problem... Its
foreign reserves are at record levels and the economy is
responding strongly to recent trade and financial liberalization,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the removal of these restrictions would give a further
boost to the Indian economy, Fischer argued.
</P>
<P>
Under WTO rules, India is required to replace its quantitative
restrictions with tariffs as soon as possible. But India insisted
on a seven-year phase-out period, with many agricultural products
of major interest to Australia not being subject to phase-out
until the very end of this period, he complained.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is prepared to accept a reasonable period for the
phase-out, but seven years is too long, and extensive negotiations
between India and its trading partners in WTO forums have made no
progress on this issue," the deputy prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said Australia would prefer an early resolution to the
issue through consultation, rather than pursuing it further in the
WTO Dispute Settlement Body.

<HEADLINE> Mandela, Chavalit to Boost Trade, Tourism Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 16 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela arrived here today on a two-day official visit, during
which trade and tourism will be among the main topics of
discussion between leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A Thai Foreign Ministry source said both sides feel that there
is ample room for the expansion of bilateral trade, which reached
10.39 billion baht (407 million US dollars) last year, with
Thailand incurring a 904 million baht (35.5 million dollar)
deficit.
</P>
<P>
The deficit was attributed to the lack of competitiveness of
Thailand's main exports -- textiles and garments, rice, frozen
chicken and canned seafood.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela and Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
would also discuss tourism cooperation. About 20,000 South African
tourists visited Thailand last year, while only 5,000 Thais
visited South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Chavalit will also exchange ideas about how best to
boost two-way investment, which has so far been very small.
</P>
<P>
The Thai side would also hope that business people of the two
countries would join forces to explore infrastructure investment
opportunities in Indochina.
</P>
<P>
The source also said Thailand would seek support from South
Africa for its bid for membership in the 14-member Indian ocean
rim.
</P>
<P>
Mandela will be granted an audience with King Bhumibol
Adulyadej later today and will be conferred on an honorary
doctorate degree of liberal arts at the Chulalongkorn university.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is scheduled to depart Thursday afternoon.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to the westward shift of
the State economic construction focus, Gansu has become a popular
destination for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry from
Japan, headed by Hotta Teruo, recently inspected Lanzhou, capital
of Gansu Province, in northwest China. Before coming to Lanzhou,
the delegation made an on-the-spot inspection of some other cities
in western China such as Chongqing, Chengdu and Urumqi.
</P>
<P>
After extensive discussions with officials and entrepreneurs in
the province, delegates said they had gained a better
understanding of investment policies and major fields of
investment available to them in the area.
</P>
<P>
They showed great interest in working with Gansu in the sectors
of retail trade, automobile and woollen textile.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been the fourth largest trade partner of Gansu. It
has built 59 enterprises there involving a total investment of
16.6 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have had successful partnerships in the fields of
education, scientific research, agriculture, water conservancy,
preservation of cultural relics and control of shifting sands.
</P>
<P>
Hotta Teruo noted after the inspection tour that the Chinese
government's attention to the economic development in the central
and western parts of the country has won the confidence of
Japanese businessmen.
</P>
<P>
He said his delegation was deeply impressed by the great
improvements made in the fields of transportation and
telecommunication in these cities in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He promised to organize more delegates from small and
medium-sized enterprises to visit this area in future.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Warn of Long Deadlock in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the rebel Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) today warned of a long deadlock in
its peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs, made the
warning following President Fidel Ramos' statement on Tuesday that
the government would not give in to the rebels' demand for the
pull-out of military troops in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"We are just being logical and practical," Murad said, adding
the government would have to wait a "proper time" before
re-opening the talks stalled by the military's recent operatives
against the MILF.
</P>
<P>
The MILF set four pre-conditions for the resumption of the
peace talks, including the withdrawal of government troops from
the areas of conflicting in Cotabato and Maguindanao provinces.
</P>
<P>
So far, the government has been positively acting on all the
demands except on the pull-out of troops which the MILF considers
as vital in breaking the impasse.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Murad also vehemently denied allegations that
his guerrillas shelled government troops in Buldon, Maguindanao
province on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that contrary to military reports, his troops did not
fire a single shot from any of their weapons. He added that the
mortars came from the military's position and landed in the MILF's
encampment.
</P>
<P>
"I investigated our mortars and rocket propelled grenades and

<P>
LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM) has been stripped of its special status and will from now
on pay taxes promptly like any others, Times of Zambia reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA)
acting Commissioner General Abraham Geevarghese as saying here
Sunday that in view of the on-going privatization of ZCCM, ZRA
has made it a policy to treat the conglomerate on an equal foot
with any other companies and will demand immediate settlement of
taxes from ZCCM.
</P>
<P>
He said previously ZCCM was given a longer period to pay its
taxes because of the size and nature of the company.
</P>
<P>
"Now with the privatization of ZCCM, we are asking them to pay
both tax and duty promptly like any body else, they will no
longer enjoy any privileges or special treatment," he said.

Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA) recently estimated the ZCCM
debt at two billion Kwacha (about 1.5 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Education in Patriotism Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of the
Central Military Commission, today emphasized the need to educate
people about the country's national defense system, paying
particular attention to patriotism.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also state councillor and minister of National Defense,
said that "the invigoration of the Chinese nation and the
reunification of the country require a powerful national defense
system."
</P>
<P>
Chi made the remarks while granting awards to a number of
departments in charge of education in national defense, as well as
some media and publishing organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Following more than 100 years of vicissitude, Hong Kong has
returned smoothly to China. The fundamental reason for its return
now is the strength of our country, including the strength of its
national defense," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
Though now is a time of great happiness in China, he reminded
people of the suffering caused by imperialist powers, China's
history of humiliation, and the sacred mission of safeguarding
national sovereignty, security and long-term stability with a
powerful defense system.
</P>
<P>
"In China today, patriotism is the love of socialist China
under the leadership by the Chinese Communist Party," he said,
calling for continued efforts to carry on the fine traditions of
the Chinese nation, safeguard national sovereignty, and contribute
to the socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen national defense is the duty of all government
departments, social institutions, businesses and citizens. Only
when the entire society pays attention to, cherishes and
supports national defense can the defense system become strong in
the real sense, Chi said.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, and Zhu Guangya, vice-chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), were present at the ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Katyusha Attack Launched in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Despite Israel's threat to erase a
cease-fire which Lebanon and Israel reached in April 1996, a fresh
volley of Katyusha rockets were fired into the so-called "security
zone" after midnight, with some landing in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the Israeli self-carved buffer zone in
south Lebanon said that some 20 Katyusha rockets were launched
Wednesday at the Israeli positions of Blat and Abbat in the
western sector of the border strip.
</P>
<P>
At least five rockets crashed across the border and landed in
northern Israel without causing casualties, the sources said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
No faction fighting the Jewish state in south Lebanon has
claimed responsibility for the Katyusha attack.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, which
spearheads a guerrilla warfare against the Israeli occupation in
south Lebanon, fired more than 15 Katyusha rockets into the
border strip Tuesday. One rocket exploded inside Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Two civilians were wounded when rockets hit Dimashkieh, four
kilometers west of the largest town of Marjayoun in the buffer
zone, the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia claimed.
</P>
<P>
The attack came after two Palestinian civilians residing in
south Lebanon were killed and a third wounded Monday in
bombardment by SLA militia in revenge for an earlier guerrilla
attack on a SLA patrol.
</P>
<P>
Later on Tuesday, the SLA-run Voice of the South radio warned
that civilians would be shelled if the Katyusha salvoes did not
stop, a declaration similar to an erasion of the cease-fire
understanding.
</P>
<P>
"So far, the IDF (Israeli Defense Force) has maintained
self-restraint and not fired directly at villages. But if
Hezbollah continues to breach the (April) understanding ... the
IDF will target civilians as a response for the shelling of
northern Israel," the radio quoted Amiran Levine, commander of
Israel's northern military area, as saying.
</P>
<P>
While the April understanding permits conflict between Israeli
troops, the SLA and resistance guerrilla troops, it rules out
harming both Lebanese and Israeli civilians.
</P>
<P>
Today's pre-dawn Katyusha attack took place several hours
before a meeting of the five-nation panel at the south Lebanon
border town of Naqoura to discuss two complaints filed by the
Lebanese government, the first over the shelling by Israeli
forces Saturday in which a 70-year-old farmer was killed, and
the second over Monday's bloody bombardment.
</P>
<P>
This will be the 14th meeting this year of the cease-fire
monitoring committee which groups representatives from France,
Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which is currently under the chairmanship of
the U.S. representative, normally calls for restraint between the
combatants rather than apportioning blame, leading both Lebanon
and Israel in the past to denounce its ineffectiveness.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in 1985 ostensibly to protect northern Israel from cross-border
attack.

<HEADLINE> New Bond Market Has Smooth Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The one-month old national
inter-bank bond trading system reported smooth operations and
active trading during the past 22 trading days.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover with the bond trading system amounted to 7.791
billion yuan, which broke down into 121 million yuan in spot
trading and 7.67 yuan in repurchasing volume.
</P>
<P>
The gross figure also translated into a daily average of 350
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the repurchasing mainly occurred in the
short-term policy-oriented financial bonds, with the repurchasing
interest rate generally below the rate on the inter-bank money
market and the past repurchasing rate of treasury bonds on the
stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
But they said the inter-bank bond trading market still needs to
expand further and have more active trading.
</P>
<P>
Banks also expressed the hope that the policy-oriented
financial bonds may become tradable and open market operation be
adopted to expand the market and improve its liquidity.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Introduces New Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Hungary will launch a multi-layer
pension system in 1998 to curb the government's rising pension
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Under a law passed by the parliament today, starting from 1998
workers will have to deposit seven percent of their income in
special pension savings accounts in banks to supplement the
pensions they receive from the government when they retire.
</P>
<P>
Of the seven percent of their income, six percent will go to
their individual pension savings accounts, which are stipulated as
personal property, and one percent to the state pension fund.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, their employers have to contribute an amount
of money equivalent to 24 percent of the payroll to the state
pension fund.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, young people beginning their jobs from July 1,
1998, have to choose the "individual pension savings account." But
current workers could opt for the new system or the existing one
under which the government pays an old-age pension to retirees.
</P>
<P>
The parliament attributed the need for the new law to an
increasing proportion of old people, unemployment and the failure
of the present pension system to satisfy social demands.

<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese doctor has invented a
treatment that can help drug addicts kick the habit within six to
eight hours.
</P>
<P>
The treatment, given by injection, was developed Dr. Yang
Guodong, who first began to work with heroin patients in his
laboratory in Ningbo, a port city in east China's Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
Since June 6, 15 heroin addicts including one from Taiwan have
overcome drug addition with the new treatment.
</P>
<P>
Made from traditional Chinese medicinal herbs, the treatment
can rapidly dissolve toxic elements in an addict's body. The shot
is said to be painless, as it puts patients to sleep. The
treatment does not cause loss of appetite or sleep.
</P>
<P>
The invention marks a breakthrough in Dr. Yang's research on
drug-rehabilitation medicine.
</P>
<P>
Yang Guodong's former therapy lasted from six to eight days,
during which the patient took one shot each day. So far it has
helped some 6,000 people overcome their drug addiction.

HARARE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean parliament on Tuesday
passed an emergency motion appealing to president Robert Mugabe
to meet ex-combatants who have staged a series of demonstrations
countrywide demanding payments under the beleaguered war victims
compensation fund.
</P>
<P>
In heated contributions to the motion by member of parliament
Jacobus De Wetg, the legislators, most of them also
ex-combatants, said only the president could solve the plight of
war veterans.
</P>
<P>
For the past two weeks, the ex-combatants have stormed state
house, the president's offices in the city, parliament building
and ruling Zanu (PF) headquarters, seeking audience with Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
One after another, the legislators sympathised with the war
veterans and said the president was the only one who could talk
to them and address their concerns to avert public disorder.
</P>
<P>
Even opposition Zanu (NDONGA) leader Ndabaningi Sithole said
the president "is the only person who can save the situation".
</P>
<P>
Mabvuku mp Pamela Tungamirai said if the president continued
to ignore the war veterans, he might destroy the unquestionable
loyalty, faith and confidence which most ex-combatants had for
the ruling Zanu (PF) leadership.

Meanwhile, South Africa's 3 billion USD trade surplus with
Africa also provided key support for the current account. Africa
currently accounts for about 15 percent of South Africa's total
exports (including gold).
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that South Africa, along with its partners in
the five-nation Southern Africa Customs Union, sold products
worth 2.8 billion USD to the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) countries last year, compared with 1995's 2.2
billion USD.
</P>
<P>
SADC countries, meanwhile, concluded sales worth 467 million
USD to South Africa last year, an improvement from 1995's 333
million USD.
</P>
<P>
Peace and pragmatism of policy makers are helping the SADC
region, with the World Bank estimates put that 37 out of 48
sub-Saharan African countries were undergoing substantial
reforms, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Earns 322 Million Dollars From Tourist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has realised a
considerable tourist revenue collection to the tune of 322.38
million US Dollars in the 1996/97 fiscal year, while 258.14
million US Dollars were recorded in the previous year, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Principal Tourist Information Officer of the Tanzania
Tourist Board (TTB), Johnson Manase, told reporters here on
Tuesday that the number of tourists arrivals rose from 293,834
people in 1995/96 to 326,194 people in 1996/97, with increased
rate of 11.1 percent between the two fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
The TTB officer further said the introduction of visa at the
main gate ways (at the border) launched early this year has
greatly reduced the bureaucracy that existed previously.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the problems facing the tourist sector, he said
poor infrastructural design in some tourist areas was the main
problem in the country, citing an example of the poor
Makuyuni-Ngorongoro road in Arusha, northern Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Ruling Party Raps Burning Voters Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) has condemned the continued burning
of voters cards by some opposition parties and warned that it
could impact negatively on the inter-party talks.
</P>
<P>
MMD national secretary Michael Sata said here on Tuesday that
it will be difficult for the ruling party to hold dialog with
those who have already taken a confrontational stance.
</P>
<P>
He wondered whether the National Patriotic Coalition (NPC)
grouping 12 opposition parties is serious about the inter-party
dialog as they have now taken to unconventional means after they
botched the talks brokered by the international Institute for
Democratic and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) with preconditions.
</P>
<P>
In the past three weeks the opposition parties' leaders have
held several joint rallies at which voters cards were burnt. The
opposition parties accused the government of rigging the election
process last year by asking an Israel computer company to compile
the voters register and issue the cards.
</P>
<P>
Sata said the MMD will not force them to a dialog table but
will try to have talks with other opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are still being made to have 23 other parties to
proceed with the inter-party talks, sata said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Fish Farming Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's fish farming industry
has made a modest recovery from a mere 1,000 ponds in 1987 to
about 3,000 ponds today, with the annual fish output hitting 180
tons, worth 60,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the local newspaper The People today, fish
farming sunk to the doldrum in Uganda in the 1970s in wake of
political turmoil after a boom in the 1960s whereby 11,000 ponds
peaked 800-900 tons of fish annually by 1968.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,200 farmers take part in fish farming throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
Their activities are backed by an increase in fish fry
production in breeding centers in some districts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Most Populous Province Meets Summer Grain Purchase Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province,
the most populous province and a major grain producer in China,
had bought and stored nearly three billion kg of wheat by July 10,
meeting the state quota for purchasing summer grain.
</P>
<P>
This year's summer harvest set a record in the province. To
encourage farmers to grow more grain, the provincial government
decided to buy grain at last year's price, which was 1.52 yuan per
kg, 10 percent higher than the state-set price, and to build more
grain warehouses.
</P>
<P>
The province needed 7.32 billion yuan for summer grain purchase,
and local financial departments and banks worked to raise enough
funding so that they would not give IOUs to farmers selling grain
to the government.
</P>
<P>
Now, the province has begun to buy any amount of grain
from farmers at market prices.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Opens Bank in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's TA Enterprises
has opened a bank in Johannesburg with the initial capital of 150
million Rand (33.3 million U.S. dollars), local daily the Citizen
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the Malaysian bank was a milestone in the
economic and trade relations between South Africa and Malaysia,
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian investment in South Africa had grown rapidly over
the last three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was recently ranked as South Africa's second largest
investor in terms of foreign direct investment, contributing 20.7
percent of an estimated 6.6 billion U.S. dollars since 1994.
</P>
<P>
TA Enterprise made its first move into South Africa's economy
in early 1996 when it acquired a stockbroking firm, known as TA
Securities.
</P>
<P>
TA Bank is South Africa's 11th foreign bank. There are also
seven branches, and 58 representative offices of foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
Manuel described the increasing foreign investment in South
Africa as a vote of confidence in the South African government's
ability to facilitate and protect investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
There has been an upswing in business confidence as a result
of the government being seen to meet its commitments in
relaxation of foreign exchange controls, Manuel added.
</P>
<P>
South Africa announced last month a program to relax foreign
exchange control, allowing individuals to invest up to 44,444
U.S. dollars abroad as of July 1. There has been no sudden
outflow of capital.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Parliament Fails to Approve No-Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Kuwaiti
parliamentary members (MP) failed to depose Finance Minister
Nasser Abdullah Al-Roudhan after a session of intense questioning
and accusations last night about his alleged negligence and
mismanagement of public funds.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti MPs Sami Al-Munayes, Mishari Al-Osaimi and Ahmed
Al-Mulaifi who had initiated a grilling request of Al-Roudhan,
also deputy prime minister, failed to secure the ten signatures
needed to submit a non-confidence motion against the minister.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one of the 50 deputies voted to close the stormy
debate without any result.
</P>
<P>
Support for a vote of non-confidence by 24 of 46 elected MPs
in the 50-seat National Assembly would have forced Al-Roudhan to
resign.
</P>
<P>
During the 13-hour debate, Al-Roudhan was accused by the MPs
of failing to implement certain laws, negligence in protecting
public funds while he allowed others to use public properties
irrespective of proper returns.
</P>
<P>
Al-Roudhan made replies to ten issues presented in the queries
and said "this is a good opportunity for me to prove that I
entered the cabinet with a clean white robe," apparently
suggesting that he was innocent of the accusations.
</P>
<P>
Questioning Al-Roudhan, the 12th of its kind since the first
Kuwaiti parliament in 1963, is the first one conducted to a
current cabinet minister by the parliament which was elected in
October last year.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, expressed his thanks to the
lawmakers who supported Al-Roudhan, while saying the grilling was
a constitutional right.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped people would not consider the grilling as a
victory for some persons or a defeat to others.
</P>
<P>
The three MPs who initiated the questioning vowed to continue
their battle with the "thieves of public funds" and warned
against "further embezzlements."

<HEADLINE> Dustbins Disappearing in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Dustbins in the Chinese capital,
which are usually placed in residential areas, are being gradually
replaced by enclosed garbage collection centers.
</P>
<P>
The city produces an average of 13,000 tons of garbage each
day. Last year, the total amount of garbage exceeded 4.8 million
tons. Beijing is surrounded by 7,000 landfills and more than 500
hectares of farmland have been covered by garbage.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the municipal government made changes to the
traditional method of garbage collection, asking residents to
place their trash in plastic bags, haul the bags to public trash
carts, which are then taken to the collection centers.
</P>
<P>
By last October, the Xicheng District in Beijing had stopped
using the dustbins and set up 80 collection centers, said an
official from the Municipal Sanitation Department.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the Dongcheng and Xuanwu districts and
95 percent of the streets in the suburban areas would get rid of
the dustbins this year.
</P>
<P>
Some districts in Beijing launched a pilot project last October
for collecting different kinds of garbage in different bags.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that this new method both promotes recycling of
resources and is pollution-free.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 1,200 tons of paper can be recycled from
the 1,500 tons of waste paper discarded by Beijing residents each
day, while the amount of gasoline refined from plastic products
thrown away each day would be enough for 30,000 cars to run 100
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
However, the municipal government is facing a shortage of funds
for the collection work.
</P>
<P>
Every day, the city must operate more than 3,000 garbage
trucks, and the transport of each truckload from a residential
quarter to a garbage collection center on the outskirts costs 400
yuan on average.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Municipal Sanitation Department advise that
fees should be collected from all the units and residents in
Beijing, including the migrant population, so that the amount of
garbage will be controlled and enough funding will be raised to
develop new methods of trash collection.

WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- World number two Michael Chang
survived a scare in his opener at the ATP Washington Classic
tennis tournament before coming back to capture a second-round

The defending champion beat 155th-ranked Mexican qualifier Luis

subduing Herrera with a forehand smash on his 10th match point.
</P>

The American then advanced to a third-round match on Thursday
against 163rd-ranked fellow American Michael Joyce, who ousted
South Africa's Neville Godwin 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (8-6).
</P>

<P>
QINGDAO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The scenic seaside city of Qingdao
has emerged as a leading Chinese tourist destination with a
colorful range of sites and activities for visitors.
</P>
<P>
Long known as a sightseers' paradise, Qingdao in east China's
Shandong Province has become a likely choice for vacationers and
people on business trips.
</P>
<P>
With a combination of Chinese and Western architecture and
beautiful hilly and beach front scenery, the well-preserved old
urban area of Qingdao is also popular, and travelers there can visit
historic buildings, museums, cathedrals, shop at trendy department
stores, and swim in the sea.
</P>
<P>
The Taoist temples at Mount Laoshan, located about 30
kilometers away, are also a favorite.
</P>
<P>
People making return visits to Qingdao are usually surprised to
see how the city's beautiful coastline has been extended as a
result of the emergence of the new business area to the east which
is lined with skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
Five-star hotels with all the amenities have been built in this
area, as well as holiday resorts complete with golf courses.
</P>
<P>
The annual "Qingdao International Beer Festival" held in
summer has also become a big draw for both Chinese and foreign
beer lovers and investors.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures show that in the first five months of this year,
Qingdao received 61,306 overseas tourists who generated tourism
earnings of 28.09 million US dollars, a rise of 13.34 percent and
12.4 percent, respectively, over the same period last year.

BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to implement
the contract household responsibility system in its rural areas
for another 30 years, the latest issue Business News quoted
Minister of Agriculture Liu Jiang as saying.
</P>
<P>
He made this remark during a recently convened meeting that was

municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The country's general economic conditions were satisfactory in
the first half of this year with the output of summer grain
reaching a record high, Jiang said. He noted that China's grain
stock has reached internationally standardized "safe line," with
its population securing an average per capita grain of 400 kg..
</P>
<P>
He attributed these unprecedented achievements to the household
contract responsibility system that benefits both farmers and the
country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also stressed that local governments should guide farmers
to invest in sideline product processing industries and protect
farmers' enthusiasm for production by deepening reforms in the
sales and marketing of farm products.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Extends Cease-fire With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
extended an interim cease-fire with the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) for another seven days to give the rebel group ample
time to return to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
Arnulfo G. Acedera, chief of the Philippine Armed Forces, told
reporters that the cease-fire was extended at the request of
Governor Nur Misuari of the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao
(ARMM), who visited the presidential palace on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Acedera, Misuari relayed the message that the MILF
was ready to return to the peace talks as long as the cease-fire
will be extended anew.
</P>
<P>
The government declared the unilateral three-day cease-fire
with the MILF on July 9. When it expired, Manila extended the
cease-fire for four more days.
</P>
<P>
Acedera pointed out that the government has extended the
cease-fire for the second time to give the MILF more time to
examine its position in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The MILF suspended its peace talks with the government two
weeks ago after government forces intensified its military
operation against the Muslim rebel group in Central Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The government accused the MILF of kidnapping businessmen and
residents in Central Mindanao and launched the offensive last
month. About 200 government soldiers and rebels were killed in the
month-long fighting.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has become the major rebel group in the Philippines
after the government and Misuari's Moro National Liberation Front
signed an accord on peace in Mindanao last September.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement was rejected by the MILF, which vowed to
continue its fighting for an independent Muslim state in the
Southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Misuari is now acting as a mediator between the government and
the MILF.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Block Grants for Preventing Juvenile Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States House of
Representatives Tuesday voted to provide states with block grants
for preventing juvenile crime rather than funding programs.
</P>
<P>
The bill would combine the programs into a single source of
money for the states. The states would also gain broader
flexibility in designing anti-crime initiatives, and catering to
their particular needs.
</P>
<P>
The bill, now advancing to the Senate, appropriates no money.
It merely authorizes creation of the block grant.
</P>
<P>
The House Appropriations Subcommittee responsible for the
Department of Justice voted last week to spend 238 million dollars
on programs to fight juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the prospective law complemented get-tough
legislation that passed the House in May because it focuses on
preventing crime.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, states could use up to 15 percent of their
block-grant money to renovate or replace juvenile facilities. The
measure also reauthorizes programs to serve runaway and homeless
youth, as well as the National Missing Children Center.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Begins to Implement Ninth Five-Year Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Nepal today began to implement
the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002), with poverty alleviation as
its major objective.
</P>
<P>
The ninth plan aims to lower the poverty percentage from 45 to
32.5 and eventually dropping it to 10 in 20 years' time.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the emphasis has been laid on production, food
security, employment, increase in income, supply of fertilizers,
irrigation, rural roads, electricity and technology.
</P>
<P>
And a special Poverty Alleviation Fund of 40 million rupees
(about 700,000 U.S. dollars) will be set up.
</P>
<P>
Poverty alleviation has been one of the main objectives of the
past plans.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the efforts in the last 40 years, more and
more Nepalese are slipping below the poverty line every year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say to achieve the goal of poverty alleviation as set
in the ninth plan, the development strategies, the management and
implementation aspects of these procedures need urgent reforms.
</P>
<P>
They also doubt the feasibility of a 6.5 percent growth rate
envisaged in the ninth plan due to limited resources.

DHAKA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The flood situation further improved
in greater Sylhet and southern Chittagong and the hill tracts
regions while diarrhea and dysentery broke out in Bandarban hill

NANNING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Bose, an important historic city
known for its natural beauty and rich folklore, is expected to
become a popular tourist destination with the completion of a
major railway trunk line.
</P>
<P>
Located at the banks of the scenic Chengpi Lake, Bose, in
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is home to
various ethnic minority groups such as the Zhuang, Yao, Miao and
Yi. The city is best-known as a site of a Red Army uprising led by
Deng Xiaoping in December, 1929.
</P>
<P>
The Nanning-Kunming Railway, which runs between the capital of
Guangxi and capital of neighboring Yunnan, is now in trial
operation. Officials not only expect it to bring more tourists to
Bose, but also link the prefecture with other major attractions
elsewhere in Guangxi, and in Yunnan and Guizhou, according to Xie
Xueming, deputy director of Bose prefecture Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
To cater to the upcoming tourist boom, several trans-regional
routes have been worked out, featuring such attractions as the
Bose Uprising Ruins, local ethnic folklore, visits to major
industrial projects, Huangguoshu Waterfall in Guizhou, and Stone
Forest in Yunnan, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
Tourists are urged to visit Bose during the colorful festivals
held by local ethnic groups, such as the slope-jumping festival of
the Miao people, the bow-jumping and torch festivals of the Yi
people, and horse-racing and tree-worshiping festivals of the
Gelao minority, Xie noted.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Primakov Announces Agenda for New York Ministerial Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov today announced the agenda for the Russia-NATO
ministerial meeting scheduled for September in New York.
</P>
<P>
Primakov made the announcement at a joint press conference here
after talking with his German counterpart, Klaus Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministerial meeting was to address issues such as
the Bosnian situation, peacekeeping mission, international fight
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
It would also explore the possibility of setting up a force
made up of both Russian and NATO troops, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Russia-NATO partnership council, set up under a landmark
pact signed in May giving Moscow a say in some of NATO's affairs,
is to hold its first ministerial meeting in New York alongside the
United Nations' General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Last week NATO's Madrid summit decided to invite the Czech
Republic, Hungary and Poland to join the military alliance,
sparking bitter criticism from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Primakov denounced the expansion plan as the alliance's
"biggest mistake" in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Before Kinkel's visit, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook flew to Moscow
to try to massage bruised relations with Russia. The coming
ministerial meeting in New York is another chance for them to
coordinate their relations.

BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region has put the finishing touches on an ambitious
plan to build the largest wind power generating base in Asia,
according to the latest edition of the Beijing-based China
Economic Herald.
</P>
<P>
The recent unification of the Dabancheng No.1 Wind Power Plant,
the Dabancheng No.2 Wind Power Plant in Urumqi, the region's
capital, and the Tuohongtai Wind Power Plant in Buerjin County,
has turned Xinjiang into the largest wind power base in China,
with more than 25,000 kw of installed capacity, accounting for 44
percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
The region will install another 66 wind power generators at the
Dabancheng No.2 Wind Power Plant, some 80 km away from Urumqi, to
have a total installed capacity of 70,000 kw -- the largest in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is rich in wind energy and has nine strong wind areas
with 800 billion kwh of wind resources. In 1989, the region
established the Dabancheng No.1 Wind Power Plant, using donations
from the Denmark government to purchase equipment, and under an
aid project by the German government.
</P>
<P>
The No.1 plant has 22 generators with an installed capacity of
6,100 kw. The No. 2 plant was built there later.

<P>
BELGRADE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Politicians here welcome Slobodan
Milosevic's election Tuesday as president of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia, saying it is an event conducive to the political
stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic contributed to national peace and stability during
its transitional period, said Milutin Stojkovic, chairman of the
parliamentarian group of the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
And therefore his election is of great historical and political
significance to the whole country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zeljko Sturanovic, chairman of the parliamentarian group of the
ruling Socialist Democratic Party of the Republic of Montenegro,
said Milosevic's election is conducive to the stability of the
federal republic, and to enhancing the alliance of the ruling
parties of Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics that form the
federal republic.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with them, Momcilo Perisic, chief of general staff of
the Yugoslav army, noted that the election shows the political
will of citizens of the federal republic to live in a stable

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Denies Change of Monetary System After ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Lieutenant-General
Khin Nyunt has denied that his country would change its monetary
system after becoming a member of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Rumors have been circulating here that Foreign Exchange
Certificate (FEC), which is equivalent to the U.S. dollar in value
and widely circulated on the Myanmar market, would be withdrawn
and foreign exchange deposited in the banks by people be seized by
the government after Myanmar's entry into ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is scheduled to be admitted into ASEAN later this month
at the regional grouping's annual ministerial meeting in Kuala
Lumpur according to a decision made at a special meeting of ASEAN
foreign ministers on May 31.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting here Tuesday of Myanmar's Leading
Committee for ASEAN Affairs, Khin Nyunt, who is first secretary of
the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council and chairman of
the committee, urged the public not to believe the rumors spread
by a group of "unscrupulous elements."
</P>
<P>
He said the rumors about the financial and economic matters
afloat among the Myanmar people currently are totally untrue, the
official newspaper the New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
FEC was introduced in Myanmar in 1993 for the convenience of
foreigners visiting and doing business in the country since hard
currency is not allowed for circulation domestically.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar authorities have already denied that the country's
200- and 500-Kyat bank notes would also be withdrawn and replaced
by new ones, saying that there was no such plan and that the
rumors are completely unfounded.
</P>
<P>
The market exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the
Myanmar Kyat has risen sharply compared with two months ago,
trading at one U.S. dollar to more than 250 Kyats, up from one to
about 150.

<HEADLINE> Rising Employment in Service Trade in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The service sector now plays an
increasingly important role in Shanghai's economic growth, with
nearly half of local employees involved in the industry, a big
rise from the 20 percent reported in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the number of employees in the city's industrial
sector accounts for 52 percent of the local total, a drop from 70
percent in 1990, when the industrial enterprises were the major
source of employment.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the positive shift of workers from manufacturing to
service jobs is a result of technological improvements and the
restructuring of industrial setups in enterprises. The change in
employment distribution in Shanghai will contribute to the
city's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai officials say they will give priority to the
development of the service trade for a long period of time, in a
bid to alleviate the existing employment problem.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the China's opening-up policies, the city has
readjusted its economic setup, with the service trade topping the
list, followed by industry and agriculture, according to local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Output value of the service trade is expected to make up more
than two-thirds of the local GNP in the future, up from the
current 44 percent.

<P>
HAIKOU, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A blue whale swam aground and died
on a beach of Yadang Bay in south China's Hainan Province, a large
island separated from the mainland by the Qiongzhou Strait.
</P>
<P>
The whale was found by local fishermen in Chengmai County, who
were frightened by the blood-stained water and the immensity of
the mammal, which was 11 meters long, 1.7 m wide and 1.2 m tall.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the local aquatic products bureau agreed that the
whale weighed six to seven tons.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen also spotted another giant sea mammal swimming
alone nearby, and the experts speculated that it was the dead
whale's mate.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that this kind of whale has been found
in the sea area of Qiongzhou Strait, as most blue whales live in
northern Pacific Ocean, according to the experts.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Pollution and poaching in the
Antarctic pose a serious threat to fish and migratory birds there,
scientists warned today.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the University of Auckland in New Zealand
discovered a large number of sick fish close to the McMurdo Base,
in the Antarctic. The sickness was caused by pollution created by
human activities.
</P>
<P>
The population of McMurdo Base, by the Ross Ice Shelf, grew to
1,000 people in summer and today there are tons of fuel, machinery
and all kinds of garbage in the region.
</P>
<P>
Specialists said that the low temperature in the Antarctic
impeded the normal growth of micro organisms that degrade wastes.
So all the rubbish dumped there maintained its toxic potential for
several years.
</P>
<P>
Another threat to species is hunting. Owing to this, masses of
migratory birds disappeared, United States scientists said.

<P>
MANAGUA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- As part of the integration
program, customs and migratory services on the borders of the
Central American countries will operate 24 hours a day starting
August 15, Nicaragua's Press Secretariat said today.
</P>
<P>
The measure, initiated by Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman,
was approved at a summit of Central American presidents held in
Panama last weekend.
</P>
<P>
"One thing that took off at the summit and sparked a lot of
interest was the idea of keeping Central American and Panamanian
borders open 24 hours a day," said Aleman upon his return from
Panama.
</P>
<P>
"All six countries, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua,
El Salvador and Panama, are in agreement with this course of
action, which will facilitate the job of truck drivers," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is going to save a lot of money for the
truck drivers of the region who used to have to wait a long time
until the borders were opened.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica to Launch Program Against Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A national program to combat
child labor in Costa Rica will be given a big push in the next
three weeks by different national institutions.
</P>
<P>
A national committee will be set up to draw up rules.
</P>
<P>
Among other measures, Costa Rica will adapt its labor law to
international norms and revise its educational system.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's labor code sets the minimum working age at 12, as
compared to the 15-year-old norm of the international practice.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica decided to revise its educational system as experts
found that poverty is not the main reason for child labor.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that less than a fifth of the 150,000-strong
child labor force in the Central American country work because of
extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
Experts said it is the cultural norms which oblige males to be
the bread earners of the household that has a decisive effect on
child labor.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Achieve 10 percent Increase in GDP This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China's largest industrial city
of Shanghai is trying to score a 10 percent increase in gross
domestic product (GDP) this year, the Shanghai-based Business News
quoted Mayor Xu Kuangdi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's GDP -- the value of goods and services produced --
amounted to 154.36 billion yuan during the first half of this
year, a 13.7 percent increase from the same period in 1996,
 fulfilling half of the annual target.
</P>
<P>
The city will rely primarily on the service sector to achieve
the expected GDP growth, and is taking steps to enable the sector
to contribute about 45 percent to the GDP, with priority given to
such industries as tourism, commerce, real estate, and post and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The city government will continue to improve the internal
structure of the service sector, in a bid to spur the development
of other sectors, Xu said.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's central bank
predicted that the country's fiscal deficit will increase next

<HEADLINE> Southwest China City Taking on New Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Chengdu, capital of southwest
China's Sichuan Province, plays an increasingly important role in
the local development after the provincial largest city of
Chongqing became China's fourth municipality on March 14.
</P>
<P>
With a history of 2,300 years, Chengdu was one of China's first
24 cities granted by the central government the status of famous
historical and cultural city.
</P>
<P>
An important city in southwest China, Chengdu was given
approval in 1992 to become an inland open city enjoying the same
preferential policies as coastal open cities.
</P>
<P>
One year later, Chengdu was defined by the central government
as southwest China's scientific, technological, commercial, trade
and financial center and a transportation and communications hub.
</P>
<P>
Except for geographical disadvantages, the city with a
population of 9.8 million has advantages of its own. Thanks to its
booming consumer goods market, the city now ranks third among
China's 14 largest cities in terms of the open market trade volume
and the number of business people and establishments.
</P>
<P>
Located on the fertile West Sichuan Plain, Chengdu is an
important grain, oil, meat, and vegetable production base. It also
has a solid industrial foundation and a comprehensive industrial
system built up on the basis of such mainstay industries as
machinery, electronics, telecom, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and
food-stuffs.
</P>
<P>
The city has 20 higher education institutions and about 440,000
scientists and technicians.
</P>
<P>
The city's financial sector had made a breakthrough in opening
up to the outside world in recent years. Eight renowned foreign
banking institutions have opened representative offices in
Chengdu, together with a branch set up here by the Overseas
Chineses Banking Corp. of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The city has made great effort to improve its investment
environment. This helps the city attract more than 2.4 billion US
dollars of contracted overseas funds from more than 30 countries
and regions by the end of last year.

KIEV, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will launch Sea Breeze-97
naval exercise with the United States and other North Atlantic
Treaty Organization navies as scheduled, from August 25 to 31.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Defense Minister Alexander Kuzmuk said on Tuesday
that the Black Sea exercise aims to provide humanitarian aid after
devastating earthquakes in nearby countries.
</P>
<P>
Every preparation for the operation has been completed, he said.

<P>
The exercise will be held within the framework of the Program

The leftists-dominated parliament is now planning a law which

"Ukraine's non-alignment and neutrality status does not mean

Moreover, the exercise will be solely sponsored by the United
States, and Ukraine does not need to spend a cent, he added. The
U.S. force will include marines and ships from the U.S. Sixth

<HEADLINE> East China Province to Open Wider to Outside World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- East China's coastal province of
Shandong will adopt a series of new measures to gear up the local
economic growth by further opening to the outside world and
expanding channels for overseas funds, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
Shandong must seize the present opportunity to push its economy
forward by internationalizing the local economy, the paper quoted
Wu Guanzheng, secretary of the provincial Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wu called on local leading officials to pay closer attention
to the open-up efforts and introduce more overseas funds into
projects with higher economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Some local state enterprises should enhance their economic
strength by making full use of overseas funds and resources, in a
bid to increase their shares of overseas markets, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the export of local traditional products, mostly
farm and sideline products, the province will increase the
shipment of high-value-added and manufactured products, instead of
selling its raw materials and primary products as in the past.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities are also urged to adopt much more flexible
policies, in a bid to enable the province to increase the direct
use of overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that some of the province's state enterprises will be
turned into joint-stock companies to allow overseas investors to
buy shares, and others will be jointly selling stocks abroad to
raise badly needed funds.

With the departure of these soldiers, the U.N. peacekeeping
force in the region would be downsized to 2,500, which would be
further reduced to 720 by October 15, according to Major General
Willy Hanset, commander of the U.N. force.

<P>
And all U.N. troops will leave by January 15, 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Slovenia was once seized by rebelling Serbs who opposed
the independence of Croatia from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached at the end of 1995, it would return
to Croatia after a maximum of two years of U.N. administration.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Monday adopted a resolution
extending the mandate of UNTAES to January 15, 1998, by which date
the administration of Eastern Slovenia would be fully assumed by
the Croatian government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the farewell ceremony, Jacques Klein from the
UNTAES said that U.N. troops had achieved a lot in the past 18
months, including demilitarizing the region and creating security
environment for local elections, thus paying the way for a
peaceful solution to one of the major problems in the Balkan
region.

<HEADLINE> Program Set for Ukrainian Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 15 (Xinhua) -- President Leonid Kuchma published a
seven-point program on Tuesday to speed up Ukraine's
market-oriented economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The basic reason for the present economic crisis, Kuchma said,
is the lack of clear guiding lines. Various sectors of economy had
different ideas, leading to a chaos of the country's economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
The market-oriented economic reforms are the fundamental
measures to save the country from worsening economic crisis, said
Kuchma, who made similar proposals back in October 1994, but
achieved no apparent success.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Ukrainian government to tighten macro-economic
control, ignoring wide-spread complaints about over-regulation.
</P>
<P>
"It's too early and too dangerous to expect the market to
self-adjust its functions," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian economy slipped by about 10 percent in 1996 and
is still declining, though at a slower speed.

SARAJEVO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on Tuesday reported an explosion
Monday night near the apartment of an OSCE international employee
in Banja Luka, northern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The explosive device was detonated around 1:40 a.m. local time
(0040 GMT) outside an apartment building. It shattered the windows
of the OSCE worker's residence on the ground floor, OSCE spokesman
David Foley said. No one was hurt in the blast.
</P>
<P>
This was the second incident in two days involving the OSCE in
the Serb entity since NATO's operation to catch war crime suspects
there. But it was not clear whether the blast was targeted at the
OSCE personnel.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, an OSCE pickup was destroyed just outside its office
in Zvornik by a bomb placed beneath the car engine.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the successive occurrence of explosions involving
OSCE, Foley said that it "is troubling and causes considerable
concern."

<HEADLINE> Low Inflation Keeps Interest Rate Subsidy at Zero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China,
China's central bank, since May has set the interest rate subsidy
for long-term deposits at zero, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an official with the central bank as saying
that the move was made because the country has since 1996 kept the
inflation rate lower than the interest rate of bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
China's inflation rate was two percent in the first five months
of this year, while the interest rate for fixed one-year deposits
is 7.47 percent.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate subsidy, paid on top of normal interest rates
on deposits of more than three years, was 0.17 percent in April
and 0.94 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate subsidy was introduced in China twice during
the past decade to attract long-term bank deposits during a period
of high inflation.
</P>
<P>
China stopped paying subsidies on new deposits as of April last
year because inflation has been easing. The subsidy is still paid
on long-term deposits made before April last year.
</P>
<P>
The official said the central bank would continue to calculate
the subsidy rate according to the national commodity retail and
service price index supplied by the State Statistics Bureau.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says NATO Expansion Good for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The expansion of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will create significant
opportunities for the U.S. to expand markets in the former Warsaw
Pact countries, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Through the expansion, the U.S. underscores its role as a major
player in European security decisions, Undersecretary Stuart
Eizenstat told a press conference at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that prospects for American business will be
enhanced in an area eager to make deals with the U.S. and the U.S.
will get economic benefit from it, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The mere fact that we are there, that we are a physical
presence _ obviously we're also a large purchasing presence in
Europe _ when you have 100,000 troops you do create a significant
economic presence, which is important," he said.
</P>
<P>
The news conference was part of a campaign by the Clinton
administration to sell the expansion of NATO to the U.S. public
and to seek the approval of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member NATO decided to accept Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic as new members at its special summit in Madrid
last week.
</P>
<P>
But many lawmakers in the U.S. opposed the expansion, arguing
that the Cold War has ended and there is no more enemy for the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat said that there are "tremendous infrastructure needs"
by the new members in environmental and telecommunication areas.
"This offers fantastic opportunities."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there are also military sales opportunities,
although we don't emphasize these," he added.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that U.S. weapons dealers have actually started
negotiations on the purchase of U.S.-made weapons by the Central
and Eastern European nations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UN Members Condemn Continuous Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Overwhelming majority of
some 40 speakers at the UN General Assembly today condemned
Israel's continuous construction of settlements at Jebel Abu
Ghneim and other illegal activities in occupied Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the resumed 10th Emergency Special Session of the
General Assembly, Nasser Al-Kidwa, permanent observer for
Palestine, said that the Israeli government had resumed colonial
settlement in order to acquire more Palestinian land by force,
seize the city of Jerusalem and impose its will on the Palestinian
people. To achieve that, it was trying to exert as much pressure
as possible, including economic suffocation and a defamation
campaign against the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Palestinian people had made many
concessions with respect to their historic rights in their
homeland in order to achieve peace. The Palestinian people and
leaders were still committed to their strategic decision to engage
in the peace process and to uphold their agreements with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ibra Deguene Ka of Senegal, chairman of the Committee on the
Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, said
that Israel was implementing illegal measures to alter Jerusalem's
character, legal status and demographic composition, including
attempts to deal with Palestinian Jerusalemites as "resident
immigrants."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Rights Committee condemned all resort to
violence, particularly against civilians, and recalled that the
peace process had made progress because both parties had agreed to
the basic principle of land for peace. He urged the international
community to stem and reverse the downward spiral in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the Arab Group, Nabil A. Elaraby of Egypt
said that Secretary-General Kofi Annan's report indicated that an
avalanche of illegal measures had been taken by the Israeli
government in the occupied territories. Such activities, which
contradicted Israel's own commitments, dealt a fatal blow to
peace. Israel had imposed obstacles on the Secretary-General's
intended mission to the territories; the international community
must reject such lack of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
F.A. Shamim Ahmed of Bangladesh said that three months ago the
international community had called on Israel to cease its
construction of illegal settlement at Jebel Abu Ghneim. Sadly,
Israel had ignored that call. It had also continued its
economically crippling policies, with a view to eroding the
capacity of the Palestinian people to survive as an independent
community. The Israeli government was following a deliberate
policy of destroying the peace process, with a view to depriving
the Palestinian people of any mechanisms to pursue their goal of
establishing a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Ali Sulaiman R. Al-Saeid of Kuwait called on the international
community to support the peace process by demanding that Israel
stop building settlements at Jebel Abu Ghneim and other occupied
areas. Israel should be asked to cease all illegal administrative
measures in Jerusalem, to accept the application of the Fourth
Geneva Protocol to the occupied territories, and to implement
Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 and other relevant
international instruments.
</P>
<P>
Hasmy Agam of Malaysia urged Israel to understand the
importance of keeping promises and honoring treaties and
agreements into which it had willingly entered. It must heed the
voice of the Assembly and respect the expressed will of the
international community. Member states with close relations to
Israel should counsel the Israeli government to act responsibly.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls on Halting Support for Israeli Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The UN General Assembly
today adopted a resolution requesting UN member states to halt any
support for Israeli settlements in occupied territories and ban
imports produced in the settlements.
</P>
<P>
Following a recent report of Secretary-General Kofi Annan that
Israel had not abandoned construction at Jebel Abu Ghneim, the
resumed 10th emergency special session of the General Assembly
condemned the failure of the Israeli government to comply with the
demands in resolution ES-10/2 made by the General Assembly at its
10th emergency special cession on April 25.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted with 131 votes in favor, 3 against
(Israel, Micronesia and the U.S.) and 14 abstentions, the assembly
also condemned the lack of cooperation of the Israeli government
and its attempts to impose restrictions upon mission of the
special envoy of the UN Secretary-General to Israel and the
occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming that all illegal Israeli actions in occupied
territories remained illegal and could not be recognized
irrespective of the passage of time, the assembly reiterated the
demands made in its resolution ES-10/2, in particular the
immediate and full cessation of the construction of a new
settlement at Jebel Abu Ghneim, and of all other Israeli
settlement activities, as well as of all illegal measures and
actions in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly demanded that Israel immediately cease and
reverse all actions taken illegally under international law
against Palestinian Jerusalemites and their natural rights.
</P>
<P>
Hinting at a future attempt to suspend Israel from the
185-member General Assembly, the resolution stressed that all
member states, "in order to ensure their rights and benefits
resulting from membership, should fulfil in good faith the
obligations assumed by them in accordance with the provisions of
the Charter of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
The assembly recommended convening of a conference by parties
to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which bars settlements in
occupied territory, to ensure respect for the convention.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly also called for reinjecting momentum into
the stalled Middle East peace process, and for the implementation
of the agreements reached between Israeli government and the
Palestine Liberation Organization, as well as for the upholding of
the principles of the process, including the exchange of land for
peace.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of over 40 countries spoke at today's meeting.
Overwhelming majority condemned Israel's illegal activities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Asylum for Swiss Bank Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
representatives today approved a bill granting asylum to a Swiss
bank guard who saved precious Holocaust-era documents from a paper
shredder.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed by a voice vote. A similar legislation was
approved by the Senate in May.
</P>
<P>
Christophe Meili, 29, when working in a Swiss bank in January,
found documents dating to the Holocaust during the Second World
War. The bank had planned to destroy the documents.
</P>
<P>
Meili secretly rescued some of them and passed them to a Jewish
organization. Swiss prosecutors say Meili may have violated the
country's strict bank secrecy laws and could be jailed.
</P>
<P>
Feeling not safe in his native country of Switzerland, Meili
and his family fled to the U.S. in April.

<HEADLINE> UN Court Sentences Serb Innkeeper to 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A Bosnian Serb was sentenced
Monday in the Hague by a United Nations tribunal to 20 years in
prison for killing and torturing his Muslim and Croatian neighbors
during the Bosnian civil war.
</P>
<P>
The male innkeeper, Dusan Tadic, will serve behind the bars a
total of 97 years for 11 separate war crimes and crimes against
humanity. But the longest term was 20 years and the others were to
run concurrently.
</P>
<P>
The judge said that Tadic had beaten his victims "intentionally
and with sadistic brutality, using knives, weapons, iron bars, the
butt of a pistol, sticks and by kicking."
</P>
<P>
The defendant even once tightened a noose around the neck of a
prisoner to make the person unconscious, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
The sentence was the first handed down by an international
court after a full-length trial since the years after World War
II.
</P>
<P>
The sentence reportedly angered Bosnian Serbian leaders, who
are worried about the possibility of the international community
holding more of them accountable for what they did during the
1992-95 Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serbs' president, Mrs. Biljana Plavsic, and Momcilo
Krajisnik, the Serbian member of the collective Bosnian
presidency, both criticized the verdict as unjust.

<HEADLINE> Donors Conference for Bosnia Scheduled for Late July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The much-delayed international
conference to raise reconstruction funds for Bosnia has been
re-scheduled for July 23-24 in Brussels, it was reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports here said the date has been confirmed by
the World Bank, which together with the European Union has
organized the so-called donors conference to be attended by more
than 50 countries.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to raise 1.4 billion U.S. dollars at the meeting
to meet Bosnia's reconstruction needs for the next year, bringing
to the total of international pledge to the country to 2.2 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Originally scheduled for early this year, the conference has
been repeatedly postponed because Bosnian parties failed to meet
the conditions set by Western donors, such as the passage of a
package of legislation necessary as the basis of unitary country.

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts Report on Tourism in 1995-96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
maintained its leading position in world tourism with a growth
rate of 4.2 percent in 1996 in terms of international arrivals and
4.5 percent in terms of receipts, says a report adopted by the EU
today.
</P>
<P>
The report examines the progress made in each area of community
activity relevant to tourism and underlines the relevant
contribution of tourism-related activities to the EU economies in
terms of GDP, employment and international trade.
</P>
<P>
"The progressive impact of community actions reflects the
recognition of the potential contribution of tourism to achieving
the general objectives of the Union and the value added which
community actions bring in terms of the balanced and sustainable
development of tourism," said EU Commissioner Christos Papoutsis.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the great majority of community programs
and policies either now include a tourism dimension or have a
significant impact on tourism-related activities.
</P>
<P>
Tourism affects directly or indirectly European citizens,
public authorities at various administrative levels, European
enterprises and tourism interests in third countries, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Tourism activities employ directly nine million people,
representing six percent of total employment in the EU.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that, by the end of the next decade, travel and
tourism jobs will have increased by some two million, and will
represent over nine percent of total employment in the European
Union.

the commonwealth countries who married, as they did, in 1947, to a
special Golden Wedding garden party.
</P>
<P>
The queen wore a bright lemon dress and matching pill-box hat,
with mushroom-colored gloves while Prince Philip was in a pale
grey suit with panama hat. They enjoyed with their guests cakes,
tea, salmon and cucumber sandwiches, strawberry tarts and ice
cream.
</P>
<P>
Couples who responded to newspaper advertisements inviting them
to apply for invitations flew to Britain from Commonwealth
countries for the occasion - one of numerous events planned to
mark the royal wedding anniversary in November.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 600 couples from Australia applied but only 50 were
granted invitations in the palace's random selection. They went to
the Australian embassy in London on Tuesday to collect the coveted
invitations.
</P>
<P>
Royal garden parties have been held since the 1860s. The three
that take place in London every Summer are normally attended by
about 8,000 people, many from government, the civil service and
the armed forces.

<HEADLINE> Most Athenians Say "No" to EURO, Schengen Treaty, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Most residents in the Greek capital
favor Greece's entry into the European Economic and Monetary Union
(EMU), but they say "no" both to the Schengen Treaty and the euro,
the common currency of the European Union (EU), according to a
poll published in today's Athens News newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by PRC from June 30 to July 7 during
which 976 people in Athens were interviewed.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 58.4 percent of the interviewees agree with
the view that if Greece does not manage in the next three years to
join the EMU, this will have negative, perhaps even catastrophic,
consequences for the country's future.
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven percent are against the Schengen Treaty, only 17.9
percent are for the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 51.1 percent say "no" to the common currency as
opposed to 33.6 percent who say "yes".
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Greek government has taken harsh economic
measures aimed at meeting the EMU criteria as early as possible.
