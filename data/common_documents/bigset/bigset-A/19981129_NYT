BRUINS BOUNCED BUT FIND HOPE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BAYAMON, Puerto Rico _ It is too soon to know. Months too soon.
But if UCLA's season turns special, if there's a fabulous February
or a memorable March, the Bruins may look back on a 28-hour period
in tiny Guerra Sports Complex as the first step.
</P>
<P>
   It began Friday afternoon, after a 16-point loss to No.5
Maryland, and ended Saturday night with a taut, riveting 66-62 loss
to No.4 Kentucky in the consolation game of the Puerto Rico
Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Two days, two games and two losses _ but 14 encouraged players.
</P>
<P>
   ``This right here, after back-to-back losses, this could
definitely be the turning point,'' injured guard Baron Davis said.
``We were so close. We played harder and smarter, and now we just
have to put teams away. Our overall intensity, the way we battled,
really made me proud.''
</P>
<P>
   The No.11 Bruins (2-2) played their best half of the season _
perhaps their best half of the Steve Lavin era _ and took a
five-point lead into the locker room. They lapsed midway through
the second half, allowing Kentucky to build a 56-45 lead, then
rallied in the final minutes, pulling within three with 30 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have done us any good to play Fairleigh-Dickenson,
San Houston State or American University (Puerto Rico),'' Lavin
said. ``I told them we needed to play a contest like this.... We're
not into moral victories, but we raised the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, after a passive second half against Maryland,
the only thing Lavin raised was his voice. Angrier than he has ever
been _ including the 48-point loss to Stanford _ Lavin blasted the
Bruins for 10 minutes, questioned their heart and challenged their
manhood.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his hotel room, Lavin watched highlights on ESPN. He
saw Maryland dunk, he saw UCLA cower from contact, and he did not
sleep at all that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 12 years as an assistant and a head coach, that was the
low point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins took the floor Saturday evening _ wearing blue
uniforms, not black _ Lavin was possessed. He stormed the sideline
throughout the game, implored the Bruins to make hard cuts on
offense, rotate on defense and, most of all, rebound. He jumped and
spun and gyrated like a gymnast, as if trying to will the Bruins to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   He also inserted sophomore guard Ryan Bailey into the starting
lineup and removed freshman forward Jerome Moiso, creating a ripple
effect that had as much to do with UCLA's performance as its
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, who started at Penn State in 1997 before transferring to
UCLA, gave the Bruins desperately-needed ballhandling and moxie. He
finished with four assists and one turnover, and his presence
lightened Earl Watson's load. After committing 17 turnovers against
San Francisco and Maryland, Watson had just one Saturday _ along
with 14 points, five assists and five steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having (Bailey) helped Earl a lot, because he didn't have to
bring the ball up as much,'' forward JaRon Rush said. ``That's what
Baron (did) last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Yanked from the lineup, Moiso responded as the Bruins hoped _
with rarely seen intensity. No one has questioned his talent. At
6-10, he is athletic and possesses a gifted touch to 15 feet, which
he showed time and again in scoring a game-high 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started coming together for me today,'' said Moiso, a
native of Guadeloupe.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso, Rush and Watson combined for 53 of UCLA's 62 points, but
they could not stop Kentucky's game-changing surge.
</P>
<P>
   It began when the foul-plagued Bruins switched to a zone defense
and Wildcats guard Tayshaun Prince hit back-to-back 3-point shots _
each from the left corner, each wide open. After Heshimu Evans'
three-point play and Jamal Magloire's jump hook, UCLA's 45-43 lead
had become a 56-45 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have won the game, but we let it go (midway through)
the second half,'' Moiso said. ``Today, we saw how good we can be.
We saw our potential.'' &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

THREE INJURED KINGS RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ After a week without a game, the Kings got
goaltender Stephane Fiset, defenseman Doug Bodger and center Jozef
Stumpel back in uniform Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have hampered the Kings throughout the season. In fact,
they have lost 94 man-games this season, compared to 33 lost
through 21 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstatic about the returning players, coach Larry Robinson said:
``Christmas is coming early this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset had suffered from a strained left groin since Oct. 18. He
returned on Oct. 28 for a game at New Jersey but re-injured it.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Storr also has been recuperating from a groin strain
suffered on Oct. 18, but he came back to record his third career
shutout last Saturday in a 5-0 win over the Chicago Blackhawks.
Saturday night, thus, was the first time in six weeks that both
Storr and Fiset were dressed.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset said the three players' return, plus the week off, could
change the fate of the Kings. At 6-12-3 coming into Saturday's
game, they have a much worse record than they expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this a turning point,'' Fiset said. ``We want to leave
everything in the past and start over.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel missed three games with a sprained right ankle. Bodger,
who missed 10 games with a fractured left hand, also was hoping the
returns would kick the Kings into gear.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the layoff helping or hindering the Kings, Bodger
said: ``It can go either way. We'll see. The way things have been
going, the week off should help because we really needed to have
some instructional practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, however, dismissed the theory that the three returns
and week off would have a major effect on the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's a turning point,'' Robinson said. ``We're
about a quarter through the season, and we know we have to get it
in gear or jeopardize getting into the playoffs. We know that to
finish with as many points as last year, we'll need to play about
.600.''!end!

UCLA FRESHMAN DEVELOPS TASTE FOR SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYAMON, Puerto Rico _ A Guadeloupe native who was educated in
France, UCLA freshman Jerome Moiso is slowing adjusting to the
nuances and terminology of American basketball. But he understands
the universal language of food.
</P>
<P>
   During the Bruins' team dinner Friday night at Tony Roma's,
coach Steve Lavin had Moiso's full attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to shoot more, Jerome, and if you don't shoot, I'm
going to take you out,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're hurting the team by not shooting, because that's a
weapon and we need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moiso did not start Saturday in a 66-62 loss to Kentucky, but he
was armed and dangerous during his 25 minutes on the court. Moiso
scored a game-high 25 points, made 11 of 17 shots and grabbed seven
rebounds in the most impressive performance by a UCLA freshman this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was unreal today,'' Kentucky coach Tubby Smith said. ``We
had no answer for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many European players, Moiso favors finesse over physical
play, and his shot selection reflects it. He's best when shooting
turnarounds from 10 feet, slashing to the basket or charging for
offensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   He did all three against the Wildcats, keeping UCLA close by
scoring 15 of its 30 points in the second half _ including six of
the last nine.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso made a driving layup with 3:26 left to pull UCLA within
58-55, he dunked an offensive rebound with 1:40 remaining, and he
tipped in JaRon Rush's miss in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Lavin talked to me, I spent all night thinking about it,
and I did it,'' Moiso said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played against physical people, but I needed to do it
consistently. I needed to be strong in the paint.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Eleven Bruins played Saturday, including walk-on forward
Sean Farnham, who had one rebound in six minutes.... In three games
in Puerto Rico, forward JaRon Rush was 9 of 36 from the field....
The Bruins fly home today and will face Delaware State on Wednesday
at Pauley Pavilion.... Asked when he'll be cleared for competition,
injured guard Baron Davis shrugged in frustration.

TCU FALLS TO OKLAHOMA STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STILLWATER, Okla. _ For 38 minutes, 58 seconds last night, TCU
and No. 12 Oklahoma State engaged in a back-and-forth game of
anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better at Gallagher-Iba Arena.
</P>
<P>
   At the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   From the floor.
</P>
<P>
   On the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   OSU challenged. TCU answered. TCU challenged. OSU answered.
</P>
<P>
   Then with 1:02 remaining, OSU's Adrian Peterson hit a shot that
TCU wasn't able to answer, a 3-pointer from the top of the key that
sealed a 79-74 victory for the Cowboys (4-0).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big-time shot,'' TCU's Prince Fowler said. ``I knew
it when he shot it. . . . We just didn't have an answer for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler tried, but his 3-pointer with 40 seconds remaining fell
short.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Jaksic had two chances. Both missed, including a
last-ditch attempt to force overtime with 6.8 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some guys, like Vladi that can answer,'' Fowler
said. ``The confidence just isn't there yet. . . . We need to get
tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Nailon had been TCU's answer for most of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   OSU had limited him to six points in the first half, but he
finished with a game-high 30 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were getting me the ball,'' Nailon said of his
second-half 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   His best work came in the final eight minutes despite playing
with four fouls. His weapon? A turnaround jumper from the left
block.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson responded. He finished with 22 points. Desmond Mason
led OSU with 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mason and Peterson are the two guys that you expect to make
big plays,'' Cowboys coach Eddie Sutton said. ``They made big
plays. Pete hit some big shots.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest might not have been his last.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon gave the Frogs a 67-66 lead with 3:39 remaining. It was
their last.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson buried a 3-pointer 22 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs would tie the score three more times, but they
never led again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good game, and they just delivered the plays down the
stretch,'' Horned Frogs coach Billy Tubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys hit 3-of-4 from the free-throw line in the final
17.2 seconds to put the game out of TCU's reach.
</P>
<P>
   There were 49 free throws attempted, 37 fouls and three players'
fouling out in the game. The officiating and the atmosphere had the
feel of a game in late March.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like an NCAA atmosphere, I thought,'' Sutton
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was part venue, part game and mostly Tubbs, who previously
coached at rival Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The love-to-hate-him coach returned to Gallagher-Iba for first
time since 1994. Cowboys fans greeted him with lusty boos, which he
acknowledged by not acknowledging _ save for a wry smile.
</P>
<P>
   He and Sutton quickly returned to sparring form that had
generated so many funny exchanges in Tubbs' 14 seasons at Oklahoma.
Both coaches met at midcourt after the halftime buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State, at times, had dominated the first half. The
Frogs trailed by as many as eight and had a stretch of 5:41 where
they failed to make a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton was contesting a slam dunk by Ryan Carroll as time
expired that gave TCU a 32-30 halftime lead. Tubbs was lobbying for
Sutton to get a technical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed it,'' Tubbs said of his return. ``I didn't enjoy
getting beat, but I think it's a good series.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night's game was the last of a two-game series. Coaches
from both TCU and Oklahoma State expressed interest in continuing
the series next season.
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point, so far? OSU wants TCU to come back to
Stillwater next season, but TCU insists that OSU travel to Fort
Worth to begin.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's Derale Wilson left with a sprained left ankle midway
through the second half and didn't return.

Texas' Brown lavishes praise on Williams, team's turnaround
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
After watching the film play-by-play one day later, Texas coach
Mack Brown was even more amazed at what tailback Ricky Williams was
able to do to make history in the Longhorns' 26-24 victory over
Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have to be the best individual performance I've ever
seen a great player have against a great defense,'' Brown said
Saturday. ``He took over the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams on Friday rushed for 259 yards, including a 60-yard
touchdown run that made him the all-time career rushing leader in
NCAA Division I-A history.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he never imagined Williams could do all the things he
did this season, and he also never imagined his team could rebound
to win seven of its last eight games after two blowout losses in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that we've gotten more improvement from
start to finish than I've ever seen out of a football team,'' Brown
said. ``The credit has to go to the young men and how they have
responded to us, especially after the 1-2 start with embarrassing
losses to UCLA and Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been easy for them to lay down. Our coaches did
an amazing job of not getting on the kids and just trying to
encourage them. It probably has been the most fun year I've ever
had in coaching because everyone pitched in, and it came
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The only question left to answer is where the Longhorns (8-3)
will end up in the bowl-selection process. The three options are
the Holiday Bowl in San Diego, the Cotton Bowl in Dallas and the
Alamo Bowl in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Had Texas lost to A&AMP;M, the Longhorns likely would have ended up
in the Alamo Bowl. But the victory over the Aggies gives Texas a
chance to move up a notch or two.
</P>
<P>
   The Holiday Bowl might like to have San Diego native Ricky
Williams play his last college game at home, but old Southwest
Conference fans would love to see a Texas-Arkansas Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to be a tremendous bowl attraction now that we
have eight wins,'' Brown said. ``We have one of the best players in
country, who is an attraction regardless of where the game would
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been rated where I felt we should have been, but I
think people's attitude about us has changed from early in the
season. We lost badly twice when people didn't know how good those
teams were. I know I never have played two teams that went
undefeated and ended up ranked in the top three in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   UT lost 48-7 at Kansas State, the team the Aggies will face on
Saturday in the Big 12 Championship Game at St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas State has absolutely no weaknesses, which is why they
are one of the best teams in the country,'' Brown said. ``Very few
people move the ball on their defense, and (quarterback) Michael
Bishop gives them such a big weapon on offense. But I'm sure Texas
A&AMP;M will make it a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   The A&AMP;M offense didn't have a great game Friday against a Texas
defense that held the Aggies to minus-seven yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud of our defense,'' Brown said. ``That's the
best they have played all year. Minus-seven yards means we put a
lot of pressure on the quarterback and had a lot of sacks (six).''
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the first time Brown had been a part of the hoopla
that surrounds an A&AMP;M-Texas football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams showed a lot of class,'' he said. ``There wasn't
any fighting and very little pushing and shoving between two teams
that are supposed to hate each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown made a point to single out the performance of UT
quarterback Major Applewhite, who led his team on a 70-yard drive
to Kris Stockton's decisive 24-yard field goal with five seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was one of his best performances,'' Brown said of
Applewhite. ``What he did all day was very impressive. But when you
get the ball with two minutes to go and take it down the field to
score the points to win, you know he's special.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also how Brown feels about the 1998 Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a team that has played all year with heart and
character,'' he said. ``They never gave up, and they finished the
mission.'' &QL;

Bishop won't count himself out of Heisman race
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Like many other people across the state of Texas on Friday morning,
Michael Bishop watched Texas A&AMP;M-Texas on TV. But he had much more
than a passing interest.
</P>
<P>
   One team will provide the opposition next weekend when Bishop's
Kansas State Wildcats play A&AMP;M in the Big 12 Championship Game at
St. Louis. The other team has Ricky Williams _ the man Bishop is up
against in the voting for the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   While sitting in his parents' living room in Willis the day
after Thanksgiving, Bishop watched Williams run for 259 yards to
become the all-time NCAA Division I-A rushing leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky played the way he has played all season,'' said Bishop,
who has quarterbacked the Wildcats to an 11-0 season. ``He might
have moved up a notch with the voters, but I still have one game
left. I just have to go out and have the kind of game he had
Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, the Aggies (10-2) will be in big trouble in a game
few people believe they can win. Bishop got a chance to do a quick
study on A&AMP;M in its 26-24 loss to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Texas was well-prepared for them and shut down A&AMP;M's
running game,'' Bishop said. ``Texas did a great job of making A&AMP;M
pass the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Aggies were suffering their first loss since August's
season-opening setback to Florida State, the Wildcats were enjoying
a weekend off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really needed this time off to get healed up and have
everybody 100 percent and ready to go at St. Louis,'' Bishop said.
``I think this definitely helps us. And everybody on the team was
watching the A&AMP;M-Texas game. It's a lot different than what we will
see in the film room this week, because when you see it live, you
get a feel for the flow of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns dominated the line of scrimmage against the
Aggies, but Bishop said the Wildcats won't enter the championship
game overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't think like that,'' Bishop said. ``We have to go out
and have a good week of practice. I know A&AMP;M is going to come out
fired up against us. They are going to come to St. Louis believing
they can beat us. They will have a lot of motivation to try to
knock us off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do things right and come out there with the same
attitude we've had all year. This game is so important to us,
because we want to play for the national championship. I hope we
are in a position to control our own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop had better keep hoping. As it stands now, unbeatens
Tennessee and UCLA are in line to meet in the Fiesta Bowl for the
national championship, with Kansas State the odd team out in the
Bowl Championship Series formula. All three teams have one game
left, but it's possible Kansas State could defeat A&AMP;M to improve to
12-0 and still not end up in the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully the situation won't turn out like that,'' Bishop
said ``But we have no control over it. If it does end up that way,
then we will have to go to another bowl and play like we have all
year, then see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Bishop's only concern is Texas A&AMP;M, a school that is
only 60 miles from his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a big deal to me any time we play a team from
Texas,'' he said. ``I wanted to play in my own state, but my
situation didn't turn out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop wound up at Kansas State after leading Blinn College to
back-to-back national junior college championships and a 24-0
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got to Kansas State, I had no idea how good we
would be or how many games we could win,'' Bishop said. ``But we've
all worked together and made some major improvements along the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said the team would not be where it is now without the
guidance of coach Bill Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real quiet, but he prepares you well for every situation
in a game,'' Bishop said. ``If something comes up that we didn't
expect, he is able to correct it right then.''
</P>
<P>
   One correction Snyder made last week was allowing Bishop to talk
to reporters after making him off-limits to the media for most of
the season. Snyder apologized last week for having not let Bishop
speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked about that to me before changing his mind, so I
wasn't surprised,'' Bishop said. ``I was happy about it. All my
friends would call me up and ask me why I don't ever talk to the
media. They didn't understand that it was out of my control.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State has been in control since Bishop arrived two years
ago. The team's only loss in the last two seasons came at Nebraska
in 1997, but the Wildcats came from behind to defeat the
Cornhuskers two weeks ago and give Bishop a little redemption from
the one blemish on his collegiate record.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes another big game against A&AMP;M in the Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it when everybody is watching,'' Bishop said. ``I like
the big games when it comes down to crunch time. That's when I want
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the first time I've played in a dome since my
senior year of high school when we lost to La Marque in the
playoffs at the Astrodome. But I think it will be fine, because we
will have so many fans in St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop likely is headed for the NFL next season, but he still
has some goals to achieve in his final two college games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that would make this year more satisfying would
be to play for the national championship,'' he said. ``If we get
there, we will have the same attitude we've had all season. We
don't believe any team can stop us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to climb to the top of the mountain. We're right
there. Now we just have to get over the hump.''

Intransigence jeopardizes NBA talks, season
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The battle lines have been drawn in the sand for both sides in the
NBA lockout. Well, drawn, erased and redrawn is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   But that sand is slipping through the hourglass, counting down
toward what could be the cancellation of the 1998-99 season.
Neither side seems to care, though, as the lockout drags on toward
its sixth month.
</P>
<P>
   When the NBA canceled this weekend's round of talks with the
National Basketball Players Association, it ensured the season will
not start until January because it will take at least a month to
allow teams to sign free agents, make trades and get in at least
one exhibition game or scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   But that appears to be just fine for the NBA. Sources say the
league has drawn up a 56-game schedule, with each team playing home
and home against every other team, with the season beginning Jan.
5.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, sources say, the NBA can afford to bicker over
trivialities and cancel bargaining sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The players, meanwhile, are sitting around, with most due to
miss another paycheck Monday, their second of the season, pushing
them close to $300 million in lost salaries from the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that when we sit here and we're trying to analyze why
they would do what they have done at this late stage, the only
conclusion I can arrive at is that they are trying to play head
games or mind games with our players,'' said union executive
director Billy Hunter of the owners canceling this weekend's talks.
``It's sort of a whipsaw thing where you get the players'
expectations up and then, boom, you snatch the rug out and you
start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest snag is the bickering over how a so-called backup
escrow tax, which would make players and owners responsible for
salary overspending, would be administered. But that's just a side
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem is a largely overlooked part of the owners'
original proposal that is called the ``timing-rules change.''
Owners insist it is a ``must-have'' part of any agreement; the
union calls it a ``deal-killer.''
</P>
<P>
   That spells trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The rule would force teams that sign another team's free agent
to give up the right to go over the salary cap to re-sign their own
Larry Bird-exception free agents, which has been the case in the
past. The Bird exception allows teams to exceed the salary cap to
re-sign their own free agents, which is why the Chicago Bulls could
pay Michael Jordan $33 million last season despite a salary cap of
$26 million.
</P>
<P>
   The result of such a change? Let's take the Rockets, for
example. If the Rockets signed free agent Antonio McDyess, they
would then be prohibited from exceeding the salary cap to re-sign
Charles Barkley, Matt Maloney, Othella Harrington or any other of
their free agents who fall under the Rockets' umbrella of
Bird-exception players.
</P>
<P>
   Most union members thought this part of the proposal so
outrageous it was included only so it could later be thrown out as
part of the bargaining process. Thus, the union is surprised at the
owners' insistence on this as a ``make-or-break'' issue.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as surprised as NBA general managers. Few owners bothered
to run this by their general managers, most of whom are against
such a change because it severely limits their ability to build or
maintain a contending team.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the owners are trying to do is get as close to a hard-cap
system as they can,'' said agent Mark Termini. ``It (the
timing-rule change) would cause immense problems for teams like the
Rockets, there's no question. It would totally stymie any
reasonable plans of putting a team together, and it would cause
similar-type problems for a number of teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a player's standpoint, it would be unprecedented and
totally unacceptable to have a player put his time in with the
expectation that he would get his Bird rights, only to have a team
come to him and say, `Well, even though we would have given you a
contract with your Bird rights, we had to choose between you and
another player, so your Bird rights with our team go away.' That's
why it's not going to be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said the players are going to keep the Bird exception,
no matter what the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never surrender the Bird exception, under any
circumstances,'' said Barkley, a free agent. ``No ifs, no ands _ we
will never surrender the Bird exception. Not under any
circumstances. It doesn't matter how they (disguise) it, we won't
give it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners haven't conceded anything. We, as players, we're in
this for the duration. If we have to miss the season, we'll miss
the season. We're not going to tamper with the Bird exception.
That's a dead issue.''
</P>
<P>
   So here they are.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy commissioner Russ Granik sent a letter to the union this
week. It explained there was no need for further meetings unless
the players agreed to reconsider their stance on three issues _ a
proposed change in timing rules, which would significantly alter
Larry Bird-exception free agency; to back off their desire for 57
percent of basketball-related income (BRI) and announce a
bottom-line figure; and to submit to the league's version of the
backup tax, numbers as well as framework.
</P>
<P>
   So, there are no talks on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Everything appeared to be fine Nov. 20, when the union and the
owners met in a 12-hour negotiating session, making what both sides
considered significant progress on several key issues.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest issue, at least at that time, was the percentage of
BRI owners would devote to salaries. When the talks started five
months ago, the owners said they wanted to spend no more than 48
percent of BRI on salaries, but came up to 50 percent. The union
responded with a demand for 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the Nov. 20 talks, the one-upmanship began.
Sources say the owners offered to bump up the share to 52, 52.5 and
53 percent in years 4, 5 and 6 of a six-year deal, and perhaps 53.5
in the case of a seventh year, but they would do so only if the
following conditions were accepted by the union:
</P>
<P>
   Changing the timing rules.
</P>
<P>
   A maximum salary tied to a percentage of the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the $25 million annual licensing payment to the
union and incorporating the money into BRI.
</P>
<P>
   A decrease in the maximum annual raise from 20 percent to 5
percent, or 10 percent for players with the Bird exception.
</P>
<P>
   A four-year rookie scale with a right of first refusal for a
fifth year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned, all issues are open to
discussion,'' Hunter said. ``We're prepared to meet at any time,
but we will not agree to any preconditions for a meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The union won't consider the first three conditions, which are
called ``blood issues'' by many players and agents, so time is
running out. Hunter said he wouldn't approach the union with the
subject of a vote on the league's current proposal, so there is a
tremendous amount of work to be done, even if neither side seems
able to make much progress on an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happens is that it appears that we're on one side
of the table and we would say something, they're on the other side,
and they sort of have their set agenda and sort of rote
presentation,'' Hunter said. ``It appears that from time to time
that neither side really pays attention to what the other side is
saying.''

Texas A&AMP;M's ineptitude on offense exposed
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Never again should it be said the Texas and Texas A&AMP;M
football rivals despise one another. In the immediate aftermath of
Friday's thrilling finish to this annual war, there was much love
exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the attitude adjustment was influenced by the puffs of
smoke coming from the small group of 1971 UT grads partying near
the north end-zone entrance of Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial
Stadium. Maybe it came from the respect these teams earned in
Friday's heart-stopping and hard-hitting game.
</P>
<P>
   But it was there. Texas' Ricky Williams hugged A&AMP;M's Dat Nguyen.
Texas A&AMP;M's former Heisman Trophy winner John David Crow hugged
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Aggies fans stood and applauded the postgame video tribute to
Williams. Longhorns fans cheered when the public-address announcer
wished the Aggies luck in the upcoming Big 12 Championship Game
against Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if these teams picked themselves up from the
knock-down, blood-and-guts football game and then gathered for a
group hug. And in the grandest gesture of all, Texas coach Mack
Brown tried to boost A&AMP;M recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every kid in this state should want to play in this game,''
Brown said. ``This kind of game should help our recruiting and
Texas A&AMP;M's.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Aggies need to do is find a way to sign a few players
and get them into uniform by Saturday. Preferably the majority of
them will be able to block, run, pass or catch passes well.
</P>
<P>
   UT game confirms suspicions
</P>
<P>
   It would be quite the contrast to what was put on display
Friday, when the A&AMP;M offense had maybe one drive last as long as
one of Dennis Rodman's marriages. Nothing became more evident in
this big game than the Aggies' offense finally getting exposed,
like so many Rodmans, or streakers.
</P>
<P>
   It was suspected through much of the season, as glorious a
season as it was for the Aggies until Friday. Many of A&AMP;M's 10 wins
were entertaining, close, low-scoring. They were well-earned wins,
but earned mostly by the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Even those love children of the class of '71 had to be covering
their eyes. Watching the Aggies' offense was like, wow, dude.
Gruesome.
</P>
<P>
   The Ags were stripped of everything but what God gave them on
their birthdays. It was all so raw and uncensored, so hauntingly
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 consecutive weeks of somehow finding a way to score
more points than the other guys _ a defensive TD here, a gritty
play by Randy McCown there, a few timely runs by Ja'Mar Toombs and
Dante Hall _ the Aggies finally had nowhere to run, nowhere to
hide.
</P>
<P>
   Exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize from an offensive standpoint,'' A&AMP;M tight end Dan
Campbell said. ``I told (A&AMP;M defensive players) I was sorry for how
we played.''
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't as if the Aggies were playing the Kansas State
defense, which they will do Saturday in a game that has massacre
written all over it unless a miraculous offensive turnaround
occurs. The UT defense is better than most expected, but it is not
great.
</P>
<P>
   It should not have held Texas A&AMP;M to minus-seven yards rushing,
173 total yards and a pair of touchdowns that came only after
Texas' Ricky Recordo got tired of scoring for his own team, so he
coughed up the ball deep in UT territory so the Aggies could score.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, of course, is new to A&AMP;M fans. Slocum tends to go
through offensive coordinators the way he might rotate lures on a
bad fishing trip: Cast, reel, change cast, reel, change.
</P>
<P>
   Living off Wrecking Crew
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it's been a while since the A&AMP;M offense has done
anything more than nibble at the end zone and live off the Wrecking
Crew's big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum seems to have found a coordinator he likes in Steve
Kragthorpe, but Friday's game showed little creativeness and little
different from what the Aggies have shown all year. That is to say,
little.
</P>
<P>
   The big Nebraska win? The A&AMP;M defense scored a touchdown early
in that one and saved the game late with an interception. The
defense also saved the Texas Tech and Missouri wins and again tried
its best Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Wrecking Crew turned away touchdown opportunity after
touchdown opportunity by Texas, but was dragged off in defeat when
Williams' runs were too good and too many to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but praise should be heaped on Slocum for the way he
molded a talented but not especially gifted group of players into a
great defense. And McCown, Toombs and several talented young
receivers seem capable of making the offense go.
</P>
<P>
   But when Toombs carries the ball just four times and receivers
such as Chris Cole do not begin getting looks until after Texas has
a 10-point lead, it doesn't matter if the players are talented
enough.
</P>
<P>
   It is all so hauntingly familiar for the Aggies. The defense is
great, but the offense fails to produce.

TCU FALLS TO OKLAHOMA STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STILLWATER, Okla. _ For 38 minutes, 58 seconds last night, TCU
and No. 12 Oklahoma State engaged in a back-and-forth game of
anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better at Gallagher-Iba Arena.
</P>
<P>
   At the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   From the floor.
</P>
<P>
   On the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   OSU challenged. TCU answered. TCU challenged. OSU answered.
</P>
<P>
   Then with 1:02 remaining, OSU's Adrian Peterson hit a shot that
TCU wasn't able to answer, a 3-pointer from the top of the key that
sealed a 79-74 victory for the Cowboys (4-0).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big-time shot,'' TCU's Prince Fowler said. ``I knew
it when he shot it. . . . We just didn't have an answer for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler tried, but his 3-pointer with 40 seconds remaining fell
short.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Jaksic had two chances. Both missed, including a
last-ditch attempt to force overtime with 6.8 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some guys, like Vladi that can answer,'' Fowler
said. ``The confidence just isn't there yet. . . . We need to get
tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Nailon had been TCU's answer for most of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   OSU had limited him to six points in the first half, but he
finished with a game-high 30 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were getting me the ball,'' Nailon said of his
second-half 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   His best work came in the final eight minutes despite playing
with four fouls. His weapon? A turnaround jumper from the left
block.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson responded. He finished with 22 points. Desmond Mason
led OSU with 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mason and Peterson are the two guys that you expect to make
big plays,'' Cowboys coach Eddie Sutton said. ``They made big
plays. Pete hit some big shots.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest might not have been his last.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon gave the Frogs a 67-66 lead with 3:39 remaining. It was
their last.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson buried a 3-pointer 22 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs would tie the score three more times, but they
never led again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good game, and they just delivered the plays down the
stretch,'' Horned Frogs coach Billy Tubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys hit 3-of-4 from the free-throw line in the final
17.2 seconds to put the game out of TCU's reach.
</P>
<P>
   There were 49 free throws attempted, 37 fouls and three players'
fouling out in the game. The officiating and the atmosphere had the
feel of a game in late March.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like an NCAA atmosphere, I thought,'' Sutton
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was part venue, part game and mostly Tubbs, who previously
coached at rival Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The love-to-hate-him coach returned to Gallagher-Iba for first
time since 1994. Cowboys fans greeted him with lusty boos, which he
acknowledged by not acknowledging _ save for a wry smile.
</P>
<P>
   He and Sutton quickly returned to sparring form that had
generated so many funny exchanges in Tubbs' 14 seasons at Oklahoma.
Both coaches met at midcourt after the halftime buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State, at times, had dominated the first half. The
Frogs trailed by as many as eight and had a stretch of 5:41 where
they failed to make a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton was contesting a slam dunk by Ryan Carroll as time
expired that gave TCU a 32-30 halftime lead. Tubbs was lobbying for
Sutton to get a technical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed it,'' Tubbs said of his return. ``I didn't enjoy
getting beat, but I think it's a good series.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night's game was the last of a two-game series. Coaches
from both TCU and Oklahoma State expressed interest in continuing
the series next season.
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point, so far? OSU wants TCU to come back to
Stillwater next season, but TCU insists that OSU travel to Fort
Worth to begin.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's Derale Wilson left with a sprained left ankle midway
through the second half and didn't return.

TROJANS SHOW HOW FAR THEY'VE COME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It wasn't a game that rattled the ghosts of Art
Parisien and Johnny Baker and Anthony Davis and Frank Jordan.
Indeed, the 70th gridiron meeting between USC and ninth-ranked
Notre Dame was so short on thrills, it practically lulled the
Coliseum crowd to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' 10-0 win Saturday might have been short on
scintillation but it was long on symbolism. The victory was USC's
first against a top-10 foe in two years and with it the Trojans
secured their first eight-win season since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Notre Dame was one card short of a full deck. The
Irish, playing without their injured senior quarterback Jarious
Jackson, might as well have been trying to shoot the moon in a game
of hearts without shuffling in the ace.
</P>
<P>
   Neither starter Eric Chappell nor freshman Arnaz Battle was able
to complete a pass in the first 40 minutes. Not to their teammates,
anyway. Chappell was intercepted twice in the first half and Battle
was picked once in the third quarter before he recorded the Irish's
first completion on a 28-yard pass to Malcolm Johnson with 19:47
remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Trojans had collected all their points. Never mind
that USC came back from a 17-0 halftime deficit to defeat the Irish
20-17 in 1964. Not even Golden Domers with long memories dared to
dream that the Irish's battle-untested quarterback and Johnson
could pull off what Craig Fertig and Rod Sherman did for the
Trojans 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Notre Dame's shortcomings on this evening shouldn't obscure
the strides made this season by the Trojans. Nowhere is their
improvement more marked than in their second-half stats.
</P>
<P>
   Last year USC had about as much staying power as a Dennis Rodman
marriage. The Trojans' credo could have been ``till the second half
do us part.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the death of USC as the Trojans were outscored in that
span, 117-83. This year they've overpowered their opponents in the
third and fourth quarters, 173-89.
</P>
<P>
   First-year coach Paul Hackett deserves much of the credit for
the turnaround, making the Trojans, to a man, revise their
definition of conditioning sure as they were reshaping their
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   He injected discipline into a program that had languished under
former coach John Robinson's laissez faire approach. For that,
Hackett is to be commended.
</P>
<P>
   Now if Hackett only could learn to exercise the same sort of
discipline on his own mouth. Let his Trojans string together three
or four Pacific-10 wins before spouting off about being a player in
the conference race. Let him acknowledge that UCLA is the best team
in the city until one of his squads can prove otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA didn't even play Saturday and, still, Hackett couldn't help
himself. Noting that Miami, the unbeaten Bruins' opponent Saturday,
suffered a severe setback at Syracuse in a game played right before
the Trojans took the field, he said he was sure the Hurricanes
would rebound from their 53-point loss and play UCLA tough.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's nothing new for arrogance to ooze from the USC
football program's pores. The difference is the USC teams of the
1990s haven't exactly made their bluster stick. The Trojans haven't
finished higher than 12th in any season in this decade and they've
gone unranked five times.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first time in three seasons the Trojans have
extended their season past Nov. 30. So what if it'll be USC's 13th
game; the players couldn't feel luckier.
</P>
<P>
   Their good fortune should have a long shelf life. With the
personnel the Trojans have assembled there figures to be more bowl
appearances from whence this year's sprang. Thirty-two of the
players on the two-deep roster are non-seniors, including 16
starters.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of the lot is also the most wondrous. All freshman
quarterback Carson Palmer needs to shine is a little polish. Had
Hackett given Palmer the starting nod sooner than in the ninth
week, the Santa Margarita High product probably would have learned
by now not to try a couple of the plays that, against a top-10
opponent at full strength could have proved quite costly.
</P>
<P>
   While in the clutches of an Irish player he forced a pass in the
second quarter that barely got airborne before Notre Dame
linebacker Kory Minor snared it as easily as a frog would a fly.
</P>
<P>
   Minor was stopped at the USC 14 but a sure-fire scoring
opportunity disintegrated into ashes when Battle was called for a
questionable fumble (it looked like he already was down when the
ball squirted out of his arms).
</P>
<P>
   On a first-down play later in the same quarter, Palmer
stubbornly hung onto the ball, trying to make something happen even
as the pocket collapsed, and was sacked. On the next play he was
picked off by cornerback Ty Goode at the Notre Dame 18. Goode got
to the USC 48 before he was stopped but time ran out in the half
before the Irish could cross into the red zone.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter Palmer finally got clearance to air the
ball to R. Jay Soward and, not surprisingly, good things started to
happen. A 44-yard rope from Palmer to Soward was wasted. But on the
Trojans' next possession the two connected on a 25-yard play that
set up the game's only touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer carried the ball the final two yards, to the surprise of
the 90,069 numb souls in the Coliseum who had watched Hackett
stubbornly try to shove Petros Papadakis down Notre Dame's throat.
Papadakis had gotten the call on a third-and-1 and two
fourth-and-one plays and had one first down to show for them.
</P>
<P>
   So the play-calling could use a little sprucing up. There's time
enough for that. Hackett wasn't spouting his usual hyperbole when
he said, ``I think we've made the statement we needed to make in
the first year. We've made a step in the right direction.'' &QL;

ROSE BOWL TRADITION IS SAFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Traditionalists, rooting !ital!against!off! Notre
Dame for a change, got the result they wanted when USC won 10-0 in
a less-than-classic renewal of the annual intersectional game. Now
the Rose Bowl is safe from the Fighting Irish on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum certainly was safe from them Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish showed up in Los Angeles as a shell of a top-10 team,
the worst in the country among teams that have a chance to win 10
games this season. Faint criticism, but standards are high in South
Bend.
</P>
<P>
   They had to play without senior quarterback Jarious Jackson,
injured in last week's victory over LSU, and that made the
difference that mattered. The difference was between scoring and
getting shut out by the Trojans for the first time since 1962 or by
anybody since Miami did it in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In Jackson's place the Irish started Eric Chappell, a junior
who'd thrown one pass all year, and soon replaced him with Arnaz
Battle, a freshman who'd thrown one pass all year !ital!and
completed it!off!. And you thought Arnaz Battle was something to do
with Lucy's and Desi's divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish took 37 minutes of game time to record a complete
pass, at which point this wasn't about waking the echoes, it was
about waking the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we have no excuses,'' Notre Dame coach Bob
Davie, still wearing the light jacket that protected him from the
after-storm dampness, said a few minutes after the final gun.
</P>
<P>
   Which is coachspeak for: Don't forget to mention the
inexperienced quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   They were overmatched. USC coach Paul Hackett's musing during
the week before the game that unfamiliarity with the quarterbacks
would compromise his defense _ that was coachspeak too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can do in five days,'' said Notre Dame
offensive coordinator Jim Colletto, ``to get 'em to play at the
level they'll eventually play at.''
</P>
<P>
   Did they feel the pressure?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was pretty obvious,'' said Davie.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Irish have no passing attack to speak of,
completing 7 of 22 for 94 yards and throwing four interceptions,
but they wound up with no rushing attack either.
</P>
<P>
   USC moved its safeties up to the line of scrimmage, daring the
Irish to throw, confident they wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``They totally didn't respect the passing game,'' Jackson as he
walked _ stiffly on his sprained right knee _ up the tunnel from
the sideline to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't a complaint, just a fact.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than usual, Notre Dame turned into an option team. The
options being: Gain three yards and fall down; or fall down behind
the line and get it over with.
</P>
<P>
   Slow and steady wasn't going to work against USC. Its defense
has been hard to grind out long drives against, giving up only two
scoring drives of more than 80 yards this season, each of those
consisting almost entirely of one breakaway run.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, when the Irish defense, trying to carry the
night, gave Battle and Chappell the ball in good field position,
they found a way to mess up a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish had the ball on their 43 to start their first drive.
Tailback Autry Denson was stopped for no gain on first down and
they went three-and-out. The Irish had the ball on USC's 14 to
start their first drive of the second quarter. Battle ran to the
goal line and fumbled the ball away, though a television replay
showed this was really the referees' mistake, because the
quarterback was down when the ball popped loose.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish had the ball at their 42 with 1:14 left in the half
and called two running plays, content to protect a 0-0 tie. The
Irish had the ball at the USC 60 to start the second half and went
backward before punting.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of these three hours of Irish misery is twofold.
</P>
<P>
   First is the fact USC, coming off its eighth straight loss to
UCLA, can at least claim mastery of its other great rival after its
third straight win over Notre Dame. Or a reasonable facsimile of
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Second is the fact Notre Dame won't be going to the Rose Bowl.
Under the new bowl alignment _ which we'll refrain from explaining
here in an effort to conserve newsprint _ Notre Dame could have
been invited to Pasadena on Jan. 1 if Pacific-10 champion UCLA went
instead to the national-title game in Tempe, Ariz., on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility inflamed fans of the Rose Bowl's Pac-10 vs. Big
Ten tradition. Now it's more likely that Arizona will represent the
Pac-10 in the Rose Bowl while the Irish (9-2) go slumming in the
Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Fla., on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   If, as predicted, Jackson is healthy by then, they might be
worth watching again.

USC CLOUDS LIFTED WITH 10-0 WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The skies were threatening, but Notre Dame wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of heavy showers spoiling USC's intersectional rivalry
with the Irish turned out to be a lot more worrisome than Notre
Dame's offense. And in the end, neither materialized.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans completely manhandled Notre Dame, which was clearly
handicapped without starting quarterback Jarious Jackson, and shut
out the ninth-ranked Irish, 10-0, before 90,069 at the Coliseum on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The score might have been low, but emotions were high for the
Trojans, who celebrated their third straight victory over Notre
Dame. Just a week after a demoralizing loss to UCLA, USC's role in
a rivalry was completely reversed as the Trojans capped their
regular season by shutting out Notre Dame for the first time since
1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got that horrible taste out of our mouths from last week,''
USC linebacker Mark Cusano said. ``It's a great way to end the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (8-4) not only extended their winning streak against
their archrival, they set themselves up for a possible berth in the
Holiday Bowl against Nebraska, or perhaps an invitation to the Sun
Bowl in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get eight wins, that's a big deal for us,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said. ``I think we made the statement we had to make in the
first year. Seven wins wouldn't have made that statement as much.''
</P>
<P>
   USC got No. 8 by forcing Notre Dame to throw the ball. The
Trojans moved their safeties up, and essentially had nine men ready
to defend the run, a sound strategy since the Irish were without
Jackson, who partially tore knee ligaments last week against LSU.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's replacements, junior Eric Chappell and freshman Arnaz
Battle, were nothing short of inept when it came time to pass.
Chappell started and threw two interceptions in three pass
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   He was quickly replaced by Battle, who was only slightly better,
going seven for 19 for 94 yards and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no excuses,'' Notre Dame coach Bob Davie said. ``We
were pretty much exclusively playing option football. We felt that
gave us the best chance. To run against nine guys is extremely
tough. We were somewhat limited. But we had enough offense to win
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish (9-2) saw their Rose Bowl hopes evaporate and are
unlikely to be included in any BCS bowl games. Instead, Notre Dame
could be headed toward the Gator Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But even without much of an offense, the Irish still had the
Trojans teetering most of the game. USC quarterback Carson Palmer
was not having one of his better performances, throwing a pair of
interceptions and the teams went into halftime tied, 0-0.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the move.
</P>
<P>
   USC tailback Chad Morton changed the pace of the game with a
nifty spin, and the Trojans never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   With USC on the Irish 28-yard line in the third quarter, Morton
took the handoff and seemed close to being stopped at the line of
scrimmage. But Morton did a 360-degree move and found himself in
the open field for a 21-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Palmer rolled out to his left and strolled into
the end zone untouched for a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea where that came from,'' Morton said. ``I
thought I saw the safety. I just did some kind of spin move.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was equally amazed on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' Hackett said. ``I saw the safety coming up,
and I said `Oh oh' on the headphones. And then Chad just went
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame responded to the touchdown by running Autry Denson
three times against USC's defense, and was forced to punt. Morton
then juked for a 19-yard gain on USC's next drive which helped set
up Adam Abrams' 23-yard field goal and gave the Trojans a 10-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Morton finished with 85-yards rushing in the third quarter, and
had 128 yards overall, his sixth 100-yard game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   With a double-digit lead, there was little to fear from the
Irish, who hadn't been blanked by anyone since Miami shut them out
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't exactly a breeze, however, for USC's defense, which
has been forced to prop up the struggling offense for most of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we handled them that easily,'' said free safety
Rashard Cook, who had two interceptions. ``It wasn't a blowout. We
knew they didn't have their quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Cook who snuffed out Notre Dame's last legitimate chance
to still win the game, when he came out of nowhere to intercept
Battle's pass at the USC 14-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as a shutout might sound, the Trojans were just
happy to take a victory in a marquee game with national television
exposure. USC hadn't defeated a top 10 team since beating these
same Irish in overtime at the Coliseum two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That game saved John Robinson's job for one more season. This
one gave USC's seniors a small legacy, a three-game winning streak
against a team that had dominated USC for most of the past 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps,'' said USC wide receiver Billy Miller. ``It's kind
of a sigh of relief that we didn't drop the last two games to UCLA
and Notre Dame. I can always remember this as a year we beat Notre
Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notre Dame. They couldn't do anything. They had to be
frustrated. That's the No. 9 team in the country and we shut them
out.''

USC SENIORS FINISH AS WINNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The USC seniors walked down the Coliseum tunnel
late Saturday with many of the same feelings of a typical fall day.
</P>
<P>
   There were assignments to be remembered and butterflies to
contend with. But this time, there was something a little
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little scary when it's your last home game,'' said
receiver Billy Miller, who started for the 29th time. ``No matter
what happens, you have to live with it the rest of your life. Going
out losing two in a row would have been tough to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as cornerback Daylon McCutcheon said: ``You are remembered
for your last performance.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is true then the Trojan seniors, particularly the ones
who line up on defense, will be remembered fondly after a
regular-season ending 10-0 victory over Notre Dame in front of
90,069.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a perfect ending to the type of season we've
had,'' McCutcheon said.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect, at least offensively, it wasn't. But that didn't matter
much to the guys who put on a USC uniform in a regular season game
for the final time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started out as a special day and it ended as a special
day,'' said linebacker and resident thorn-in Notre Dame's-side Mark
Cusano, who had one of the Trojans four interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The seniors had a big role in making the day special.
</P>
<P>
   Senior safety Rashard Cook ended two Notre Dame drives with
leaping interceptions and swatted away three more passes. Senior
cornerback Kenny Haslip ended Notre Dame's deepest threat with a
fumble recovery and 27-yard return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw the ball come out and picked it up,'' Haslip said
of the play, when Notre Dame freshman Arnaz Battle fumbled at the
Trojans 2-yard line. ``I just happened to be in the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusano and Marc Matock, who had promising senior seasons
shortened by injury, both made big plays. And safety Grant
Pearsall, who took a medical redshirt after having his original
senior year end before it started with a knee injury, was flying
around smacking Notre Dame ball carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The experience on defense helped hold the Irish to 217 total
yards of offense. Fittingly, Notre Dame's final chance ended when
an exhausted Matock wrapped up Battle after a six-yard gain on
4th-and-10 with 1:41 left.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, Miller caught five passes for 50 yards, senior
tackle Ken Bowen's blocks helped junior Chad Morton dart for 128
yards on 27 carries and Adam Abrams closed the Trojans' scoring on
the spongy field with a 23-yard field goal late in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For a few brief moments, it even allowed the Trojans to forget
about never beating UCLA.

CUSANO AGAIN TOUGH ON IRISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC linebacker Mark Cusano got his hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   Already earning the moniker ``Mr. Notre Dame killer'' from his
teammates after being a part of two pivotal plays in victories over
the Irish, Cusano played a large role in USC's 10-0 victory
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Cusano intercepted Eric Chappell's first pass of the game, and
returned it 19 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It was just another memorable moment for Cusano, who intercepted
a Ron Powlus pass last season that set up USC's game-winning field
goal in a 20-17 victory. He also batted down a pass in overtime two
years ago, that was the game-winning play in the Trojans' 27-20
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one I look forward to every year,'' Cusano said.
``It will give me a good memory when I'm 40. God blessed me. I kind
of have their number. When I went to bed (Friday night), I said a
little prayer and tried to envision something good happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusano, who got just his second start of the season while
filling in for the injured David Gibson, had five tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really helps me. It felt good to play again,'' Cusano said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame honorees: USC inducted 21 new members into its
Athletic Hall of Fame on Saturday, including baseball superstar
Mark McGwire and football greats Anthony Davis, Anthony Munoz, Jim
Hardy, Bob Chandler, Jesse Hibbs, Russ Saunders, Harry Smith, Homer
Griffith, Francis Tappaan and Garrett Arbelbide.
</P>
<P>
   Other inductees are track legends Frank Wykoff and Louis
Zamperini; track coach Verne Wolfe; swimmer Cynthia
Woodhead-Kantzer; golfer Craig Stadler; women's basketball player
Cynthia Cooper; tennis player Gene Mako; sportswriter Harley
Tinkham, booster Jerry Buss and trainer Jack Ward.
</P>
<P>
   The honorees will be officially inducted during a ceremony in
May at USC.
</P>
<P>
   Tired team: If USC looked a little sluggish offensively, it
wasn't totally surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're worn out. We're tired,'' said a player who asked not to
be identified.
</P>
<P>
   It gets better for the Trojans. They will be off until Friday,
when they will resume practicing in anticipation of a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne delivers: USC linebacker Chris Claiborne enhanced his
chances for the Butkus Award, with 12 tackles and an interception.

GRITTY NORTHRIDGE SHOWS HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Carl Holmes dove on the floor a few times.
Brian Heinle fought for rebounds he usually fails to get.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge's interior defenders grunted while
perimeter players fought through screens and scurried recklessly
for loose balls.
</P>
<P>
   And during a span that lasted nearly 11 minutes, the Matadors
yielded one field goal and turned a close game into a meaningful,
early win.
</P>
<P>
   Heinle scored a 19 points and Markus Carr added 15, but it was
the Matadors' second-half defense that catapulted them to a 73-65
win over the University of San Diego in their home opener Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the cohesion that's been missing the past few games was
most apparent in what CSUN did on the boards. Despite having no one
with more than five rebounds, the Matadors outrebounded the Toreros
34-33.
</P>
<P>
   ``That second half we found our heart,'' CSUN coach Bobby
Braswell said. ``In that second half we took our game to another
level from a toughness standpoint. That's going to win basketball
games for us. I'll take a win like this any time where you have to
grind it out. It's one of those games you really appreciate as a
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The win ended CSUN's two-game losing streak and put the Matadors
(2-2) back at .500.
</P>
<P>
   It also serves as an early barometer for the Big Sky Conference
since San Diego (2-2) won at Eastern Washington and lost to
Portland State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed this win because if we went 1-3 people would have
been thinking, `Oh, it's the same old Northridge,''' Carr said.
``There was all the hype, but now we need to put up.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Braswell continues to tinker with the Matadors'
rotation. Not only did Carr start in place of Jason Crowe, but
Heinle and Greg Minor started in place of Rico Harris and Jeffrey
Parris.
</P>
<P>
   Harris came through with 10 points and Andre Larry added 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think to play defense the whole game (like the last 12
minutes) we need to have 10 people,'' Braswell said. ``I thought
our interior guys plays tougher and harder and more aggressive, and
that was our challenge before the game.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's defensive effort was a good sign, particularly since
defense was  &UR; !ital! &LR; the &UR; !off! &LR;  point of focus since the Matadors
surrendered 54 second-half points last Sunday to San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't come to fruition against San Diego until the
Toreros built 54-51 lead with 11:42 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Then the clamps went on and the Toreros went dry.
</P>
<P>
   With tenacious defense on the perimeter and tough, post play,
the Matadors held San Diego to one field goal and five points
during a 19-5 run that lasted 10:54. The Matadors turned a
three-point deficit into a 70-59 lead, going ahead for good when
Heinle tipped in his open missed shot.
</P>
<P>
   And during CSUN's spurt, the flustered Toreros turned the ball
over six times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect teams to be frustrated with our defense,'' said
Heinle, a sophomore center. ``We knew we could play better
defensively (than San Jose State). I don't think we prepared fully
for that game so we needed to come out and prove we could play well
defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that prevented CSUN from making it an
honest-to-goodness rout was an inability to score more.
</P>
<P>
   While San Diego experienced trouble even getting off a shot, the
Matadors missed a few easy chances and committed some silly
turnovers. Not to mention shooting 5 of 10 from the free-throw line
in the final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pressure is what got us back into the game in the second
half,'' said Carr, who added four assists and five steals. ``In the
first half we weren't playing with heart. The biggest keys to

FULLERTON TOO FAST FOR PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>

By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FULLERTON _ Maybe slow wasn't so bad, after all.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, Cal State Fullerton presented the Pepperdine
men's basketball team with a much faster-paced game than the Waves
received during their 5-0 start.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans also handed the Waves their first loss of the year.
Aside from David Lalazarian's bank shot to open the scoring, the
Waves never led in a 78-68 nonconference loss at Titan Gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we'd finally be able to play a little more up-tempo,''
said coach Lorenzo Romar, whose Waves were too busy running back
and forth to play defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Fullerton) did a great job on half-court execution. We had
been surviving off our defense and for whatever reason, we didn't
take care of that half of the court tonight. Credit them, they did
their job, but this was also our worst defensive performance of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Baskets didn't come easily for the Waves, either. Pepperdine
(5-1) shot 26 percent from the field in the first half and 38
percent overall.
</P>
<P>
   Junior guard Kenroy Jarrett had the task of guarding
Pepperdine's leading scorer, Jalani Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just prayed,'' Jarrett said of preparing to face the Waves
senior.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 7-inch height disadvantage, Kenroy held Gardner to 10
points.
</P>
<P>
   Five Waves contributed 10 points each, while Mark McDowell came
of the bench to lead the team with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore center Matt Caldwell led a Fullerton attack that
didn't let up when its top player missed almost the entire second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Fullerton's junior forward Ike Harmon led all first-half scorers
with 14 points, making six of seven shots from the field, before
aggravating a sprained left ankle with 1:11 remaining in the half.
After collapsing beneath the Waves basket, he hobbled off the court
and was in so much pain he told teammates he thought it was broken.
He returned briefly in the second half but was unable to continue.
Caldwell took over and scored a career-high 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans (2-1) led 32-26 at the half. They scored 13
consecutive points early in the second half for a 17-point lead
with 16:44 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Fullerton's 78 points are the most by any team against
Pepperdine this season. The Waves entered the game holding the
opposition to 55.6 points a game, with Fresno (71) being the only
team to score more than 60.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's loss evens the all-time series between the schools
at 7-7. The Waves won last season, and only once has a team won
back to back games in the series.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; L &LR; oyola Marymount &UR; 79, UC &LR;  Santa Barbara &UR; 78 &LR; : The Gauchos and
Loyola Marymount matched score-for-score in the final minutes,
tying three times until a layup by Brandon Peyton put the game away
for the visiting Lions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third home game the Gauchos lost by a single point,
despite holding second-half leads in all three.

KINGS SHUT OUT BY COYOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Ah yes, the Kings played inspired and
refreshed, after a week layoff.
</P>
<P>
   But the only problem was that their inspirational freshness
lasted just one period against the NHL's hottest team.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Coyotes scored three second-period goals on Saturday
night to demoralize and beat the Kings, 4-0, in front of 13,008 at
the Great Western Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings suffered from killing a two-man advantage for 1:43 in
the second period and never recovered. After they killed that
two-man advantage, the Coyotes' Daniel Briere scored on the power
play, at 3:13 of the second period, off a rebound that Jyrki Lumme
had shot from the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kings then were at full strength, it didn't help.
The Coyotes added another goal at 4:10 of the second period. Shane
Doan tried a wraparound that goaltender Jamie Storr deflected. But
the Coyotes' Juha Ylonen put it the rebound. The puck slid over
Storr's turned right skate to go past the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Teppo Numminen added another goal for the Coyotes at 8:34 of the
second period to make it, 3-0. The three-goal lead held up until
4:24 of the third period when the Greg Adams put in a rebound that
Jeremy Roenick shot to put the Coyotes up, 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings looked like a different team, comparing the first and
second periods. In the first period, they were aggressive and were
tied with the Coyotes with eight shots. In the second period, they
were out of synch and were outshot, 15-4.
</P>
<P>
   After having a shutout one week ago, Storr's story was much
different in his second game back from a strained groin. But Storr
had to face 31 shots and the aggressive Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to work off the last game or last practice,'' Storr
said. ``You hope that confidence carries over.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have in the first period when Storr had eight saves and
neither team scored. But the game drastically changed in the second
and third periods.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (6-13-3) and the Coyotes (14-2-2) contrasted each
other in that the Kings have had a injure-plagued, disappointing
start, while the Coyotes have been healthy and are 12-0-2 in their
past 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Larry Robinson said, ``When you're on a streak like
that everything is positive. When you're losing, all the worse
adjectives are used about your team. They're on a positive frame of
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be an easy reaction for the Kings to have a negative
frame of mind, but they don't. Instead, their sentiment is that if
it weren't for their glut of injuries, their story would be
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect that we'd be where we are,'' Robinson said.
``But then again, I didn't expect we'd have eight starters out with
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   So after their strong first period, the Kings just didn't have a
chance against Phoenix. That was even the case with defenseman Doug
Bodger and center Jozef Stumpel back in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   What may be more impressive than the Coyotes' 14-game streak
without a loss and eight-game winning streak, is that for 17 games,
they have held their opponents to two goals or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always get back on defense and just clog the front of the
goal,'' Robinson said.

UMASS HOLDS ON FOR PLAYOFF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE CHARLES, La. _ Freshman running back Kevin Quinlan fumbled
on the fifth play of the first half, turning the ball over.
Quarterback Todd Bankhead was intercepted on the second play of the
fourth quarter, then tripped over his own foot dropping back into
the pocket with 9:18 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   They were doing it again. The University of Massachusetts
Minutemen, who had built a 21-point lead against McNeese State
Saturday night in the first round of the Division 1-AA playoffs,
failed at every attempt to put the game away and their blunders
helped put McNeese State in position to rally for the win _ just as
similar UMass miscues led to comeback victories by Delaware and
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed only a matter of moments before McNeese State would
follow suit, forging ahead then holding on for a dramatic ...
</P>
<P>
   No. Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen defense withstood several McNeese charges. The
offense amassed just enough plays to milk the clock. And then, to
the surprise of many, fate conceded defeat, leaving 11th-seeded
UMass to celebrate a thrilling 21-19 upset over sixth-seeded
McNeese State before 11,349 at Cowboy Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   For UMass (9-3), the victory tied a school record for wins in a
season and gave the Minutemen their first postseason victory since
the 1978 1-AA semifi-nals. UMass will host undefeated Lehigh, a
24-23 winner over Richmond Saturday, next week in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   It was undoubtedly the biggest victory of the decade for UMass,
which had not been to the playoffs since suffering a 38-0 loss at
William and Mary in 1990. And surprisingly, it came without the
services of Marcel Shipp, the Atlantic 10's No. 2 rusher whose knee
injury suffered Oct. 31 against New Hampshire forced him to sit out
for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   His understudy was Quinlan, a Somerville resident, who entered
the contest with just 73 yards on 21 carries. But Saturday night
Quinlan set a UMass postseason record with 147 yards on 28 carries
and scored the game's first touchdown, a 2-yard run with 12:41 left
that put the Minutemen up, 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   Bankhead set UMass postseason records for completions (19),
attempts (35) and yards (254), and threw for two touchdowns. The
second TD pass was a 7-yarder to tight end Kerry Taylor with 5:26
left in the second quarter, giving the Minutemen a 21-0 lead.
Taylor set a school postseason mark for receptions yards with 119.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any doubt that those losses in the
regular season helped us win this game,'' said UMass coach Mark
Whipple, whose high-powered offense failed to score in the second
half for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept trying to put the game away, but we couldn't. We gave
them the momentum, but our defense held. No way we would have won
down here if it had been the fourth or fifth game of the season.
But our guys are coming together and believing in each other.''
</P>
<P>
   McNeese State (9-3), last year's 1-AA runner-up and the
preseason pick to win the title this season, could manage just a
32-yard field goal by placekicker Shonz LaFrenz in the first half.
The All American kicker would add three more field goals in the
second half, the last a 29-yarder that cut the lead to 21-19 with
4:52 remaining. It came after McNeese scored its only touchdown on
a 10-yard pass from quarterback Blake Prejean to wide receiver
William Davis with 9:33 left.
</P>
<P>
   UMass stalled after LaFrenz's final score, and McNeese drove the
ball to the 40-yard line. But the UMass defense held, and LaFrenz,
who had missed only two field goal attempts this season and had
booted a 43-yarder earlier this year, attempted a 52-yard boot.
</P>
<P>
   The kick had enough distance but sailed wide right with 1:42.
UMass then milked out the clock, giving the ball back with :07
left. McNeese completed two passes, moving to the UMass 40-yard
line, before time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Bankhead) threw the interception, I said, `Here we go
again,' and for a brief second I thought, `We might lose this
game,''' said Taylor. ``I had my head down on the sideline and
coach Whipple came over to me and said, `Kerry don't start that;
you're a leader,' and then I said okay, and I knew our players
would pull it out at the end.''

COYOTES TOO WILY FOR KINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Ah yes, the Kings played inspired and refreshed
after a week layoff. The only problem was that their inspiration
lasted just one period against the NHL's hottest team.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Coyotes, unbeaten in their last 14 games, scored
three second-period goals on Saturday night to demoralize and beat
the Kings 4-0 in front of 13,008 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings suffered from killing a two-man advantage for 1:43 in
the second period and never recovered. After they killed it off the
Coyotes' Daniel Briere scored on the power play at 3:13 of the
second period, finishing a rebound of a Jyrki Lumme shot from the
blue line.
</P>
<P>
   After that first goal, the game spiraled downhill for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got soft, first of all,'' coach Larry Robinson said. ``When
you play against a team as talented as Phoenix, you know they are
not going to give you a lot of chances. I didn't like our second
and third efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kings (6-13-3) were at full strength after that
first goal, it didn't help. The Coyotes added another goal at 4:10
of the second after Shane Doan tried a wraparound that goaltender
Jamie Storr deflected. The Coyotes' Juha Ylonen was there for the
rebound, however, the puck sliding over Storr's turned right skate.
</P>
<P>
   Teppo Numminen added another goal for the Coyotes at 8:34 of the
second period. The three-goal lead held up until 4:24 of the third
period when Greg Adams put in a rebound of Jeremy Roenick's shot to
put the Coyotes (14-2-2) up 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   The loss left Robinson questioning the Kings' toughness.
``Visiting teams aren't paying the price in our building,''
Robinson said. ``The difference between this and last year's team
is that we don't have the guys willing to play the price
physically.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings looked like a different team in the first 20 minutes
compared to the final two periods. In the first period they were
aggressive and matched the Coyotes with eight shots. In the second
period they were out of sync and were outshot 15-4. In the third
period, the Coyotes simply clung to the lead.
</P>
<P>
   About the first period, Robinson said, ``That's exactly how we
have to play. But they took the life out of us, once they got that
first goal.''
</P>
<P>
   After a shutout in his first game back from injury one week ago,
Storr's story was much different. But he had to face 31 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say he's had better nights,'' Robinson said. ``A couple of
the rebounds could've been cleared.''
</P>
<P>
   Storr defended himself. ``No one beat me on a straight-on
shot,'' Storr said. ``... When the puck is tipped it changes
direction and bounces around, and that's how they scored.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings and the Coyotes contrasted each other in that the
Kings have had a injury-plagued, disappointing start, while the
Coyotes have been healthy and are 12-0-2 the past 14 games. More
impressive, the Coyotes have held their opponents to two goals or
less in 17 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes coach Jim Schoenfeld said, ``(The Kings) probably had
two or three good scoring chances.'' &UR; !end! &QL;

 &HT;    Judge aims to improve child-support process, reduce deliquent
payments
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ In his 10 years on the bench, Judge Jim Rausch has
seen it all before _ practically every day.
</P>
<P>
   Before him a mother stands, holding in her left arm a
curly-haired baby clutching a bottle. Standing adjacent to an
assistant attorney general is the father of another of her
children, a red-and-blue star-shaped tattoo on his right forearm
and another tattoo circling his left arm just below the short
sleeve of his bright orange jumpsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The back of his jumpsuit reads ``Bexar County Jail.''
</P>
<P>
   He owes $10,200 in child support, has not paid on it in almost
two years and explains he's been unemployed for a year. ``If I'm
working, I pay,'' he tells Rausch. ``If I'm not working, I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Rausch looks him straight in the eye, his voice agitated. ``You
should have thought about that before you brought this child into
the world,'' he says. ``It's a tough world, isn't it, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   His judgment: six months behind bars for contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If $500 is paid,'' Rausch tells him, ``the court will release
you to electronic monitoring.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the prisoner gets back to jail, the $500 is paid.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, the money used to bail out these fathers comes from
the parent who is owed the child support.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it works, time and again. In two days last week,
four of 10 fathers Rausch either threw or kept in jail for
child-support violations came up with the lump sum the judge set
for their release. One _ a ``career case,'' Rausch called him _
said he couldn't muster more than $1,000 when the judge set $2,500
as the hurdle for his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the afternoon, his family paid the $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   In an often teeming courtroom, like a scene from a Rudyard
Kipling story, Jim Rausch speaks not so softly and wields a big
stick to collect child support: one of Texas' most beguiling social
and political problems, with 1.1 million active cases pending in
the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Legislature searches for answers, Rausch and other
family law court masters who enforce state-supervised child-support
orders _ one of the few aspects of child support that seems to be
working _ stand to be replaced by an administrative process that is
among several proposals to resolve an almost unsolvable problem.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dan Morales consistently has defended his
child-support collection, pointing to collection increased by 300
percent since 1990 and to Texas moving from 14th to sixth in total
collections. But, just as consistently, mothers owed child support
and the lawmakers to whom they invariably complain have slammed the
collection efforts as ineffective, too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   Dragged down by a $75 million computer that has not done what it
was supposed to do, the percentage of paying cases lately dropped
from 20 percent to 18 percent. And at the same time that caseloads
kept rising, the number of paternity establishments fell 13 percent
by the end of the 1998 budget year.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the complexity of a growing social phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General-elect John Cornyn, for example, made child
support a campaign issue by saying Morales, who decided not to seek
re-election, collected only 18 cents of each dollar owed in child
support. But Cornyn's figures can be misleading because he refers
to an 18 percent collection rate for all child support cases _ even
those in which paternity has not been established and payment
orders have not been drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Rausch and others worry that confusion results in a proposal to
cut people like Rausch out of the process _ and to reduce due
process _ to solve problems that Rausch says he rarely deals with
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very efficient _ not perfect _ but very efficient
judicial process,'' Rausch says of what he does, ``that resolved a
great number of cases in a short period of time yet did not deny
anyone their day in court.'' According to a 1998 budget-year tally
by the Office of Court Administration, court masters like Rausch
handled almost 175,000 legal actions filed by assistant attorneys
general. Of those, the judges disposed 90 percent within three
months.
</P>
<P>
   On this Monday in Rausch's courtroom, enforcement actions
dominate the docket.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you just saw in the last two hours was 95 percent
contempt. I think I heard one paternity case,'' he says during a
morning recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paternity establishment is a small part of the picture here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth floor of the century-old Romanesque red
sandstone-and-granite Bexar County Courthouse _ overseeing Main
Plaza, where justice has been dispensed in San Antonio for close to
300 years _ mothers and fathers called to Rausch's courtroom take
all available seats this Monday morning. More people crowd the
entry into the courtroom and spill outside the door into the
marbled hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys work in constant motion at its center. Deputy sheriffs
call for order again and again and again as people mumble and
whisper in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   In the jury box, four prisoners in jail jumpsuits wait their
turns.
</P>
<P>
   His docket runs 93 cases when Rausch, a family law court master
responsible for child support and complex other issues that go
hand-in-hand with it, begins calling cases at 8:30 a.m. He starts
this ritual at the same time four days a week.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Rausch breaks for lunch on this day, at 12:53 p.m.,
he will have finished all but three cases on his docket. Another
hour in the afternoon and he will be done.
</P>
<P>
   In that time he will have conducted one hearing on past-due
child support for a father of a 13-year-old who was not told until
years later that the child was his. He will have held a formal
rights hearing at the same time for four fathers accused of
contempt _ and facing jail _ because they have not paid child
support. And he will have ruled in perhaps 30 other individual
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the efficiency, Rausch and the other 40 child-support
court masters in Texas _ judges who, as he does, can throw the book
at parents delinquent in their child-support payments _ work in the
gun sight of a proposal Morales endorses that might eliminate them.
In their place would be administrative hearing officers with power
to decide paternity and set child support but without authority to
enforce child-support orders.
</P>
<P>
   That administrative process, Morales says, would speed
child-support orders by speeding along decisions establishing
paternity in cases where children have been born out of wedlock.
These days, that means as many as 30 of every 100 births in the
state. Morales' successor, Cornyn, advocates streamlined
child-support administrative proceedings not unlike those for
drivers license revocations.
</P>
<P>
   Morales' proposal would put the burden of proof on men alleged
to be fathers, leaving it up to the men to contest an allegation in
a procedure that has no judicial protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, for one, am sick and tired of taking away people's legal
rights to make up for the faults in this system,'' state Sen. Chris
Harris, R-Arlington, told a Sunset Advisory Commission hearing
recently.
</P>
<P>
   But the so-called expedited administrative procedure _ the
cornerstone of a legislative consultant's recommendation for the
attorney general's child-support division _ would do little, by
Rausch's reckoning, to dent the never-ending cycle of enforcement
problems he handles day in and day out.
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone in that assessment. A sunset commission staff
analysis of the consultant's report raised doubt about channeling
to a hearing officer decisions that needed a court's decision _ and
throwing enforcement of a hearing officer's orders onto the crowded
caseloads district judges now handle.
</P>
<P>
   At 49, his graying hair cut close in the style he wore as an F-4
Phantom fighter pilot in Vietnam, Rausch brings tactical zeal to
his work now. His instincts play off his experience in sizing up a
delinquent parent probably months or years past due in his child
support.
</P>
<P>
   For one father, who pleads that he has a new job and a son who
lives with him, Rausch threatens him with jail unless he can cough
up $800.
</P>
<P>
   Then, against the assistant attorney general's preference, the
judge orders the father to work release.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy cuffs him and leads him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put them in jail and throw away the key,'' Rausch
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you want to do is get their attention and get a lump
sum.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of his reasoning depends on 10 years of handling familiar
faces back again to be threatened or cajoled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't work that way _ `thanks, judge, it'll be OK' _ it
doesn't work that way,'' Rausch says. ``It doesn't go away.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no closure. There's no closure to a child-support
case.''

   CHILD-SUPPORT _ SAN ANTONIO _ In his 10 years on the bench,
Judge Jim Rausch has seen it all before _ practically every day. In
an often teeming courtroom, like a scene from a Rudyard Kipling
story, Rausch speaks not so softly and wields a big stick to
collect child support: one of Texas' most beguiling social and
political problems, with 1.1 million active cases pending in the
attorney general's office. (McCarthy, Austin American-Statesman)

</P>
<P>
   U.S.-COLOMBIA-DRUGS _ A recent congressional initiative, spurred
by a growing link between conservative Republicans and the
Colombian National Police, has more than doubled anti-drug
assistance to Colombia, and made Bogota a top recipient of American
foreign aid. By Diana Jean Schemo.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-CHINA-ASSESS (Tokyo) _ Just last month, Japan had seemed
to be making major progress in laying World War II to rest,
forthrightly apologizing to South Koreans for its behavior and
receiving something of an absolution from the visiting Korean
president. Then Chinese President Jiang Zemin arrived on the first
visit ever by a Chinese head of state. By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   QUEBEC-ELECTION (Quebec) _ Both the Liberals and the Parti
Quebecois hope that when Quebecers vote Monday in all 125 districts
around this largest of Canadian provinces they will be able to
clearly distinguish between the two parties and their positions. By
Anthony DePalma.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-VOTE (New Delhi, India) _ As vote tallies piled up here
Sunday in a series of important state elections, the humiliating
defeat of the Hindu nationalists and the stunning resurrection of
India's once-dominant political force, the Congress Party, became
ever more starkly apparent. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINA-VOTE (Buenos Aires, Argentina) _ Millions of
Argentines voted in a primary election Sunday to select between two
presidential candidates of the center-left Alianza opposition
coalition. Polls favor the coalition to defeat the governing party
and to replace President Carlos Saul Menem in the general election
next October. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   SWISS-DRUG-VOTE (Geneva) _ Swiss voters Sunday decisively
defeated a radical measure to legalize marijuana as well as heroin
and cocaine, turning aside arguments that a government-managed
narcotics network would curb drug-related crime. By Elizabeth
Olson.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-VICHY-JEWS (Paris) _ After 50 years of suppressed
memories, the French authorities have been trying harder to face
what the collaborationist Vichy government did to Jews under the
Nazi occupation. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   PINOCHET-BRITAIN (London) _ Pressing Chile's effort to persuade
Britain to free Gen. Augusto Pinochet and let him fly home, the
country's foreign minister said in London on Sunday that his
government would be pursuing its own judgment of the former
dictator. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-PRISONER-RELEASE (Jerusalem) _ A meeting between Israeli

criminals as part of prisoner releases required by the agreement.

   CONGO-CEASEFIRE (Nairobi, Kenya) _ The leader of the rebels in
Congo said Sunday that he had not heard the details of a cease-fire

</P>
<P>
   WOODHEAT-DECLINE (Berlin, Vt.) _ National and regional
statistics show wood heating at its lowest ebb since the numbers
started to be tracked 20 years ago, out-run by other cheap fuels
and increasingly abandoned by older, busier householders who just
do not want to cut, chop, split, stack, carry in, load and sweep up
anymore. By Carey Goldberg. (With photo and graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   SD-INMATE-HOMEBUILDERS (Armour, S.D.) _ A look at an innovative
program in South Dakota that uses prison inmates to build homes for
the elderly, who buy them at low cost and thus are able to sell
their larger homes for low prices to young families with kids who
will move to the town. By Pam Belluck. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-GATOR-FARMER (Anahuac, Texas) _ By the time Mark Porter is
finished carving up one of his gators, there's nothing left but the
fat and the guts, and if anyone can come up with a way to sell
those he'd be eager to hear about it. He has 3,100 alligators at
the moment swishing around ominously in the dark, vaporous,
mosquito-filled building behind his bayou-side home. He is at one
end of a food chain that extends from the soggy and predatory flats
along the Gulf Coast into gourmet food shops and high-end
restaurants in Houston, New York, Tokyo and London, not to mention
the highly prized skins sent to Italy and Singapore. By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   News addicts who use the Internet are most interested in
national and international news and are more likely to turn to
broadcast and cable television news sites instead of newspaper
sites for a quick look at breaking headlines, a report on Internet
news has concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, at least for those Internet news consumers surveyed
recently by Jupiter Communications, a market research firm in New
York, online news is considered almost as reliable as news from
more traditional outlets like newspapers and television news
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 2,200 Internet users showed that 80 percent of
respondents thought that news carried on the Internet was as
reliable as news from traditional outlets, and 7.3 percent
considered Internet news more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Internet audience swells and the medium becomes better
trusted for the delivery of news,'' the report concluded, news
organizations ``will become less concerned'' about scooping
themselves, or putting news out on the Web before they distribute
it through their traditional outlets _ usually newspapers or
television news shows.
</P>
<P>
   After national and international news _ the main attraction for
61 percent of those surveyed _ business (39.3 percent), sports
(34.4 percent) and entertainment (31.3 percent) news are the most
popular, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It also punctured one bit of conventional wisdom holding that
broadcasters, with their access to video, would have a huge
competitive advantage over print counterparts when both competed
online. But even news consumers signing on at work, where
connections tend to be faster (though still relatively pokey),
``simply are not taking the time'' to go through the sometimes
cumbersome business of calling up and playing video clips of news
events.
</P>
<P>
   _ FELICITY BARRINGER
</P>
<P>
   IS THE NBA BRAND LOSING SOME CACHET?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the National Basketball Association _ which oversees a
basketball business worth $2 billion a year _ is canceling its
games in an official lockout as owners try to renegotiate elements
of the collective bargaining agreement with players.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, retailers are canceling orders for NBA merchandise, and
Sports Illustrated has reported that shoppers are avoiding the NBA
boutique in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But hold on to your Michael Jordan cologne bottles: Time Inc.
has chosen to cease its involvement with Inside Stuff, the
basketball magazine it has published in tandem with the league.
</P>
<P>
   The bimonthly magazine is aimed at readers 12 to 19 years old
and is affiliated with ``NBA Inside Stuff,'' a Saturday morning
television show that the NBA produces jointly with NBC. But Time
Inc. has decided not to continue publishing Inside Stuff; after the
January/February issue, the magazine will revert to the National
Basketball Association, which had turned it over to Time Inc. three

   The publisher of Sports Illustrated for Kids, Cleary Simpson,
who also served as publisher of Inside Stuff, said that Time Inc.,
a unit of Time Warner, was re-evaluating its young readers' market.
``Bottom line is, earlier this year we decided that we were going
to focus on growing the Sports Illustrated for Kids brand,'' she
said, adding that Inside Stuff's circulation rate base had been
holding steady at 300,000.

   Adam Silver, the head of NBA Entertainment, the league's
division responsible for the magazine, sounded like a man who had
just discovered a baby in a bassinet at his front door. ``It's not
the best time for us to be changing publishers, frankly,'' he said.
``But it is purely coincidental that the switch is happening during
the lockout.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is not used to the business of magazine publishing,
Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're novices,'' he said, ``so we're in discussions with
several other publishers.''

   FOR MADEMOISELLE, AN INTERNET LINK
</P>
<P>
   When Money magazine decided to redesign its pages beginning with
its September issue, designers chose a page layout for some
sections that had the look and feel of a World Wide Web page. Now,
Mademoiselle is taking that notion a step further, according to
Elizabeth Crow, the editor in chief: With its February issue, not
only will the magazine introduce a top-to-bottom redesign, but
every article will suggest a Web site, chat room or home page on
the Internet for readers to consult for more information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my fifth year at Mademoiselle, which is like dog years,''
Ms. Crow said, explaining her desire for a redesign. ``And it
seemed to me that we suddenly had this fantastic opportunity. We
saw that Cosmo and Glamour were going to duke it out for the title
of `Sexiest Girl in Town.' So it left a brain gap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the smart girl?'' she asked, adding: ``Our readers are
a little more rarefied then theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Those rarefied readers, of course, recently read articles in the
magazine, which is owned by Conde Nast, a unit of Advance
Publications, about ``The Sex Survey: 1,000 Couples Tell Us the
Steamy Truth,'' and a November cover line exhorted readers to
``Bring him to his knees.'' But Ms. Crow sticks with the ``smart
girl in horn-rimmed glasses'' image.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as much as I admire Glamour and Cosmo's huge circulation,
this does make us a little more distinct,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestions come in a box at the end of each article called
a ``Mlle.link'' (pronounced ``millie link'' after the magazine's
in-house nickname, Millie) and will range from thoughtful to funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's an article about the perfect romantic gesture for
guys, then we'll have a `Mlle.link' suggesting a Web site about
women and the romantic gestures they can do for men,'' Ms. Crow
said. ``We're probably not going to be wildly sardonic in our
suggestions all the time, but other times the subject matter will
lend itself to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crow said that Mlle.links would not refer readers solely to
Conde Net Web sites _ which include Swoon (offering romance
advice), Phys (health and fitness articles) and Epicurious (recipes
and travel). But, she said, the links would certainly rely on them
in part.

   David Lauren, son of the designer Ralph Lauren, has decided to
close Swing magazine, his glossy monthly for 20-somethings ...
American Benefactor, previously a quarterly journal for
philanthropists, has said it will now be published only twice a
year. The reason: distribution problems encountered with 3,000
nonprofit corporations that buy subscriptions on behalf of their
top donors, says W. Randall Jones, chief executive of Capital
Publishing ... An early sign of Newsweek's direction under Mark
Whitaker, its newly appointed editor: the debut last week of a
Science and Technology section ... Who gained the most and fell the
most in Fortune magazine's Power 25 Washington lobbyist rankings?
The Credit Union National Association jumped from No. 70 in 1997 to
No. 8 this year; the Children's Defense Fund plunged from 40 to 69
... Neatest job title: Lisa Caputo becomes vice president for
communications and synergy at Buena Vista Publishing Group ... For
the cautious: The CD-ROM ``Cosmopolitan Virtual Makeover: The
Collection'' has sold more than 300,000 copies, Hearst Magazines
says. It allows users to download a photographic self-portrait,
then experiment with variations in hair styles, eyeglasses and eye
color and even has a special segment for wedding veils ... Bad
timing: The December issue of Hachette Filipacchi's George magazine
lists Newt Gingrich as the ninth-most-powerful person in
Washington. He gets a very high three-thumbs-up ``mogul'' rating,
better than two thumbs (``broker''); one thumb (``player) or three
thumbs down (``outcast'').

DIGITAL COMMERCE: CYNICISM UNBOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``No matter how cynical you become, it's never enough to keep
up.''
</P>
<P>
   That aphorism, a sage comment on the absurdities of 1980s
culture, was written by Jane Wagner for the actress Lily Tomlin, in
their 1985 Broadway hit, ``The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life
in the Universe.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Wagner and Ms. Tomlin could just as well have applied
that same observation to the trajectory of the 1990s money-and
power-drunk world of high technology, an industry that seems to be
trying to one-up itself, almost daily, in the ``how cynical can we
get?'' department.
</P>
<P>
   Just how cynical indeed is becoming abundantly clear as the
board room and courtroom dramas play out between Microsoft Corp.
and its archrivals _ Netscape Communications Corp., America Online
Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. _ and, of course, the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-core cynics find honesty contemptible unless it serves a
purpose; the truth too often makes suckers out of those who
practice it. It is an attitude so embedded in our business culture
that feigned ignorance is now an acceptable courtroom defense.
</P>
<P>
   For example, we shake our heads and tut-tut when we read about
the videotaped deposition in which Microsoft's chairman, Bill
Gates, the most powerful and feared executive in all of technology,
``cannot recall'' a single negative e-mail or its context, even
when the wording suggests that he was articulating his ideas,
plans, visions and strategies with great fervor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few people, in or out of the industry, cried foul when one
of Gates' advisers _ a former Justice Department official, no less
_ characterized the Gates testimony as a success because he had
refused to concede anything to his questioners, even when it
appeared they had him dead to rights.
</P>
<P>
   And how cynical is it for some industry executives who say they
believe in an unfettered free market _ and who, not coincidentally,
reap the secondary benefits of Microsoft's success _ to argue that
Microsoft's dominance has been good for consumers?
</P>
<P>
   Most economists would argue that what is good for software
buyers _ whether corporate or consumer _ is choice and quality.
Microsoft asserts that the market domination of its Windows
operating system insures both, by providing a stable platform on
which developers can build myriad application programs.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly true _ until one then considers that most of
Microsoft's vast revenues derive from its own Windows applications.
Few companies are brave enough to develop products that compete
head on with Microsoft's; historically, the odds of winning that
market battle are next to zero.
</P>
<P>
   But choice spurs quality. One could argue, for instance, that
the very best software Microsoft has produced in the last 10 years
has been its browser, Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? Not likely. Internet Explorer is Microsoft's only
major consumer application that has had serious competition _
Netscape's Navigator, which once dominated its market niche at the
90 percent levels of Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft joined the battle with a huge advantage: It could
afford to give its browser away free, and did so. When that failed,
Microsoft _ in what may someday be known as one of the greatest
cynical acts in industry history _ effectively killed the entire
market segment by declaring the browser to be not a browser but the
``HTML engine'' of Windows, an inextricable component of its
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But the deepest cynicism, set forth with great righteousness by
Microsoft and its defenders, is their assertion that, given the
opportunity to do so, its competitors would act exactly as
Microsoft has.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this defense is absolutely true. Strong-arm
tactics and cutthroat behavior have long been considered not just
acceptable business practices in technology, but de rigueur. And
all the industry aspires to the stock price and the market heft of
Microsoft _ although none want to be sued by the government, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   But the argument is specious. No other company has the
opportunity to act like Microsoft; it is too late.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Microsoft was quick to point to last week's
announcement of America Online's takeover of Netscape as proof that
there is plenty of healthy competition in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But while consolidation sometimes enhances competition, even a
troika as apparently formidable as the America Online, Netscape and
Sun Microsystems alliance lacks the muscle to nudge Microsoft from
its market dominance or to stem its hegemony in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the alliance were to conquer every new market they
envision, the personal computer market is enormous and still
growing, and most new _ and old _ machines will be powered by
Microsoft's operating system for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   But the merger announcement was a classic tactic for a cynical
industry. Many such announcements have been made over the last
decade or so, and despite the vast media coverage they engender,
most do not work and are quietly dismantled later, when their
public relations value has waned.
</P>
<P>
   Such cynicism is perfectly legal, of course, but it demeans
everything it touches. Take nothing at face value, it demands,
because everyone has an agenda and everything has a price. At some
point, even principled people start to waver: ``If they can do it,
why shouldn't I get mine, too?''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, that is where the technology industry is
today, a game with few rules and only brute moves _ jockeying for
position, cutting the flanks of the competition whenever possible.
Yet, that game, too, has a price _ but it is a price of a
different, more personal sort.
</P>
<P>
   As Jane Wagner put it so eloquently, ``The trouble with the rat
race is that even if you win, you're still a rat.''

IN NIGER, JOURNALISM WITHOUT CYNICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Previously skedded as NIGERIA-TV-MEDIA) 
(mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the scattered cities of Niger, they have talk radio of a
different kind. It's more like walk-in radio. On Saturday and
Sunday mornings, farmers and merchants and homemakers gather
outside the independent stations run by Radio Anfani in Niamey,
Maradi and Zinder to await the start of a two-hour program.
</P>
<P>
   They want to talk about their children's health or the price of
tomatoes or the latest decree of the military government of Ibrahim
Bare Mainassara. They want to talk about some of the news broadcast
by Radio Anfani, like reports translated from Voice of America or
the German service Deutsche Welle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take telephone callers and put them on the air,''
explained Gremah Boucar, director general of Radio Anfani. Those
who own telephones, he explained, are automatically considered
rich, and ``it shouldn't be such a small circle'' of people doing
the talking.
</P>
<P>
   For a fee equivalent to about $1 a year _ not so small in a
country where per capita share of the gross domestic product is
$200 a year _ listeners can join Radio Anfani's club, which has
36,000 members. Membership lets them talk to listeners and suggest
programming changes or otherwise object to the material the
stations broadcast. ``The only way to really be free is to accept
criticism,'' Boucar said.
</P>
<P>
   In Niger, a landlocked country of 10 million people without Don
Imus, Rush Limbaugh, Howard Stern, Arbitron ratings or democracy,
radio is a truly intimate medium. When people want to talk, they
walk in and talk. When the military _ sorry, maybe it was just
people in stolen military uniforms _ wants to close down a station,
it storms in and smashes the equipment. When people who control the
military or police want to lodge a complaint about his news
broadcasts, they take Gremah Boucar from home, stuff him in a bag,
throw him on a flatbed truck and spend hours discussing how to kill
him.
</P>
<P>
   Boucar, a 39-year-old who saw a journalist for the first time
when Niger's president came to his village of Maine-Soroa 30 years
ago, is about as distant from New York's and Washington's brand of
journalism as possible. His country is remote and obscure, often
confused with its richer and more populous neighbor, Nigeria. His
medium is radio. In the archipelago of settled communities in
Africa, it is more ubiquitous and influential than any newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He and his editorial committee create their 20-hour-a-day
schedule with a practical eye. They produce programs on health
(ways to prevent AIDS or diarrheal illness in infants), the economy
(the price of food) and politics (including pronouncements of
Mainassara's political opponents).
</P>
<P>
   Boucar's attitude toward his profession carries none of the
overt cynicism about the business that tends to permeate
discussions in this country. ``It seems to me that journalism goes
with democracy,'' he said. To practice journalism, therefore, is to
give life to democracy. ``My moral obligation,'' he calls it.
</P>
<P>
   Such earnest simplicity can veer into the dreaded realm of
platitude. But that is a risk the Committee to Protect Journalists
is willing to take when it gives out its International Press
Freedom awards. At its annual dinner last week, the group honored
Boucar and four other journalists, from Indonesia, Peru, Belarus
and Eritrea, who have been persecuted, arrested, tried and
otherwise hindered by governments that have little history of _ or
tolerance for _ a free press.
</P>
<P>
   It was an occasion for some of the profession's most
accomplished or just plain famous members to take a quick refresher
course in the underpinnings of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, like any occasion that mixes professional pride with
expensive food, tuxedos and celebrity, it had its Tom Wolfish
moments. (What to do? Listen to Boucar's paean to democracy and a
free press, or try to spot the actress Sharon Stone?)
</P>
<P>
   Still, celebrity watching and financial prodding aside, the
persecuted foreign journalists and their pampered domestic
counterparts have something to offer each other. When Boucar was
arrested, the outcry of groups like the Committee to Protect
Journalists, and the accompanying protests by American diplomats,
helped free him, or so he tells it. When Anna Zarkova, a Bulgarian
journalist who covers her country's mafia, had acid thrown on her
face, blinding one eye, as she walked down a Sofia street six
months ago, it was the material and psychic support of groups like
Committee to Protect Journalists and the International Women's
Media Foundation that helped lift her from a profound depression,
or so she told friends.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Boucar offers a reminder that simple news broadcasts
and open-mike programs and a willingness to reflect diverse
political viewpoints can be a precious commodity in countries where
the life expectancy of a person is less than 50 years and the life
expectancy of a democracy is less than three.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 20 years, the event ``still maintains its power,''
said Gene Roberts, the committee's chairman and a former managing
editor of The New York Times. ``If anything, it seems to increase
each year. The dinner always runs an hour and a half too long.
There's only one way to make it stay within space limitations _
severely limit the time that the awardees have.'' That, the group
is unwilling to do _ it would be like editing the apostles.

ADDING PROTEIN TO VEGETABLES  
 CARROT HOT DOGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    
 &HT;    It's well known that the turkey served at last week's
Thanksgiving dinner offered more protein than the vegetables that
accompanied it. But researchers have been working on bolstering the
protein quotient of plants, using the same techniques that
genetically enhance plants to make them disease- or pest-resistant.
 &HT;    Jesse Jaynes and Kenneth Derrick have won a patent for a process
that increases the protein in potatoes, sweet potatoes and tobacco.
 &HT;    Jaynes, a biochemist, is vice president of research at Demegen
Inc., a biotechnology company in Pittsburgh. Demegen plans to
expand the technology to wheat, corn and rice.
 &HT;    ``Basically, what I've discovered over the last 10 years is a
way to distribute protein and make it stable within a plant,''
Jaynes said. ``These proteins are tailored for the well-known amino
acid deficiencies in plants.''
 &HT;    Twenty amino acids are used in protein synthesis; the body
produces only eight of those. The other 12 must come from food. But
two favored sources, meat and dairy products, are luxuries in many
parts of the world, so the company hopes its invention can increase
proteins in rice and in vegetables like cassava, which are staple
foods in many developing countries.
 &HT;    ``We've been able to construct a gene and put it into a plant
under conventional genetic transformation methods, and have the
plant express the missing amino acids,'' Richard Ekstrom, president
of Demegen, said. ``It also enables us, and we don't completely
understand why, to see an increase in total protein.''
 &HT;    The gene can be tailored for different plants, and for a variety
of uses for the plant, Jaynes said.
 &HT;    He said researchers first look at a particular crop and the
amino acids in which it is deficient. ``Then we look at the needs
or requirements of the particular animal consuming it,'' he said.
That can help seed manufacturers produce plants that are
genetically enhanced to increase their nutritional value, either
for human consumption or as animal feed.
 &HT;    ``We can design the protein along certain parameters to be
stable and digestible, then synthesize the gene and put it in the
plant,'' Jaynes said.
 &HT;    Ekstrom said manipulation of the proteins did not change the
food's flavor. ``We've done some feeding trials and not seen an
alteration in taste,'' he said. ``We'll do cooking, handling and
shelf-life trials. There's a humanitarian aspect _ if we're
successful in putting it into cassava, we could have a tremendous
impact on countries where what they eat is deficient in amino
acids.''

   Cold Cuts, With Help From Cauliflower
</P>
<P>
   For those who find it difficult to eat enough vegetables,
Mitchell Hochman has patented a formula for cold cuts and hot dogs
that are made from fresh vegetables and low-fat meat.
</P>
<P>
   Hochman's family has run a meat-processing business for more
than 50 years, and he hoped to fill a void he saw between full-fat
meat and tofu or whey vegetarian products. He came up with a
formula for replacing the water commonly added to processed meats
with moisture from fresh vegetables like carrots, cauliflower,
broccoli and spinach. He named his venture ``Project 7099'' because
the vegetables he uses are 70 to 99 percent water.
</P>
<P>
   Hochman's patent calls for liquefying the vegetables and
blending the liquid with lean or low-fat meat. He recommends using
a one-to-four ratio of whole vegetables to meat. He then adds
spices, sweeteners and other flavorings, along with soy protein and
natural food colorings. The food is then formed into meat blocks
intended to resemble hot dogs or cold cuts like bologna.
</P>
<P>
   Hochman, who lives in New York City, wants to license his
invention to a major meat processing company. He won patent
5,766,667.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

ADVERTISING: 20 QUESTIONS ON ADVERTISING AND MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time again to ask 20 questions about advertising, marketing
and the media.
</P>
<P>
   _ Has ``The Rugrats Movie'' released by the Paramount Pictures
unit of Viacom Inc. broken the jinx for films featured in ``milk
mustache'' ads sponsored by the National Fluid Milk Processor
Promotion Board, because unlike ``Matilda'' and ``The Phantom'' _
the other films with characters undergoing mustache makeovers _
``The Rugrats Movie'' looks as if it may do well at the box office?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the Benson &AMP; Hedges cigarette brand sold by Philip Morris
Cos. continue to run advertisements in which cigarettes are
rendered in limp, flexible poses to mimic human activities like
embracing and sitting in chairs now that medical research linking
smoking to impotence has inspired a commercial in which a man who
lights up to impress a woman is embarrassed when his cigarette goes
limp?
</P>
<P>
   _ How dismayed were the editors of Men's Health magazine when
Speaker Newt Gingrich announced his resignation, which came as they
were sending out their December issue featuring a humorous article
by Gingrich that began ``Being a congressman is tough work''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Did the creators of a new campaign for Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. that
promotes the Levi's jeans brand, which carries the theme ``What's
true,'' recall a 1992 campaign for Levi Strauss that promoted
Levi's 501 jeans, which carried the theme ``Got to be real''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Now that General Motors Corp. has licensed the Franklin Mint
to sell die-cast models of the 1930 V-16 Cadillac Imperial Sedan
owned by Al Capone _ described in ads as ``Scarface's legendary
`Fortress on Wheels''' _ will collectors soon be pitched a series
of Notorious Crime Vehicles like the getaway cars used by Bonnie
Parker and Clyde Barrow, the sedans in which mobsters met grisly
deaths in ``The Godfather'' and the armored car held up in a 1950
Boston robbery known as the Brink's job?
</P>
<P>
   _ Did readers of Sports Illustrated notice that a recent issue
included ads on nearby pages that carried the headlines ``You could
be this close to winning a trip to Super Bowl XXXIII,'' for Sprint
Corp., and ``You may be this close to winning a trip to the Super
Bowl,'' for the Pringles snacks sold by Procter &AMP; Gamble Co?
</P>
<P>
   _ When Helmut Lang started a fashion fad in the spring by having
models wear rubber-soled lace-up nurse's shoes as part of ensembles
of hospital-white clothing, was he thinking of a 1996 commercial
for Polaroid cameras by the Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners agency
owned by Omnicom Group, in which a fashion designer's nurse
unwittingly inspires a line of haute couture?
</P>
<P>
   _ Was it excitement, urgency or desperation that led Kellogg Co.
to place a bright red arrow next to a box of Kellogg's Honey Crunch
Corn Flakes in a recent newspaper coupon insert, proclaiming in fat
yellow letters ``You've got to try this!''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Can consumers continue to pronounce the product
tongue-twisters being promulgated by the designer Ralph Lauren, who
after introducing a fragrance named Extreme Polo Sport Ralph Lauren
has brought out apparel called Polo Sport Ralph Lauren Sportman?
</P>
<P>
   _ Would the singer and songwriter Paul Simon ever agree to sell
rights to one of his hits to a giant soap company, so that
commercials could offer consumers ``50 Ways to Love Your Lever''?
</P>
<P>
   _ When AT&AMP;T Corp. advertises that its collectible ``Star Trek''
prepaid cards offer ``clear, quality connections to anyone,
anytime, virtually anywhere,'' will hard-core Trekkers use them to
place person-to-Vulcan calls to Spock?
</P>
<P>
   _ Now that gossip and society columnists are popularizing the
phrase ``arm candy'' to refer to an attractive young thing who is
escorted by an older, more powerful person for others to eye
appreciatively, how long will it be before they begin using a
companion term, ``room candy,'' for a similarly attractive young
thing who is invited to receptions or parties for decorative
purposes?
</P>
<P>
   _ Was it good public relations for Haymarket Publishing Group to
send an invitation to a reporter to a reception introducing an
American edition of the trade publication PR Week that misspelled
both his first and last names?
</P>
<P>
   _ Was the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco unit of BAT Industries PLC
pleased with the placement of a full-page advertisement for Kool
Natural cigarettes in a recent issue of USA Today, which appeared
opposite articles about a state attorney general who helped
negotiate the national tobacco settlement (``Lawyer Who Took On
Tobacco Is a Fighter'') and the settlement-related increase in the
price of cigarettes that was described as the biggest ever?
</P>
<P>
   _ When the U.S. Postal Service brings out a stamp next year
honoring Bernard Herrmann, the composer of music for many Alfred
Hitchcock films, will ads carry headlines like ``Lick one and
you'll get vertigo'' and ``Use this on letters going north by
northwest''?
</P>
<P>
   _ As the Fox Entertainment Group unit of News Corp. and Walt
Disney Co. open themed bar and restaurant chains named Fox Sports
Sky Box and ESPN Zone, will they be required to perpetually pay
huge fees for TV rights to professional sports for fear patrons
would flee if they presented lacrosse matches and darts
tournaments?
</P>
<P>
   _ Did the creators of a new campaign for Kellogg that encourages
cereal consumption, which carries the theme ``Help yourself,''
recall a mid-1990s campaign for Dairy Management Inc. that
encouraged milk consumption, which carried the theme ``Milk, help
yourself''?
</P>
<P>
   _ If smokers refuse to buy a new variety of Newport cigarettes
that the Lorillard unit of Loews Corp. is describing in a campaign
as ``nonmenthol,'' will the smokes be deemed a ``nonsuccess''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Does Unilever try to withdraw ads for Fresh Rain All detergent
and Fresh Rain Snuggle fabric softener from parts of the country
that suffer flood damage?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will 20-somethings in khaki pants dancing to an old Louis
Prima tune swing by an advertising columnist and wail ``You ask a
lot of questions for someone from Brooklyn''?

A ONE-MAN UNIVERSITY OF LATIN MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Puerto Rico, N.Y.)  (js) 
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's hard to get more than a few sentences out of
Harry Sepulveda, though he would like to talk some more. When he's
at work, perched behind the cash register at the Record Mart in the
Times Square subway station, Sepulveda attracts a line of fans.
Sometimes they are from Japan, video cameras in hand, hoping to
take home some tape of a legend. Sometimes they're from France or
Sweden, Latin music enthusiasts who have come to the heart of Latin
recordings. They pick up hundreds of dollars' worth of CDs; the
owner of the record store, the ever-patient Jesse Moskowitz, won't
ring up their choices right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you run them by Harry?'' he asks. ``Make sure you're
getting the good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same in Sepulveda's other realm, the city's club scene.
Musicians, critics, dancers and well wishers regularly line up to
tell him about what's going on or to find things out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about live music I love,'' Sepulveda said
recently. ``I like to stand right in front and see my friends play,
and when something happens that's special on the bandstand, we all
look at each other, because we know it's happening. I live for
those moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Judged by the nature of his job, Sepulveda is simply a record
store clerk. But if his cultural importance and the respect
accorded him are taken into account, then he clearly is important,
for he is the living memory of Puerto Rican and Cuban music, both
in the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The singer Gilberto Santa Rosa, one of Puerto Rico's biggest
salsa stars and a historian of the music, is quick to testify to
Sepulveda's standing. ``Harry is so important to who we are as a
people,'' he said. ``On the simplest level, he has an apartment
filled with records, so when musicians need music, they go to him.
But he knows everything. He knows who played on what recording, who
worked where, who was listening to whom, who was playing well when.
He's our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Latin music studies are in their infancy. Most Latin record
companies care very little about documenting the music. Outside
Cuba, few books are published on the subject, and to become an
expert, one has to be privy to an oral heritage built upon many
hours with people who were present at the music's creation or heard
about it from those who were. Which is why Sepulveda, who has an
astonishing memory and, even better, is profoundly generous with
his information, tends to be surrounded wherever he goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the University of Harry,'' said Ned Sublette, the
owner of Qbadisc Records, a Manhattan company specializing in Cuban
music. Sublette started his apprenticeship with Sepulveda in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I was trying to learn everything I could about
this music,'' Sublette said. ``We would hang out and talk about
shoes and music and people, and we became friends through music.
That's our great passion, and I would go to his house, and he'd
play me things from his collection and really start to teach me the
discography.''
</P>
<P>
   Sepulveda's generosity is often repaid. This summer Santa Rosa
paid for Sepulveda's flight to Puerto Rico to attend a concert for
Santa Rosa's birthday. Sepulveda's presence was deemed essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came to New York, in the early 1980s, singing
with Willie Rosario's band, one of the first things I did was go
see Harry,'' Santa Rosa said. ``I'm a collector and historian, too.
But Harry's much more disciplined than I am. Anyway, we became
friends, and every time I'm in New York working, I hang out with
him. So the least I could do, having learned so much from him, is
invite him to Puerto Rico for the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Sepulveda's earliest memories are of Puerto Rico, where
he was born. (He moved to New York in 1959.) He remembers the
parties held in his neighborhood of Ensenada in the town of
Guanica, P.R., where trios or small groups played for dancers.
</P>
<P>
   At an early age he was showing the signs of an infatuation with
the music. When Sepulveda's mother or older sisters needed to find
him at the party, he said, they would go to the bandstand. He would
be standing there, listening. A few weeks ago, he attended a show
at the Copacabana by the Puerto Rican percussionist Roberto Roena
and didn't leave until 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   When Sepulveda first moved to New York, settling in the
Williamsburg section of Brooklyn (he now lives in the East
Village), he was more interested in rhythm and blues. But Puerto
Rican and Cuban music was on the record player at home, and he
remembers swapping albums, borrowing them from friends and soaking
it all in, reveling in the excitement of every new release. By the
time he was a teen-ager, he was going to the Palladium, the
legendary home of Latin music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember seeing the Cuban singer Vincentico Valdes there;
what an experience!'' Sepulveda said. ``I was working in
restaurants as a kid to support my two habits, which were music and
clothes. So I'd finish school, run off to work, then go out at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Sepulveda's family could not afford to send him to college, he
said, so he went to work. He kept buying records, hanging around
musicians, asking questions. He befriended an older man, Pepe
Rodriguez, who worked at the Record Mart's precursor on West 14th
Street in Manhattan. Rodriguez became like a father to him, and
when he retired, he recommended Sepulveda for the job. Now 50,
Sepulveda has spent half his life working for Record Mart.
</P>
<P>
   In the store, Sepulveda is authoritative and determined, and
when a customer asks him about something, he'll bustle over to the
CD bins, pulling out one or two or three CDs to demonstrate not
only what the buyer had wanted but Sepulveda's own tangential,
connective ideas. He works in a cramped space, and Sepulveda like
the best athletes, makes navigating the terrain look easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still go see Pepe,'' Sepulveda said. ``He knew a lot of
stuff. But he's just such a beautiful person, so nice to be around.
He taught me the beginnings. But I was always going out, hanging
with other collectors and musicians. And people in my neighborhood
were really into the music, and we would get together with a crowd,
listen to different things. I was doing that stuff when I was very
young, and I learned lot about Arsenio Rodriguez, Benny More,
Cortijo, Orquesta Aragon from older music fans in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the only way to learn. When Sepulveda was younger, there
were even fewer sources of information about the music than there
are now, with no magazines and virtually no scholarship. So he
watched, and he listened, and he remembered everything.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Sepulveda has parlayed that information into a lucrative
sideline. He's the resident expert at several labels that have been
reissuing the music for CDs. For Sublette, he has produced a
five-volume set called ``Cuban Gold,'' regarded as one of the best
compilations of Cuban music available. He has also produced some 40
reissues for West Side, a small label in New Jersey that has been
reissuing some of the most important older Cuban and Puerto Rican
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry has really helped us, because he has ideas on what to
reissue and what not to reissue; he really knows the catalog,''
said Hector Varona, a co-owner of West Side. ``And Harry is aware
of who is buying what in each part of the country: what will sell
in California, what will sell in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Both projects strongly reflect Sepulveda's point of view, which
is to find the best music recorded and issue it, even if it is
known only to a few. As an example, there is Sepulveda's
compilation for West Side of performances by the obscure but
greatly talented Cuban singer Silvestre Mendez. And the whole of
``Cuban Gold'' represents Sepulveda's esthetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry picked the tunes,'' Sublette said. ``He's very
demanding. If something passes his muster, it is a good record. He
tastes aren't predictable. His standards are high, but he's not
close minded. Within the universe of music he likes, anything
that's new has a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there a formula that Sepulveda uses to arrive at his choices?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not really,'' he said. ``I do the compilations in 10
minutes or so. I walk around with the idea in my head; then it
comes out. If I waited another 10 minutes, the compilation would be
completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   And what are his criteria for what makes a good recording?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I like lyrics,'' he said. ``I like arrangements, too.
But you know, sometimes a record won't have anything but a feeling,
and you have to go with that. The person's really trying, and it
just makes you feel good. That's what counts.''

   CLINTON, Ontario _ It's hard to get to Alice Munro, to the
little town of Clinton, Ontario, where she lives in the rolling
farmland of southern Canada. In the autumn light, Clinton seems
bleak, a cluster of small undistinguished houses of wood or yellow
brick set in rich black soil, overwhelmed by the landscape around
it. With its unforgiving climate, Clinton is not for the
uncourageous. But Ms. Munro will never leave. She finds her stories
here amid the descendants of the Scottish settlers, with their
modest, restrained ways, their short, to-the-point sentences. It's
all the material she could ever want. ``I love living here,'' Ms.
Munro said. ``I love the landscape so much _ more than love it.
It's something I know so thoroughly I don't want to detach from it.
I like living in isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice Munro has been called one of the best short-story writers
in the English language. Her books sell about 25,000 to 30,000
copies a year, very good for a short-story writer. She is a writer
other writers admire for her technical skills and the purity of her
style. She is known for the complex structure of her stories. A
typical Alice Munro story might begin at a point that most writers
would consider the end, then jump to a time 10 years later, then
back again.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Alice it's like a shorthand,'' said Richard Ford, the
novelist. ``You'll just mention her, and everybody just kind of
generally nods, that she's just sort of as good as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing her new book, ``The Love of a Good Woman'' (Alfred A.
Knopf) in The New York Times this month, Michael Gorra compared Ms.
Munro to Wordsworth, who can ``collapse one moment, one memory,
into another with an unrivaled combination of clarity and
subtlety.'' She has been awarded Canada's Governor General's Award
three times. This month she won the Giller Prize, at $25,000 one of
Canada's biggest literary awards. And she always comes back to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a really beautiful landscape,'' Ms. Munro admitted.
But ``I love a life apart from the whole world of writing.'' Every
winter she takes a break at her condominium in Comox, British
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Munro's stories are about ordinary people: their secrets,
their memories of acts of violence, their sexual longings. In
``Cortes Island,'' in her new collection, a would-be writer takes a
job caring for an old man, Gorrie. Ms. Munro writes that the
narrator is aware of ``his pungent smell, his jelly eye, his dog's
teeth.'' But she has sexual dreams about him, ``pagan'' dreams ``in
which the attack, the response, the possibilities, went beyond
anything life offered.'' ``And from which romance was banished.
Decency as well. Our bed _ Gorrie's and mine _ was the gravelly
beach or the rough boat deck or the punishing coils of greasy
rope.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Before the Change,'' another harrowing story in the new
collection, a woman discovers her father is an abortionist. She
assists him as he operates. ``He had a series of rods, all of the
same length but of a graduated thickness,'' the character says. ``I
could not see the actual, intimate progress of these instruments.
But I could feel it, from the arriving waves of pain in her body
that beat down the spasms of apprehension.'' ``The thing I feel
most strongly makes a story is a kind of primordial moment, an
awful revelation, that you can't do anything about,'' Ms. Munro
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Some stories in the collection are about what Ms. Munro calls
``a new kind of old woman, women who grew up under one set of rules
and then found they could live with another.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``new kind of old woman'' is about 60, has been something of
a hippie in her youth, has had a period of irresponsibility, an
affair and has sometimes in effect abandoned her children to the
care of others. ``We associate old women with conventional sexual
morality,'' said Ms. Munro, who is 67. But ``a lot of women lived
more risky lives than their daughters. You take the risk of being
lonely.'' Ms. Munro's favorite story in her new book is ``Save the
Reaper.'' A grandmother who had a daughter out of wedlock feels her
daughter's resentment. One day the older woman picks up a
hitchhiker, a girl, who makes a sexual pass at her. At the end the
woman wonders if the girl will ever come back and see her again.
But, Ms. Munro writes: ``The girl wouldn't come. Much better offers
would turn up before she'd stood 10 minutes by the highway. More
dangerous offers perhaps, but more interesting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Munro was raised in Wingham, Ontario, 20 miles from Clinton.
Her father, Robert Laidlaw, was a fox farmer, her mother a former
teacher. Ancestors have been in Huron County since the 1850s. Ms.
Munro's story ``A Wilderness Station'' was inspired by an ancestor
who was killed by a falling tree. In Ms. Munro's version, a woman
claims to have murdered her husband. Like other Munro stories, ``A
Wilderness Station'' deals with an unsolved murder. It turns out
the man was killed by his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Munro's family was poor, she says. When the family farm
failed, her father worked in a foundry. He longed to write a novel
and finished his first novel just before his death at 75. ``The
McGregors: A Novel of an Ontario Pioneer Family,'' was published a
short time later.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Munro began writing poetry secretly at the age of 11. She
was an avid reader, benefiting, she points out, from the library
system that Andrew Carnegie established in Canada. But she was
raised to be a farmer's wife. ``In my background, ambition isn't
valued,'' she said. ``Being modest and accepting your limitations
and trying not to stand out; it's a tribal value.'' When she was
12, her mother became ill with Parkinson's disease. Ms. Munro took
over the household until she won a two-year scholarship to the
University of Western Ontario. While a student, she sold her first
story, to the Canadian Broadcasting Company.
</P>
<P>
   She also met a fellow student, James Munro, whom she married.
The Munros had three daughters: Sheila, now 45; Jenny, 41, and
Andrea, 31. A fourth daughter died at birth. Ms. Munro struggled to
be a mother and a writer. Her husband, she said, was supportive.
``Quite early she used to send stories to The New Yorker,'' he
remembered recently. ``They came back so fast,'' he said, that she
had the feeling that someone's job was just to send them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a whole lot of guilt about writing,'' Mr. Munro said.
``Her friends phoned and she wouldn't tell them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Munro suffered deep depressions. ``I was doing two jobs and
not doing either one of them as well as I wished,'' she said of the
years spent being a mother and trying to write.
</P>
<P>
   She also felt, she said, that being intellectually serious would
compromise her femininity, that if she fulfilled her talent as a
writer she would lose her sexual attractiveness. In one of her most
famous stories, ``The Albanian Virgin,'' a Canadian woman is
kidnapped during the 1920s by Albanian bandits. The woman renounces
her sexuality, carries a weapon and lives like a man. ``It's about
virgins who opt out of sex,'' Ms. Munro said. ``That's when you get
the right to carry a gun, to eat at the men's table, with women
waiting on you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to camouflage my seriousness behind my sexuality,''
Ms. Munro said.
</P>
<P>
   The Munros moved to Victoria, British Columbia, where Munro
founded a bookstore, Munro's Books. ``I started working in the
store,'' she said. ``I got out of my depression and started to
write.'' In 1968 her first book, ``Dance of the Happy Shades,'' was
published in Canada, and she won the Governor General's Award. In
1971, came her only novel, ``Lives of Girls and Women.'' She has
never written another novel. ``I just can't,'' she said, adding
that when she begins to stretch her stories into novels, ``They
start to sag. I'm thinking of something now, how it might be a
novel. I betcha it won't be! My ambition is to write a novel before
I die.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Ms. Munro and her husband were divorced. Ms. Munro
moved back to Ontario, and Gerald Fremlin, whom she had known in
college, resurfaced in her life. He had gone on to become a
geographer. ``We drank three martinis,'' she said, ``and we very
speedily decided we were going to stay together.'' They were
married in 1976.

   With ``The Moons of Jupiter,'' published in the United States in
1983, Ms. Munro caught the notice of American reviewers, and her
next book, ``The Progress of Love,'' in 1986, was lavishly praised
by critics.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Munro lives an isolated life in the small white
clapboard house where Fremlin was raised. Ms. Munro begins writing
first thing in the morning. ``I don't speak to Gerry. I write for
three to four hours, not answering the phone, not getting out of my
night clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   She revises extensively and then sends her work straight to her
agent in New York. ``I would never give my work to anyone to
read,'' she said. ``I have too little confidence, not the real
confidence to be a writer.'' She added, ``Even Gerry doesn't read
my work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes I do,'' said Fremlin. ``But we don't discuss it.''

`THE JEWELS OF TESSA KENT': LIMPID EYES DEVOUR PAGES WITH EAGER
CURIOSITY
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, I've been resisting the temptation to read one of
those blockbusters by Judith Krantz until, finally, I couldn't wait
any longer. And now I've just finished ``The Jewels of Tessa
Kent,'' Ms. Krantz's latest novel, and there's a tear in my eye
(despite my effort at world-weary self-control) at the blissful,
star-crossed passion of it all.
</P>
<P>
   But let me be frank. I feel jealous, yes jealous, at the ease
with which Ms. Krantz seemed to spin out her tale of the
ultra-glamorous, the ultra-rich and the ultra-tragic. And I feel
relief as well, relief that, at long last, I have relinquished, if
only briefly, my claim on highbrow culture, and have experienced
total immersion in sudsy, perfumed, tumescent melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   I might as well just admit it: I wanted so much to hate ``The
Jewels of Tessa Kent,'' to find it bathetic and overdone. It is
bathetic and overdone, and _ here comes the critical admission of a
lifetime _ I kind of liked it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's not surprising, really. Since Ms. Krantz gave up
writing about orgasms for Cosmopolitan, her novels (which don't
just have orgasms, they have ``exploding orgasms'') have sold 75
million copies worldwide. And the millions of women who buy them
presumably know what they want. (I assume that they are mostly
women, though, who knows, maybe there are male acolytes too,
reading books like ``Scruples'' and ``I'll Take Manhattan'' as
though engaging in a solitary vice.)
</P>
<P>
   Let's not be snobbish. Flaubert's Emma Bovary read the
19th-century French equivalent of Judith Krantz when she was a
girl. (``Gloomy forests, romantic woes, oaths, sobs, tears and
kisses, small boats in the moonlight,'' as Flaubert put it.) With
Ms. Krantz it's not so much small boats in the moonlight as large
stone farmhouses in Provence, but never mind. The core melodramatic
concept _ the dark and tormenting family secret of a rich and
celebrated main character _ go back as far as Henry Fielding's
``Tom Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   So where to begin? With beauty and money, of course, because in
Ms. Krantz's new novel beauty and money are literally the same
thing (well, not literally the same, but literally is one of the
words that Ms. Krantz uses a bit loosely, as a general emphatic,
not to be taken literally). Beauty and money are inseparable in the
Judith Krantz world, and one glows with vicarious pleasure as the
dramatis personae disport themselves beautifully and richly across
these pages of upwardly mobile middle-class tumult and strife.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough to say simply beauty and money. Ms. Krantz's
Tessa Kent is beyond beautiful. She is a movie star ``born with a
physical presence no one else had ever possessed in the history of
the screen,'' no less.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be fooled by the glitter and the dazzle of her life,
by the lover whose idea of foreplay is to cover her ``from her neck
to her feet with the contents of her jewel cases''; don't be taken
in by Tessa's extraordinary fame, or by the seemingly blissful
nature of her life, by her marriage to a super-millionaire who is a
good man, or by the way she glories in his ferocious possessiveness
of her, glories even in his selfishness, glories in her willingness
to give herself to him ``gladly in an undivided way.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled because life is not easy for Tessa Kent. Or it
is easy, but there is that family secret, hidden like William
Blake's invisible worm, cradled inside the gorgeous, enfolding
petals of the rose. And there is tragedy lurking, for not even the
beautiful and the wealthy are immune to accident and disease and
the consequences of their mistakes. Sooner or later, you, the
reader, realize with a special Schadenfreude-laden thrill that
there is going to be a reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   In Tessa's case, the secret is something that happened when she
was 14 and attending a Roman Catholic school, sent there by her
clawingly ambitious mother and her pious father. The worst
imaginable happens _ seduction by the handsome captain of the
football team, shame, a mighty effort to achieve forgiveness and
forgetfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes movie stardom, love, marriage, fabulous wealth. The
jewels are symbolic of it all. Yes, they symbolize the
voluptuousness of her husband's possession of her. Yes, they
symbolize the lustrous rhapsody that is her existence. Yes, she
adored them and exulted in them, especially the rare green diamond
in her ring. And yes, the jewels will also symbolize her contrition
when, yearning for reconciliation with the daughter she had never
fully recognized, she converts them into the true gold of the good.
</P>
<P>
   There are others in this story, especially Maggie, Tessa's
secret daughter, a clumsy and unhappy child who grows up to be a
beauty about whose breasts Ms. Krantz writes a great deal _ also
about her ``open, impetuous, curious, innocent lips, groaning with
hungry haste and need.'' Averting the risk that she will be
swallowed whole by an avalanche of swollen adjectives, Maggie
manages to be an interesting character, clever and smart as well as
sensuous and greedy for experience, making up for the lost time of
her childhood. When she is finished groaning with hungry haste,
Maggie earns the gilded life that she will live as the novel
closes, secure in the knowledge that, after all, she did the right
thing, and so, in the nick of time, did Tessa, her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Krantz's savory tale ends in the first week of June 1994,
with Tessa bravely facing a new tragedy and Maggie a new future.
Even in the midst of all that beauty and money there is sadness,
and in the midst of sadness, hope. ``The Jewels of Tessa Kent'' is
a morality tale for our time that will be enjoyed by many millions.
Despite my better judgment and my reckless, impetuous,
larger-than-life effort not to, I enjoyed it myself.

FIRST BOSTON POLISHES ITS IMAGE 
HELP FOR SPEEDERS 
WEB ADDRESS FOR SALE

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston's technology banking team _ led by
the uber-banker Frank Quattrone, who moved from Deutsche Bank in
July _ is turning the luxurious Phoenician resort in Arizona into a
playland for clients at its annual conference starting Monday. And
for the first time, reporters are invited to this most exclusive of
parties, which will include four-wheeling in the Sonoran desert and
a dinner show starring the comedian Dana Carvey.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden new openness? Credit Suisse First Boston could be
trying to improve its image.
</P>
<P>
   The company ranks seventh in advising on technology mergers and
acquisitions in the five months since Quattrone was promised
millions in exchange for bringing in more technology business.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston has been involved in six transactions
worth $2.14 billion, according to Securities Data Co.
</P>
<P>
   That pales in comparison with activity for Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, where Quattrone got his start, which advised on 16 deals
valued at $23.8 billion, and Bear Stearns Co., which advised on
five deals for $14.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse was absent last week from one of the technology
sector's highest-profile deals _ the acquisition of Netscape
Communications Corp. by America Online.
</P>
<P>
   And when Ascend Communications bought Stratus Computer Inc.
earlier this year, it was Salomon Smith Barney representing Ascend,
not the longtime relationship bankers in Quattrone's group.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Credit Suisse have to say?
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the company said it was indeed trying to
market itself to a wider audience. ``Frank Quattrone recognizes the
value of cultivating good media,'' she said.

   Get a Speeding Ticket, Head for the Internet
</P>
<P>
   What do you get when you cross an Internet marketing guy with a
lawyer? In one case, www.speedingticket.net, a new Web service for
people nabbed for speeding and other traffic violations while away
from home territory.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of the site _ not to be confused with
www.speedingticket.com, which sells a book on how to beat a
speeding ticket _ is to match traffic violators with local lawyers
who can represent them in court in the counties where they got
their tickets. And with the holiday travel season soon to be in
full swing, the prospects are pretty good that there will be plenty
of tickets doled out to people just passing through town. Already,
the site is getting 11,000 hits a day on some weekends.
</P>
<P>
   John White, an Internet entrepreneur in Charlotte, N.C., said he
came up with the idea after a friend who is a lawyer told him how
much effort he had been putting into trying to get the names of
traffic violators from out of town in the hopes of getting their
business. Eventually, White says, he plans to offer an online
traffic school and listings of bail bondsmen nationwide. Pretty
soon, traffic violators will not even have to leave their homes to
get themselves out of hot water.
</P>
<P>
   White charges lawyers $99 each to list their firms on
speedingticket.net, and so far he has 1,500 of the nation's 3,100
counties covered. His goal is to list three or four lawyers in each
county, so people can shop around.
</P>
<P>
   For the ticketed, the service is free _ but the legal services
are not. Depending on the area of the country and the complexity of
the case, a traffic violator can typically hire a lawyer in a
speeding case for $100 to $300. White says his biggest customers so
far have been truck drivers and traveling salespeople, who cannot
afford to see their insurance premiums go up.

   More Fancy Prices for a Domain Name
</P>
<P>
   And you thought the days of Internet squatting were over? Kevin
Sinclair, who lives in a Silicon Valley suburb, is the lucky owner
of www.computer.com, presumably one the most valuable domain names
on the World Wide Web. And now he wants to sell it for at least
$500,000. So far the highest bidder has offered $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   His associate representing him in the sale, Gary Kremen, insists
that Sinclair is not a speculator but that he planned to start an
online computer store when he acquired the name in 1994. He quickly
realized he did not have a shot in such a competitive market, even
with the right address. So he left the working world to stay home
with his children.
</P>
<P>
   While Sinclair, who also has the phone number 1-800-COMPUTER, is
willing to accept cash, he would prefer stock in an Internet
start-up. And Kremen may be just the right guy to help him make a
deal: Kremen was involved in the negotiations between Digital
Equipment Corp. and Jack Marshall, who until earlier this year
owned the address www.altavista.com. Digital, which owns the Alta
Vista search engine, paid Marshall $3 million to give the name up,
reportedly the largest amount ever paid for a domain name.

   12 Nude Pictures Start a Copyright Extravaganza
</P>
<P>
   As copyright battles go, this one just does not seem to have an
end in sight. Just a few weeks after a federal judge ruled that the
Internet Entertainment Group could display 12 nude photos of Laura
Schlessinger, the radio talk show celebrity whose program offers
advice to both the lovesick and the just plain sick, on its Web
site, the company finds itself caught up in a nasty fight to
prevent other Web sites from doing the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Seattle, has sent a cease-and-desist
warning to more than 50 Web site owners to get them to stop
publishing the photos, which the company bought from Bill Ballance,
Schlessinger's lover 20 years ago. And last week, it filed a
lawsuit against one of them, the After Hours Production Co. of
Houston, calling the whole lot Internet pirates.
</P>
<P>
   It all started earlier this fall when Schlessinger, known to her
fans as Laura, sued Internet Entertainment in an ill-fated attempt
to prevent it from displaying the photos. On Nov. 2, a federal
judge in Los Angeles ruled in favor of the company, saying that as
the legal copyright holder, it had the right to publish the photos,
which were apparently taken while Schlessinger and Ballance were
married to other people. Since then, more than 100,000 people have
viewed the photos online.
</P>
<P>
   With this latest action, the saga of the dirty dozen is, once
again, about to test the limits of the nation's copyright laws as
they apply to the Internet. Internet Entertainment Group contends
that the other Web site owners could be fined as much as $100,000
and handed jail terms of as long as five years.
</P>
<P>
   As for Schlessinger, it's irrelevant to her how many Web sites
pick up the photos at this point or who wins the court battles.
``What difference does it make?'' said Keven Bellows, vice
president and general manager of ``The Laura Schlessinger Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cow is already out of the barn,'' she said.

`TUG-OF-WAR': TAIWAN AND ITS TROUBLES AS AN UNDERDOG 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Program notes are at the end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(js) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an age distinguished by mass cruelty wherever one looks,
Americans may be forgiven if they have not given much attention, in
the intervals between emergencies, to the decades of troubles of
the people of Taiwan. Monday night, to repair the neglect, comes
``Tug-of-War: The Story of Taiwan,'' which offers a glimpse of
history from the perspective of a perpetual underdog caught up in
wars, occupations, power plays and other ills of the weak
confronted by the strong.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as the narrator notes, begins with geography. Lying
90 miles from China, the island of Taiwan has always been ``too
near to China to be different, too far away to be the same.''
Although they are mostly of Chinese stock, the Taiwanese had a
reputation for independence, not that it did them much good in
1895, when their island fell into the hands of the Japanese. When
Japan invaded China in 1937, the Taiwanese found themselves drafted
to fight for the invaders. Without much affection for either side,
they were pawns in a political contest that they had no power to
influence.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute program gives a sense of what it was like for a
politically marginal people caught up after World War II in what
seemed like a remote civil war in China and then the even more
remote maneuverings of the Cold War. (For viewers of a certain age,
the names Quemoy and Matsu may recall panicky threats of war
between the United States and Communist China.)
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalist Chinese who fled the mainland after the
Communist takeover and established themselves in Taiwan saw the
island as enemy territory; after decades of occupation, its people
seemed more Japanese than Chinese. Efforts at independence were
crushed by the Nationalists. The Taiwanese had a pithy line for the
change in rule, from Japanese to Chinese: ``The dog leaves, but the
pig comes.''
</P>
<P>
   The doleful history is brightened by a look at how U.S. aid,
shifts in diplomatic calculations, the famous Nixon opening to
China, economic success and the rise of an indigenous opposition
movement against the Nationalists has brought more freedom and a
reassertion of cultural identity to the islanders in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has joined the other ``mini-dragons'' of Southeast Asia
in the ``economic miracle'' club, at least for now. The lure of the
vast Chinese market is strong _ money has a way of making allies _
but the worries about provoking China with too flagrant a show of
independence remain real. As ever, the Taiwanese remain at the
mercy of other, greater powers.

STUDIO DISAPPOINTED OVER `BABE' SEQUEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ What happened to ``Babe: Pig in the City''? The
family film, which cost about $90 million and had an initial gross
of only $8.5 million, was not only the most high-profile failure
over the Thanksgiving weekend, but it may cause the ouster of
Universal Pictures' president, Casey Silver, several high-level
talent agents and studio executives said.
</P>
<P>
   One top Universal executive, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said simply: ``I'm heartbroken. It will not be a
pleasant week.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two weeks ago, Frank Biondi, the chairman of Universal
Studios, the parent of Universal Pictures, was dismissed by Edgar
Bronfman Jr., the chief executive at Seagram, which owns the
studio. The projected departure of Silver, a well-liked figure at
Universal, would come after the brutally disappointing reviews and
box office for ``Meet Joe Black,'' a three-hour drama directed by
Martin Brest and starring Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins. Several
executives said that Ron Meyer, Silver's boss and president of
Universal Studios, might take over the Universal Pictures job.
</P>
<P>
   What was dismaying to executives at Universal was that the
sequel to the 1995 Australian sleeper hit ``Babe,'' about an
orphaned pig taken in by a charmingly eccentric farmer, earned
generally positive reviews and was lavishly promoted by the studio.
But the sequel, directed by George Miller, whose previous movies
included the ``Mad Max'' trilogy and ``Lorenzo's Oil,'' simply
failed to draw crowds. By contrast, ``A Bug's Life,'' the
computer-generated animated film made by Pixar and Disney, took in
a record $46.5 million for the five-day holiday, Disney said.
</P>
<P>
   While the disappointing box office for ``Babe: Pig in the City''
cannot be fully explained, what happened to it is, in some ways, a
textbook case of present-day Hollywood, where a studio can find
itself almost locked into a release date and unable to budge
despite extraordinary competition.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Universal said the decision to produce the sequel
to ``Babe'' was a foregone conclusion. The endearing and
sophisticated original film, in which barnyard animals spoke to one
another, cost only about $30 million. It received stunning critical
reviews, and took in more than $64 million in the United States and
about $150 million abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding to make the sequel, studio executives gave the
highly inventive Miller a free hand and set the film's release for
the 1998 Thanksgiving weekend. Although sequels generally cost far
more than originals, the price soared to close to $90 million
partly because of complicated computer effects. With the studio's
agreement, the newer film was designed to be more inventive and
lavish than the first. (In addition, the sequel cost $25 million to
$30 million to promote.)
</P>
<P>
   Like any other studio with a potential family franchise,
Universal began making deals for tie-ins and toys. An estimated 100
licensees around the world began filling stores last month with toy
Babes, CD-ROM Babes and interactive Babes that asked for meals.
Essentially, the studio was more or less stuck with its release
date because the merchandise was being distributed to coincide with
the opening.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, several Universal executives said, the studio's
lack of flexibility was especially damaging. For one, the new
``Babe'' was set to open against ``A Bug's Life.'' For the last few
years Disney has had a virtual lock on Thanksgiving with such hits
as ``Toy Story'' (also made by Pixar), ``101 Dalmations'' and
``Flubber.'' As a result, ``Babe'' faced heavy competition.
</P>
<P>
   The situation worsened for ``Babe'' when Paramount moved ``The
Rugrats Movie'' from Christmas to Nov. 20. The film, based on the
popular Nickelodeon series, was almost guaranteed to lure smaller
children and their families, as well as pre-teen-agers, cutting
heavily into the ``Babe'' audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Rugrats' audience is incredibly loyal, kids from 3 to
13,'' said Albie Hecht, president of film and television
entertainment at Nickelodeon. ``There's a real emotional connection
that kids have to `Rugrats.' In many ways, `Rugrats' will be the
first movie for a lot of kids.'' The film, which opened at No. 1 in
its first week, took in an estimated $28 million over Thanksgiving
and has grossed about $58 million so far.
</P>
<P>
   There was initially some thought about moving ``Babe'' to
Christmas, but it would have competed with Dreamworks' ``Prince of
Egypt,'' the story of Moses. One executive said Bronfman had
personally vetoed this move because it would have placed Universal
in competition with Dreamworks. Dreamworks offices are at
Universal, and the two companies have close personal ties as well
as a distribution agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the difficulties for ``Babe'' was the unexpected
success of ``The Waterboy,'' the comedy starring Adam Sandler,
which has grossed nearly $123 million and is now drawing audiences
of 7- and 8-year-old boys.
</P>
<P>
   The problems for ``Babe'' deepened when its Los Angeles premiere
two weeks ago was abruptly canceled because Miller was still
working on the film. Television and newspaper accounts said that
the film's mood was too dark for children and that Universal was
worried about it. Universal executives said they believed that the
bad publicity built up a negative impression about the film.

 ISRAELI TRIP FROM TEXAS' BUSH IN LIMELIGHT
 By LARRY KAPLOW
 c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ It only took a few hours Sunday for Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's visit to Israel to be engulfed in presidential
speculation, despite his attempts to duck the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrived late in the afternoon for the three-day visit,
accompanied by fellow Republican governors from Utah, Massachusetts
and Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli reporters zeroed in on Bush during a brief photo session
with Israeli President Ezer Weizman. They pressed ahead despite
warnings from the Republican-oriented National Jewish Coalition,
which organized the trip, that media coverage was unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   When they asked if Bush had come to promote his presidential
bid, he replied that he has not decided whether to run.
</P>
<P>
   He was also asked if he was here to cozy up to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, widely seen as partial to the
Republicans, at a time when President Clinton faces an impeachment
vote in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush answered that he was not going to talk about U.S. politics.
For that matter, Bush made it clear, he was not going to discuss
Middle Eastern politics, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``My purpose here is to learn. I do not have any political
purposes,'' Bush said. ``Israel is a great friend of the United
States. I'm here to learn more not only about Israel but about the
history of my own religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife, Laura, had come from Italy where they had
visited their daughter. Before that, they were in Cairo for what
the organizers described as a vacation but that nevertheless
included a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the organizers declined to release Bush's itinerary.
They claimed, alternately, that the travel schedule could not be
made public for security reasons and that the governors needed
private time to form their views before being accosted by the
press.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Israeli officials showed no qualms over
publicizing the Bush's visit. The foreign ministry released a
detailed itinerary. Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert's office e-mailed a
notice of a reception for the visitors which noted that, ``some of
the governors are expected to run for the American presidency in
the next elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's trip was reported in three Israeli papers Sunday morning.
Each of them focused on his undeclared status as the presumed front
runner for the Republican nomination for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is known,'' wrote the Maariv daily, ``that the Israeli
government is very interested in the success of the visit and in
building up the ties with Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli right wing, which currently holds power, viewed
Bush's father, George Bush, with suspicion on the grounds that he
held a pro-Arab bias against the Jewish State while serving as
president between 1989 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the thorny issues centered upon the approximately
150 Jewish settlements Israel has built in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip. The lands were captured in 1967 by Israel and are
widely considered occupied territory by other states.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration withheld loan guarantees from Israel
after it found that Israel was using the loans to finance
settlement construction.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush's trip could also face a snag over settlements:
His itinerary includes a helicopter stop at two of them. But it's
likely that the settlement visits will merely serve as observation
points for the West Bank landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want the Israelis to understand that this is a move
that legitimizes the settlements,'' said Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat when told about the visits. ``Mr. Bush is not a private
person.''
</P>
<P>
   As organizers of the trip would not comment on the visits,
Erekat was not aware at the time of his comments that the
settlements might just be used to view the geography.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to respond has he was leaving Weizman's office, Bush shook
his head, pointed at reporters and told them they could ask him
questions at a press conference scheduled for Wednesday _ back in
Austin.

   BIG WINNER
</P>
<P>
   Just when he thought things couldn't get any better, JOHN LEE
HOOKER will now receive the 1999 Rhythm-and-Blues Foundation
Lifetime Achievement Award. The award comes on the heels of what
has been a stellar year for Hooker, the legendary bluesman. He
celebrated his 50th anniversary as a recording artist, released a
new CD, was honored by the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame, won two
Grammy Awards, had a collector's edition guitar issued in his honor
and _ as if that weren't enough _ witnessed the christening of John
Lee Hooker Lane, which runs in front of the Delta Blues Museum in
his hometown, Clarksdale, Miss. Not bad for the 81-year-old
musician who said he started out with nothing but the shirt on his
back. The award will be presented on Feb. 25 in Los Angeles.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's an all-star tribute to the singer and actor Paul
Robeson with Harry Belafonte and Paul Robeson Jr. in charge. ``Ol'
Man River: A Centennial Salute to Paul Robeson,'' Monday night at
Carnegie Hall, looks at the life of Robeson, the son of an escaped
slave who became one of the country's definitive performers. F.
Murray Abraham, Danny Glover, Whoopi Goldberg and Paul Newman are
among those who will portray scenes from Robeson's life. Also
scheduled to participate are Muhammad Ali and Pete Seeger. Tickets
range from $20 to $500. Information: (212) 302-8477.

   SIMPLE TRUTHS
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ CHARLES KURALT, who died last year at 62, traveled
more than 1 million miles through the back roads of America for his
CBS series ``On the Road.'' He searched for stories that cast light
on ordinary lives. Tuesday at 6 p.m., a few of his colleagues, as
well as those who, like Calvin Trillin, were influenced by his
gentle observations, will meet at the Museum of Television and
Radio to discuss his legacy. Information: (212) 621-6600 or (212)
307-7171.

<P>
   COMING HOME
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He's an American living in Germany, and to his
adoptive country William Forsythe may as well be Balanchine. That's
the consensus among balletomanes who watched the choreographer
transform Ballet Frankfurt from a regional company into an
international contender after he took the helm in 1984. On
Wednesday, Forsythe, a native New Yorker, will return home with his
troupe after nearly a decade abroad for the U.S. premiere of his
``Eidos: Telos'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Set to music by
the Dutch composer Thom Willems, the monumental work weaves the
tale of the spider woman Arachne, who flouted time by spinning a
web. Not content to stick to the work's dance aspects, Forsythe
composed the text, along with the Italian writer Roberto Calasso.
``Eidos: Telos'' was created in honor of Stravinsky. Information:
(718) 636-4100.

`THE GLINT': RIVALS IN A STORYBOOK WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first thing one noticed about ``The Glint'' on
Saturday night at the Kitchen was Nicole Eisenman's set. Figurines
of tiny animals and people were crowded onto small platforms.
Little racing cars were spaced along a strip of cloth that
resembled a highway. Five plates on the floor held slices of bread.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eisenman created a toylike world. And Jennifer Monson's
choreography often conveyed the spirit of adventure that can be
found in children's storybooks. The action contrasted two women
(Chrysa Parkinson and Ms. Monson) with a quintet (Miguel Gutierrez,
Sarah Michelson, Joanne Nerenberg, Jennifer Allen and Robert
Bingham). All moved to a score by Guy Yarden that combined
electronic sounds with live violin music, played by the composer.
</P>
<P>
   The two women sometimes seemed friends and at other times
rivals. Their alternations between cooperation and competition
occasionally became monotonous. Yet, fortunately, there were many
striking moments, as when the women rolled stormily across the
floor while Yarden produced a cyclone of musical sounds. The
dancers in the quintet formed an imposing human wall marching back
and forth. They also bent down and placed the slices of bread in
their mouths. Their movements looked so obsessive throughout the
70-minute piece that one could never be sure if this wall of bodies
was protective or threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of ``The Glint,'' Yarden fiddled energetically. But
all the dancers stood motionless yet alert. Then came a few
hesitant gestures. Although the work ended there, the choreography
implied that a new adventure was ready to begin.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ann Jackson remembers particularly vividly one meeting when she
was trying to get In Style magazine off the ground for Time Inc. in
the early 1990s. Ms. Jackson, now the publisher of the In Style
Group of magazines, showed sample spreads of posing starlets to a
group of Time Inc. senior editors, including the company's chief
executive, Don Logan. After a ponderous silence, one of the men in
the room _ and they were all men _ grumbled a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to know why the pictures were so big, why they
showed everything from head to toe,'' Ms. Jackson explained. ``I
looked out at this phalanx of men and I said, `Why? Because we want
to see the shoes! The shoes are key!' And the whole room looked at
me like I was from Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an encounter, she said, that underscored what might be a
fundamental difference between men and women. But Ms. Jackson and
her colleagues prevailed and the gamble _ to create a magazine so
slavish and so devoted in its adoration of celebrity culture that
it makes People magazine look positively dour by comparison _ has
paid off handsomely. With all the gravity of a helium-filled
balloon, it has moved the Time Warner unit into what may prove to
be a hot competition for a share of the women's magazine market, a
field dominated by Conde Nast (Vogue, Glamour and Mademoiselle) and
Hearst Magazines (Harper's Bazaar, Marie Claire and Cosmopolitan).
</P>
<P>
   In Style is a monthly bible of celebrity, a frothy, adoring
homage to movie and sitcom stars, pop singers and talk show hosts.
The magazine's secret weapon: It covers fashion, home furnishings
and beauty from the vantage point of the celebrity. If a famous
person _ or even semifamous _ wears it, eats it, sleeps on it or
scratches her back with it, then it's fodder for In Style.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, In Style is Time Inc.'s brightest foray to date
into the women's market. Time Inc. shelved one attempt, Makeover,
after several test issues in the early 1990s, and plans for a
soap-opera magazine were scrapped then. But in 1999, Sports
Illustrated for Women will try to make its mark with four issues,
and Time Inc.'s development editors are weighing the benefits of a
magazine aimed at women in their 40s and 50s, a market already
addressed by More magazine, from Meredith Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Will Time Inc. _ the publisher of such stately tomes as Time and
Fortune _ make its mark in the women's field? Will the next Vogue
magazine come out of the same building that publishes Life, Money
and Sports Illustrated?
</P>
<P>
   It seems only natural, said Ann Moore, president of the People
division at Time Inc., a group that includes People, People en
Espanol, Teen People, In Style and In Style's new German edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did People come from? It was the best-read section in
Time. What's the best-loved section of People? Star Tracks,'' Ms.
Moore said, referring to the celebrity lifestyle column in People
that generated In Style four years ago. ``It tells you where famous
people are going and what they're wearing. We all loved
celebrities, real-life celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Miller, executive vice president of marketing for the
Magazine Publishers of America, said that before In Style, the
prevailing wisdom in the industry was that the women's market was
saturated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When In Style began, everyone said that `People already covers
the celebrity aspect of what you're going to cover and fashion
books already cover the fashion,' but Martha Nelson smartly found a
niche within that celebrity journalism, and within the women's
market,'' she said, referring to In Style's editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just who's dating who, but who's living how,'' she
said. ``It proved there was room to grow, once you find your
niche.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the first issue in June 1994, In Style has filled its
pages with broadly grinning starlets, in designer dresses, at
elegantly catered parties, in artfully decorated homes, eating in
their favorite restaurants, wearing their favorite jewelry, sunning
in idyllic vacation spots, stumping for their favorite charities.
Most of the captions that identify the merchandise also provide
toll-free numbers, so the reader can call the retailer directly and
buy the satin dress or rhinestone barrettes or four-poster bed
favored by Salma, Jada or Cindy. (That's Salma Hayek, Jada Pinkett
Smith and Cindy Crawford, if you happen not to be a reader.)
</P>
<P>
   Even Ms. Moore says the truth without shame: ``Look, we think of
it as a catalog.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of celebrity lore, fashion and beauty news, and
personal shopping companion has proved to be a hefty hit with
readers and with advertisers. In Style's ad revenue has quintupled
in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's first full year, 1995, brought in $12.6 million
in ad revenue, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. This
year that number has climbed to $69.2 million _ and that's only
through September.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising strength can be attributed to the desirable
demographics of the readership. The average household income of an
In Style reader is $64,214, according to Mediamark Research Inc.,
which studies the magazine industry. One-quarter of the readership
has a household income of more than $100,000. Almost three-quarters
are college-educated.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the magazine's newsstand sales _ perhaps the
best measure of plain old-fashioned enthusiasm for a magazine _ are
robust, the best of any consumer magazine priced higher than $3 an
issue. (In Style is price-testing the magazine around the country,
but most issues sell for $3.50.)
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of 1998, In Style outpaced Vogue at the
newsstand by almost 200,000 copies: In Style's average newsstand
circulation for the first half of 1998 was 735,784, while Vogue's
was 545,311 and Vanity Fair's was 406,902. (Vogue's overall
circulation for the same period was 1,125,585; Vanity Fair's was
1,118,895.)
</P>
<P>
   One secret of the magazine's appeal, Ms. Nelson says, is its
avoidance of anything that even hints at imperfection. Having done
stints at People and its Australian cousin, Who Weekly, Ms. Nelson
had never been a fan of women's magazines, saying they offer too
much in the way of self-help.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, women's magazines create a feeling of anxiety
without intending to,'' Ms. Nelson said. ``When you're reading the
traditional women's magazines, they're loaded with this
prescriptive advice, all of which is utterly well intentioned by
the editors, but the feeling at the end is: `I'm not doing anything
right; I'm inadequate; I don't have a good-enough sex life; I'm not
feeding the kids right.' I made a conscious decision not to include
that sort of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nelson said she relied on ``beauty and pleasure'' as her
guiding editorial principles. ``Women deserve a treat,'' she said.
She also relies on the fact that readers feel a more intimate bond
with movie stars than with fashion models.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put 20 models in a row, and 20 movie stars in a row,
your reader will more closely identify with the movie star,'' she
said. ``They have more variety, and they exude more personality.
Readers think they know their personalities. If I say Ally McBeal,
you think: `I know her; I know what she's about; I know what her
life might be like.' You can't say the same thing about Kate
Moss.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nelson added that consumers have wearied of reading fashion
magazines that seem to have remained unchanged for the last three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeannette Chang, publisher of what could be considered a
rival, Harper's Bazaar, said: ``When you think that we've been in
business for 131 years, you might think that Liz Tilberis
recognizes change,'' she said of the magazine's editor. ``We have
changed fashion and beauty coverage over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, In Style provides one-stop shopping for public
relations agents and is a favorite of the Hollywood press agencies.
Larry Winokur, a partner in the Los Angeles public relations firm
of Baker Winokur Ryder, said the magazine was more appealing to
public relations agents than any other because clients are
guaranteed soft, noncontroversial coverage, and because In Style _
in its mix of fashion, celebrity, home furnishing and beauty _
allows public relations agents to publicize a variety of products.
</P>
<P>
   Winokur said he was planning to have several of his clients
covered in one spot, all at one time.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, we're opening the Atlantis Resort,'' Winokur
said, referring to a Caribbean resort that he represents. ``And
we're throwing a $5-million-plus party on Dec. 12 and 13. We
represent the resort, and we're sending many celebrities down. We
may grant an exclusive to In Style to cover some aspects of the
party. So now we have a great, guaranteed party story. We get pages
on the resort in the magazine. And we have the potential to bring
our clients forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few magazines _ actually no magazines, come to think
of it,'' he said, ``that would allow you to promote your resort,
your celebrities and your party, all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nelson said she had not guaranteed Winokur coverage. ``I'm
sure that it's on a roster,'' she said. ``And if it turns out to be
a story of interest to our readers, then we'll run it.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Pearlstine, editor in chief of Time Inc., said he was not
bothered by the magazine's bubbly tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great success, and that's what matters,'' he said. ``It
works for a combination of reasons. There's a service component
that Martha and her colleagues take pretty seriously. There's a
fascination with celebrity and celebrity lifestyle. And the
demographics of who's reading it are very good: working women with
reasonably good incomes and by presumption reasonably good jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearlstine also credited some of the magazine's success to its
quality of accessible escapism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've often thought that was what made Martha Stewart a
success, too,'' he said. ``I don't think everyone wants to make the
85-step dessert, but there's certainly a curiosity about it. In
terms of In Style, everybody wants to wear Versace's party dress,
and there's a kind of wonderful escapism in observing women you
might identify with at some level in Versace's party dress.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if In Style is known for being utterly lightweight,
that does not bother Ms. Moore. For instance, a recent sketch on
``Saturday Night Live'' spoofed the magazine. The announcer of the
fictional ``VH1 Spirituality Awards'' said the awards were
sponsored by In Style magazine. ``In Style,'' the voice announced,
with the glib intonation of a game show host, ``because People
sometimes has stories about cancer patients _ and you don't need
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's terrific,'' Ms. Moore said when she heard about the
sketch. ``That tells me that we've arrived.''

<P>
   RUSSIA-FARM-FIASCO (Savino, Russia) _ As winter begins to grip
the heartland, Russia's grain harvest is at its lowest point in 45
years. Milk and meat production has continued to plummet. Russia
remains heavily dependent on imports of food _ so dependent that
the Kremlin has put aside its pride and sought almost 5 million
tons of food aid from the United States and Europe. It is a bitter
legacy for a nation where ties to the land seem almost primordial
and where 100 million citizens tend their own modest plots to grow
fruit and vegetables. By Michael R. Gordon. (With a graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-CHINA-ASSESS (Tokyo) _ Just last month, Japan had seemed
to be making major progress in laying World War II to rest,
forthrightly apologizing to South Koreans for its behavior and
receiving something of an absolution from the visiting Korean
president. Then Chinese President Jiang Zemin arrived on the first
visit ever by a Chinese head of state. By Nicholas D. Kristof.

Medicare to allow tens of thousands of people with disabilities to
retain their health benefits when they return to work,
administration officials say. By Robert Pear. (With a graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-IMPEACH (Washington) _ A divide is growing among
lawmakers who feel President Clinton must state clearly that he
lied in the Monica Lewinsky affair before the House Judiciary
Committee can consider alternatives to impeachment, and those who
favor the lesser action of censuring the president.

   WOODHEAT-DECLINE (Berlin, Vt.) _ National and regional

started to be tracked 20 years ago, out-run by other cheap fuels
and increasingly abandoned by older, busier householders who just
do not want to cut, chop, split, stack, carry in, load and sweep up
anymore. By Carey Goldberg. (With photo and graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   DEER-URBAN-WAR (Minneapolis) _ For more than a decade, as
populations of white-tailed deer have exploded on the fringes of
many eastern and midwestern cities, overrun suburbs have tried all
kinds of ways to reduce the attendant threats of deer-car
collisions, Lyme disease (which is carried by deer ticks) and

A PRIVATE WORLD TO WARD OFF THE NAZI HORROR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Royal Academy of Arts can hardly claim to have
discovered a new artist with its current show, ``Life? or Theater?
The Work of Charlotte Salomon.'' Salomon's paintings were first
exhibited in Amsterdam in 1961, and they have since traveled to
Germany, France, Japan, Israel and the United States. The Jewish
Historical Museum in Amsterdam, which owns all her surviving works,
has 60 of her paintings on permanent display.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the Berlin-born Jewish artist is not better known, it may
be because the tragic nature of her death (she was 26 when she was
deported from France and murdered at Auschwitz) had the effect of
turning her work into what Norman Rosenthal, exhibitions secretary
at the Royal Academy, calls ``special circumstance'' art: it was
thought significant in the context of the Holocaust, but not for
its own sake.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Academy's show, which runs through Jan. 17, has now
set out to change this perception, hoping to re-discover her work
for a larger public. ``I see it as part of the story of art, rather
than outsider art,'' said Rosenthal, himself of German-Jewish
descent. ``I see it as a work of high art, of great culture and
great sophistication and complexity and skill. It's an act of great
artistic will at the highest level.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of Salomon's life's work is the vast
autobiographical series that she entitled ``Life? or Theater?'' and
described as a ``dreifarben singspiel,'' or a three-colored play
with music. From an original 1,300 gouaches, all on identically
sized paper of 10 inches by 13 inches, she selected 780
illustrations, most accompanied by texts, to form ``a great opera
of the mind and eye,'' as Rosenthal put it. Some 400 of these are
on display at the Royal Academy.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why, at first sight, the work could be termed
Holocaust art: the Nazis' rise to power in 1933 convulsed Salomon's
life, and the German occupation of France led to her death a decade
later. Perhaps inevitably, ``Life? or Theater?'' has also been
compared with the diary of Anne Frank, who recorded her thoughts
and feelings while hiding in an attic in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Salomon evidently saw herself as more than a witness to the
Nazi nightmare. Indeed, it is as if she felt she could dispel this
nightmare through her painting and texts, which include titles of
music like Schubert's ``Death and the Maiden'' that should
accompany the work. She does not ignore the escalating Nazi
horrors, but her art becomes the key to her sanity. She controls
her life by turning it into a theatrical work of art, even to the
point of presenting a cast of characters: relatives, friends and
acquaintances who are given different names in her drama.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon herself becomes Charlotte Kann and is referred to in the
third person, which enables her to be both frank and ironic about
her feelings. In the epilogue, when the narrative has caught up
with her daily process of creation, she explains with disarming
simplicity why her alter ego embarked on the project: ``And she
found herself facing the question of whether to commit suicide or
to undertake something wildly eccentric.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable maturity of ``Life? or Theater?,'' not only its
visual complexity but also its frequent references to music,
philosophy and psychology, reflects Salomon's upbringing in an
educated and assimilated middle-class Berlin family. Her mother
died when she was 8, but five years later her physician father,
Albert Salomon, married a singer, Paula Lindberg, who soon became
both surrogate mother and close friend to young Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, after Hitler seized power, Dr. Salomon lost his right
to practice as a doctor, while Paula was forbidden from performing
in public, although both were able to work among Jews. Their home
became a gathering point for Jewish intellectuals, including Alfred
Wolfsohn, Paula's music teacher, who was said to be Charlotte's
first lover. Charlotte, meanwhile, was the only Jewish student at a
local art college.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 9, 1938, Kristallnacht, when Nazi mobs attacked
synagogues and Jewish properties across Germany, Dr. Salomon was
briefly detained. After his release, he sent Charlotte to join her
maternal grandparents in the south of France, where they were
living in a cottage on the estate of a wealthy American woman,
Otillie Moore. Dr. Salomon imagined he was saving Charlotte's life;
in fact he and Paula fled Germany soon afterward and survived the
war in hiding in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   In Villefranche-sur-Mer, Moore encouraged Charlotte to paint and
bought some of her portraits and still-life oils (which have all
disappeared). But the young artist was troubled. When her
grandmother killed herself in May 1940, Charlotte learned for the
first time that not only her mother but also her aunt and numerous
other family members had committed suicide. Struggling to make
sense of the emotional and political turmoil surrounding her, she
embarked on ``Life? or Theater?'' some time in 1941, again
encouraged by Moore, to whom it is dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she finished it, Moore had left for the United
States, while Moore's former lover, Alexander Nagler, had become
Salomon's lover. She gave the collection of gouaches to a French
doctor for safekeeping with the words, ``Take good care of it, it
is my whole life.'' In September 1943, soon after their marriage,
Salomon and Nagler were arrested by the Gestapo and within weeks
were sent to Auschwitz, where both died. After the war, ``Life? or
Theater'' was recovered by Salomon's father and stepmother.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Seen in isolation, many of the paintings stand out as
interesting works, some strongly evocative of Chagall. Using just
red, blue and yellow, Salomon captures the changing mood of the
narrative by darkening and lightening her colors. Sometimes her
technique is that of a cartoonist, presenting for instance a dozen
or more images of the same face as it changes expression to conform
to the narrative. Other times, the images set the pace, almost like
a storyboard for a movie.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional tone of the gouaches also swings as she goes from
recounting her mother's suicide to dwelling on her fascination with
Wolfsohn, or rather Amadeus Daberlohn as he is called in the
``singspiel.'' Approaching the end, her urgency is such that she
abandons images for full pages of multicolored text.
</P>
<P>
   Yet her final sentences suggest she had finally emerged from her
own dark tunnel: ``And with dream-awakened eyes, she saw all the
beauty around her, saw the sea, felt the sun and knew: she had to
vanish for a while from the human plane and make every sacrifice in
order to create her world anew out of the depths. And from this
came: Life or Theater?''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal, who organized the show along with Monica Bohm-Duchen,
said that Salomon's collection was ``clearly intended as a
`Gesamtkunstwerk,' a `total work of art' in the tradition of the
ambitious fusion of music, poetry and the visual arts that had been
created in Germany in the 19th century.'' And yet, he added, it
also seems vividly contemporary. ``I can't quite believe it,'' he
went on. ``When I was putting it up, I thought, if someone had made
it 10 years ago or 5 years ago as an act of imagination, I would
more readily believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, having given Charlotte Salomon a place at the Royal Academy
beside a show of Picasso's pottery and ceramics, Rosenthal is
hopeful that ``Life? or Theater?'' can shake off its tag of
``special circumstance'' art. ``The Jewish Museum in New York wants
to do the show,'' he said, ``but I'd much rather it were shown at
the Guggenheim or the Met or the MOMA because I don't think it
needs to be ghettoized in the Jewish Museum. I think it is bad for
it myself, though it's not up to me, of course.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Windswept rain will lash the Oregon to central California coast
early Monday as a potent Pacific front arrives. Wind gusts over 50
miles an hour will be common near the coast and in the mountains
especially during the morning and midday over northern and central
California. Snow will fall in the mountains at elevations over 5000
feet in the morning. Snow levels will lower to 3,000 feet in the
afternoon as the cold front sweeps inland. Periods of rain will
persist throughout the day, but the precipitation will become
intermittent in the afternoon. The rain will spread into southern
California late Monday. Farther north, patchy rain and mountain
snow will prevail from northern Oregon and Washington to western
Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the eastern Rockies and Plains will not be as mild as
recent days, but temperatures will remain above the seasonal
average. Clouds will linger early Monday in the eastern Plains.
Otherwise, ample sunshine will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front surrounded by showers will move across the central
Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. In the wake of the front, cooler and
drier air will spread into the northern Mississippi valley.
</P>
<P>
   Near record warmth will cover parts of the interior Northeast
and Middle Atlantic States. Balmy breezes from the southwest will
average 10 to 20 miles an hour. Morning clouds near the southern
New England coast will erode as milder air arrives. Clouds and some
patchy rain and sleet will plague northernmost New England where
the warm air rises over cool air across the region.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Slow to Snow
</P>
<P>
   In western New York, where fierce snow squalls are common in
November, there has been a slow start to the snowy season. Buffalo
will be in the balmy 60s on Monday, insuring its least snowy
November in 114 years of records with 0.2 inches. Early snow in
Buffalo is enhanced when cold air sweeps from Canada gathering
moisture as it crosses the Great Lakes. This autumn, Canada has
been mild, eliminating the spark that ignites squalls. History
suggests the dearth of snow in Buffalo will continue. Of the 12
seasons with less than an inch of snow through November, only one
had above normal snowfall.

REPORT ON E-COMMERCE INSISTS ON SELF-REGULATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To many Americans, the name Ira Magaziner is
synonymous with the ill-fated Clinton health care plan. But the
presidential adviser's more lasting legacy may prove to be the
administration's laissez-faire policy on Internet commerce: no
taxes, no government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   As Magaziner prepares to take leave of the White House,
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore are scheduled to
release with great fanfare on Monday a long-awaited report by
Magaziner's interagency working group in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The report _ the foundation of the administration's new Internet
commerce policy _ argues for stronger consumer protection and
privacy rights, but like Magaziner's 1997 ``Framework for
Electronic Commerce,'' it clings to the insistence that these be
achieved through self-regulation by industries rather than dictated
by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-regulation in the digital age will require the private
sector to engage in much greater collective action to set and
enforce rules than was characteristic of the Industrial Age,'' the
report states.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees with that theme, particularly as it relates
to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   One of Magaziner's most vocal critics, Marc Rotenberg of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, is among those who say that
``self-regulation has been a lot of smoke and mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg insists that laws are needed to protect consumer
interests and personal data in the young and often free-for-all
atmosphere of cyberspace. Without such laws, he warns, the United
States will open itself to a trade war with Europe, where
self-regulation has been declared incompatible with laws
guaranteeing strong privacy protections for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The European law, which took effect in October, prohibits any
company that does business in the European Union from transmitting
personal data to any nation that does not guarantee comparable
privacy protections.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner concedes, ``If self-regulation is not working at the
end of the year, then I would advocate that government do more.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he adds: ``I would point out that just
passing laws is still not protecting privacy. You still have to put
in place an enforcement mechanism and demonstrate that you can
enforce the law. So I think it might be fairer for critics to say
that no country has found a way to do this adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Farber, a professor of computer science at the University
of Pennsylvania and a board member of the Internet civil liberties
group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says the fact that the
United States has won a reprieve from the European Union while both
sides search for mutually acceptable privacy protections is a
credit to Magaziner.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the differences over privacy ``a real nightmare,''
Farber said: ``I think what he has done has kept us from falling
off an edge of a cliff. October came and we are still doing
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond consumer issues, the report tries to head off moves by
the Federal Communications Commission to regulate high-speed
Internet access in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rumblings about the FCC wanting to regulate advanced
services,'' Magaziner said. ``We want to make it clear that we
think this would be a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also calls for a series of programs intended to
spread the Internet to developing countries quickly, using
low-orbit satellite links in areas that lack telephone service; to
help small businesses use the Internet, and to update the
government's statistical and economic models to help better measure
the economic impact of information technology industries.
</P>
<P>
   A final report on the administration's _ and Magaziner's _
headway on cyberspace issues, the document details treaties signed
and laws passed in the last 18 months to keep the Internet tax free
and unregulated and to encourage electronic commerce with new
digital copyright and security protections.
</P>
<P>
   Those successes, said Harris Miller, president of the
Information Technology Association of America, a trade
organization, show that Magaziner proved to be ``a pivotal leader
at a pivotal time.''
</P>
<P>
   His most important contribution, Miller said, was ``the idea
that the Internet and electronic commerce are not going to be like
traditional industries in the sense that they need to be heavily
regulated from birth.''
</P>
<P>
   While even an outspoken critic like Rotenberg gives Magaziner
``a lot of credit for his energy, his smarts, and his ability to
create a coherent vision for the administration,'' he added, ``At
the end of the day, it can be fairly asked whether the
administration's policy was based on self-regulation or on
promoting business interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is that such criticism is the antithesis of
widespread criticism of the plan for a heavily regulated national
health care system that Magaziner and Hillary Rodham Clinton
proposed during the president's first term.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Internet policy is seen as laissez-faire, the health
care plan was criticized as government meddling. And shaping
Internet policy has been a comparatively low-key effort, consensus
driven and largely devoid of the partisan politics that Magaziner
largely blames for the health care plan's demise.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was also an effort that began almost accidentally, without
any preconceived political notions or agendas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, when health care failed, I actually offered to
resign,'' Magaziner said in an interview over the weekend. ``The
president said no. He suggested that I do something in a different
area _ not in health care because Hillary and I had both become
radioactive on that subject.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1995, Magaziner recalled, he and the late commerce
secretary, Ron Brown, and Mickey Kantor began holding hearings
around the country to develop an economic development strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really was almost no electronic commerce on the Internet
then,'' Magaziner said. ``But it became very clear to me that if we
set the right environment, the Internet and electronic commerce
were going to explode.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``When I presented that, to be honest, I think a
number of people didn't understand. But the president did.''
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner then set out to formulate a new policy for the
administration and to sell those goals domestically and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, there was suspicion of the United States and the
fact that the Internet started here and that somehow we were trying
to use this whole policy to further the American agenda around the
world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he said, the ``principles we began espousing spread
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   On an issue even more contentious than electronic commerce,
Magaziner recently wrapped up an agreement for turning over
administration of the Internet's addressing system, which has
historically been managed by government contractors, to a private,
nonprofit corporation _ a big step in Internet self- governance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Magaziner says he feels his role is played out. ``We
accomplished more than the goals we set out for,'' he said. ``I
think it is a good time to return to private life.''
</P>
<P>
   After wrapping up his White House duties in the next few days,
he will join his wife and three children in Rhode Island and decide
what the future holds for him professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he did a very good job,'' said Farber of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation. ``He was very visible to the
Internet community. He tried very hard to get into the culture. He
got online. He traveled. He felt he had to meet these people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Farber said: ``He probably decided the whole
Internet community is wacko. And it probably is.''

`THE NUTCRACKER': NOT ALL CANDY-CANE SWEET, A RITUAL AT MIDDLE
AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a changing world, it is reassuring to report that
the majestic Christmas tree rose as expected on the stage of the
New York State Theater on Friday night. The children at the
Stahlbaum family's holiday party had near-exemplary manners and
dancers small and grown filled the stage with the kind of delicate
color that has brought generations of families back to ``The
Nutcracker'' year after year. Yes, it is ``Nutcracker'' time again.
The New York City Ballet will present George Balanchine's magical
production through Jan. 3 at the New York State Theater. And if
this year's opening performance was not quite magical, it got the
``Nutcracker'' season off to a good enough start.
</P>
<P>
   As City Ballet celebrates its 50th year, all performances of
``The Nutcracker'' are dedicated to Maria Tallchief, for whom
Balanchine created the role of the Sugarplum Fairy in 1954. It is
Ms. Tallchief whom ballerinas today must blame for the understated
but difficult choreography for the Sugarplum Fairy and the
split-second timing and off-kilter partnering of the climactic
second-act grand pas de deux. Her daring and control, her dazzling
technical skill and her cool passion are all embodied by the
Sugarplum Fairy.
</P>
<P>
   Kyra Nichols, Friday's Sugarplum Fairy, brought her own delicacy
and slightly distant warmth to the role, particularly in the first
moments of her entrance solo, recalling that one of Balanchine's
missions was to make music visible. Ms. Nichols' feet, acutely
nibbling up the stage at first, moved into gliding bourrees that
suddenly seemed an object lesson for the gliding baby angels who
proceeded her, demonstrating what they too might one day achieve as
grown-up dancers. Lyrical and fluid, Ms. Nichols brought nuance to
the pas de deux that balanced the sometimes too-reckless dancing of
Damian Woetzel, her Cavalier. They began the duet like the pros
they are, catching the musical and dance climaxes without overdoing
them. Ms. Nichols continued to do so, especially in a chain of fast
pique turns that were a model of ebullient restraint. But from his
solo on, Woetzel often looked like a refugee from ``Le Corsaire''
rather than an inhabitant of the gentle ``Nutcracker'' Land of
Sweets.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Whelan's Dewdrop paused in flight in several beautifully
shaped arabesques, but her generally well-danced performance was
diminished by the brittleness of her attack. One's eye kept
straying to the richness and glamorous warmth of Jenifer Ringer's
dancing in the much less demanding second lead roles performed with
Pascale van Kipnis in this divertissement. Monique Meunier was much
too energetic a Coffee. Benjamin Millepied turned in a refreshingly
dry and witty performance as Tea, and Tom Gold brought an
interestingly burnished quality to the hoop tricks as the lead
Candy Cane. The Marzipan Shepherdesses, led by Samantha Allen,
looked as if they had overdosed on adrenaline, however, and Jason
Fowler was a bland Mother Ginger.
</P>
<P>
   Robert La Fosse continues to explore and deepen his
characterization of Herr Drosselmeier, the mysterious honorary
uncle whose gift of a nutcracker is central to the E.T.A. Hoffmann
story. This Drosselmeier was a spidery, giddy old gent who was
almost as excitable as the children. His billowing, white, wispy
hair was the scariest image in the nightmare scene. Jan Burkhard
and Zali Grinberg, who played little Marie and the little
Nutcracker Prince, were models of elegant deportment. Zakary
Yermolenko was almost too believably naughty, though adorable, as
Marie's brother, Fritz. The children, students at the School of
American Ballet rehearsed by Garielle Whittle, were all first rate,
standing out in the Polichinelles section that is Balanchine's
loveliest gift to child dancers. The cast also included Robert Lyon
as the rambunctious Mouse King and Robert Wersinger, appropriately
starchy in a first performance of the Soldier solo. Hugo Fiorato
conducted the Tchaikovsky score.

   Merger Talks Add to Workers' Anxiety
</P>
<P>
   They have been downsized, cut back and re-engineered. So when
the 900 remaining blue-collar workers at Mobil's largest domestic
refinery in Beaumont, Texas, heard that their company was in merger
talks with Exxon, it was like an alarm warning them that an already
suspect valve might be about to blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a terrible thing,'' said Dick Mabry, a refinery
operator, as he emerged from the main gate after his 12-hour shift.
``It's a revival of the Standard Oil Co. It's going to put 20 or
30,000 people out of work. I think the Justice Department should
step in and stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank Incentives Expected
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank is expected to provide multimillion-dollar
incentives to a handful of top Bankers Trust and Deutsche
executives to secure their services once the German banking giant
completes its $9.67 billion purchase of Bankers Trust, a deal that
is expected to be officially announced today.
</P>
<P>
   Sales Season Starts Optimistically
</P>
<P>
   While unexpectedly warm weather brought hordes of shoppers to
malls over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, department store
executives expressed just cautious optimism about sales for the
Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   Separation Valued Over Synergy
</P>
<P>
   If America Online followed all the advice it was getting for how
to take advantage of its recent deal for Netscape Communications,
it would merge its AOL.com Web site with Netscape's Netcenter site
and would use Netscape's browser on its online service. But America
Online puts separation above synergy and would rather own multiple,
if somewhat competitive, offerings rather than creating one master
brand.

   Putting a Human Face on Cartoons
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation is pushing into new territory on the wings of
an unlikely fleet of animated airplanes in ``Jay Jay the Jet
Airplane,'' a series for preschoolers. The creators of the series
use sensors to detect the facial expressions of as many as seven
actors and feed them into computers, giving expressive vitality to
animated characters.

VOTE COUNT SHOWS SIZE OF HINDU NATIONALISTS' LOSS IN INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ As vote tallies piled up here Sunday in a
series of important state elections, the humiliating defeat of the
Hindu nationalists and the stunning resurrection of India's
once-dominant political force, the Congress Party, became ever more
starkly apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Voters outraged by the spiraling prices of onions, tomatoes and
potatoes _ essentials of the Indian diet _ swept the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party from office by landslide margins
where it had been deeply entrenched. The party lost in Delhi, the
district that includes the nation's capital, and in the Hindi
heartland state of Rajasthan.
</P>
<P>
   Even more surprising in a year marked by an anti-incumbent mood
among voters, the Congress Party managed to hold on firmly to power
in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, the country's
largest. Political analysts said it was likely that voters there
blamed the national government, led by the Hindu nationalists, for
price increases, not the state government.
</P>
<P>
   Two regional parties beat out Congress in the small northeastern
state of Mizoram, the other state where elections were held, but
its results were not considered important to national politics.
</P>
<P>
   While the Hindu nationalists alienated leaders all over the
world in May when the government conducted secret underground
nuclear tests, polls indicated that it was rising vegetable prices
that cost them dearly with voters at home.
</P>
<P>
   The repudiation of the Hindu nationalists in the state
elections, which were held Wednesday and the votes counted over the
weekend, will further undermine the 18-party coalition government
they lead at the national level. The eight-month-old government is
already plagued by squabbles that range from the farcical to the
serious.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the Bharatiya Janata Party's partners openly
criticized it over the weekend for its failure in the state
elections, none have yet withdrawn from the coalition, which has a
narrow majority in Parliament. But one political commentator quoted
a saying by Chanakya, the Indian political sage from ancient times,
to question how long the party's allies will remain loyal: When a
tree falls, the birds won't sit on it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the arithmetic of the Hindu nationalists' hold on
national power is unchanged for now. Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee admitted Saturday that he was taken aback by the depth of
his party's loss, but he said the coalition would prove it still
has a majority when Parliament convenes for its winter session on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He has also begun owning up to his mistakes, a party-wide
process that was in full swing by Sunday. At a meeting of state
officials Friday, Vajpayee acknowledged that his government should
have moved more quickly to import onions when a shortage caused the
prices to rise and to remove all duties on them. Before the
elections, he had blamed Mother Nature and vegetable crop failures
for surging prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The BJP had an image as a cohesive, disciplined, well-led
party _ and all that fell away,'' said Pran Chopra, a political
analyst at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. ``Prices
became the crystallized image of the incompetence of the BJP
government.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jubilant Congress Party workers celebrated in the streets
Saturday night, but the party's president, Sonia Gandhi, had a more
sober reaction to victory Sunday morning. Yes, she said, the
results are a gain, but she told a television reporter that she was
still in no rush to topple the Hindu-nationalist-led coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Congress Party leaders and political analysts said her caution
was wise. Congress has even fewer votes in Parliament than the
Hindu Nationalists _ only 141 of the 272 it would need to form a
majority. It would have to join with a number of other political
parties that are unified mainly by their opposition to the
Bharatiya Janata Party and what they see as its attempt to impose a
narrow vision of Hinduism on the rich religious diversity of India.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Communists, who have governed the state of West
Bengal for two decades, are eager to join with Congress in what
they call a secular front, but the Communists and the Congress
Party have long been divided on economic issues. The Congress Party
_ like the Hindu-nationalist-led government _ favors a gradual
opening of Indian markets to foreign investment, while the
Communists favor more protectionist policies.
</P>
<P>
   Murli Deora, a Congress Party leader from Bombay who is chairman
of the finance committee in Parliament, said the Congress Party,
just like the Hindu nationalists, would find it almost impossible
to govern effectively and difficult to survive politically if it
assumed power now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Congress is not up to power just now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and others said the party should wait on the assumption that
the Hindu nationalists' coalition will fall apart, then press for
new elections that might return a strengthened Congress Party to
govern with a clearer public mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to form a majority in the present Parliament
without facing the same problems as the BJP,'' said Yogendra Yadav,
a political scientist with the Center for the Study of Developing
Societies. ``It would be foolish of the Congress to form a
government now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear just how much this election was a rejection
of the Hindu nationalists and how much a victory for Congress, the
party whose founders led India to independence in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi is the unlikely inheritor of the Congress Party
mantle. An Italian-born Roman Catholic in majority-Hindu India, she
is the surviving member of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband's grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was India's first
prime minister. Her mother-in-law, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,
died in her arms after being shot by Sikh bodyguards. And her
husband, Rajiv, was assassinated in 1991 by a Sri Lankan suicide
bomber while he was campaigning to win back the post of prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi, who lived a private life after her husband's death
until she emerged this year as an aggressive, confident campaigner,
has read her speeches in Hindi to huge throngs in recent weeks but
has granted no sit-down interviews to reporters. With her
shoulder-length flip of dark hair, she is the public face of the
Congress Party, but she has yet to expose herself to searching
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she led Congress to its biggest victory since 1985,
the year after her mother-in-law's assassination. And political
commentators here say she has asserted control over the party
hierarchy and may yet become prime minister of India in her own
right.

shared, according to a complex formula, by the mutual company's 12
million life insurance policy-holders, who are its formal owners.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematically, the average payment to each policy-holder works
out to $1,166, based on the company's latest report of its
accumulated profits or equity at the end of last year. But most
policy-holders of Met Life, as the company is often called, are
likely to receive somewhat more or less, depending upon such
factors as the size of the policy, how long it has been in effect
and the amount of the premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Some policy-holders may receive as little as a few hundred
dollars, said Robert Benmosche, Met Life's chief executive, while
payments to some of the 60,000 holders of corporate group life and
disability policies may run into the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization, which will permit the company to issue stock
for the first time, follows similar decisions by several other
mutual life insurers, including Prudential Life Insurance Co. of
America, which competes with Met Life for the title of the nation's
largest life insurer, and John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.
Only a few weeks ago, Mutual of New York completed a reorganization
and issued its first stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reorganization of Met Life and the others is emblematic of
a much larger issue which is that the life insurance industry is in
a very sorry state,'' said Eric Berg, an analyst for CIBC
Oppenheimer. ``Fewer Americans than ever are worried about dying
young. Agent productivity is declining and the number of agents is
also on the wane.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Met Life, like those of other reorganizing
insurers, say the company needs to become a publicly traded stock
corporation to raise capital for expansion in an industry that has
been steadily consolidating. As a stock company, Met Life and the
others would, of course, also be able to use their own shares as
currency in acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changing the structure gives you stock you can place in the
hands of managers and agents, giving them an incentive to work
harder,'' Berg said.
</P>
<P>
   Benmosche acknowledged that ``dramatic changes'' and
consolidation were taking place in the life insurance industry and
said he believed the reorganization would position Met Life ``to
deliver value to its policy-holders and to be competitive in the
pursuit of new growth opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor pushing Met Life to change its structure,
Benmosche said, was the expectation that Congress would eventually
eliminate Depression-era barriers that prevent insurers, banks and
brokerages from doing business in each other's fields.
</P>
<P>
   While some mutual insurers have started moving into banking by
acquiring savings and loan charters, Benmosche said he believed
that to provide full banking services _ should Met Life eventually
choose to do so if federal barriers fall _ Met Life needed to
embrace a holding company structure, which it is now doing.
</P>
<P>
   Met Life, which was founded 130 years ago, had struggled
mightily to avoid sharing its profits with policy-holders. It had
spent millions of dollars leading a campaign to lobby the New York
state Legislature to change the law that requires mutual insurers
to distribute their accumulated profits to policy-holders.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki had supported the insurers' effort to create
a hybrid company structure that would permit them to reorganize
without sharing their accumulated profits with policy-holders. But
Alexander Grannis, the New York City Democrat who is chairman of
the state Assembly's Insurance Committee, contended that
policy-holders at Met Life and other New York insurers would be
short-changed.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was defeated despite heated negotiations in the
final hours of the legislative session last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Met Life was so strongly committed to the hybrid form of company
structure that the company even considered moving its headquarters
to one of the more than 20 states that have recently pass
accommodating legislation. But the company abandoned that idea,
too, when Congress cut a part of federal financial-services
legislation that would have facilitated such a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate is over,'' Benmosche said Sunday. ``This is a
cleaner approach and it makes more sense. We are clearly going to
give all the value of the company to policy-holders from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Benmosche said Met Life had sought the hybrid structure as an
interim step toward a full restructuring that would have eventually
compensated policy-holders.
</P>
<P>
   The main issue for Met Life, he said, had been speed; under the
hybrid structure, Met Life could have reorganized in six months.
Under its current plans, he said, the company hopes to make the
transition in about 15 months or toward the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The board gave its approval last week for Benmosche to develop a
conversion plan for the changes, and he is to report back in three
or four months to get its final approval.

MOTION-CAPTURE ANIMATION A BREAKTHROUGH IN CARTOON PRODUCITON 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Computer animation is pushing into new territory on the wings of
an unlikely fleet of cartoon airplanes _ characters in a series for
preschoolers that began Nov. 2 on the Learning Channel on cable
television.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional animators who create two-dimensional characters like
those in the shows ``South Park'' and ``Rugrats'' now routinely use
computer graphics to replicate the hundreds of frames needed to
make a character move. But the creators of the new show, ``Jay Jay
the Jet Plane,'' are using an entirely different method called
real-time performance animation in which the facial expressions of
as many as seven actors are detected by sensors and fed into
computers, giving expressive vitality to animated characters.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called digital motion-capture technique has never been
used for an entire 24-minute show, according to Bruce Johnson, a
former Hanna-Barbera executive who started Porchlight Entertainment
in Los Angeles to create children's programming. ``Jay Jay'' is a
joint venture of Porchlight, Chris Walker's Modern Cartoons and the
character's creator, David Michel, a Dallas executive who hopes to
convert the airplane stories he made up for his son into a
licensing franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Digital motion-capture technology has existed for a decade, but
its use has been limited to a single virtual character for video or
CD-ROM games and for special effects in feature films, such as the
figures who dangled from ropes in ``Titanic.'' Animated films like
``Antz'' from Dreamworks SKG and ``Toy Story'' from Walt Disney get
their three-dimensional quality through the costly, time-consuming
process of adding realistic lighting and backgrounds by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Motion-capture makes animation more affordable by speeding
production and lowering costs; it also improves production values
by giving characters the humanistic qualities animators strive for,
said Joan Collins Carey, a visual-effects producer who is
assembling a documentary on computer animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direction Chris is going is leading the rest of the
industry,'' she said. ``This is very good for studios that want to
kick out content.''
</P>
<P>
   To orchestrate all the ``Jay Jay'' elements _ seven character
performers, two walk-on live-action characters, miniature sets and
seven model airplanes _ meant spending $1 million during the last
year converting a missile plant in Oxnard, Calif., into a studio.
Proprietary software that synchronizes 35 Compaq Alpha NT computers
does the job.
</P>
<P>
   Like a situation comedy, ``Jay Jay'' uses several cameras that
shift the audience's point of view. ``We're shooting 11 minutes of
production animation a day,'' said Douglas Rask, the show's
producer. ``It's a volume unheard of in animation.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern Cartoons falls short of the Holy Grail of animation: the
simulation of human motion naturally. ``Jay Jay'' characters rely
only on actors' faces; their bodies are airplanes. But Walker
thinks the show has achieved a breakthrough. ``We've industrialized
cartoon production with motion-capture,'' he said. ``I've been
working toward this for 12 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable network, owned by Discovery Communications and
distributed to 70 million homes, has licensed 26 episodes for each
of three years. The partners hope to turn a profit by selling
foreign broadcast rights and merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   It's a path well trod by characters like Barney and Teletubbies,
and ``Jay Jay'' has an advantage they lacked. Even before his first
regular series, the character was well known to the preschool set.
In the last four years, his creator, Michel, has sold 250,000 ``Jay
Jay'' videos that featured some of the same production techniques,
mostly using direct-response advertising on two children's cable
channels, Viacom's Nickelodeon and Time Warner's Cartoon Network.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Channel ``is not a destination point for
preschoolers,'' Michel said. ``They've made a big commitment in
giving us a time slot.''

PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS NOW AT ODDS OVER RELEASE OF PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A meeting between Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators on carrying out their latest accord ended in a dispute
Sunday over Israel's insistence on freeing common criminals as part
of the prisoner releases required by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Israeli-Palestinian accord reached last month with
U.S. mediation at Wye River, Md., Israel agreed to a phased release
of 750 Palestinian prisoners. But out of 250 prisoners released
this month, 150 were common criminals and other offenders,
including car thieves and laborers caught in Israel without
permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a major crisis on this issue,'' said Saeb Erakat, the
chief Palestinian negotiator, after a meeting in Jericho with Danny
Naveh, the Israeli Cabinet secretary. ``I asked the Israeli
government not to carry out any further step unless we agree on the
criteria and the names. We did not go to Wye to discuss the release
of car thieves. I have asked the Americans to intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials contend that all 750 prisoners to be freed
were supposed to have been people jailed for anti-Israeli violence
or political activity. Israeli officials say that they agreed to
release only 200 such prisoners, those ``who have no blood on their
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserted Sunday that he had
``not the slightest intention of freeing murderers or Hamas men.''
The release of prisoners has drawn criticism in Israel from the
political right, including some relatives of victims of terrorist
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is also an emotional one among Palestinians because
nearly every family has a relative in Israeli jails. The failure to
secure the release of more prisoners deemed political has set off a
hunger strike in some jails and a wave of protests by relatives of
inmates, who accuse the Palestinian leadership of selling them out.
</P>
<P>
   In East Jerusalem on Saturday, dozens of Palestinian
demonstrators were injured when Israeli riot police fired rubber
bullets to disperse a crowd that attacked them with stones.
Relatives of prisoners also demonstrated at the inauguration of the
new Palestinian airport in the Gaza Strip last Tuesday, waving
black flags.
</P>
<P>
   Hisham Abdul Razek, a Palestinian cabinet member who is
responsible for the prisoners issue, said that prisoner releases,
especially of people jailed before the Israeli-Palestinian accords,
were supposed to have been part of the process of mutual
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no logic to keeping our soldiers in jail when Israel
is sitting down to make peace with the Palestinian leadership,
which is responsible for the actions of those soldiers,'' Abdul
Razek said. ``The Israelis want to say, `We're dictating the
terms.' They're acting forcibly, not out of agreement in which
there is reciprocity and partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement over the prisoners and the disputes over
Israeli settlement expansion and the seizure of West Bank land by
Israel for bypass roads led to a walkout by one Palestinian
negotiator, Hassan Asfour, at Sunday's meeting in Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   There was more trouble between Israelis and Palestinians in the
Gaza Strip, where Palestinian police blocked trucks carrying
building supplies from reaching the Israeli settlement of Netzarim.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians maintained that building at the settlement
violates the Israeli-Palestinian accords. The Israelis countered by
blocking the VIP entrance to the Gaza Strip to Palestinian
officials, while settlers from Netzarim blocked a road near their
settlement to Palestinian traffic.

   RUSSIA-FARM-FIASCO (Savino, Russia) _ As winter begins to grip
the heartland, Russia's grain harvest is at its lowest point in 45
years. Milk and meat production has continued to plummet. Russia
remains heavily dependent on imports of food _ so dependent that
the Kremlin has put aside its pride and sought almost 5 million
tons of food aid from the United States and Europe. It is a bitter
legacy for a nation where ties to the land seem almost primordial
and where 100 million citizens tend their own modest plots to grow
fruit and vegetables. By Michael R. Gordon. (With a graphic.)

   JAPAN-CHINA-ASSESS (Tokyo) _ Just last month, Japan had seemed
to be making major progress in laying World War II to rest,
forthrightly apologizing to South Koreans for its behavior and
receiving something of an absolution from the visiting Korean
president. Then Chinese President Jiang Zemin arrived on the first
visit ever by a Chinese head of state. By Nicholas D. Kristof.

   CLINTON-IMPEACH (Washington) _ Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the

leadership to predict that the House would impeach the president.

and increasingly abandoned by older, busier householders who just
do not want to cut, chop, split, stack, carry in, load and sweep up

   DEER-URBAN-WAR (Minneapolis) _ For more than a decade, as
populations of white-tailed deer have exploded on the fringes of
many eastern and midwestern cities, overrun suburbs have tried all
kinds of ways to reduce the attendant threats of deer-car
collisions, Lyme disease (which is carried by deer ticks) and
damage to gardens, shrubbery and forests. Sharpshooting is the

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As part of his budget for the coming year,
President Clinton will propose expanding Medicaid and Medicare to
allow tens of thousands of people with disabilities to retain their
health benefits when they return to work, administration officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, many of these people must, in effect, choose
between working and keeping their health insurance coverage. If
they take jobs and earn any significant amounts of money, they
jeopardize their disability benefits and the insurance coverage
they receive through Medicaid and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Many people with disabilities caused by severe injuries and
chronic illnesses say they could work, thanks to advances in
medicine and medical technology, but do not do so because they want
to keep their medical benefits under the two government health
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Eight million disabled people of working age receive more than
$50 billion a year in cash benefits in the form of Social Security
and Supplemental Security Income payments. Fewer than 1 percent of
them return to work. The definition of disability is strict; people
qualify for benefits only if they are so disabled they cannot
engage in any ``substantial gainful activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of people receiving disability benefits has risen
sharply in recent years _ 60 percent in the last decade. People are
qualifying for benefits at younger ages and staying on the rolls
longer than in the past. Federal officials have concluded that they
must find ways to get more people back to work.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposals would help people with HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS, as well as people with kidney disease, spinal
cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, various types of mental illness,
and impairments caused by strokes and heart attacks. Medicaid, in
particular, covers two items of great value to many people with
disabilities: prescription drugs and the services of personal
assistants or attendants, who help the disabled perform everyday
activities at home or at work.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Thurman, director of the Office of National AIDS Policy,
said the president's proposal would help many people with HIV keep
their Medicaid benefits while they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without prescription drugs and Medicaid coverage,'' she said,
``they might not be able to work or continue to be healthy. We're
always encouraging people to move from welfare to work. But to keep
people in the workplace, paying taxes and living healthy productive
lives, we need to provide a minimum amount of support to make sure
that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the president's proposal would
create several new options:
</P>
<P>
   _ People who lose eligibility for Social Security disability
benefits because they return to work would be allowed to continue
their Medicare coverage. People with disabilities often take
low-paying jobs that do not offer health insurance, or they do not
qualify for employer-sponsored health benefits because they work
part-time.
</P>
<P>
   _ People with disabilities could purchase Medicaid coverage even
if they took jobs and earned income that disqualified them from the
Supplemental Security Income program. States could set the
eligibility criteria and charge premiums for such Medicaid
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   _ States could allow ``working individuals with disabilities''
to buy Medicaid coverage even if they lost eligibility for cash
benefits because of medical improvements in their conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, for example, a person with severe arthritis
may receive cash disability benefits and Medicaid. The Medicaid
pays for therapy and a new drug that allows the person to go back
to work. Although this temporary remission is mostly attributable
to health care coverage, the person may lose both disability
benefits and Medicaid under existing law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us are unable to go to work because if we do, we will
lose our Medicaid and Medicare,'' said Paul Spooner of Framingham,
Mass., vice president of the National Council on Independent
Living, a nonprofit group that assists people with disabilities.
``That is a risk we cannot take. Our very lives depend on the
prescriptions, personal assistance, technology, therapy and medical
care we receive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal is similar to legislation drafted this year
by Sens. James Jeffords, R-Vt., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. Bob
Dole, the former senator and Republican presidential nominee who
has long been an advocate for people with disabilities, endorsed
that proposal, as did Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The bill did not reach the floor of either house. It did not
encounter active opposition; time simply ran out when the Senate
adjourned in October.
</P>
<P>
   People who receive disability benefits are periodically
re-examined to see if they still qualify, and they may lose
eligibility if they have even modest amounts of earned income.
Under the president's proposal, no such review could be conducted
solely because of a person's work activity, and such activity could
not be used as evidence that the person was no longer disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Lowery, an employment specialist in the Illinois
Department of Human Services, said the president, Jeffords and
Kennedy appeared to be taking the right approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``For millions of people with disabilities,'' Lowery said, ``the
biggest obstacle to re-entering the job market is the risk of
losing health insurance. A lot of them could return to work if
there was a way for them to get insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently had a 44-year-old client with a heart condition who
received $805 a month in Social Security disability benefits. His
medications cost more than $500 a month. Medicaid paid for them.
But if he were to go back to work, how could he afford to pay for
those medications? He didn't have enough skills to do anything but
an entry-level job paying the minimum wage, a little over $800 a
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and lawmakers from both parties want to
find better ways of providing job training and other services to
disabled people. They say people with disabilities should be able
to get employment services from private organizations, as well as
state agencies. Accordingly, they would issue a federal voucher, or
``ticket to work,'' that could be used by a disabled person to pay
for such services.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the growth in the disability rolls is that
Congress expanded eligibility, and court decisions have forced the
Social Security Administration to liberalize the standards further,
especially for people with mental impairments.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Social Security officials have publicized the
disability programs and actively sought out people who might
qualify. Also, many states have encouraged people to move from
state welfare programs to Supplemental Security Income, so the
federal government would pay more of the costs.

<P>
   SAVINO, Russia _ Vadim Voloboyev's day begins before sunrise,
when he scurries over to a weather-beaten barn to supervise the
morning milking.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the easiest job. Two hundred cows are crammed together
in a stockade originally built for pigs. The farm cannot afford new
conveyor belts to dispense the cheap feed or remove the pungent
manure.
</P>
<P>
   It might all be worth it if milk production helped keep the farm
solvent. But milk is turning out to be a money-losing proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work hard,'' said Viktor Remizov, director of the Savino
farm. ``But we have no money to invest in production. There is no
way to get credit. Taxes are high. There is simply no easy way out
of our situation.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of the vaunted talk of building a free market,
agriculture is the least reformed sector of the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist-led parliament has refused to approve the sale of
farmland. The nation's chronically inefficient collective farms
have been relabeled, not reorganized.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has done little to help the fiercely conservative
farmers cope with the brave new world of capitalism. Their distress
has only been compounded by the virtual collapse of the banking
system and a ruinous summer drought.
</P>
<P>
   As winter begins to grip the heartland, the results have been
distressingly clear: Russia's grain harvest is at its lowest point
in 45 years. Milk and meat production has continued to plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Russia remains heavily dependent on imports of food _ so
dependent that the Kremlin has put aside its pride and sought
almost 5 million tons of food aid from the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bitter legacy for a nation where ties to the land seem
almost primordial and where 100 million citizens tend their own
modest plots to grow fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farming requires good management and capital,'' said
Viktor &UR;  &LR; Lishchenko, a leading agricultural specialist at a
government academy of economics. ``Unfortunately, Russia does not
have either. Food security is a big, big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nestled on 4,000 acres near the storied city of Novgorod in the
northwest, Savino is a textbook case of Russia's neglect of
agricultural reform.
</P>
<P>
   During the heyday of Soviet power, this was a state-owned
collective, grandly called the 50th Anniversary of the Soviet Union
Farm. It had a bloated work force and fought a daily battle against
pilferage. But its production of wheat, meat and milk was buoyed by
state-subsidized feed, fertilizer and tractors.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the Soviet Union gave workers an opportunity to
break free of the collective. No one did.
</P>
<P>
   Each worker received a handsome certificate allowing them to
take about 10 acres of tilled land and five acres of pasture and
farm it for themselves. Instead, the workers leased their land back
to the farm, keeping only tiny plots for themselves to grow
vegetables and perhaps raise a pig or a calf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted to leave,'' recalled Remizov, who also was the
director of the Savino farm in Soviet times. ``People seem to be
afraid of the uncertainty and financial difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a common story. Few of Russia's 27,000 former collective
farms have been broken up or restructured. Russia has some 275,000
private farms, but they are generally far smaller than collective
farms and account for a mere 5 percent of farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the number of private farms increasing. Without the right
to buy and sell land, many investors are reluctant to pour their
money into Russian agriculture. Cash-poor farmers cannot use their
land as collateral to obtain loans. Programs to teach farmers
accounting and other management skills are rare. And Russia lacks
the infrastructure to develop a market that would distribute
domestic produce across the vast land.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you gave the Russian farmers all the modern equipment in
the world, it would not solve their problem,'' said Christian
Foster, an expert on Russian farming at the U.N. Department of
Agriculture. ``They need to operate their farms like a real
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Banding together, certainly, has not brought Savino's farmers
prosperity. Officially Savino is now a joint stock company; in
reality it operates much as it did when it was state owned, but
without the government handouts it used to count on to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Savino's work force remains swollen, if underpaid. Some 500
people live here, but since many are pensioners, only about 200
work the farm. A comparable farm in the United States would be run
by a handful of workers.
</P>
<P>
   Seed, feed, fertilizer and tractors now must be bought in the
marketplace at sky-high prices. Big dairies, meat factories and
grain elevators have become regional monopolies, pushing down farm
revenues by paying less for raw milk, livestock and wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Loans are hard to come by. The regional government in Novgorod
offered the farm a two-month loan at 25 percent, but the farm
cannot afford to pay it back over such a short period and turned it
down.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of the 1,500 tons of fertilizer a year it used in
Soviet times, Savino is making do this year with 120 tons. And
instead of buying new tractors and harvesters, old ones are lined
up in a muddy lot awaiting the spare parts that the farm scrambles
to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a chance to buy basic equipment,'' Remizov said.
``If I could get a loan for four years, I might take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Savino lost a million rubles (about $59,000) over the past two
years. That's normal; about 80 percent of Russian farms are
unprofitable. They survive through barter, delaying tax payments,
paying their workers with food instead of money or squeezing tax
breaks and other concessions from regional authorities.
</P>
<P>
   What most farms have not done is reorganize by laying off
unneeded workers, concentrating on crops that are most profitable
or introducing modern business techniques.
</P>
<P>
   At Savino the old ways are apparent at the fetid paddock where
Voloboyev oversees the dairy cows. The feed is short on the
nutrients needed to raise milk production. The conveyor belts that
distribute feed are old and rickety. The milking is labor
intensive.
</P>
<P>
   Each row of 40 cows is assigned to a milkmaid, who tends to them
one-by-one and then carries away the steaming pails. A milkmaid
receives 400 to 600 rubles a month (about $24 to $35) for her
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The animals themselves are filthy. A milkmaid is paid a 10-kopek
bonus for keeping each of the cows clean for a month _ less than
one cent a cow. Most simply refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask them to clean the cows,'' said Voloboyev, ``but they
say, `Why don't you do it yourself?'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The faltering state of agriculture has powerful political
implications. Many farm regions are already Communist strongholds,
and without reform they are likely to stay that way. Farms and
teetering military plants make up much of the ``Red Belt,'' a swath
of territory across southern and central Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The grinding inefficiencies have also made Russia increasingly
dependent on foreign supplies of food. Because of poor feed and
other shortages, it takes the Russians about 65 days to raise a
chicken to market weight, compared with 40 days in the United
States. Livestock herds have also shrunk.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ruble collapsed in August, Russia imported more than
a third of its food. In major cities like Moscow and St.
Petersburg, the percentage was far higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most of the farms of northwest Russia, veterinary work has
deteriorated,'' said Andrei Katargin, manager of Novgorod's leading
meat-packaging plant. ``The selection of forage is bad. The meat we
bought from Australia, Canada and Europe before the crisis was not
only of high quality; it was cheaper than the meat from the St.
Petersburg area, two hours away.''
</P>
<P>
   To a considerable extent, the failures have been cushioned by
the small garden plots most Russians maintain, which yield most of
the nation's potatoes and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even before the latest financial crisis, Russians were
cutting back on meat, instead eating potatoes, pasta and other
cheaper foods.
</P>
<P>
   Then this year, bad luck came in threes. Drought swept across
the heartland. Garden plots were hit by potato blight. The collapse
of the ruble and the paralysis of Russia's banking system took a
brutal toll on imports.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's harvest may recover somewhat next year if the weather
improves. But its land will still not be nearly as productive as it
could be. And while the government talks about reforming the farm
sector, it has yet to present a cogent plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``To succeed in modern farming today, you need to be an
agronomist, an expert in cattle breeding, a specialist on market
research, a financier and a computer programmer,'' said Sergei
Saidov, one of the handful of successful private farmers in the
region. ``But in Russia they simply took the old collective farms
and left them to their own devices. Now the food security of the
country is at risk.''

FOR THESE SPICE BOYS, IT'S A NEW FORM OF SWING MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; What ``Weird Al'' Yankovic managed to do for pop music, PGA
Tour members Peter Jacobsen, Mark Lye and Payne Stewart have . . .
</P>
<P>
   We're not quite sure yet. But obviously they've had a lot of fun
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   The threesome, known as Jake Trout and the Flounders, could be
accused of veering too far off the cart path with their debut CD
``I Love To Play'' (EMI-Capital), but then rocker-turned-golfers
like Alice Cooper, Huey Lewis, Graham Nash, Stephen Stills, Darius
Rucker and Glenn Frey are equal accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   Blame _ and credit _ all goes to Jacobsen, who's not only lead
vocalist but the main re-writer of 12 rock standards. While each do
backup vocals, Lye bangs on his non-air guitar while Stewart is
listed as the seldom-heard harmonica player. Surprisingly, Gary
McCord is not involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
   In true Yankovic fashion, Jacobsen has golf-ized versions of
songs better known as rock standards, starting with the title cut
that plugs in his words to the Randy Newman classic ``I Love L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; `` &LR; Playin' down that big old fairway
</P>
<P>
   Don't want no hackers to get in my way
</P>
<P>
   The boys and me got a big Nassau goin'
</P>
<P>
   We were born to drive ...
</P>
<P>
   Harbor Town Golf Links _ we love it!
</P>
<P>
   Winged Foot Golf Club _ we love it!
</P>
<P>
   Augusta National _ we love it!
</P>
<P>
   Pebble Beach _ we love it! &UR; '' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   That's par for the CD.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen's impressive range goes from the smooth takeoff of
Stills' ``Love the One You're With'' with his ``Love the One You
Whiff'' to the raspy ``I'm On 18,'' a revised version of Cooper's
``Eighteen'' high school anthem from the '70s. Unfortunately, Jake
can't get the Joe Walsh whine down on his version of ``Life's Been
Good (To Me So Far)'' that's been changed to ``It'd Be Good (To
Just Make Par).''
</P>
<P>
   Steppenwolf, War, the Box Tops and REO Speedwagon are also
ground up in Jacobsen's lyrical blender and come out equally
clever. It doesn't hurt that Frey, Nash, Stills, Cooper and Rucker
actually do backup vocals on the remakes of their songs.
</P>
<P>
   From a rock-band standpoint, Jake Trout and the Flounders show
birdie potential but might need more time on the vocal range. If
this effort would have been perfect as the ``Happy Gilmore'' sound
track, they've got ``Tin Cup'' in them somewhere.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN, Vt. _ In winters past, Molly Prescott recalled, when her
daughters came in from sledding, cherry-cheeked and snow-crusted
and clamoring for hot chocolate, they would bake their mittens dry
next to the wood stove that had long heated the family house in the
rural Vermont hamlet of Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when her younger daughter sledded right into a brook, Mrs.
Prescott even had the frozen child strip off her wet clothes and
stand next to the old black Defiant stove until the shivers
subsided. The heat the squat thing threw off penetrated right to
the bone.
</P>
<P>
   But the Prescott girls are grown now, and no longer at home to
do the log-stacking and stove-feeding and gathering 'round. And for
Mrs. Prescott, a native Vermonter, ``The romance of the stove kind
of faded,'' she said. ``I went to work, our life became faster'' _
and she and her husband, Seymour, broke down and bought an oil
furnace.
</P>
<P>
   The Prescotts are far from alone. National and regional
statistics show wood heating at its lowest ebb since the numbers
started to be tracked 20 years ago, out-run by other cheap fuels
and increasingly abandoned by older, busier householders who just
do not want to cut, chop, split, stack, carry in, load and sweep up
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The nadir follows a decade of decline in the popularity of the
potbellied radiance that, to many, once meant more than just cheap
heat. It meant doing things the good, old way, and using renewable
resources back when the Arab oil embargo was still fresh in memory,
and leading a life slow and close to home and hearth. That was
especially true here in Vermont, ground zero of the
back-to-the-land movement of hippie times.
</P>
<P>
   But these are sport utility vehicle times now. Oil and natural
gas are cheap. Newfangled gas stoves and fireplaces can provide the
hypnotic flames and the radiating heat without the labor (though
also without the crackle _ until someone comes up with a speaker
attachment). And wood turned out to be environmentally problematic,
with its nasty particulates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many ponytails have gone gray now, or white.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory runs that we've got an aging population and people
find it physically more difficult even just moving the firewood,''
said Bob De Geus, a wood utilization specialist for the state of
Vermont who recently stopped using his own wood stove for fear his
young children would burn themselves. ``It's something they don't
find pleasure in doing anymore. Also, people's lives are busier and
they don't have time to spend tending the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent heyday of wood heat _ leaving aside that humankind
has warmed itself at fires since its cave days _ was in the
mid-1980s, according to surveys by the Federal Energy Information
Administration. In 1987, 6 percent of households used wood for
their main heat and 21 percent used it as secondary heating. But by
last year, only 2 percent of U.S. households used wood as their
main heat, and supplemental use had dropped to 13 percent, one
percentage point lower than in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, here in a state that is nearly 80 percent forested,
home to the famed and still-existent Vermont Castings stove company
before it was bought by an Indiana company, wood heating will
always play a strong role, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, said Peter L'Esperance, proprietor of the Chimney
Sweep II store in Berlin, sales of wood stoves have picked up in
the wake of last winter's devastating ice storm, which gave many
Northeasterners a taste of life without heat and electricity for
days.
</P>
<P>
   And there is word among suppliers that fear of the chaos that
the year 2000 computer problem could wreak on the nation's power
system is also fueling sales, he said _ though he has
conscientiously resisted playing on that panic in his
advertisements. In general, he and others said, any sane Vermonter
makes sure there is some kind of backup for the home heating
system, and few throw out their old wood stoves even after they
stop using them.
</P>
<P>
   But one of his more typical customers these days, L'Esperance
said, is a Vermonter who comes in and wants to shift from wood to
gas. ``They've burned wood for 20 years, they're older, and they
don't want the dust, they don't want the dirt, and the main thing
is, they don't want to fool with the wood anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   L'Esperance's experience is borne out by national sales figures
gathered by the industry group called The Hearth Products
Association, formerly known as the Wood Heating Alliance. In 1997,
sales of wood stoves and wood-burning fireplaces totaled 525,000,
having dropped since 1991. They were easily outnumbered by sales of
gas-fueled fireplaces and stoves, which rose steadily to 680,000 in
1997 from 149,000 in 1992, and have helped keep many a wood-stove
company alive.
</P>
<P>
   Chroniclers of Vermont life see not only a decline in
wood-burning, but also a decided sociological shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population is more and more brainy and less and less
brawny,'' said Joe Sherman, author of ``Fast Lane on a Dirt Road:
Vermont Transformed, 1945-1990'' (Countryman Press, 1991), in an
e-mail interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firewood burning is a class thing,'' Sherman said. ``Poor
people now burn firewood. The upscale nouveau Vermonters used to
burn wood when it was chic, but no longer. I know several couples
who moved to Montgomery, my town, who took on wood for a year, then
abandoned it because it was too much work.''
</P>
<P>
   And Peter Miller, whose ``Vermont People'' is being re-issued
this fall by his own Silver Print Press, noted that these days,
``More and more people who move up here are connected to the
computer for business, and I don't think they want to have the
problem of ashes in their offices.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Miller said, he is starting an online photographic
agency out of his sprawling old farmhouse in Waterbury, Vt., and
though he has wood stoves elsewhere in the house, and happily
splits the logs that he gets dumped in his driveway at $70 a cord,
he heats the computer-scanner-photo room with gas.
</P>
<P>
   The ironic thing about the decline in wood stove use, he and
others pointed out, is that it comes at a time when wood works
better than ever before. Houses are better insulated to hold in the
heat, and the stoves are crafted to be much more efficient and
cleaner burning _ in part because they must now meet tough
air-pollution requirements. Some new stove models advertise such
efficiency that one load of wood can burn almost all day.
</P>
<P>
   Energy experts also see added heating promise in systems that
use wood chips and waste; homeowners can buy stoves that burn wood
pellets _ 40,000 were sold last year nationwide _ and for larger
buildings, wood-chip systems are gaining ground. Two dozen Vermont
schools have converted to wood-chip systems, state officials said,
and each saved about one annual teacher's salary by doing so. A
power plant in Burlington is experimenting with a ``biomass
gasification process'' that would convert wood chips into
high-energy fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Fireplaces for what experts call ``pleasure burners'' _ the
upscale kind who enjoy a snifter of brandy as they regard the
flames from their wing chairs _ remain as popular as ever,
according to official figures and sales statistics. Of Vermont's
90,000 households using wood heat, about 10,000 are ``pleasure
burners.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there will always be hard-core wood-heat-lovers
like Sherman, who described the joy of chopping wood with the even
rhythm of a metronome: ``I can do it with a rhythm that joins
muscles and the music of steel against grain, of wood falling to
the side in growing piles,'' he wrote. ``You become a pendulum of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter the decline, ``You should be able to find a few blue
scarves crawling out of chimneys and into the sky here and there
for a long time to come,'' he averred. ``You sure as to hell will
wherever I live.''
</P>
<P>
   And most likely anywhere, Federal tracking shows. Though
associated in many minds with northern New England winters,
dependence on wood heat is spread fairly evenly around the country,
and is even somewhat heavier in the South and Pacific regions,
where less heat is needed over all and a bit of wood will often
suffice, than in the East.
</P>
<P>
   But the less hard-core wood heaters, it seems, are increasingly
going the way of Ben and Barbara Scotch, who moved to a storybook
Victorian brick house in Montpelier in 1972 and soon installed a
wood stove in their living room because back then, Mrs. Scotch
said, ``It was the thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The stove served as the glowing center of the living room as
their children grew, toasting the room nicely. It also so dried out
the air that it caused cracks in the cherished Biedermeier
furniture that Mrs. Scotch, an artist, had brought over from her
native Switzerland to fight homesickness. And the Scotches had a
child with asthma, and cats that ended up smelling smoked; and
their neighborhood, located in a hollow, would sometimes be
shadowed by a pall of wood smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Scotches took out the wood stove, choosing to heat
the living room using the oil furnace that already warmed the rest
of the house. It was not without a pang, said Ben Scotch, who is
chief staff lawyer for the Vermont Supreme Court and a former New
Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   But they had faced reality, he said: ``It dried out our skin,
our lungs and our furniture. And since everyone else was doing it,
it was the equivalent of smoking about two packs a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Ben Scotch said, the wood stove ``came with the
large starry eyes of flatland immigrants, and life turned out to be
much more complicated. Everyone who came here to simplify their
lives quickly found out they'd been watching too many sitcoms.
Everything is a trade-off.''

   You'd think one of the four ``C's'' to successful public-address
announcing would be asking for payment in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they involve being 1) clear, 2) concise, 3) correct and
4) consistent. And if you had checked the official site for
public-address announcers
(http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Sideline/4204/) _ yes, one
exists _ that golden rule could have been etched in your memory by
now.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Kennedy (joekennedyn2.com), the PA man for the University of
Maine's men's and women's hockey the last nine years, started the
site when he went to look for one and couldn't find anything. So,
he built it.
</P>
<P>
   The four ``C's'' rule, by the way, was submitted by Roger
Gitlin, who is the voice of College of the Canyons, Pierce College
and the WNBA Sparks. Gitlin is also founder of the Association of
Public Address Announcers.

CONGO REBEL LEADER VOICES CAUTION ON TRUCE AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By IAN FISHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The leader of the rebels in Congo said Sunday
that he had not heard the details of a cease-fire agreement
announced on Saturday in Paris and could not yet commit to it.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel leader, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, said he hoped that the
pact would end the fighting. But, speaking by telephone from a
remote town in northeastern Congo, he said fighting would continue
until details of the cease-fire became clear.
</P>
<P>
   And he repeated a demand that President Laurent Kabila has
rejected time and again. ``The next step would be substantive and
direct negotiations between us and the government of Kabila,'' dia
Wamba said.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila has been battling an insurgency that began in August in
the nation, which was called Zaire under the long dictatorship of
Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila has refused to meet directly with the
rebels, and it was unclear whether he agreed in Paris to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Dia Wamba's comments added yet another element of uncertainty to
the accord, announced by French President Jacques Chirac and U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan at a meeting of African leaders this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Congo became the focus of the summit meeting in Paris
because of its potential to spread into a major regional conflict.
Already, Uganda and Rwanda support the rebels militarily, and four
other nations _ Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad _ support
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   After meetings with leaders of Uganda, Rwanda, Angola and
Zimbabwe, as well as with Kabila, Annan and Chirac said they had
secured promises that a cease-fire pact would be signed by
mid-December, before a meeting of the Organization of African
Unity.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no written accord, and afterward the parties could
not agree on exactly what they had pledged to do. Even as he called
the pact ``preliminary,'' Kabila said late Saturday that he and his
allies would sign a pledge in Lusaka, Zambia, on Dec. 8 to end the
hostilities .
</P>
<P>
   Officials from South Africa and Uganda cast doubt, however, on
whether any real progress had been made. Sunday, a Rwandan official
said there could be no progress until Kabila met with the rebels.
Until then, said Patrick Mazimhaka, Rwanda's minister of state, the
accord is ``not worth anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, who took power only last year, has said he will not meet
with the rebels because the conflict is essentially an ``invasion''
by Uganda and Rwanda. Those two countries _ contending that they
need to secure their own borders from rebels based in Congo _ have
sent troops to support the Congolese rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The insurgent leader, dia Wamba, said Sunday that his
representatives in Paris had not yet reported back to him on the
talks. He said, however, that he could support any initiative that
included direct negotiations with Kabila.

 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time an e-mail message reaches a resident of Grants,
N.M., an isolated town 75 miles west of Albuquerque, it has
traveled where few Internet transmissions have gone before.
</P>
<P>
   The town's primary Internet provider, Cibola Internet Services,
is linked to cyberspace by a satellite about 23,000 miles above the
Earth. At $1,700 a month, the service is not cheap, but the
alternative was even less appealing: Cibola's owner, Louis Uttaro,
said he had waited six months for the local phone company to
install a high-speed line with a monthly fee of $2,200.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of businesses, schools and Internet service providers
in remote areas have turned to satellite access to the Internet
because land lines are either unavailable or too expensive. Yet
service by satellite is still a small player in the Internet
marketplace, and industry analysts are skeptical that traditional
satellite connections such as that provided to Cibola will ever be
affordable enough to play a large role in the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, two California start-up companies say they have
engineered ways for more people to use the same satellite
simultaneously to gain access to the Internet and thus make the
technology more affordable and widespread.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of these companies is to offer less expensive
alternatives to a T1 line, the high-speed connection that most
Internet service providers and large corporations lease from local
telephone companies. A T1 line can handle 1.5 million bits, the
smallest units of information handled by a computer, a second.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Tachyon Inc., based in San Diego, plans to begin
testing its technology in Europe within a month, offering
high-speed access, equal in some cases to what is offered by a T1
line, for $400 a month. The second company, Aloha Networks Inc. in
San Francisco, plans to start a similar service, called SkyDSL,
within six months. Both systems cost several thousand dollars to
install and are aimed at businesses, not individual consumers, and
at buyers primarily outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This works in Dubuque, in Mazatlan, in Dubai _ anywhere there
is not good cable and good service,'' John Koehler, president of
Tachyon, said. ``Our business is to provide communication links
from anywhere to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The satellite companies do not plan to compete directly with
dial-up access, digital subscriber lines, cable modems or T1 lines,
which can cost $350 to $3,000 a month, depending on how far the
line must be stretched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Land lines aren't going to go away,'' said Nicholas
Negroponte, founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Media Lab and a member of Tachyon's board. ``If you want to move
bits from a specific point in Manhattan to a specific point in
London, there is no better way than to stretch a fiber line between
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But he sees Tachyon's solution as having great potential in
regions devoid of telephone and cable lines. ``I'm looking for ways
that rural communities and developing nations can get Internet
access long before they can get wired or even wireless terrestrial
structure,'' he said, ``and this is the only way of doing it for
the next four or five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are skeptical, though, that the technology will enjoy
widespread success. Abhi Chaki, a senior analyst with Jupiter
Communications, a market research firm in New York, projects that
by 2003 at most 2 percent of online households in the United States
will use satellite access to the Internet. And he says he does not
think that overseas markets will grow as much as the start-up
companies expect.
</P>
<P>
   Chaki said customers would not be very likely to switch from
land lines even if the satellite technology improved, in part
because they would perceive it as unreliable. ``If technology alone
were responsible for owning market share, you'd see Apple and
Betamax owning the markets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the proponents of satellite access acknowledge that the
technology presents some serious challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The way satellite access works varies by company, but in
general, when an Internet user requests a connection to a Web page,
the signal first travels through a land line to a satellite dish,
typically on the roof of the company or the service provider. The
dish then transmits the signal at least 22,300 miles into space via
radio waves to a geostationary satellite _ one that is always in
the same position in relation to the equator, so that the ground
antenna never has to move.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite sends the request back to Earth, where it is
directed to the Internet. Once the information is retrieved, it is
sent by the same process back to the user. The whole process takes
only seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But one drawback of satellite-based Internet access is that the
data do not travel at the same speed in both directions. Data sent
from the satellite down to the user travel at speeds of 500
kilobits to 2 megabits a second, but the speed of information sent
from the user up to the satellite is typically not much greater
than that delivered through a standard 56 kilobit-per-second modem.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger satellites and more transmission power are required for a
faster trip up, and most businesses would find the cost
prohibitive, industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The unequal speed coming and going, known as asynchronous
bandwidth, may be fine for individuals who typically send out, or
``upload'' to the network, only e-mail and Web page requests, and
it is common with some nonsatellite forms of Internet access. But
it is a problem for corporations that want to maintain Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   A second sticking point with satellite access is that the
distance the data must travel can cause delays.
</P>
<P>
   A third is that the geostationary satellites cost about $2
million a year to lease, yet can process only a limited number of
simultaneous data streams _ about 400 sources at a time, said Jim
Omura, president and chief executive of Aloha.

 UNDATED: of Aloha. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Omura said Aloha's technology could increase the per-satellite
capacity to as many as 3,000 high-speed data streams, allowing
overhead costs to be spread among eight times as many users.
</P>
<P>
   He said the system would enable users to send out data at 64
kilobits a second, slightly faster than by a 56-kilobit modem. But
they could receive data at 500 kilobits a second, one-third the
speed of a T1 line. Omura said the company planned to charge $2,500
to install the system, plus monthly fees ranging from $500 to
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Users in some countries in Latin America, Aloha's first target,
now pay $2,000 a month for a dedicated land line carrying 64
kilobits per second both ways, Omura said. ``There is a growing gap
between the demand for Internet access and the ability of
terrestrial networks to meet those demands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, the Tachyon president, said his company had developed a
way to fit 3,000 to 4,000 users on a single satellite transponder.
The system will cost $3,500 to set up, and the monthly fees will
depend on how much bandwidth the customer needs. He said the
company planned to roll out the service in the United States and
Mexico on Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite access market already includes several major
players. One, Hughes Network Systems, based in Maryland, offers a
service called DirecPC to about 85,000 individual and corporate
users worldwide. Loral Orion, a division of Loral Space &AMP;
Communications, says it provides satellite access to 60 Internet
service providers, mostly in Europe. Intelligent Communications, a
Fremont, Calif., company, sells connection by satellite to 60
customers, including remote schools and Internet service providers.
Cibola, the service in New Mexico run by Uttaro, is one of its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Intelligent Communications announced that it had
signed a deal to be acquired by Softnet Systems, a small company
based in Mountain View, Calif. Softnet will focus on delivering
high-speed access via satellite to small-town cable companies,
which will then sell it to their customers over cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   All these companies use geostationary satellites.
</P>
<P>
   An altogether different model is the much-publicized plan by
Teledesic, a company owned in part by Bill Gates, chairman of
Microsoft Corp., to develop a satellite-based system it calls
``Internet in the sky.'' In a $9 billion undertaking, Teledesic
plans to place 288 satellites into low orbit, about 850 miles above
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Because Teledesic's satellites would be closer to the Earth's
surface than geostationary satellites are, the round-trip time of
the data would be cut significantly. The catch is that users of
Teledesic's system will have to install antennae that can track
satellites that move through the sky rather than hang in one place.
The satellites have not been built or deployed, and the service
will not be operational until at least 2003, the company says.

FRANCE MAKES AN ACCOUNTING OF HOLOCAUST VICTIMS' LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It has been carefully preserved in the archives for more
than 50 years, a handwritten receipt from the French Internal
Police for 51,135 francs _ worth about $13,000 today _ and $450
seized from Henri Israel of Limoges on his arrival in the French
concentration camp in Drancy, north of Paris, on Oct. 30, 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Where he went, he and 11,000 others for whom similar receipts
were made and kept during the German occupation in World War II, is
known: the Nazi death camps at Auschwitz, where nearly 75,000
French Jews were sent.
</P>
<P>
   Few returned.
</P>
<P>
   But what happened to the money? Has Germany, has France made
restitution? Has some French bank been using the money all this
time (if it was not seized by the Nazis)? If so, what kind of
compensation should be made, and who should get it?
</P>
<P>
   These are among the questions that France now appears to be
ready to answer, according to Jacques Fredj, director of the Center
for Contemporary Jewish Documentation and the Memorial to the
Unknown Jewish Martyr, where many records are kept.
</P>
<P>
   After 50 years of suppressing memories of what the
collaborationist Vichy government did to the Jews under the Nazi
occupation, French authorities have been trying harder since 1995
to do justice to their survivors. Government commissions are poring
over long-closed files like the ones in the Jewish archive, in the
once heavily Jewish district of the Marais in the heart of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But for French Jews, the question of how hard to push for
restitution or compensation remains difficult. France did make a
major effort to restore seized assets after the war, but then swept
the loose ends under the carpet and mostly forgot about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Switzerland, everything was done wrong,'' said Fredj,
referring to Swiss indignation over $2 billion in claims that
Holocaust survivors are pressing against Swiss banks for handling
gold seized by the Nazis. But the Swiss, unlike the French, had not
previously been confronted with charges of collaborating, wittingly
or unwittingly, with the Germans during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political pressure was put on the Swiss authorities before
experts had done the necessary work to establish the validity and
extent of claims,'' Fredj said. ``Here it is much better to wait
and find out what the experts determine before pressing any
demands.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, France did its best to find heirs of death camp
victims and to restore property, cash and bank accounts that the
Nazis and their collaborators had seized from them and from the
225,000 to 250,000 other Jews living in France in 1940 when the
Nazis marched in.
</P>
<P>
   But many deported Jews never returned and had no survivors to
claim their property. According to Henri Hajdenberg, president of
the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France, 15,000
to 20,000 safe-deposit boxes and accounts seized from Jews went
unclaimed after the war and stayed with the French banks holding
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably 70 percent of the bank assets were returned,''
Hajdenberg said. ``But we don't know what the banks have been doing
with the rest. Morally, there can be no question of leaving money
that belonged to victims of the Holocaust in the hands of private
or nationalized companies.''
</P>
<P>
   One group of survivors living in the United States brought a
class action suit last year in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
against large French banks to recover assets like these.
</P>
<P>
   With an international conference on Holocaust-era assets
starting in Washington on Monday to discuss issues that museums,
art dealers and collectors face in dealing with looted artwork,
French officials have become more willing to consider new claims.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the government set up a blue-ribbon panel under Jean
Matteoli, a prominent banker and politician, to try to inventory
every artwork, building and bank note illegally confiscated during
the occupation, and determine what to do about those that could not
be restored to their owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a lot of progress,'' said Adolphe Steg, a surgeon
and Jewish civic leader who is a member of the Matteoli commission.
``There are hundreds of thousands of documents and other records
that we have had to go through, but insurance companies and banks
have studied their archives, too, and we are getting there. We
expect to publish an interim report at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has announced an increase of nearly
$2 million in the commission's budget next year. He also said the
government would create a new official body to examine individual
claims by victims of anti-Semitic occupation laws and their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   But Hajdenberg, a prominent lawyer, said the real question was
what France should do to compensate for actions that are
irreparable. ``The essential, fundamental aspect of the restitution
question is historical knowledge and its dissemination,'' he said.
``This question should not be obscured by demands for money.''
</P>
<P>
   With Jospin in the audience, Hajdenberg proposed at a dinner
Saturday night that the French government create a national
Holocaust memorial. Jospin pledged $8.8 million in government money
to expand the center in the Marais, run by a foundation led by Eric
de Rothschild, and said that perhaps this would make a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``A foundation to teach the history of totalitarian movements
would help make sure something like the Holocaust could never
happen again,'' Hajdenberg said. ``Its endowment should be on the
scale of the economic depredations committed against the Jews of
France.''

CHILE WILL INVESTIGATE PINOCHET, FOREIGN MINISTER VOWS
</HEADLINE>
   (js) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Pressing an effort to persuade Britain to free Gen.
Augusto Pinochet and let him fly home, the foreign minister of
Chile said here Sunday that his government would pursue its own
judgment of the former dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said that the popular view
that the 83-year-old general had unlimited immunity in his own
country was wrong and that there were 14 cases against him
initiated by alleged victims of his dictatorship that are in the
hands of prosecutors in Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   The cases have all been brought since March, when the general
stepped down as commander in chief of the armed forces. The people
who have sought prosecution believe that the Chilean judge handling
the cases has been doing a ``thorough job,'' Insulza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the government is going to do even more to make sure
that the investigation goes forward, but of course you can never
say, `We assure you he is going to jail,' '' he said. In contrast
to only ``symbolic'' justice in Britain or Spain, Insulza
contended, ``the only real chance to have some kind of justice and
some kind of truth is in Chile, where the events happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Insulza made the comments to the television interviewer David
Frost on Sunday in one of a series of appearances and news
conferences the Chilean official has held since arriving here on
Friday to plead the diplomatic case for Pinochet's return to Chile.
A Socialist, Insulza spent years in exile during the Pinochet years
and does not plan to visit the former dictator in London.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet is being held here for a hearing on Dec. 11 on a
Spanish petition for his extradition to Madrid to face charges of
genocide, terrorism and torture in connection with the killings and
``disappearances'' of 3,178 people.
</P>
<P>
   While hinting at possible court action against the general at
home, Insulza said he was not offering Britain a ``deal'' for his
freedom. ``I would not say we are making any deals or going into
negotiations,'' he said. ``What we have tried to present is our
position on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has remained out of the public eye since his arrest
Oct. 16 and is expected to move on Monday from a North London
hospital where he has been recuperating from spinal surgery to a
mansion rented by friends in a fashionable community in the Surrey
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers spent the weekend preparing written arguments for
Jack Straw, the British home secretary, due by the close of
business on Monday. Straw must decide whether to let the
extradition matter go forward or allow Pinochet to leave England.
</P>
<P>
   The British government has insisted that the decision is a
matter for the courts and that Straw, acting in a ``quasi
judicial'' capacity, does not intend to consult prime minister Tony
Blair or his Cabinet colleagues. Four legal grounds exist on which
Straw may stop the extradition process at this stage: for
compassion, if the crimes are not extraditable ones, if the
document itself is faulty, and if the charges are considered
political.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Insulza saw his British counterpart, Robin Cook, on Friday and
dropped off a letter at Blair's official residence, 10 Downing
Street. On Saturday he held a news conference and gave radio and
television interviews in which he argued that Britain was
interrupting the progress of democracy and the peaceful move away
from authoritarianism in Chile. ``The Chilean people have to be
allowed to judge and decide how they are going to deal with their
past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also warned that British-Chilean trade and diplomatic
relations could suffer unless the Pinochet impasse was resolved.
``We have been close friends and close allies for 175 years, and of
course nobody can guarantee the world that will go on if this thing
prolongs itself too much in time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The British Foreign Office warned Britons against nonessential
travel to Chile because of the ``highly volatile'' situation there.
The Defense Ministry canceled the visit of the Royal Navy frigate
Sutherland to Valparaiso, Chile's second largest city, at the
suggestion of the Chilean authorities. ``We jointly concluded that
conditions at the moment were no longer conducive for a visit to go
ahead,'' a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain also closed its honorary consul's office in the Pacific
port city, but played down the seriousness of the action. ``This is
not a question of removing anybody or closing down consulate
buildings or offices,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said. ``This
person lives and works in the area. But her office, as far as the
British work she does, has been closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Insulza dismissed reports of possible danger to Britons in
Chile. ``There is no question that anyone can travel to Chile with
no problem, and there are no reports of any serious incidents,'' he
said.

SWISS VOTERS REJECT LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA, HEROIN AND COCAINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Swiss voters on Sunday decisively defeated a radical
measure to legalize marijuana as well as heroin and cocaine,
turning aside arguments that a government-managed narcotics network
would curb drug-related crime.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would have turned Switzerland into a virtual
free-drugs zone, with any resident over 18 years old able to buy
narcotics at state-approved pharmacies, after consulting a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 74 percent of voters rejected the initiative, which had
been expected to fail, but not to such an overwhelming extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a surprise,'' said Francois Reusser, spokesman for the
committee that launched the initiative ``for a sensible drug
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters reacted emotionally to the heroin aspect,'' he said.
However, Reusser said he hoped lawmakers would still consider
liberalizing the use and possession of cannabis, which federal
statistics indicate is regularly consumed by some 500,000 people in
Switzerland, a nation of 7 million.
</P>
<P>
   He said the committee, backed by Socialists, medical doctors,
lawyers and drug experts, would consider a new campaign to collect
the signatures necessary to force a ballot vote on legalizing
cannabis.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said the vote confirmed Switzerland's
policy of battling illicit drugs, but also aiding the worst-off
drug addicts through a program that gives heroin and methadone to a
controlled group of abusers. The Alpine nation has an estimated
30,000 to 36,000 hard drug addicts, one of the highest rates in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Zeltner, chief of the federal health department, said
Switzerland was ready to review policies on soft drugs such as
marijuana and hashish. The government is proposing new laws on
drugs be drawn up next year.

NEW LOAN WOULD KEEP THEATER COMPANY IN BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Livent Inc., the corporate producer of the Broadway musical
``Ragtime,'' has found lenders willing to provide it with more
money and save it from shutting down immediately, a person close to
the company said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Livent, which sought protection from its creditors in bankruptcy
court this month, is quickly running out of cash. The company has
said that a $5 million emergency loan from a group of its directors
would pay the bills only through the end of November.
</P>
<P>
   But the person close to the company said that Livent's board,
including Michael Ovitz, the Hollywood power broker who now
controls the company, met Sunday to consider ``three different
lending alternatives.'' The board will make a final decision early
this week, this person said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Any new loans must be approved by the federal Bankruptcy Court in
New York and another court in Toronto where the company is based.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that the company will be kept together,'' said
this person, who would not identify the possible lenders.
</P>
<P>
   If the loans are approved, the company will continue to
reorganize its finances and try to make its shows profitable. Ovitz
and Livent's other new managers, who took over the company in June,
have blamed the former chief executive, Garth Drabinsky, and other
former managers for the company's predicament.
</P>
<P>
   Livent has sued Drabinsky and his partner, Myron Gottlieb,
contending that the two men, who founded the company, engaged in a
widespread corporate fraud and manipulated the company's accounts
to hide the fact that its extravagant productions were losing tens
of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Since the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on
Nov. 18, executives have canceled dozens of concerts and musicals
at a theater in Toronto, angering ticketholders who arrived to find
the lights out. Instead of getting their money back, the Toronto
patrons were offered tickets to ``Phantom of the Opera,'' another
Livent show.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also closing some of its expensive musical
productions that have been touring the United States. The company
has canceled a production of ``Ragtime'' that last played in
Minneapolis. A production of ``Showboat'' is expected to close on
Dec. 6 in Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, ``Ragtime'' has continued to go on before houses
that are nearly sold out. So far, the company insists that its
other new projects coming to Manhattan are proceeding as planned.
``Parade,'' which the company produced with Lincoln Center, is in
previews, and ``Fosse: A Celebration of Song and Dance,'' is
scheduled to open on Broadway in January.

NAME YOUR POISON: SHRIMP OR CHICKEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It may have been a historic occasion, but nobody knew
it at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Frederick &AMP; Nelson department stores management
to stage an Intermediate Eater cooking demonstration in the
pots-and-pans department may not have led directly to the decline
of that long-esteemed emporium. But it could have been a
contributing factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who seem to live in Frederick &AMP; Nelson,'' I
was advised before the cooking demonstration commenced, lo those
many years ago. ``Maybe they sleep in the stockroom or in the
heating vents, we don't know,'' the F&AMP;N executive advised in a
whisper. ``But they always reappear during a cooking demonstration.
If you let them eat something you cooked, they will swear tomorrow
they were poisoned by Frederick &AMP; Nelson. Then we've got a real
problem on our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   With that warning in mind, I tried not to make direct eye
contact with anybody, while cooking up a version of chicken
saltimbocca. When I had finished, I turned around to locate a
spatula. When I turned back, the skillet was empty. I hadn't dished
up the chicken. I hadn't cut it into tiny pieces. But all the
spectators in the front row were suddenly chewing furiously on
something.
</P>
<P>
   If I didn't kill Frederick &AMP; Nelson, those piranhas probably
did.
</P>
<P>
   But with the opening of Westlake Center and Pacific Place and
the renovation of the F&AMP;N building by Nordstrom, Seattle's retail
core has never looked more successful or appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I deserve credit, rather than blame.
</P>
<P>
   But I wonder. When I wander into a food hall like Costco or Top
Foods, it seems like every aisle contains another quick-cooking
demonstration. And the customers are encouraged to sample the
goods.
</P>
<P>
   I think some families diet all week in anticipation of a rush on
Costco. I suspect I'm witnessing family reunions, scheduled a year
in advance, at the frozen food aisle where teriyaki chicken wings
are being offered.
</P>
<P>
   Does the old warning no longer apply? Doesn't anybody get
poisoned anymore?
</P>
<P>
   All I know is that I now cook in a controlled environment. If
anybody reaches too quickly for a Swedish shrimp or a hunk of
Turkish chicken, alarms go off and the kitchen door is
automatically locked _ top and bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish Shrimp
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-one-half pounds shrimp in shells
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup celery tops
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup mixed pickling spices
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sliced onions
</P>
<P>
   8 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 recipe pickling marinade
</P>
<P>
   I got this recipe from Mary Emmons, but Mary says she got it
from Barb Ferrer. Obviously, nobody wants to be legally
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find pickling spices already packaged, mix together
equal parts of dill seed, peppercorns, mustard seeds and celery
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Cover shrimp with boiling water. Add celery tops, spices and
salt. Cover and simmer 5 minutes. Drain. Peel and devein under cold
water.
</P>
<P>
   Alternate cleaned shrimp, onions and bay leaves in shallow
baking dish. Slop the pickling marinade over the top. Cover and
chill at least 24 hours, occasionally spooning the marinade over
the top. Serve as an appetizer or buffet dish with toothpicks on
the side.
</P>
<P>
   Pickling Marinade
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one-half cups salad oil
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons capers with some liquid from bottle
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-one-half teaspoons celery seed
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one-half teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   Tabasco to taste
</P>
<P>
   Mix well before pouring over the shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish Chicken
</P>
<P>
   2 whole chicken breasts (four pieces)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped onion, divided
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup chopped carrots
</P>
<P>
   10 black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one-half quarts water
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons walnut oil
</P>
<P>
   Paprika
</P>
<P>
   2 or three slices French bread, crusts removed
</P>
<P>
   Milk
</P>
<P>
   Three-and-one-half cups walnut meats, divided
</P>
<P>
   3 large cloves garlic, mashed
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   Into a pot containing the one-and-one-half quarts water put
two-thirds cup chopped onion, the chopped carrots, peppercorns, bay
leaf and 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste. Simmer over medium heat 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Toss in the chicken breasts and simmer just until done, about 20
minutes more. Remove the breasts and let cool. Remove and discard
the bones and skin. Cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. Strain
and reserve the chicken broth.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the walnut oil into a small saucepan and add 2 teaspoons of
paprika. Keep over warm heat.
</P>
<P>
   Mix bread with a little milk until soft, then squeeze dry in
your fist. Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Grind 3 cups of the walnuts in a food processor until fine. Dump
into a large bowl and add the bread, garlic, one-third cup of
minced onion, 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons paprika, the cayenne
and 2 cups of the chicken broth.
</P>
<P>
   Stir, then add more salt if needed. You want the sauce thick but
pourable, so adjust the broth accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Mix half the sauce with the chicken pieces and arrange on a
platter. Pour the remaining sauce over the top. Drizzle the warm
paprika oil over the sauce and decorate with the remaining one-half
cup of whole walnuts.

BIG BONUSES TO ACCOMPANY MERGER OF DEUTSCHE AND BANKERS TRUST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank AG is expected to provide multimillion-dollar
incentives to a handful of top Bankers Trust and Deutsche
executives to secure their services once the German banking giant
completes its $9.67 billion purchase of Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to be announced formally in Frankfurt on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Executives involved in the merger talks said bankers in this
select group would receive at least $10 million each to stay with
the merged company for an undisclosed period of time, to help
insure that managers crucial to the merger's success are in place.
Hundreds of other employees of the investment banking unit will
receive smaller incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Although fat bonuses have never been known to be guarantors of
long-term loyalty on Wall Street, those who will receive the
largest financial incentives include at least six Bankers Trust
executives and three Deutsche executives, all of whom will be
overseeing the enlarged investment banking business created by
Deutsche's purchase.
</P>
<P>
   From the Bankers Trust side, the executives include the bank's
chairman, Frank Newman; Mary Cirillo, who will run the new unit's
global custody business; Yves de Balmann and Mayo Shattuck, who
will jointly manage the new investment banking business; Ted
Virtue, who will run corporate finance; and Robert Ferguson, who
will supervise retail brokerage activities.
</P>
<P>
   From the Deutsche side, the executives include Josef Ackermann,
who oversaw Deutsche's investment banking business; Edson Mitchell,
who will oversee global debt trading in the new business; and
Michael Phillip, who will oversee the equities business of the
merged company.
</P>
<P>
   All of these executives will be members of the merged company's
investment banking committee, which will be supervised by Ackermann
and Newman.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both companies appeared ready late Sunday to give
final approval to the Bankers Trust acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The big payouts are being offered although Deutsche has been
badly burned in the past when it gave lucrative pay packages in an
effort to secure what it believed to be top investment banking
talent. Most notably, Deutsche went on an expensive shopping spree
to build up its Deutsche Morgan Grenfell investment banking unit
with very little impact on the bank's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Deutsche has to do something to make sure that the
acquisition goes as smoothly as possible, given the potential for
client defections or a late start in snaring new business if the
investment banking unit lacks direction and stability. Deutsche
already lost dozens of investment bankers earlier this year who
specialized in making deals in the high-technology business.
</P>
<P>
   The bank is expected to retreat from its policy of awarding
bonuses in the form of Deutsche Bank shares.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The senior ranks of Bankers Trust have been badly divided in
recent months both because of the heavy trading losses the bank
suffered in Russia and other emerging markets and by disagreement
about how the bank was managing its risky junk bond business. Much
of the ill will growing from these problems has been directed
internally at Newman, even though the economic downturn overseas
affected a broad array of financial services companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust has also struggled to integrate the Baltimore
brokerage firm Alex. Brown into its ranks. It acquired Alex. Brown
last year, but a number of senior executives left the firm over
concerns about how it was being managed, and the unit has
continuing morale problems.
</P>
<P>
   If Newman faces a challenge in carving out a role for himself as
a co-director of Deutsche's new investment banking unit, he can
still play a valuable role helping to overcome regulatory hurdles
in Washington. Newman, a former Treasury Department official, is
well connected in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche is likely to face tough regulatory scrutiny about some
of its industrial and financial holdings in Germany, as well as its
involvement with the Nazi regime during World War II and its
handling of bank accounts owned by Jewish depositors.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche plans to pay cash for Bankers Trust, and executives
involved in the merger talks said that Deutsche would raise that
money through a mixture of new stock and bond offerings.
</P>
<P>
   While it is still unclear how many layoffs will accompany the
acquisition, executives involved in the transaction said cuts will
fall most heavily on administrative staff in Europe and the United
States as well as managers and employees in the fixed-income and
equities businesses. The two banks jointly employ about 9,000
people in Britain, where a sizeable number of layoffs are likely to
occur, and have overlapping investment banking operations in New
York, another likely target of cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   If Deutsche's acquisition of Bankers Trust is completed, it
would be the biggest purchase of an American financial services
firm by a foreign company and would create the largest financial
services firm in the world, with about $850 billion in assets.

KEY REPUBLICAN LEADER PREDICTS HOUSE WILL IMPEACH CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chief Republican vote counter in the House
accused President Clinton on Sunday of trying to evade perjury
charges ``on a technicality,'' and became the first member of the
Republican leadership to predict that the House would impeach the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, criticized
Clinton's formal responses on Friday to 81 questions submitted by
the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, the president is trying to redefine what sexual
relations are, he's trying to use legalese and lawyerese to do
two-steps around the questions and try to get off on a
technicality,'' DeLay said on the CNN program ``Late Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, whose ability to keep tabs on Republican votes in the
House is widely respected by both parties, cautioned that he had
not taken a formal head count on impeachment. But he indicated that
his experience told him that the House would follow the
recommendations of the Judiciary Committee, which is expected to
approve, along party lines, at least one charge of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the House will uphold the rule of law and
impeach the president and send the case to the Senate,'' said
DeLay, who is the third-ranking Republican in the House.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's unusual forecast came as an outspoken Republican on the
Judiciary Committee, one who has implored the White House for a way
to avoid impeachment, also voiced anger over Clinton's answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still dancing on the head of a pin,'' Rep. Lindsey Graham
of South Carolina said. ``Right now, to me, he is an unrepentant
perjurer who should lose his job unless he changes his tone with
the American people and reconciles himself with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tersely worded replies, repeating earlier denials that
he had lied under oath or had urged others to do so, seem to have
hardened the partisan views of Republican and Democratic committee
members, and given no new information to other lawmakers who are
anxious to hear the president's side of the story before making up
their minds on how to vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those Americans who expected this to end up like Perry
Mason, where you have someone confessing, I think they're going to
be disappointed,'' Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., a member of the
Judiciary Committee who favors impeachment, said on the NBC program
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's responses, which his lawyer, David Kendall, said on
Friday would be augmented soon by ``a further memorandum on behalf
of the president,'' may complicate efforts by the White House and
congressional Democrats to resolve the matter by censuring the
president, rather than impeaching him.
</P>
<P>
   At least 100 Republicans would oppose a censure because it is
unconstitutional, insufficient or a bad precedent, Republican aides
say. ``This censure idea, without an admission on the president's
part, is a political cop-out,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Many liberal Democrats object to a strongly worded rebuke,
although House Democratic leaders who favor a censure to shield
them from Republican criticism that they are being too lenient are
confident they would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   It would take 218 votes to impeach or censure Clinton. The
House, where terms expire on Jan. 3, now has 228 Republicans, 206
Democrats and one independent who usually votes with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's vote-counting prowess is well-regarded. But Republican
leaders, including DeLay, have said that any lawmaker's vote on
impeachment will be a vote of conscience, and they will not conduct
formal head counts in advance, as is customary on most close votes.
That makes vote estimates even more fluid than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides outside the committee estimate that 15 to 20
Republicans will defect, even on the perjury count, which among the
three possible counts stands the best chance of passing. That means
five to 10 Democrats would have to vote for impeachment for it to
pass. The two other counts the Judiciary Committee is drawing up
are obstruction of justice and witness tampering, and abuse of
power.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King of New York, one of five Republicans who
publicly oppose impeachment, agreed Sunday with the estimates of
possible Republican defectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people like myself who don't believe it rises to an
impeachable offense and don't want to leave as our legacy that
perjury from an underlying civil case warrants the removal of a
president from office,'' King said on ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, if we are going to push this impeachment issue and lose,
I think it's going to hurt us going into the next session,'' King
said. ``It's going to make it harder to get our agenda across, to
get it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the vote tallies, DeLay said he valued King's
``opinions, but I don't respect his ability to count votes. I don't
know of 20 Republicans who would vote against impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has a strong motivation to enhance the perception that the
House might narrowly vote to impeach Clinton. The Texan is a
leading opponent of censure, fearing, in part, that if such an
alternative were offered, it would drain away undecided votes for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of world would this be, what kind of country would
this be if we have decided that lying to the American people,
committing perjury, is not impeachable?'' DeLay said. ``If that's
not impeachable, I don't know what is.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a raging debate among Democrats and Republicans
over whether Clinton did, in fact, commit perjury, and, if so,
whether it is an impeachable offense. Many Democrats are angry that
Republicans would seek to impeach Clinton without calling Monica
Lewinsky as a witness, although Democrats themselves have not
called Ms. Lewinsky in the interests of being able to both chide
the Republicans and urge that the inquiry end quickly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton and his lawyers have based their arguments that he did
not commit perjury on a narrow definition of sexual relations used
in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In drafting an article of impeachment on perjury, Republican
committee aides would face the delicate issue of deciding how much
of Clinton's sexual dalliance with Ms. Lewinsky they had to
describe.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on Sunday repeated that defense without going into the
graphic specifics. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said on ``Meet
the Press'': ``We don't have the basic grounds for perjury. What we
have is somebody's guess, because perjury has defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans disagreed. ``He lied,'' said Bryant, a
former federal prosecutor. ``He has committed perjury when he
failed to tell the entire truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats and Republicans who concur that Clinton lied
under oath say that is not grave enough to impeach him. ``I believe
it's perjury, I believe it's illegal,'' King said. ``I just don't
believe it's a high crime such as defined by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Paul McHale of Pennsylvania, one of the president's most
outspoken Democratic critics in the House, said on ``Meet the
Press'': ``I do believe that he engaged in perjury and obstruction
of justice, and I do believe that he could be impeached. I simply
think that it's in the best interests of the nation not to impeach
him.''
</P>
<P>
   McHale last week offered a harshly worded resolution of censure
of Clinton, but so far it has drawn little reaction from Democrats
or Republicans.

ANALYSIS: SEPARATION OVER SYNERGY AT AOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If America Online followed all the advice it was getting for how
to take advantage of its pending purchase of Netscape
Communications Corp., it would merge its AOL.com Web site with
Netscape's Netcenter Web site, it would use Netscape's browser on
its online service, and every time someone used the Netscape
Communicator program to check for messages, it wuld chirp,
``You've got mail.''
</P>
<P>
   But America Online defiantly puts separation above synergy and
would rather own multiple, if somewhat competitive, offerings than
create one big homogeneous master brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at things like a media company rather than as a
technology company,'' said Barry Schuler, president of America
Online's main programming division. ``Why does Time Warner have
both HBO and Cinemax? Because the audience segments in attitude and
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   And thus rather than blur the lines between the America Online
services and those of Netscape, Schuler said his company would more
crisply delineate the Netscape brand to appeal to more
technologically sophisticated users.
</P>
<P>
   This is a very different approach than that taken by most online
companies. Microsoft Corp., for example, recently tied together all
of its far-flung Internet activities under the MSN brand. But
America Online's driving force these days is its president, Robert
Pittman, who as one of the creators of MTV concocted a second music
channel, VH1, to appeal to an older audience, and then started
Nickelodeon to appeal to children.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman is fond of saying that while Pepsi may beat Coca-Cola in
taste tests, ``In America, brands win.'' As a result, America
Online has maintained the separate identities of its other
acquisitions: Compuserve, another online service, and Mirabilis,
the provider of the ICQ chat service, popular among technologically
hip youth worldwide. Users of these services see nary a mention of
the America Online name.
</P>
<P>
   Some think that all this talk of market segments leads to a
confusing overlap of products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the consumer would be better served if they put all
their wood behind a single brand, be it Netscape, ICQ or AOL,''
said George Bell, chief executive of Excite, which bought the
Webcrawler search service from America Online and kept it as a
separate portal, a strategy Bell now thinks was flawed. ``It's
really hard to manage not only the multiple businesses you buy but
the multiple consumer propositions you keep alive through all those
brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, America Online argues it must make changes gingerly,
because many of its core users find the whole cyberworld baffling
and cannot tell the difference between a browser, an online service
and a hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   This confusion has been a factor in America Online's phenomenal
success. Once a user puts one of its ubiquitous disks into a
computer, it automatically installs the software, sets up the modem
to dial into the network and handles everything from e-mail to
Internet browsing to finding sports scores in one seamless
environment. America Online says it will not add any features from
Netscape that will make the service more confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need Netscape to revitalize the AOL brand,'' said
Paul Noglows, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, the California
investment bank. ``It is continuing to grow and gain momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, of course, is most known for pushing the technology in
just one piece of that puzzle: browsing. Netscape's browser
software, known as Navigator, is the window through which users can
view pages on the World Wide Web. But Netscape does not offer a
connection to the Internet; that has to be arranged either through
an Internet service provider or a corporate network.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, until recently, did it provide any information or content.
The company's Web site, called Netcenter, was an attempt earlier
this year to build a new advertising-supported business when it was
forced by competition from Microsoft to start giving Navigator away
free. Navigator, a Web guide or ``portal'' service modeled after
Yahoo, lures its audience because it is the first screen that many
Navigator users see when they start to surf.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape's browser and its Web site do bring to America Online
several audience groups that are underrepresented in its main
service. For example, America Online is very strong among
teen-agers, who use it to chat among their friends, and among older
adults, who like its simplicity. But Netscape has much greater
penetration among college students, who often are given its browser
as part of their school networks.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, America Online wants to create a new online service
based on the Netscape browser that it hopes it would especially
appeal to recent college graduates who need to arrange for online
access after losing their accounts at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think these people are never going to get excited about the
AOL brand, but they do have an affinity for the Netscape brand,''
Schuler said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this risks offending some of the independent Internet
service providers who distribute Netscape's browser. But then
again, their only alternative is Internet Explorer by Microsoft,
which runs its own MSN Internet access service.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, America Online says it will continue to use Microsoft
Internet Explorer itself in its main online service. The reason is
that in return, Microsoft includes a copy of America Online's
software in every copy of the Windows software package, saving the
company hundreds of millions of dollars a year in mailing out
disks. That deal does not give Microsoft much more than bragging
rights, though, because the version of Internet Explorer that
America Online uses is so well integrated into its own software
that most users do not know when it is running. Moreover, it does
not contain any of the links to Microsoft's MSN online service that
are in other copies of Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, America Online does not plan to merge the Netcenter
site with its own huge AOL.com site. Netcenter's main audience is
one of America Online's weakest groups: people who use the Internet
during the day at their offices. The company had hoped that daytime
users would use its Internet site, AOL.com, as a portal instead of
Yahoo. But AOL.com does not appeal to that audience because it is
mainly a friendly and colorful site that was designed to be used by
people on America Online's proprietary services as their first step
onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Netcenter, by contrast, has a more businesslike tone. And
Netscape has been developing a series of services that combine its
software and Web site to appeal to professionals. For example, it
will let you move a copy of your file of personal contacts from
Netscape's Communicator program, onto its Web site, so that you can
look up a phone number from the road (assuming you have the right
password). America Online does plan to link Netscape gingerly to
its other brands. It will place a button to download Navigator on
the software program ICQ chat service users must run in order to
send and receive instant messages.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 10 million active users of the ICQ chat
service. America Online is working on ways to put more features on
that program that will drive ICQ users to advertising-supported Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some link as well with Compuserve, when its new
software is introduced at the end of the year. That will lower
costs by running Compuserve's service using America Online's vast
computer network behind the scenes and pave the way for a marketing
blitz that emphasizes Compuserve's traditional appeal as a more
sober, professional, less entertainment-oriented service than
America Online itself. Now the company has to decide whether to
risk a potential delay in the product introduction to replace
Internet Explorer with Netscape Navigator in the Compuserve
software.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect any chipper voices talking about the arrival of
e-mail.

ANAHUAC JOURNAL: IN A SMALL TEXAS TOWN, AN ALLIGATOR OBSESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)  (js) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHUAC, Texas _ By the time Mark Porter is finished carving up
one of his gators, there's nothing left but the fat and the guts,
and if anyone can come up with a way to sell those he'd be eager to
hear about it.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, an East Texas refinery worker and part-time swamp rat,
has 3,100 alligators at the moment swishing around ominously in the
dark, vaporous, mosquito-filled building behind his bayou-side
home.
</P>
<P>
   Standing there in his rubber boots, gunky blue jeans, Great
Texas Alligator Round-up T-shirt and a cap reading ``Porter's Gator
Processing &AMP; Gator Farm,'' Porter, 44, is at one end of a food
chain that extends from these soggy Gulf Coast flats into gourmet
food shops and high-end restaurants around the world. On top of
that, the highly prized skins are sent to Italy and Singapore to be
turned into everything from boots to purses to motorcycle seats.
</P>
<P>
   He pretty much learned the business as he went along, beginning
five years ago when he had an epiphany at the annual Gator
Round-up. All the hunters, including him, were pulling their
prehistoric monsters out of the dank bayous and selling them to
processors from nearby Louisiana, the epicenter of the U.S.
gator-processing industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, hey, there must be some money to be made if these
guys are driving all the way over from Louisiana,'' Porter said. He
visited a few alligator farms, tried to drink in the details of how
it was done and started up from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   When he noticed that refrigerated air seemed to kill the
animals, he would pile them up in his walk-in refrigerator and skin
them when they stopped moving. Only later did he realize that they
were not dead, but dormant, and he was skinning them alive. ``Now
we just hit them on the head with a baseball bat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of only five alligator farmers in Texas, compared with
dozens in Louisiana, including some with as many as 100,000 gators.
His farm is small, but he contemplates adding new buildings and
gradually increasing his stock to 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Porter has only one full-time worker, though he
can usually hire a dozen oystermen to help during the September
hunting season when he processes not only his own farm-raised
gators but the bigger ones brought in by hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Anahuac, a town of slightly under 2,000 not far from where the
perennially flooding Trinity River seeps into Galveston Bay, has a
bit of a gator fetish. There's a Gator Motel and a Gator Bar, with
a big, grinning ``Gator Love'' mural on its roadside face, and the
annual Gatorfest is held not far away near a gator-filled national
wildlife refuge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I should warn you,'' Porter said while pausing at the
door to his gator building. ``There may be a little odor in here.
And mosquitoes.'' An embracing fog of rot and reptile reached out
of the darkness and pulled him inside, where hissing mosquitoes
appeared like mud flecks on every inch of exposed skin.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of angry eyes peered up from a tangle of tails in one of
the dark ponds. ``I'm fixing to hammer these guys right after
Christmas,'' Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup de grace, Porter takes the bodies to his workshop
and chills them overnight. ``Makes it easier to skin,'' he said.
Then, they are stretched across a skinning table and he goes to
work with knives, skinning even a big gator in under 15 minutes.
``The meat goes one way and the skins goes the other,'' he said.
Even the heads are saved now, boiled and shellacked and sold as
ornaments in the United States and around the world. He recently
found a new market in Japan and China for the gall bladders, green
and slimy, which are sunk in a glass of cognac and swallowed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It's humid, hot and dark inside the building that holds Porter's
gator ponds. He keeps it hot because the gators like it hot and
dark, stopping them from glowering at one another and picking
fights. For Porter, there's nothing worse than a chipped hide.
</P>
<P>
   When he first started, leather was his only business. ``We just
tossed the meat away,'' he said. But a steadily growing market for
alligator meat, in the United States and around the world, led him
to invest in freezers and go into the food business.
</P>
<P>
   Meat from farm-raised gators, which are younger and haven't been
out in the swamp eating rotten, dead things, is more highly prized.
The underside of the tail provides the sweetest meat, though Asian
chefs have begun buying the four legs whole, with the bone in, like
baby dinosaur drumsticks. ``You put one on a plate and it looks
like the biggest frog leg you've ever seen,'' Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   He sells his meat for about $5 a pound. The gall bladders are $2
a piece, cognac not included.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Perez, who runs the Butcher Shoppe in Houston's tony
western suburbs, said he sold 25 pounds to 30 pounds of alligator
meat every month for $12.99 a pound; boneless alligator sirloin,
long strips of tail meat, even alligator sausage. Most of his
customers have tasted alligator at a restaurant, liked it, and want
to try cooking it. ``It's not something everybody eats every day,
but it's starting to get popular,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Porter prefers to simply grill the meat or roll it in pancake
mix (``the raw powder, not the batter'') and deep fry it in peanut
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Walker, the executive chef at Brennan's Restaurant on the
edge of downtown Houston, takes a grander approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I've cooked it, I generally cut it into scallops and
pound that out to tenderize it and then you can pan saute it or top
it with anything,'' Walker said. ``You might top it with crawfish
and crabmeat or a Creole meuniere sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter said the standard response to the inevitable question is:
kind of like chicken. But there's a fishy taste, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really like chicken,'' Walker said. ``I don't know
that I have anything to really compare it to. I don't know if you
would say like turtle meat. I guess is just tastes like
alligator.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the scattered cities of Niger, they have talk radio of a
different kind. It's more like walk-in radio. On Saturday and
Sunday mornings, farmers and merchants and homemakers gather
outside the independent stations run by Radio Anfani in Niamey,
Maradi and Zinder to await the start of a two-hour program.
</P>
<P>
   They want to talk about their children's health or the price of
tomatoes or the latest decree of the military government of Ibrahim
Bare Mainassara. They want to talk about some of the news broadcast
by Radio Anfani, like reports translated from Voice of America or
the German service Deutsche Welle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take telephone callers and put them on the air,''
explained Gremah Boucar, director general of Radio Anfani. Those
who own telephones, he explained, are automatically considered
rich, and ``it shouldn't be such a small circle'' of people doing
the talking.
</P>
<P>
   For a fee equivalent to about $1 a year _ not so small in a
country where per capita share of the gross domestic product is
$200 a year _ listeners can join Radio Anfani's club, which has
36,000 members. Membership lets them talk to listeners and suggest
programming changes or otherwise object to the material the
stations broadcast. ``The only way to really be free is to accept
criticism,'' Boucar said.
</P>
<P>
   In Niger, a landlocked country of 10 million people without Don
Imus, Rush Limbaugh, Howard Stern, Arbitron ratings or democracy,
radio is a truly intimate medium. When people want to talk, they
walk in and talk. When the military _ sorry, maybe it was just
people in stolen military uniforms _ wants to close down a station,
it storms in and smashes the equipment. When people who control the
military or police want to lodge a complaint about his news
broadcasts, they take Gremah Boucar from home, stuff him in a bag,
throw him on a flatbed truck and spend hours discussing how to kill
him.
</P>
<P>
   Boucar, a 39-year-old who saw a journalist for the first time
when Niger's president came to his village of Maine-Soroa 30 years
ago, is about as distant from New York's and Washington's brand of
journalism as possible. His country is remote and obscure, often
confused with its richer and more populous neighbor, Nigeria. His
medium is radio. In the archipelago of settled communities in
Africa, it is more ubiquitous and influential than any newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He and his editorial committee create their 20-hour-a-day
schedule with a practical eye. They produce programs on health
(ways to prevent AIDS or diarrheal illness in infants), the economy
(the price of food) and politics (including pronouncements of
Mainassara's political opponents).
</P>
<P>
   Boucar's attitude toward his profession carries none of the
overt cynicism about the business that tends to permeate
discussions in this country. ``It seems to me that journalism goes
with democracy,'' he said. To practice journalism, therefore, is to
give life to democracy. ``My moral obligation,'' he calls it.
</P>
<P>
   Such earnest simplicity can veer into the dreaded realm of
platitude. But that is a risk the Committee to Protect Journalists
is willing to take when it gives out its International Press
Freedom awards. At its annual dinner last week, the group honored
Boucar and four other journalists, from Indonesia, Peru, Belarus
and Eritrea, who have been persecuted, arrested, tried and
otherwise hindered by governments that have little history of _ or
tolerance for _ a free press.
</P>
<P>
   It was an occasion for some of the profession's most
accomplished or just plain famous members to take a quick refresher
course in the underpinnings of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, like any occasion that mixes professional pride with
expensive food, tuxedos and celebrity, it had its Tom Wolfish
moments. (What to do? Listen to Boucar's paean to democracy and a
free press, or try to spot the actress Sharon Stone?)
</P>
<P>
   Still, celebrity watching and financial prodding aside, the
persecuted foreign journalists and their pampered domestic
counterparts have something to offer each other. When Boucar was
arrested, the outcry of groups like the Committee to Protect
Journalists, and the accompanying protests by American diplomats,
helped free him, or so he tells it. When Anna Zarkova, a Bulgarian
journalist who covers her country's mafia, had acid thrown on her
face, blinding one eye, as she walked down a Sofia street six
months ago, it was the material and psychic support of groups like
Committee to Protect Journalists and the International Women's
Media Foundation that helped lift her from a profound depression,
or so she told friends.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Boucar offers a reminder that simple news broadcasts
and open-mike programs and a willingness to reflect diverse
political viewpoints can be a precious commodity in countries where
the life expectancy of a person is less than 50 years and the life
expectancy of a democracy is less than three.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 20 years, the event ``still maintains its power,''
said Gene Roberts, the committee's chairman and a former managing
editor of The New York Times. ``If anything, it seems to increase
each year. The dinner always runs an hour and a half too long.
There's only one way to make it stay within space limitations _
severely limit the time that the awardees have.'' That, the group
is unwilling to do _ it would be like editing the apostles.

 &HT;    Bowl schedule to shed light on shady season
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A college football season that has been filled with
speculation, conjecture, and more than a little hyperbole will
finally get some clarity come Saturday with three games that will
set the table for the post-season banquet.
</P>
<P>
   One of those three will be here in Atlanta, where No. 1
Tennessee (11-0) meets No. 23 Mississippi State (8-3) in the SEC
championship game at the Georgia Dome (8 p.m., ABC).
</P>
<P>
   For Tennessee, the SEC East champion, the situation is pretty
simple. A win over Mississippi State not only gives the Vols their
second straight SEC championship, but also a trip to the Fiesta
Bowl where they would get a shot at their first national
championship since 1951.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've reached a number of our goals already but this is a
special team that has a chance to do some special things,'' said
Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer, whose team remained No. 1 in the
Associated Press poll on Sunday and closed the gap on No. 1 Kansas
State in the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll. Tennessee is No. 2 in
that poll by only three points.
</P>
<P>
   But who will Tennessee play if the Vols gets to the Fiesta Bowl?
Right now it's too close to call. No. 2 Kansas State meets No. 10
Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12 championship game while UCLA travels to
Miami (2 p.m., ESPN) in a game that was postponned on Sept. 26 due
to Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Should both teams win, the early projections have UCLA just
barely edging out Kansas State for No. 2 in the BCS Standings, a
computer formula which determines the two teams that will play in
the Fiesta Bowl for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary at Atlanta Touchdown Club
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary will be the featured speaked
at today's meeting of the Atlanta Touchdown Club, set for the Cobb
Galleria Centre. This will be the last meeting of the 1998 season.
Lunch will be served at noon followed by remarks from O'Leary.
Tickets are available to the public. For more information call
(770) 953-3200.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting
</P>
<P>
   _ Iowa athletics director Bob Bowlsby and former Hawkeyes coach
Hayden Fry will reportedly travel to Gainesville, Fla., this week
to offer the school's head coaching job to Bobby Stoops, the
Gators' defensive coordinator. Stoops, however, is still in the
hunt for the Oklahoma job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tulane coach Tommy Bowden said he will make a decision on his
future ``by the middle of the week.'' Bowden interviewed with
Clemson on Friday and South Carolina on Saturday. Tulane has
promised a raise, a new practice facility, and an easing of
academic standards if he'll stay.
</P>
<P>
   _ In addition to Bowden, South Carolina has talked to Virginia
Tech's Frank Beamer. Athletics director Mike McGee asked for
permission to talke to Miami's Butch Davis. But Davis has a $1
million buyout clause if he goes to another college.

 &HT;    Anderson cranks up for another career high against Rams
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Maybe it's the helmets, the insignia depicting a
ram's horns, that charge up Jamal Anderson to be more forceful when
he faces St. Louis. Maybe it's the challenge of pounding a team
that refuses to bow to his aggressive approach. Or maybe, as
Anderson suggests, it's just plain luck.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Falcons' star running back beat up on the Rams
again, this time going for a career-high 188 yards on 31 carries in
Atlanta's 21-10 victory Sunday. This comes after establishing a
career high against St. Louis a month ago with 172 yards at the
Georgia Dome. That came after a career-high 162 yards against St.
Louis last year. Anyone sensing a pattern here?
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I don't know what it is,'' Anderson said about his
success against the Rams. ``I can't say we're destroying them,
because we're not. They're playing hard. I can't say what it is
because I don't know. I guess I've just been lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone once said, ''You make your own luck,'' and that's
certainly true in the case of Anderson. Although ''nowhere near 100
percent healthy,'' he continues to lead the Falcons' ground attack
with grit and determination and a sore left ankle, among other
aches and pains.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's getting awful good at it,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ''He
got 188 yards _ not doing it 100 perdent _ which is incredible.
He's banged up, but he keeps playing, keeps working.''
</P>
<P>
   It had to be frightening for the Rams that Anderson took the
first play from scrimmage and rambled 25 yards. Especially since
the St. Louis players vowed to stop him, no matter who was the
Falcons' quarterback Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all the stuff they said about stopping me, it's great to
go out and have success like that,'' Anderson said. ''But the real
credit goes to the offensive line, Bob Christian and O.J. Santiago.
Those guys create the holes for me to run through. I expect that of
them and they expect me to get through them.''
</P>
<P>
   The line created a gap so wide with 3:13 to play that Anderson
could have done his ''Dirty Bird'' dance through the lane and still
scored from 27 yards. As it was, he saved the routine for the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We caught them in blitzes a couple of times,'' Anderson said.
''Once or twice they caught me. But when they blitz and you break
free, there's no one there.''
</P>
<P>
   When there has been someone there, Anderson usually attempts to
go straight through him. Part of this is his physical style. And
it's also because his ankle injury sometimes limits his ability to
make sharp cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then,'' he said, ''you just run over him.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Anderson said he learned to reach goals, not
set them. He's on pace to set a franchise record for single-season
rushing with 1,768 yards. ''Last year, I got caught up in the hype
of getting 1,300, 1,400 yards and I barely got 1,000,'' he said.
''Now, I'm just playing my game. I want to make things happen when
Dan gives me the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled and winked. ''And I've been making things happen,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Ga. Tech coach goes for subtle celebration
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary cringed when a
reporter asked him following the Yellow Jackets' 21-19 win over
Georgia Saturday if he had snatched up his own piece of Sanford
Stadium's famed hedges.
</P>
<P>
   While he enjoyed watching his players take in the win over
Georgia that broke a streak of seven losses, his own celebration
was much more subtle. The way he explained it Sunday was that
coaches go into games expecting to win and shouldn't make a big
deal out of getting one.
</P>
<P>
   After the most gratifying win of his head coaching career,
though, O'Leary knew this one was special.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were only two (regular opponents) we hadn't beaten,''
said O'Leary, now 27-21 in his fourth full season and headed to the
Gator Bowl on his second consecutive bowl trip and first on New
Year's Day. ``Florida State is the only one left now.''
</P>
<P>
   He also knows what the win meant for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question we got the rivalry back in the game,'' O'Leary
said. ``Good win for Tech; tough loss for Georgia...It's good for
the state, the fans, the kids. That catapults into your
offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets will take the next two weeks off from practice for
final exams, with their only football responsibility lifting
weights twice a week. They'll reconvene Dec. 15 for a team meeting
and start practice for the Gator Bowl Dec. 16. Tech will practice
through Dec. 22 then take off through the Christmas holiday. The
team will report to Jacksonville on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, O'Leary has a couple of business matters to resolve _
his contract status and the status of injured senior Charles Wiley.
With Auburn's hiring of Tommy Tuberville, emphasis shifts to the
possibilities of signing O'Leary to a new contract at Tech.
</P>
<P>
   For now, O'Leary plans to leave that in the hands of his lawyer,
Jack Reale. ``My lawyer's dealing with that situation now,''
O'Leary said. ``I'm out of it. And that's the way it should be.''
O'Leary plans to meet today with Wiley, who has missed most of the
season with a knee injury, to talk about his future. O'Leary had
thought he had to wait until Wiley's eligibility was exhausted
before applying to the NCAA for a medical redshirt and a sixth year
of eligibility but learned that may not be true when he saw a
report that Wake Forest linebacker Kelvin Moses had already been
granted a medical redshirt for this season.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley, who is on track to graduate in June, has yet to say if he
will return next season if he's given the chance.

 &HT;    Rams raze Graziani
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Under the lights of the Trans World Dome and the
weight of his first start this season, Tony Graziani insists he did
not succumb to stage fright. Rather, it was rust. Apparently, a lot
of it.
</P>
<P>
   With starting quarterback Chris Chandler unable to play because
of a badly sprained right ankle, coach Dan Reeves elected to start
the 24-year-old Graziani over Steve DeBerg, 20 years his senior, in
part because of the youngster's ability to avoid an aggressive pass
rush. And for the most part, Graziani did just that.
</P>
<P>
   However, much more goes into being a quality quarterback in the
NFL, and it was evident that Graziani remains in the learning
stage. His numbers were not awful: 8 for 18, 102 yards, one
interception. But they were not enough for Reeves to allow him to
continue beyond the first half.
</P>
<P>
   And so, although leading 3-0 at the break, Reeves benched the
babe and called on the sage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach told me to stay ready, to keep my head up,'' Graziani
said. ``And I did. It would have been difficult to do if we were
losing. But Steve did a great job and we're 10-2. How can I not be
happy?''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was not happy with Graziani's inability to convert on
third-down plays that would have extended drives. On the first
drive of the game, he missed wildly on a throw in the end zone to
Todd Kinchen, who had sprung free. Atlanta settled for a Morten
Andersen 42-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The next time with the ball, Graziani threw behind an open Tim
Dwight on third-and-2 from midfield, forcing a punt. After that,
Graziani failed to find a receiver on third-and-6 and ran for one
yard. Another punt.
</P>
<P>
   On his fourth drive, on third-and-10, Graziani's pass to Jamal
Anderson was almost intercepted by Keith Lyle. Punt again, from the
Falcons' 17.
</P>
<P>
   During the Falcons next possession, Graziani missed on
third-and-4 and then didn't convert on third-and-6.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after moving the team to the Rams' 33, Graziani sealed
his fate on the bench. On first down, the lefty QB rolled to his
right and forced a pass across his body. No Falcon was within 12
yards of the ball. Lyle intercepted it, ending a scoring
opportunity _ and Graziani's day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't nervous. I felt ready. But I was a little rusty,'' he
said. ``It was tough. I didn't get into a rhythm. We moved the ball
well on that first drive and should have scored. And I accept
responsibility that we didn't. But it's a learning process. On that
interception, I forgot the rule that the corners can hit receivers
when the quarterback is out of the pocket. Timmy (Dwight) got hit
pretty good and the ball was just out there. But it's only my
second (NFL) start. It was better than the last time. Hopefully,
the next time will be better.''
</P>
<P>
   When that next time will be is uncertain. If Chandler can't go
next Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts, DeBerg _ after a
credible peformance Sunday _ certainly will start. ``But Tony's
gritty and all he needs, really, is experience,'' DeBerg said.

 &HT;    Dogs should get Penn State, Outback
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ If there's any solace for Georgia following its
first loss to Georgia Tech since 1990, it's that Saturday's 21-19
defeat probably didn't alter the Bulldogs' postseason bowl
destination.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, who fell to No. 19 in both the Associated Press
and USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, appear headed for Tampa's Outback
Bowl for the second year in a row. Georgia (8-3, 6-2) will probably
play No. 20 Penn State, which defeated Michigan State 51-28 in its
regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've heard, I don't think it's going to hurt our
bowl chances that much,'' defensive lineman Paul Snellings said.
``We're still going to a bowl game in Florida, so we're not going
to let (the loss) hurt our season too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Georgia's first loss to the Yellow Jackets in eight years
removed a lot of the luster of a successful season. The Bulldogs
blew a 19-7 lead in the fourth quarter, after their offense failed
to gain a first down in the final 15 minutes. Georgia's defense
played well, but failed to stop Tech when it had to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do anything to stop them and we didn't make any
plays on offense to get some first downs and give our defense a
breath,'' coach Jim Donnan said. ``I think the execution wasn't
there because we had a different center and a different guard. We
tried to play around what gave us the best chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs wasted another solid performance from running back
Olandis Gary, who gained 95 yards on 18 carries, with one
touchdown. Senior tight end Larry Brown had three catches for 106
yards, including a 68-yard pass from wideout Michael Greer on the
fourth play from scrimmage. Quarterback Quincy Carter completed 13
of 24 passes for 206 yards, but was just 3-of-7 for 19 yards in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Georgia surrendered 241 rushing yards, its highest
total of the season. Tech gained 133 of its 411 yards in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot left for this team and our future looks good,''
Donnan said. ``I'm proud of our team and I'm proud of our season.
It's not as good of a year as it could have been, but it could have
been a lot worse.

DARK CLOUD'S SILVER LINING FOR TV SCHEDULE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two months ago the Bruins complained that
rescheduling Miami would disrupt their recruiting, spoil their
Thanksgiving vacation and postpone their postseason banquet.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Hurricane Bowl just might get them into the Fiesta Bowl.
How about a game ball for Georges?
</P>
<P>
   If not for the devastating hurricane, which passed south of
Miami but hammered the Florida Keys, the Bruins would have played
Miami on Sept. 26 and completed their season against USC nine days
ago. They'd be home Dec. 5, watching Tennessee and Kansas State
play big games on national television _ an ideal chance to impress
voters and gain computer points.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the cancellation, UCLA will share the spotlight
with its competitors on Championship Saturday. Yes, Miami's 66-13
loss at Syracuse might have sapped some of the appeal from the
Hurricane Bowl. But in football as in politics, equal time is
essential in swaying voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got mixed emotions,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``If we
had played earlier, it might have been to our advantage because
they're starting to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'd have been on the back burner. Now with (the Big 12
and Southeastern) conference championship games and us playing
Miami, it's Championship Saturday. We'll all be visible to viewers.
That's definitely in our favor.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Speaking of Georges: Days before the storm reached the Keys,
Puerto Rico took a direct hit from which the island has not
recovered. According to a story in the Nov. 25 edition of the San
Juan Star, almost 4,000 people are being housed in shelters across
the island, and another 49,000 lack water services.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Edmonston, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, told the Star that Puerto Rico is passing from the
``response'' to the ``recovery'' phase.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's basketball team participated in the three-day Puerto Rico
Shootout over Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   __ BCS update: The Bruins are expected to maintain their No. 2
ranking when the latest Bowl Championship Series poll is released
today. They led No. 3 Kansas State by 1.24 points last week.
</P>
<P>
   The final BCS poll will be released Sunday at approximately 10
a.m. The top teams will play for the national title Jan. 4 in the
Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   A significant discrepancy in victory margin on Championship
Saturday _ UCLA at Miami, Kansas State vs. Texas A&AMP;M and Tennessee
vs. Mississippi State _ could affect the final rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many points do you have to win by? That's crazy,'' Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sagarin Ratings in USA Today give victory margin little
weight, as BCS officials learned when they asked Jeff Sagarin to
compute a Kansas State victory over Baylor with varying scores.
</P>
<P>
   After its 49-6 victory last month, Kansas State was No. 1 in
Sagarin's poll with a 105.71 rating. When Sagarin ran the numbers
on a hypothetical 42-6 win, Kansas State's rating dropped to
105.49. A 35-6 victory lowered its rating to 105.11, and a 28-6
victory reduced it to 104.87.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a 21-point difference in victory margin altered
Kansas State's rating by a mere 0.84.
</P>
<P>
   __ Roster move: Freshman center Jeff Wright, a Covina native,
has quit the team and is expected to transfer to Cal State
Fullerton to pursue his career in law enforcement.

SMALL INVESTOR MAKES BROKERAGE PAY FOR ERRORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``f'' financial news file.) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In the spring of 1995, David A. Smith received a
cold call from a broker telling him about a great stock. Little did
Smith know how costly that phone call would be.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old recent college graduate from West Los Angeles
ended up losing $4,550 on the stock and countless hours trying to
get it back. That's because rather than accept his losses, Smith
fought back and in the end, won a small-claims court decision that
forced a major Wall Street brokerage to pay him back.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's saga reads like a storybook full of lessons: Beware of
unsolicited telephone sales pitches. Be persistent, especially when
you know you're right. And modern-day Davids can still slay
Goliaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going up against a giant,'' said the soft-spoken and
bespectacled Smith, whose mild manner belies his determined streak.
``When they started to manipulate and lie, I got so upset, I wanted
to fight this as much as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Bear, Stearns officials wouldn't comment on the case, instead
issuing this statement: ``Mr. Smith obtained a small claims default
judgment against Bear, Stearns in a case in which we believe we had
been improperly served and had meritorious defenses. In addition,
an identical case filed by Mr. Smith in the same court had been
previously dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's odyssey began on a seemingly innocuous note -- he opened
an account with A.S. Goldmen in New York at the urging of a
cold-calling broker in early 1995. A few months later, his broker
moved to A.R. Baron and wanted permission to continue handling his
account. Smith moved his business to A.R. Baron.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he held about $5,000 worth of Skylands Park
Management shares, a recommendation from A.S. Goldmen, and cash.
When his account started dropping, Smith ordered his broker to sell
the stock. No problem, the broker said.
</P>
<P>
   But when he tried to contact the broker soon after to confirm
the trade, he found out the broker had quit. In the meantime, A.R.
Baron employees claimed they couldn't find his account.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean you can't find it?'' Smith said to them,
incredulously. ``I have a Social Security number, I have an account
number.''
</P>
<P>
   Did A.R. Baron lose track of Smith's account? Not likely,
according to the president of an agency created by federal
legislation that pays back investors up to $500,000 in the event
their brokerage firm goes bankrupt. The agency is funded by the
securities industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want to sell his stock,'' said Michael Don,
president of the Securities Investor Protection Corp. In general,
corrupt brokers ``keep the stock price up because someone in the
firm has a big position in it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the stock reaches a certain level, the brokerage executive
will dump it and ordinary investors will be left holding the bag --
a declining stock. That's a standard con among disreputable firms,
Don said.
</P>
<P>
   In Smith's case, his stock kept dropping, but no one could sell
it because they claimed that they couldn't find his account. A.R.
Baron pledged to keep looking.
</P>
<P>
   His broker finally called him back in September 1995. He said he
had moved to another place of employment and wanted to handle
Smith's account again. Smith agreed to the plan, hoping the broker
would now find his account.
</P>
<P>
   But his broker vanished again, having left his new employer.
Smith contacted the National Association of Securities Dealers,
which couldn't find the broker since he had left his last job.
Smith wrote the New York Attorney General's Office to find the
broker's address and phone number. What he got back was
confirmation of his broker's transient nature: He had held 11 jobs
in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't just small unknown firms either. Among his
employers were Dean Witter, D.H. Blair, Shearson Lehman Bros. and
Prudential-Bache. One Century City firm he worked for was The
Boston Group, underwriter of the initial public offering of Studio
City, Calif.-based Jerry's Famous Deli, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1996, a representative of A.R. Baron told Smith
he had found Smith's account, not in an overlooked computer
database but in a stack of files. The bad news: The $5,000 account
was now worth $453.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the A.R. Baron employee promised to make up the lost
money in a couple of trades. He asked Smith for more investment
money. A.R. Baron even promised to let him in on a few IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   A manager, trying to assuage Smith's concerns that their brokers
don't stay with them long, assured him that the ones they were
currently employing would be around for a long time. But Smith just
wanted his money back. He was tired of being strung around.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month, A.R. Baron filed bankruptcy. To his surprise,
his account with his remaining $453 was automatically transferred
to Bear, Stearns. Bear, Stearns did not ask for Smith's permission.
</P>
<P>
   He filed a claim with the bankruptcy trustee in charge of the
A.R. Baron case but it was rejected. The trustee wrote that since
Smith's loss came from his allegation that A.R. Baron did not
execute a trade, it was not covered under the Securities Investor
Protection Act of 1970. The SIPA gives the Securities Investor
Protection Corp. the power to pay claims.
</P>
<P>
   It was highly ironic that SIPC wouldn't insure his losses. After
all, on his account statements -- between the A.R. Baron and Bear,
Stearns names -- was the name Securities Investor Protection
Corporation. He felt protected seeing that moniker, even if he
didn't know how far the protection extended. Smith found out the
hard way that fraud is not covered.
</P>
<P>
   So Smith turned his sights on Bear, Stearns. He wanted the firm
to take responsibility for his losses since they were the clearing
agent. After all, their name was on his account statements and his
broker's solicitation letter emphasized A.R. Baron's relationship
with the Wall Street powerhouse. Smith said that lent confidence to
his dealings with A.R. Baron -- to his loss.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key points that swung the case in Smith's favor were
similarities between his account statements from A.R. Baron and
Bear, Stearns. Both even used the same account number, giving
strength to Smith's contention that A.R. Baron and Bear, Stearns
enjoyed a closer relationship than met the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bear, Stearns) takes lots of profit and lends credibility to
small firms that don't deserve that credibility,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing agents are firms that actually execute trades which
investors place with their brokers. The agent may be a subsidiary
of the firm or an outside company. Major brokerage firms, such as
Bear, Stearns, clear their own trades and also provide the service
at a fee to smaller shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very common,'' said Laurie Doherty, branch chief of
enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had a rough start in court since he was serving as his own
attorney. He had to file the case twice because he didn't list all
the defendants in the first filing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he didn't realize that the court date was on Rosh Hashana,
a Jewish holiday, until the day of the hearing. As an observant
Jew, he couldn't use the telephone that day to tell the court he
couldn't attend or to postpone the case. The judge dismissed the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Smith refiled the case. A new court date was set for early 1998
and this time, Bear, Stearns attorneys didn't show up. Smith won
the case by default.
</P>
<P>
   Bear, Stearns appealed the ruling, saying it did not know of the
new court date. In fact, in a sworn testimony, under penalty of
perjury, a top executive from Bear, Stearns' legal department said
he called Smith but they did not discuss the details of claim
against the firm or any upcoming hearing dates.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith produced telephone records showing that he called
Bear, Stearns, not the other way around, and talked with the
executive for 36 minutes in an attempt to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's mother testified at the appeal that she was listening to
her son's telephone conversation without the Bear, Stearns'
executive's knowledge. His mother, an attorney who hadn't practiced
law for years, also submitted a declaration that the executive
discussed the case with her son but didn't want to settle it. She
said the executive ended the call by saying that he would see Smith
at the hearing Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally had the upper hand,'' Smith said. ``They were
playing so dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the judge ruled against Bear, Stearns. Smith got his
$4,550.
</P>
<P>
   While it's less cumbersome to win a judgment in small claims,
and have it affirmed in Superior Court, Bear, Stearns' loss should
be a warning bell to other clearing agents, said J. Kelly Strader,
a law professor at Southwestern University who specializes in
white-collar crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They better be careful who they clear for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, A.R. Baron is no more. It was shut down by federal
regulators and the company is being liquidated, according to SEC
officials. Last December, former executives and employees pleaded
guilty to bilking investors out of $75 million from 1991 to 1996.
They lied to investors, manipulated small stocks and initial public
offerings, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities are investigating Bear, Stearns'
relationship with A.R. Baron, according to the Manhattan District
Attorney's Office. The New York U.S. Attorney's Office declined to
comment on the case.

SMALL INVESTOR MAKES BROKERAGE PAY FOR ERRORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In the spring of 1995, David A. Smith received a
cold call from a broker telling him about a great stock. Little did
Smith know how costly that phone call would be.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old recent college graduate from West Los Angeles
ended up losing $4,550 on the stock and countless hours trying to
get it back. That's because rather than accept his losses, Smith
fought back and in the end, won a small-claims court decision that
forced a major Wall Street brokerage to pay him back.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's saga reads like a storybook full of lessons: Beware of
unsolicited telephone sales pitches. Be persistent, especially when
you know you're right. And modern-day Davids can still slay
Goliaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going up against a giant,'' said the soft-spoken and
bespectacled Smith, whose mild manner belies his determined streak.
``When they started to manipulate and lie, I got so upset, I wanted
to fight this as much as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Bear, Stearns officials wouldn't comment on the case, instead
issuing this statement: ``Mr. Smith obtained a small claims default
judgment against Bear, Stearns in a case in which we believe we had
been improperly served and had meritorious defenses. In addition,
an identical case filed by Mr. Smith in the same court had been
previously dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's odyssey began on a seemingly innocuous note -- he opened
an account with A.S. Goldmen in New York at the urging of a
cold-calling broker in early 1995. A few months later, his broker
moved to A.R. Baron and wanted permission to continue handling his
account. Smith moved his business to A.R. Baron.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he held about $5,000 worth of Skylands Park
Management shares, a recommendation from A.S. Goldmen, and cash.
When his account started dropping, Smith ordered his broker to sell
the stock. No problem, the broker said.
</P>
<P>
   But when he tried to contact the broker soon after to confirm
the trade, he found out the broker had quit. In the meantime, A.R.
Baron employees claimed they couldn't find his account.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean you can't find it?'' Smith said to them,
incredulously. ``I have a Social Security number, I have an account
number.''
</P>
<P>
   Did A.R. Baron lose track of Smith's account? Not likely,
according to the president of an agency created by federal
legislation that pays back investors up to $500,000 in the event
their brokerage firm goes bankrupt. The agency is funded by the
securities industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want to sell his stock,'' said Michael Don,
president of the Securities Investor Protection Corp. In general,
corrupt brokers ``keep the stock price up because someone in the
firm has a big position in it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the stock reaches a certain level, the brokerage executive
will dump it and ordinary investors will be left holding the bag --
a declining stock. That's a standard con among disreputable firms,
Don said.
</P>
<P>
   In Smith's case, his stock kept dropping, but no one could sell
it because they claimed that they couldn't find his account. A.R.
Baron pledged to keep looking.
</P>
<P>
   His broker finally called him back in September 1995. He said he
had moved to another place of employment and wanted to handle
Smith's account again. Smith agreed to the plan, hoping the broker
would now find his account.
</P>
<P>
   But his broker vanished again, having left his new employer.
Smith contacted the National Association of Securities Dealers,
which couldn't find the broker since he had left his last job.
Smith wrote the New York Attorney General's Office to find the
broker's address and phone number. What he got back was
confirmation of his broker's transient nature: He had held 11 jobs
in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't just small unknown firms either. Among his
employers were Dean Witter, D.H. Blair, Shearson Lehman Bros. and
Prudential-Bache. One Century City firm he worked for was The
Boston Group, underwriter of the initial public offering of Studio
City, Calif.-based Jerry's Famous Deli, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1996, a representative of A.R. Baron told Smith
he had found Smith's account, not in an overlooked computer
database but in a stack of files. The bad news: The $5,000 account
was now worth $453.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the A.R. Baron employee promised to make up the lost
money in a couple of trades. He asked Smith for more investment
money. A.R. Baron even promised to let him in on a few IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   A manager, trying to assuage Smith's concerns that their brokers
don't stay with them long, assured him that the ones they were
currently employing would be around for a long time. But Smith just
wanted his money back. He was tired of being strung around.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month, A.R. Baron filed bankruptcy. To his surprise,
his account with his remaining $453 was automatically transferred
to Bear, Stearns. Bear, Stearns did not ask for Smith's permission.
</P>
<P>
   He filed a claim with the bankruptcy trustee in charge of the
A.R. Baron case but it was rejected. The trustee wrote that since
Smith's loss came from his allegation that A.R. Baron did not
execute a trade, it was not covered under the Securities Investor
Protection Act of 1970. The SIPA gives the Securities Investor
Protection Corp. the power to pay claims.
</P>
<P>
   It was highly ironic that SIPC wouldn't insure his losses. After
all, on his account statements -- between the A.R. Baron and Bear,
Stearns names -- was the name Securities Investor Protection
Corporation. He felt protected seeing that moniker, even if he
didn't know how far the protection extended. Smith found out the
hard way that fraud is not covered.
</P>
<P>
   So Smith turned his sights on Bear, Stearns. He wanted the firm
to take responsibility for his losses since they were the clearing
agent. After all, their name was on his account statements and his
broker's solicitation letter emphasized A.R. Baron's relationship
with the Wall Street powerhouse. Smith said that lent confidence to
his dealings with A.R. Baron -- to his loss.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key points that swung the case in Smith's favor were
similarities between his account statements from A.R. Baron and
Bear, Stearns. Both even used the same account number, giving
strength to Smith's contention that A.R. Baron and Bear, Stearns
enjoyed a closer relationship than met the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bear, Stearns) takes lots of profit and lends credibility to
small firms that don't deserve that credibility,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing agents are firms that actually execute trades which
investors place with their brokers. The agent may be a subsidiary
of the firm or an outside company. Major brokerage firms, such as
Bear, Stearns, clear their own trades and also provide the service
at a fee to smaller shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very common,'' said Laurie Doherty, branch chief of
enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had a rough start in court since he was serving as his own
attorney. He had to file the case twice because he didn't list all
the defendants in the first filing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he didn't realize that the court date was on Rosh Hashana,
a Jewish holiday, until the day of the hearing. As an observant
Jew, he couldn't use the telephone that day to tell the court he
couldn't attend or to postpone the case. The judge dismissed the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Smith refiled the case. A new court date was set for early 1998

</P>

   Bear, Stearns appealed the ruling, saying it did not know of the
new court date. In fact, in a sworn testimony, under penalty of

</P>
<P>
   But Smith produced telephone records showing that he called

</P>
<P>
   Smith's mother testified at the appeal that she was listening to

ANALYSIS: CHINA AND JAPAN CONFRONT WOUNDS UNHEALED FOR 60 YEARS  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Just last month, Japan had seemed to be making major
progress in laying World War II to rest, forthrightly apologizing
to South Koreans for its behavior and receiving something of an
absolution from the visiting Korean president.
</P>
<P>
   Then President Jiang Zemin of China arrived on the first visit
ever by a Chinese head of state and asked for a similar apology.
And suddenly, like a forgotten old jack-in-the-box, history leaped
out of the past to roil the present and future.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi offered Jiang the
traditional welcome gift _ a statement of ``deep remorse'' for
Japan's war-time conduct _ but Jiang wanted an actual formal
written apology. And Japan refused.
</P>
<P>
   The grim shadowboxing these days as Jiang travels around Japan
on a six-day visit, exhorting his hosts to confront their past
while he is told to pipe down, underscores the degree to which East
Asia's history dominates the present. Here, the most important
tensions are not rooted in present-day disagreements but rather in
60-year-old wounds that have never healed.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's visit, which ends Monday, has achieved progress in such
areas as youth exchanges and environmental cooperation. But instead
of easing the most important source of tensions between the two
great powers of East Asia _ the common history that divides them _
the visit seems to have backfired and left the region quarreling as
painfully as ever about responsibility for the past.
</P>
<P>
   To Chinese, Japan's reluctance to apologize formally suggests a
dark ambivalence about one of the bloodiest invasions in human
history. Many Chinese are honestly fearful of Japan's long-run
intentions, and some passionately warn Americans not to be fooled
by a Japan that they believe is itching to rise up in arms again.
Chinese are outraged when Japanese officials periodically suggest
that the Rape of Nanking _ in which Japanese troops massacred as
many as 200,000 Chinese in 1937 _ was much ado about nothing or
that Japan was not an aggressor in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Japanese, even in high positions, have distorted history
and tried to gloss over Japan's invasion of China,'' Jiang declared
Saturday. ``The Chinese people have felt hurt because of this
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   To Japanese, who often feel that half their diplomacy in Asia is
spent bowing abjectly in regret for events that occurred before
most of today's Japanese were born, Jiang's behavior has been
impolite and calculating, simply an effort to push the guilt button
and gain more concessions. Moreover, most Japanese see the most
important threat to peace in the region in the long run coming from
China, and there has been growing annoyance within Japan at the
Chinese demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this a finished problem?'' asked Hiromu Nonaka, Japan's
chief cabinet secretary and one of the country's most powerful
politicians. ``There is a school of thought that Japan has already
reflected on its past and apologized to China any number of times
already.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang was originally scheduled to visit in September, and if he
had come then the summit might have gone much more smoothly. But
then Jiang delayed the trip because of the floods at home.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea visited
Japan early last month, and the meeting went extraordinarily well.
Never had Japan apologized so graciously to a neighboring country
for war-time conduct, and never had another nation accepted the
apology with such magnanimity.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, according to a written statement of his meeting with
Kim, ``expressed remorseful repentance and heartfelt apology.'' Kim
responded that it was time to move on and called for a
``future-oriented relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jiang's visit was rescheduled, he demanded the same kind of
written apology that Kim had received. Japan refused, saying that
its maximum offer was an oral apology by Obuchi and a standard
written expression of deep remorse.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sharp distinction? The explanation is partly linguistic,
because the term that is usually translated into English as remorse
_ ``hansei'' _ is actually a bit vaguer than that. It can mean
remorse, but it can also mean self-reflection about even minor
matters. A child, for example, might be told to show ``hansei'' for
some misdemeanor, and the term is far less weighty than the various
words for apologies.
</P>
<P>
   Akitaka Saiki, Obuchi's spokesman, offered a couple of reasons
why Japan was willing to apologize in writing to South Korea but
not to China. First, he said, Japan had colonized Korea but not
China, and so the circumstances were different. Second, he added,
Japan's emperor had already gone to China and apologized for the
war, while the emperor has not visited Korea yet.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Japan annexed the Korean peninsula and forced
Koreans to speak Japanese and take Japanese names, something that
never happened in China. But Japan also did establish a puppet
state in Manchuria after invading it in 1931, and it dropped plague
germs over China to start epidemics and killed and tortured far
more Chinese than Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although Emperor Akihito did go to China, he quite
deliberately did not apologize for the war. He instead simply
expressed deep sadness about ``an unfortunate period in which my
country inflicted great suffering on the people of China.''
</P>
<P>
   The real reason for the recent difference in apologies to Japan
and Korea seems to go deeper. Under the previous South Korean
president, Kim Young Sam, Japanese relations with South Korea were
just as testy as relations with China. But Kim Dae Jung was
perceived as genuinely eager to start a new chapter in relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``While President Kim made it clear that he would like to settle
past history,'' Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Koumura told
reporters, ``it was not necessarily the case'' with Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many diplomats and scholars say that China's leaders
have been less interested in healing the wounds of history than in
reminding everyone of their existence. The Communist Party derives
its legitimacy in part from the spirited resistance it led against
Japanese invaders, and whenever it wants something from Tokyo it
thunders about Japanese war brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps for these reasons, there has been a remarkable inflation
in the number of Chinese reported killed in the war with Japan.
Immediately after the war, China announced that Japan had killed
1.75 million of its people, although that figure included only
soldiers; it was considered impossible to determine how many
civilians had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   After it came to power, the Chinese Communist Party declared
that 9.32 million Chinese had been killed, and that figure stood
for many years. Finally, in a speech in 1995, Jiang raised the
estimate to 35 million, and now that is the official Chinese
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang repeated the 35 million estimate in his speeches in Japan,
and added: ``I, as a witness of history, have the responsibility to
convey the historical facts to the younger generation.''
</P>
<P>
   But in most respects the Communist Party has done its best to
cover up modern history. Far more Chinese were killed by the
Communist Party _ 30 million in the man-made famine of the early
1960s alone _ than by the Japanese army. When Chinese scholars
raise those issues, the Communist Party has emphasized the need to
forget about past mistakes and move on.

 &UR; EXCUSE ME, THERE'S A HEX ON YOUR HEAD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Say you're walking down the street and you see a steel beam
hanging over the sidewalk, and intuition tells you, suddenly and
for sure, that it's going to bean the Irish setter lying there.
Should you share that information with the victim? Author
 &UR; Belleruth Naparstek  &LR; provides some guidelines in the Utne Reader.
Among them:
</P>
<P>
   1) If you don't know what to do, do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   2) Think of bad news as good news. ``When I asked Miami medical
intuitive  &UR; Iris Saltzman &LR;  what to do if you `see' that someone is
going to die,'' writes Naparstek, ``she replied, `Aw, let it be a
happy surprise.' ''
</P>
<P>
   3) Relate the information in a conversation that takes place
inside your head, which is where it comes from anyway.
</P>
<P>
   4) ``Drop out of your head and into your heart. There it's hard
to act like a jerk.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The marksmen gulped a hasty dinner of pasta and
salad before preparing to spend a chilly night stalking their
quarry. Their quarters had the look of a wilderness encampment for
commandos, with heavy wool socks hung to dry and foam-lined cases
for custom-made rifles stacked near a fireplace. Telescopic sights
and night-vision gear sat on a bed.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no guerrilla hideout. It was a suite at a hotel, in
the heart of the endless patchwork of malls and townhouse complexes
ringing this city, less than 10 miles from downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The team of hunters, led by Anthony DeNicola, a Yale-educated
wildlife biologist from Hamden, Conn., was here to methodically
kill up to 150 deer, under a contract with the government of Eden
Prairie, a suburb that is one of many municipalities trying to cull
overgrown herds of white-tailed deer.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member team's next stop, depending on a decision by the
New Jersey attorney general's office, could be Princeton Township,
where Mayor Phyllis Marchand recently compared the deer problem to
the avian invasion in the Hitchcock film ``The Birds.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, as populations of white-tailed deer have
exploded on the fringes of many Eastern and Midwestern cities, the
overrun suburbs have tried all kinds of ways to reduce the
attendant threats of deer-car crashes, Lyme disease (which is
carried by deer ticks) and damage to gardens, shrubbery and
forests. Sharpshooting is the newest tactic in the war.
</P>
<P>
   DeNicola, whose doctoral dissertation at Purdue University was
on the use of contraceptives to control deer, said he considered
every option before settling on shooting when he set up his team.
The goal is stealth, precision and compassion, he said, and sniper
rifles are used because the shooters can nearly guarantee an
instantly fatal head shot with every squeeze of the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, DeNicola set up a nonprofit group, White Buffalo Inc.,
which he runs out of his Hamden home, that in effect does contract
killing of deer, at rates varying from $200 to $300 a head or more,
depending on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   During recent contracted shoots in Long Island, N.H., and Dune
Acres, Ind., DeNicola's team was dogged by protesters, some
blasting air horns to scare the deer. Animal rights groups say
shooting is just a temporary fix. But many elected officials and
residents in these and other communities that have hired DeNicola
have nothing but praise for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's professional, he's a scientist, he's a marksman,'' said
Dusty Stemer, president of the Dune Acres Town Council. The
two-square-mile community of 170 homes, on the southern tip of Lake
Michigan, was so plagued by deer that one out of four drivers in
town had hit one, she said. In February, White Buffalo killed 51
deer in five days.
</P>
<P>
   Similar sharpshooting programs employing local police officers
or wildlife officials have been used for several years around
Chicago, Milwaukee, and other areas. But DeNicola is the first
person to establish a business operating across the country. He has
undertaken wildlife-culling projects from a Catalina Island,
Calif., effort to shoot feral goats and pigs, to the eradication of
deer on Monhegan Island, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   He started White Buffalo as a nonprofit venture to help finance
research in wildlife management. Eventually, he said, he plans to
shift to a commercial business, but only if the deer-culling
strategy gains more acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we look biased, it's by default,'' said DeNicola, 32, a
square-jawed technician who makes his own ammunition on a table in
his living room and can fire a series of rifle bullets into a
dime-size circle at 100 yards. White Buffalo has 11 rifles, many of
which are custom-made by the same gunsmiths who make weapons for
Navy Seals.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as people hate to see things die _ they spend $10,000
on vet bills to save a pet _ mortality has to occur,'' DeNicola
said. Since deer have no predators and hunters in crowded suburban
areas, he said, nothing keeps them in check.
</P>
<P>
   He and his team work mostly at night, often with an escort of
local police officers to keep away protesters or explain the
situation to suburbanites alarmed by the unfamiliar sound of
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   In states that allow silencers on rifles, the team uses them to
prevent a herd from scattering as each deer falls, and to avoid
disturbing residents.
</P>
<P>
   The marksmen prepare a site several weeks ahead of time, placing
bait daily in safe locations, using infrared detectors on deer
trails to record the hour when they pass, and then shooting from
tree platforms or from trucks when they pull up to a baited site.
</P>
<P>
   They almost invariably kill each deer with a single shot in the
head, said state wildlife officials who tracked the projects in New
Hampshire and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a sanitized world, so that's what we try to bring
to this operation,'' DeNicola said. ``You don't hear the gunshots,
you don't see the bloody carcasses, but in the end the deer are
gone.''

</P>
<P>
   Early in the century, it it estimated that there were about
500,000 white-tailed deer in the United States, but their numbers
were kept in check by widespread hunting and by coyotes and other
predators. Now there are thought to be more than 15 million deer.
Each year, they cause 500,000 car accidents in which about 100
people die. In a recent case in New York, a 9-year-old boy in the
town of Malta died on Nov. 20, the day after the family car struck
a deer that then crashed through the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   A sharpshooters' rifle is not the only weapon being used to
reduce herds. In North Haven, N.Y., New Canaan, Conn., , and many
other municipalities, permits have been issued to hunters using
bows or shotguns to kill more female deer. But so far, those
efforts have had limited success but have caused ample controversy.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of increasing sport hunters' kill this year, New Jersey
temporarily lifted its ban on using bait to attract deer to a
hunting spot. But some hunters condemn the practice, saying it has
reduced the sport to a slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on hunters to cull deer can also create problems. The
first arrow or shotgun blast does not always kill a deer, resulting
in a significant percentage of wounded animals. ``When a deer runs
off and then dies on Mrs. Smith's lawn, you have a problem,''
DeNicola said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fire Island National Seashore off Long Island, and in
Groton, Conn., the Humane Society and local wildlife officials have
collaborated on projects testing deer contraceptives. But the
operations are most effective on isolated groups of deer, and
sterilized females have to be reinoculated every year, making the
efforts costly and complicated.
</P>
<P>
   In many places some homeowners have simply chosen to embrace the
big-eyed, big-eared grazing animals.
</P>
<P>
   In Princeton Township, which for years has been debating how to
manage its deer population, estimated at 1,300, many residents
continue to feed the animals, among them Tamara Gund, a professor
of chemistry at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Every week
in the fall and winter, she said, her family puts out about 300
pounds of corn and deer food pellets. ``We love to see them,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But most township residents, where deer-car crashes are a daily
event, appear to support the views of the mayor, Ms. Marchand, who
has made culling the deer herd a key issue of her administration.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marchand said that the township was prepared to retain White
Buffalo to shoot at least 200 deer this winter, at about $250 each,
if the state attorney general rules that a state ban on
high-powered rifles would not apply to a local deer-management
project. A ruling is expected in early December.
</P>
<P>
   But a Princeton sharpshooting project, even if sanctioned by the
state, could be opposed intensely by deer lovers and animal rights
advocates. ``This sharpshooting idea is horrible, insane,
barbaric,'' said Ms. Gund. ``It reminds me of the Final Solution.
There has to be a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Princeton's animal control officer, Mark
Johnson, is staying busy, since deer-car crashes are now a regular
part of the rhythm of suburban life. Every day through the fall and
early winter, he spends his mornings picking up the night's road
kills.
</P>
<P>
   When the township bought him a new truck in August, it paid an
extra $4,000 for a hydraulic lift on the back bumper. Its sole
purpose is to make it easier for Johnson to deal with the heavy
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent November morning, the platform dropped and rose
seven times. Johnson piled the bodies in the woods, and later a
state contractor was to come and cart them away.

GIANTS' SPECIAL TEAMER FACES A SPECIAL GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At 180 pounds, the Giants Curtis Buckley doesn't
spend much time running into 300-pound linemen.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't avoid them either. Simply ask the Philadelphia
Eagles 6-foot-4-inch, 309-pound tackle Barrett Brooks, a mountain
of a man who the 5-10 Buckley flattened on a kickoff in the Giants'
last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in the rule book or my contract that says
don't hit the guy if he weighs 100 pounds or 200 pounds more than
me,'' Buckley said last week at Giants Stadium. ``It's all about
being psyched. Go full speed, let the other guys worry about the
collisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, who the Giants signed off waivers from the San
Francisco 49ers two weeks ago and who already will get a chance to
face his former team here on Monday night, is a special-teams
specialist who has three times been named a Pro Bowl first
alternate. The 49ers never wanted to lose Buckley, but a spate of
injuries this month created a hole at cornerback, a position
Buckley does not play.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers signed cornerback Tyrone Legette, and to make room for
him they put Buckley on waivers, although they did so on a Friday
morning. The timing of that transaction _ two days before the next
round of games _ suggests that the 49ers may have been trying to
catch other teams at a time when their rosters were too crowded to
consider adding another player.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley said he was told that the 49ers had plans to re-sign him
a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi was surprised to see
Buckley's name on the waiver wire that Friday morning, but since he
knew the Giants special teams have been subpar, Accorsi knew
Buckley was worth claiming.
</P>
<P>
   The day the Giants signed Buckley, one Giants coach called him,
``a heat-seeking missile.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first game as a Giant, against the Eagles on Nov. 22,
Buckley had two tackles and got the attention of his new teammate
with a boisterous, enthusiastic attitude not often seen on special
teams, an area many players try to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   As 49ers Coach Steve Mariucci said last week: ``During games,
Curtis Buckley thinks special teams are the most important thing
going on that day. He loves it. It's what he does for a living and
he has a spunk, an energy and a confidence that goes with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every coach wants to have a Curtis Buckley on his team. It was
a really tough decision to put him on waivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants Coach Jim Fassel said he heard someone yelling on his
sideline during the Eagles game, turned around and discovered that
it was Buckley trying to rally the Giants for their next
special-teams assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to get people psyched about a punt coverage,''
Fassel said. ``What's more impressive is that you can talk the
talk, but then he went out and earned his teammates' respect. He
was a dynamo out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley has an air of confidence that stands out these days in a
blue Giants locker room where seven losses in 11 games have muted
the swagger and self-assurance the team had back in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm good at what I do and I want other people to feel good
about what they do,'' Buckley said. ``You can't play this game with
your mouth closed. I'm out there telling my teammates, `Come on,
come with me. Let's go hit them all.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, 28, developed this penchant for special-teams mayhem
when he was with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 1995, his third
season with the Buccaneers, he blocked two punts, forced a fumble
and had eight special-teams tackles. He received his first Pro Bowl
recognition and that got the attention of the 49ers, who signed him
after the season as a restricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next two seasons as San Francisco's leading
special-teams player and was the 49ers' special-teams captain when
they put him on waivers two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they were thinking,'' Buckley said of the
49ers. ``But I know I wouldn't have let me go. I know 99 percent of
the coaching staff and players wouldn't have let me go. You can put
somebody else in a position on the field but you can't do all the
things I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you find a guy who can play on kickoffs, kickoff returns,
punts, punt returns and block field goals _ and do it with the
success I've had _ you let me know.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Buckley is helping the Giants prepare for the 49ers'
defense, and their special teams. Asked if he would try to reveal
some of the 49ers secrets for the Giants coaches, Buckley smiled
and said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it takes. I'm with the Giants. I'm all about helping
the Giants win. You can take that any way you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would have any trouble playing against his former
teammates Monday night, Buckley said: ``I played Pee-Wee football
against my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   He does acknowledge that he is something other than overjoyed
about having to leave a team headed for the playoffs for one with
virtually no playoff aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be a fool to say it didn't matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley has a year left on his contract and he said that he
wouldn't mind remaining with the Giants when the 1998 season is
over. ``If they want to extend my contract,'' said Buckley. ``That
sounds good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, who was reared in Texas and played at Texas A&AMP;M, said
he has only one problem playing for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it goes below 70 degrees,'' he said. ``I consider it cold.
I don't mind the cold in games, but I don't like that cold weather
for practices. That's a problem, but I'm working on it.''

IN MACEDONIA, SLAVS AND ALBANIANS FORM UNUSUAL COALITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MIKE O'CONNOR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ With the war in neighboring Kosovo as the
example of what could happen if they fail, the leaders of
Macedonia's most radical ethnic political parties are forming a
coalition to govern this fragile ex-Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of surprisingly smooth negotiations, a
government that could prove to be a significant Balkan experiment
in power-sharing between ethnic groups is to be approved by the
parliament on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing an idea that seems whimsically romantic in the
violence-racked Balkans, Arben Xhaferi, a leader of Macedonia's
ethnic Albanians, said: ``We can find common ground for ethnic
integration through mutual understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Xhaferi himself thought this ideal impossible to achieve
until very recently. He and many other Albanians, who number about
a quarter of the population in Macedonia, feared they would never
have true representation because, they said, the Slav-dominated
political system was rigged against them.
</P>
<P>
   They saw as their main opponent the most nationalist party, the
Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization. When that group, as
the senior member of a coalition, won control of the parliament in
elections this month, the stage seemed to be set for another
hardline Balkan nationalist group to take power and oppress ethnic
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the leader of the nationalist party, Ljupco Georgievski,
started negotiating with Xhaferi _ whose support he did not need to
govern _ to see how they could work together.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently Georgievski, 32, who will be the new prime
minister, had accused Xhaferi's supporters of only wanting to
destroy Macedonia by seceding. In reviewing ways to settle their
differences, Xhaferi said, ``a small miracle'' occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, we had never talked before,'' he said. ``We had
shaken hands at a couple of events. But I thought, `We are here and
they are here, so let's put our problems on the table and see if
they are as bad as we think.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians in Macedonia feel strongly that they are
systematically discriminated against by the government, and foreign
diplomats concur. In a very poor country, the ethnic Albanians are
generally the poorest, have the worst medical care and schools, and
hold proportionally many fewer jobs in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, many feel they have no stake in Macedonia, which
broke away from Communist Yugoslavia in 1991, and see independence
as the only solution, perhaps in league with Albania or Kosovo, the
ethnic Albanian province in southern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, when the insurrection in Kosovo seemed to favor the
Albanian separatists, a despondent leader of Xhaferi's party said
Albanians in Macedonia were beginning to believe that they too
should take up guns.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later that man, Alajdin Demiri, began a two-year
prison sentence for raising an Albanian flag outside the city hall
of Tetovo, a largely Albanian city of which he was the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   When ethnic Albanian politicians began to talk with Georgievski,
one of his first concessions was that Demiri and another mayor
convicted of the same offense be released.
</P>
<P>
   According to Xhaferi, they also agreed on a plan to give much
more power to local governments and to settle a sometimes violent
rallying point for both sides: a university where instruction is in
the Albanian language.
</P>
<P>
   Many Slavs in Macedonia fear that ethnic Albanians are trying to
form a separate society, and demand that higher education be in
Macedonian. Georgievski, at considerable political risk, has agreed
to use state funds to support the Albanian-language university,
Xhaferi said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgievski said he expects no trouble from extremists in his
party or in Xhaferi's; rather, he is determined to convince them to
join him. ``In Macedonia, we will make them part of the system,''
he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Xhaferi, who in the past has hinted that Albanians here may have
to secede in order to secure political rights, now says they must
learn to work with Macedonian politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats and Macedonian politicians say even the most
radical people here now see that the landlocked country, sandwiched
between Serbia, Albania, Greece and Bulgaria, will remain poor and
isolated unless its leaders learn to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an increasingly disgruntled Albanian population,
Macedonian leaders decided it was smart to include some of their
representatives, according to Christopher Hill, the U.S.
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Balkans all the other countries are a problem,'' said
Vasil Tupurkovski, an ethnic Macedonian who heads the other party
in Georgievski's coalition. ``We want to be the stable country.''
</P>
<P>
   Tupurkovski, a veteran politician who in 1991 was one of the few
scrambling to prevent the wars that engulfed the old Yugoslavia,
said he expects the West will respond with economic aid and
investment.
</P>
<P>
   The extreme nationalist party is now convinced it must be more
moderate, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realized perfectly well they could never have won with
the radical positions they used to hold,'' Tupurkovski said, ``and
they really wanted to win, and to have power.''

U.S. AIDE TO PALESTINIANS COULD REACH $900 MILLION  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Israel)  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States will pledge hundreds of millions
of dollars in aid to the Palestinians this week and is pressing
other wealthy nations to dramatically increase economic assistance
to encourage the Palestinians to stick to the peace process with
Israel, senior Clinton administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The new American aid package, to be announced Monday at a
one-day international donors' conference here, could total as much
as $900 million over the next five years, officials said. In all,
they hope the conference will raise $2.3 billion for the
Palestinians, the amount pledged at the last major donors'
conference in October 1993, shortly after the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell you precisely what we'll pledge because
we're still in consultations with Congress,'' a senior State
Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last
week. ``But I can tell you that we do plan to substantially
increase the amount of assistance that we will provide for this
next five-year period.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference will be hosted by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, and will be attended by President Clinton; Yasser Arafat,
the Palestinian leader, and the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia,
Egypt and other Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see if we can do better'' than in 1993, the State
Department official said. ``One way to underpin peace and to build
a constituency of peace is to make certain that people are better
off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli foreign minister, Ariel Sharon, will not attend the
conference because of what American officials described as domestic
political turmoil. The Israeli team will be led instead by the
director general of the foreign ministry, Eytan Bentsur.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat arrived in Washington on Saturday and had lunch Sunday
with Secretary of Commerce William Daley and a group of 15 American
business leaders. He also met groups of Arab Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, much of the American aid money for the
Palestinians has been used for infrastructure, including the paving
of more than 400 miles of roads that knit together scattered towns
and villages in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   American aid to the Palestinians is expected to increase, in
part because of promises that President Clinton made to Arafat's
Palestinian Authority and to Israel that Washington would pick up
much of the bill for the land-for-security plan that was hammered
out in negotiations last month in Wye, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis are expected to seek up to $1.2 billion in
additional aid as a result of the Wye agreement, while Palestinian
officials have suggested that they will solicit as much as $400
million in new aid.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also hopes that an expanded aid package to the
Palestinians will allow Arafat to blunt the influence of the
radical Islamic militant organization Hamas, which has built public
support by sponsoring medical clinics, schools and sport clubs.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said that only two Arab nations _
Syria and Lebanon _ turned down invitations to Monday's meeting,
just as they did when invited to the 1993 conference. Syria and the
Syrian-controlled government of Lebanon have been harsh critics of
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they spoke optimistically about the chances of
increasing aid to the Palestinians, State Department officials
acknowledged that they had effectively suspended plans to open a
Middle Eastern development bank, an institution that they had once
billed as a symbol of economic cooperation among Israel, the
Palestinians and their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the Middle East and North Africa Development Bank were
announced in 1994. The bank, with the United States as its largest
shareholder, was supposed to encourage Israelis and Arabs to work
together with private investors on regional development projects.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States was unable to get the main Middle Eastern
partners in the project _ Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the
Palestinians _ to agree on a charter for the bank. And without
their support, State Department officials said, Congress refused to
make a contribution to capitalize the bank.

BUENOS AIRES MAYOR TO LEAD OPPOSITION IN ARGENTINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES _ The mayor of Buenos Aires, Fernando de la Rua,
became the favorite to replace Carlos Saul Menem as president of
Argentina by winning a landslide victory Sunday in a primary
election to carry the banner of the center-left Alianza opposition
coalition in next October's general election.
</P>
<P>
   The balloting followed a primary campaign, which inspired little
excitement, between de la Rua, a cautious politician running on his
record of improving the capital's finances, and Graciela Fernandez
Meijide, a congresswoman from Buenos Aires province who promised a
full-scale attack against government corruption.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua appeared to benefit from the strength of his Radical
Party's political machine and a construction and tourism boom in
Buenos Aires that has given the city a new image of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua declared victory three hours after the polls closed,
pledging ``a fight against corruption'' if he wins the presidential
election. ``We want an Argentina with more jobs and more
development,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fernandez Meijide conceded defeat and pledged to work for
her opponent's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be a hypocrite and deny that I wish I had
won,'' she said, ``but this vote will lead to a reconstruction of
our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on early returns and exit polls, several television news
stations projected that de la Rua would win more than 55 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates ran a close race in and around Buenos Aires,
but de la Rua pulled away with a big victory in the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   A 61-year-old golf and tango aficionado who has been a
government official and politician his entire professional life, de
la Rua ran a traditional campaign complete with a trip to Rome to
be photographed with Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Few political experts think he would take the country in any
dramatic new directions should he take power in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, appearing on television before the polls closed in an
ascot and double-breasted blue blazer, he projected a cool
confidence, saying, ``Like any other Sunday, I'm eating lunch with
my family and going to Mass.''
</P>
<P>
   In televised debates and other campaign appearances, the two
candidates in the primary election went out of their way to
minimize policy differences and to emphasize their desire to stay
united to defeat the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   They hugged in public and jointly endorsed the Alianza platform,
which pledged to crack down on corruption, take political influence
out of the judicial system, and funnel more government funds into
education, job training and credits for small business.
</P>
<P>
   The Alianza platform also promised to double exports, to $50
billion a year by 2003, and to reduce the unemployment rate to 6
percent from the current rate of over 12 percent. But the platform
did not offer many specifics on how the goals would be
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates also said that if elected they would not diverge
from Menem's major economic policies _ neither reversing his
sweeping privatizations nor his one-to-one peg of the peso to the
dollar. Those actions brought Argentina's chronic hyperinflation
under control and enticed a spectacular volume of foreign
investment over the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua's Radical Party, traditionally the party of
Argentina's middle class, and Ms. Fernandez Meijide's Frepaso, a
more liberal party that broke away from the ruling Justicialist
Party, cobbled together a coalition last year and managed to gain
control of the lower house of Congress in elections last October.
De la Rua has agreed to choose a member of Frepaso as his vice
presidential running mate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The candidacy of Ms. Fernandez Meijide, a 67-year-old former
French teacher who is a Benny Goodman fan and sews her own clothes,
received worldwide attention because one of her three children was
kidnapped by the security forces during the military dictatorship
in 1976 and never seen again. But while voters seemed to like her
image as an outsider, she was so careful not to appear threatening
or too liberal that she stirred little enthusiasm among voters.
</P>
<P>
   On television Sunday, she appeared as a motherly figure,
stirring a pot of risotto in a cramped kitchen. ``We're going to
work hard to keep the Alianza strong and united through the
campaign,'' she said. ``We understand that the nation needs to make
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls indicated that each of the coalition's candidates
would be comfortably ahead of Eduardo Duhalde, governor of Buenos
Aires province, who is favored to win the Justicialist primary next
April. The former finance minister, Domingo Cavallo, the architect
of Menem's economic program, is running far behind on a third-party
ticket, but he may play the role of the spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   The Justicialist Party, which still carries the flag of the late
President Juan Domingo Peron and his wife Eva, remains the largest
and most powerful political force in the country. But the party is
deeply divided between Duhalde and Menem, who tried to run for
re-election despite a constitutional ban. His candidacy was blocked
by party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Menem is jockeying to remain leader of the party after he leaves
office in early 2000, but Duhalde is trying to block his efforts in
party councils and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Duhalde is doing his best to distance himself from Menem because
of a series of scandals that has implicated several Cabinet members
in recent months as well as a persistently high unemployment rate

GOOD WEEKEND, NOT GREAT, FOR RETAILERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   While unexpectedly warm weather brought hordes of shoppers to
malls during the Thanksgiving weekend, most department store
executives were expressing just cautious optimism about sales for
the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an OK two days,'' said Michael Gould, chairman and
chief executive of Bloomingdale's, a unit of Federated Department
Stores. Referring to the percentile rise in sales over the
comparable period a year ago, Gould added that Bloomingdale's saw a
``solid single-digit improvement'' over the weekend, led primarily
by sales of armoires and other furniture, food, and housewares such
as crystal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're big days,'' he added, ``but they're only two of the
top 20 days of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton Tansky, executive vice president of Neiman Marcus Group,
expressed similar sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did fine,'' Tansky said, adding that popular items during
the weekend were cashmere sweaters, fine jewelry and accessories
like evening scarves and shawls. ``It was a good weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that company executives were cautiously optimistic about
the season, he added, ``but you never know in December.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing analysts and most retailers agree on: Consumers
stepped into this holiday shopping season feeling much more upbeat
than they did even a month ago, aided in part by the recent
resurgence of the stock market. But whether consumer confidence
will translate into strong sales remains an unanswered question.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers would not even offer Thanksgiving weekend sales
numbers or precise forecasts for the rest of the holiday season;
perhaps they have learned a lesson from previous disappointments.
After two years of sales that began strong during the Thanksgiving
weekend but then fizzled by the end of December, even the brightest
Thanksgiving forecast may not hold up.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the overall picture is good. General forecasts are for
about a 6 percent increase in retail sales this season.
</P>
<P>
   Telecheck Services Inc., which tracks personal check use at more
than 20,000 stores each month, said that check use at department
stores nationwide increased by 4.4 percent for the day after
Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday because of its positive impact
on retail profits. That gain was stronger than either last year's
2.2 percent increase or the 3.6 percent gain in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects a 3 percent to 5 percent increase in check
use in the holiday season, said William Ford, its senior economic
adviser. While checks are not a preferred method of payment for
most shoppers, Telecheck's numbers are often consistent with
industry trends.
</P>
<P>
   But shoppers seem content to let retailers, especially those at
larger department store chains, wait for any windfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the excitement and promotions that Black Friday conjure
up, the day after Thanksgiving is no longer the busiest shopping
day of the year. The International Council of Shopping Centers said
the biggest sales day last year was Dec. 20, and 44 percent of
holiday sales took place from Dec. 15 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Friday after Thanksgiving usually ranks as the sixth to
eighth busiest shopping day of the year, said John Konarski, the
association's head of research. Last year, it was seventh and the
Thanksgiving week accounted for only about 9 percent of department
stores' holiday sales, he said.
</P>
<P>
   America's Research Group, which tracks shopping trends, forecast
a 20 percent increase in mall traffic compared with the weekend a
year earlier, but by some accounts, more shoppers were still
finishing their gift lists rather than picking up items.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weekend brings a lot of lookers and more bargain-oriented
customers driven by sales'' promotions, said Michael Anthony,
president and chief executive of Brookstone, a specialty retailer.
Even though the company expects high single-digit percentile
increases in the Christmas season and saw good sales rises during
the weekend, most popular items like hammocks, croquet games, home
office and gardening items will not be sold until the third week of
December, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanksgiving weekend does not make Christmas,'' said Larry
Mondry, executive vice president of CompUSA. Strong sellers for the
company were computers priced less than $1,000, digital cameras and
new video-game software, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Toy stores, discounters and online retailers seemed to buck the
trend, with many reporting strong sales over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were buying a lot of toys,'' said Stanley Greenman,
chief executive at Noodle Kidoodle, a toy store chain based in
Syosset, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The company awaits a new shipment of the popular Furby dolls but
saw strong sales of educational computer software, Legos and
classic board games, Greenman said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the online retailer, saw a fourfold increase in
sales over the weekend, compared with those in the period a year
earlier, a company spokesman said. The company, which began by
selling books, now offers compact discs, videos, personal
electronics, gadgets and toys. During the weekend, ``Gone with the
Wind'' and ``Casablanca'' sold well in the digital video-disk
format. Children's boooks and portable CD players were also
popular.
</P>
<P>
   Customers began lining up about 4 a.m. Friday for a chance to
win shopping certificates and a new car at Target stores, said
Susan Eich, a spokeswoman for Dayton Hudson, Target's parent
corporation. Once inside, they scooped up toys like Teletubbies,
handheld electronic games and lava lamps.
</P>
<P>
   At Dayton Hudson's other department stores, tastes ran toward
items for the home like electric grills, breadmakers and apparel
such as sweaters, holiday dresses and men's designer sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   Promotions, such as a year without interest payments, brought
customers into jewelry stores, executives at Zale Corp. and Marks
Brothers Jewelers said.
</P>
<P>
   Popular items in both chains included diamond bracelets and
earrings and jewelry made with the blue stone tanzanite.
</P>
<P>
   Wellspark Group, which owns and operates 22 malls, primarily in
New England, said it saw sales jumps of 2 percent to 10 percent
during the weekend. This year, the malls offer an incentive
program: Shoppers can receive gift certificates, discounts or free
products depending on how much they spend.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAUMONT, Texas _ They have been downsized, cut back and
re-engineered. So when the 900 or so remaining blue-collar workers
here at Mobil's largest domestic refinery, out of about 1,500 a
decade ago, heard last week that their company was discussing a
possible merger with Exxon, it was like a siren warning them that
an already suspect valve might be about to blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a terrible thing,'' said Dick Mabry, a refinery
operator, as he emerged in the plant's artificial twilight from the
main gate after his 12-hour shift ended at 4:30 on Sunday morning.
He stopped to rub eyes rimmed with red, but on this topic his
bedtime could be delayed. ``It's a revival of the Standard Oil
Company. It's going to put 20 or 30 thousand people out of work. I
think the Justice Department should step in and stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Lewis, whose overalls bore a ``Big E'' patch appropriate
to his scale, added his uh-huh's. The latest evidence of where
things were heading hulked right nearby, he said, glancing over at
a new power plant likely to be operated by an outside company
without the unions that now man the refinery's generators.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Mobil Corp. has to be sold, Lewis said, noting the
gains in his company stock holdings, a buyer as solid and large as
the Exxon Corp. might be the least of all evils. ``If we merged
with Chevron, we'd be Moron,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A growing American economy that can make a billionaire out of
someone with an unproven idea for Internet marketing is still
sloughing off workers in older industries, in petroleum as much as
any.
</P>
<P>
   Those here point to the tote board by the Beaumont plant's brick
headquarters, that they say shows they have already handled 171
million barrels out of 130 million planned for the full year. But
the numbers that matter even more are the ones like 89.9, 88.9,
even 81.9, on nearby gas stations _ the lowest prices, after
inflation, since the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Mobil and Exxon are considering combining into the
world's largest oil company. Some people close to the talks
cautioned that no deal would be considered by their boards until at
least Tuesday, maybe Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why, beginning last Wednesday evening, the phone at
the home of Jimmy Herrington, the president of the Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers Local 4-243 rang without stop.
</P>
<P>
   No, he didn't know about that merger talk on television, said
Herrington, who also works full-time producing lubricants. He had
asked some Mobil managers, in a meeting earlier this month, about
all the rumors, but they said they had heard nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Oil industry analysts say that the first targets of a combined
company's efforts to cut billions of dollars in annual costs would
be the office staff and the professionals, like geologists and
engineers, in the field. One company's accountants could almost do
the work for two.
</P>
<P>
   But the crews here fully expect that an Exxon or any other buyer
would ask yet again whether the refinery could turn more crude oil
into gasoline, motor oil and other products with even fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders raise the prospect that Exxon would have to sell
the refinery. Antitrust regulators, they say, are bound to notice
that Exxon has refineries an hour's drive in one direction and
three hours in the other, along a Gulf of Mexico crescent that
forms the petrochemical industry's home.
</P>
<P>
   The Beaumont plant, a steaming, humming chemistry set lining the
Neches River off the Gulf, has become the prime provider of
livelihoods here since it was built almost under the spray of the
nearby Spindletop gusher.
</P>
<P>
   With mounting overtime that can stretch a shift to 16 hours or
more, workers regularly make $55,000 or $65,000 a year. ``People go
there to retire there,'' Herrington said, as he drove around the
plant's fenced periphery.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, in his 17th year, is a third-generation employee. But his
nephew laboring here too is the exception. The workers streaming to
and from the plant before dawn are mostly balding or going gray, a
sign that for a full generation the refinery has been more
concerned about how to get rid of workers than how to attract them.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks have, so far, come through attrition, with
retirements often encouraged by incentives. But the plywood sheets
covering the windows of most of the fast food places and gas
stations around Herrington's union hall advertise that the best
times are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   His members chafe at the experts who come in from Wall Street to
question the justification for every person's job. In tiring and
dangerous tasks, they question the elimination of most relief
laborers in favor of covering vacations and sickness with overtime
(although some like the extra pay, and they say the plant has
become safer over the years). They complain about the growing
numbers of outside contractors taking over formerly unionized
tasks.
</P>
<P>
   But with many workers choosing to invest at least some
retirement savings in Mobil stock, a 1990s ethos is gaining. Some
share credit with the plant's management for the efficiency
measures they agree are necessary for true job security. Some take
the attitude that every company is always for sale.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not be too concerned about what we feel about it,''
said Sam Salim, one of the electrical plant workers whose future is
uncertain. ``But if they fork out $60 billion? I'd look it over.''
</P>
<P>
   With most Mobil executives saying as little as possible for now,
calls on Sunday to the local plant manager and a company spokesman
did not elicit a peep.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders, however, are already squawking. ''I don't believe
creating new monopolies is the way to prop up the industry,'' said
Robert Wages, a former refinery operator himself and now the
union's president, by telephone Saturday. Nevertheless, with
admirable foresight the union negotiated a clause in last
November's three-year contract extension guaranteeing that any
company buyer would have to keep to its terms.
</P>
<P>
   Many members, who typically came to work after high school, are
already molding the oil companies' latest exploits into case
studies fit for rapacious MBA's.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the biggest,'' said Bobby Whisneant, an assistant
operator in the gasoline and lubrication oil units, referring to
Exxon. He was coming, early on Sunday morning, through a plant gate
whose white canopy seems borrowed from a self-service station. ``So
they go buy the second biggest. That's one way to get rid of the
competition. I just hope it's not something like the 80s _ buying
companies and scrapping them.''
</P>
<P>
   Or something like the Robber Baron era a century before, said
Mabry, another operator. ``Didn't the teachers teach us all through
school that the Standard Oil Company would never come back?
Remember that?'' he said, looking to his friend, Lewis, the Big E,
for agreement. ``But I better shut up. I still work for Mobil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Used to,'' Lewis said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEBEC _ A Quebecer returning home this week after a few years'
absence would be thoroughly confused by the campaign posters lining
the highways leading to this provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   Signs that prominently feature the blue and white fleur-de-lis
flag, the provocative symbol of the Quebec separatist movement,
this time belong to the anti-separation Liberal Party and its
leader, Jean Charest.
</P>
<P>
   And neither a fleur-de-lis nor the color blue is on any of the
posters for the separatist Parti Quebecois, and the current premier
of Quebec, Lucien Bouchard. Instead, the primary color used is a
muddy green, which is supposed to stand for hope.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Liberals and the Parti Quebecois hope that when the
vote takes place Monday in all 125 ridings, or districts, around
the province, Quebecers will be able to clearly distinguish between
the two parties and their positions.
</P>
<P>
   But the reversal of symbols on the campaign posters is just one
of many reversals in a campaign that has distracted voters,
confounded experts and added a thick layer of ambiguity to one of
the continent's most baffling political landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign itself has lasted only 33 days _ the shortest ever
in Quebec _ but in that time Charest and the Liberals have steadily
lost support.
</P>
<P>
   Charest, the former leader of the federal Conservative Party,
arrived in Quebec this year as the great federalist hope whom the
rest of Canada had recruited to banish the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   But he seems to have gone from hero to goat, with the latest
polls showing the Liberals headed for a stinging defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has failed to become the leading contender for Quebec's
champion against Ottawa,'' said Desmond Morton, director of the
Institute for the Study of Canada at McGill University in Montreal.
During the campaign, Bouchard attacked Charest relentlessly and
raised doubts about how well he really knew Quebec, since Charest
had been away from the province for so long, Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   Charest ``often looked hot-tempered and crotchety against the
man many Quebecers see as a secular saint,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard, who was practically canonized here after losing a leg
to flesh-eating disease in 1994, did not run an unassailable
campaign. In the last four years that his Parti Quebecois has
controlled the provincial assembly, it has tried to balance the
provincial budget by closing hospitals and making deep cuts in
hallowed social spending programs like education. Those cuts have
angered many, presenting the Liberals with ample targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bouchard had trouble almost every day of the campaign,''
Morton said. ``But he was always able to capitalize on his ability
to get out his message through a largely sympathetic media.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when it dealt with the fundamental issue of separation,
that message was not always clear.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard had at first vowed that if he was re-elected, he would
hold another referendum. In the last referendum, in 1995, the
separatist question was narrowly defeated, but Quebec law prohibits
a government from holding more than one referendum during a term
that usually lasts four to five years.
</P>
<P>
   As surveys showed that Quebecers _ for whom Monday's election is
the sixth in six years _ were overwhelmingly against holding
another referendum, Bouchard's position wavered. He promised a
referendum only when ``winning conditions'' prevailed, but never
defined those terms. Later in the campaign, he said he would
negotiate a new arrangement on social spending with Ottawa, a
``renewed federalism'' that seemed the polar opposite of previous
separation threats.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters were confused, others angry. ``Ambiguity wins in
Quebec,'' a Montreal radio talk show host, Gord Logan, proclaimed
during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Charest left no doubt that he was against a referendum. Using
the fleur-de-lis on campaign posters was his way of taking back the
powerful image from the separatists. But in the end, Charest's
straightforwardness may have cost him support even among people who
said they would vote against separation.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 years of the separatist movement, many Quebecers have
developed sophisticated positions on independence that at times can
puzzle outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Balthazar, a professor of political science at Laval
University, said many Quebec voters hedged their bets. They do not
necessarily want to separate from Canada, but they expect their
leaders to use the threat of separation as leverage to bargain with
the federal government for more provincial powers.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Balthazar continued, even Quebecers who want to stay in
Canada will vote for the Parti Quebecois, which officially embraces
separation, to maintain this perceived advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Bouchard could not necessarily count the support he wins
on Monday as support for a referendum. ``Right now, a PQ victory
would not translate into a future winning referendum,'' Balthazar
said. He said he believed that Quebecers would vote for Bouchard
because of the way he has managed Quebec, not because he will make
it an independent nation.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marc Leger, president of Le Groupe Leger &AMP; Leger, a
Montreal polling company, said that if the Parti Quebecois picks up
more seats in the provincial assembly than the 77 it now controls,
and exceeds 50 percent of the popular vote, it will be encouraged
to call for a referendum in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that voters now see Bouchard's separatist
government as standing for stability while it is Charest's Liberals
who represent radical change. That is in large part because at the
beginning of the campaign, Charest said he would diminish the
provincial government's role in Quebec's economy and open it up to
market forces.

ESSAY: THE KING OF CHUTZPAH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In blowing off the House Judiciary Committee's 81
interrogatories, a mockingly evasive Bill Clinton told the Congress
of the United States: Take your impeachment process and stick it in
your ear.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere up in Modified Limited Hangout Heaven, Richard Nixon
is applauding. Clinton is carrying out his Watergate credo:
Presidents caught covering up admit only a mistake _ and never give
their enemies an inch on having broken any law.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stiffed the Congress on questions about the most
characteristic moment in his presidency. In January, caught lying
under oath in the Jones lawsuit, he consulted Dick Morris about the
people's reaction if he told the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Morris testified that he took a poll showing public forgiveness
about adultery but not about perjury. He reported Clinton's
declaration of dishonesty: ``We just have to win, then'' _ that is,
to hang tough with his line of lies.
</P>
<P>
   In his answer to Congress, Clinton had to admit the polling
consultation because phone records back up what Morris told the
grand jury. But that damning quote about winning by lying? Clinton
answered ``I do not recall.''
</P>
<P>
   He dared not deny outright saying that because Morris' habit is
to make contemporaneous notes on his laptop of all conversations
with Clinton. (By the way _ who paid for the historic poll that led
Clinton to his ruination?)
</P>
<P>
   Such exquisite disremembering is typical of the Clinton defense.
Its guiding principle: If you can prove wrongdoing, I'll admit it,
but not if it's a crime. In his grand jury testimony, Clinton took
the position that he never touched Monica Lewinsky intimately, not
even once _ look, Ma, no hands _ yet he and his lawyers assert that
he did not lie under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Words have meaning. You can argue that lying under oath about
sex does not rise to an impeachable offense, but if what Bill
Clinton told that grand jury is not lying under oath, then nothing
is lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton has done in his mocking answers to 81 questions is
to fling down a gauntlet: Impeach me if you dare. If you dare not,
then the only adjectives acceptable to me in a shame-on-you
resolution are ``indefensible'' and ``wrong'' about my initial
behavior, and ``misled'' about my subsequent denials under oath
(not ``lied'' and certainly never ``unlawful''). You have my
permission to be cross, goes his message _ but not judgmental.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's present in-your-face attitude places many
representatives in a pickle. Do they let him treat them with
unconcealed contempt, or do they let him force them to hit him
harder than they want to?
</P>
<P>
   Most will base their vote against impeachment less on the rule
of law than on a simple judgment: whether this helps or hurts them
in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Few doubt that on the basis of the last election Democrats
should oppose impeachment. Clinton is triumphalistic; the market is
booming; Ken Starr proved only lies about sex; nothing can stop the
move-on movement. But politicians know that it is in the nature of
the political wheel to turn.
</P>
<P>
   Two years hence, we could be in a recession, with people finding
fault. A missile from a rogue nation could remind us who opposed a
missile defense. With the statute of limitations run, Chinese
fund-raising culprits could start confessing for fame and profit.
Memoirists will be impelled to reveal all and Democratic partisans
will claim to be shocked, shocked at President Pinocchio.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clinton star falls again, as it has twice before, few
candidates for re-election will want to say to their constituents:
This fellow you are reviling in 2000 is the one I saved from
retribution in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Democrats, denied a genuine contrition fix, want the
shame-on-you way out. They want to be able to say: ``I voted to
verbally skin him alive; I wasn't soft on Clinton's wrongdoing.'' A
scolding resolution is their insurance policy for giving him a
constitutional pass. They are desperate to get right with the
possible condemnation of voters in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans rightly don't want them to get away with it.
And the Comeback Kid, by coming back too cockily, is helping those
who want to let the Senate make the final judgment.

cavernous chocolate factory in South San Francisco, workers still
roll bon-bons by hand. See's began accepting credit cards only 18

LOSS REVEALS WEAKNESSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The best and worst of UCLA was on display Saturday
against defending national champion Kentucky, which explains the
Bruins' disparate reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Lavin rejected the notion of moral victories, yet
injured point guard Baron Davis congratulated his teammates on a
job well done.
</P>
<P>
   One freshman, Jerome Moiso, backed Lavin's position. Another,
JaRon Rush, was undeniably upbeat despite an aching lower back that
once again limited his effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, you saw the tip of the iceberg of our potential,''
Lavin said. ``Closing the gap between performance and potential is
the theme of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins showed their depth, athleticism and energy in a 66-62
defeat. Lavin was at his underdog best, willing UCLA to its most
encouraging performance of the season. (His decision to start Ryan
Bailey at guard didn't hurt, either.) Earl Watson played under
control, Rush slashed to the basket, Moiso and Dan Gadzuric had
moments of dominance and Matt Barnes displayed his versatility.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the frenzy, it was easy to envision season-long
improvement culminating in 20 wins and a respectable showing in the
NCAA Tournament. But that would be premature. With 12 freshmen and
sophomores _ not to mention one reconstructed knee _ the Bruins are
several time zones away from having the efficiency and consistency
to compete with the elite.
</P>
<P>
   Peel back the emotion and urgency they showed Saturday and the
structure remains weak.
</P>
<P>
   The motion offense doesn't create enough open shots for UCLA to
score consistently in half-court situations. Defensive fundamentals
like footwork, positioning and locating shooters are spotty.
</P>
<P>
   The substitution pattern hasn't formed, roles haven't
established, leadership is fledgling _ and Lavin knows all about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll shore things up as we go along,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few impressions after three games in the Carribean:
</P>
<P>
   __ Watson might be UCLA's most improved player, but he's not
ready for full-time duty at point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Watson was content to dribble and distribute. This
year, he's more confident and thus taking more chances. Bad move.
He had 17 turnovers in two games as the floor leader but only one
against Kentucky with Ryan Bailey playing the point.
</P>
<P>
   __ The coaches must work with Rush on his shot selection. No
doubt, he's a prolific scorer, but he can't settle for jumpers and
must learn to shoot within the context of the offense. Too often
Rush misfired from 3-point range before the Bruins could establish
rebounding position and floor balance, which gave opponents
transition opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no denying his energy, especially when compared to
top scorers from previous UCLA teams. Rush is a dervish on defense
and dives for loose balls with refreshing abandon.
</P>
<P>
   __ The freshman big men, Gadzuric and Moiso, are both raw, but
in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric has small, quick feet and fabulous mobility for his
size, but his footwork and instinct are inefficient. There's no
reason for him to chase opposing centers 15 feet from the basket,
but he did against San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He must also learn to pin and seal defenders in the low post.
Maybe he should watch film of Kentucky center Michael Bradley, who
lacks Gadzuric's skill but knows how to play.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-10 Moiso isn't a center. In fact, he isn't a power
forward. He's most comfortable roaming 12 feet from the basket,
shooting turnarounds and slashing to the hoop. A finesse player,
Moiso has moments of aggression but usually avoids contact.
</P>
<P>
   __ Davis is ready to play but not ready to perform. His left
knee is sound enough for full-contact scrimmaging, but Davis has
not regained his timing, his explosion or total confidence in the
knee _ all typical symptoms of anterior cruciate ligament
recoveries. Davis is not the player he was, not yet, and it might
be another year before he is.

RESURGENT IBM THRIVES BY MEETING TECHNOLOGY NEEDS FOR
U.S.  BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - IBM
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By David Einstein &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There's a great ``Seinfeld'' scene in which George, after
fretting that he has become impotent, rediscovers his manhood and
shouts for all the world to hear, ``I'm back, baby!''
</P>
<P>
   That pretty well describes IBM these days.
</P>
<P>
   Given up for dead by many people just five years ago, Big Blue
has enjoyed under Lou Gerstner one of the great turnarounds in the
annals of U.S. business. With record sales and profits in 1997 and
a stock price that's shot through the roof, the Armonk, N.Y.,
company has regained its title as king of the computing world.
</P>
<P>
   Look anywhere in the industry and you'll find IBM's footprints.
Eight out of 10 mainframe computers sold carry the company's logo,
and an IBM AS/400, the most popular commercial business computer in
the world, is delivered to a new customer every 12 minutes of every
working day.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is among the leading makers of personal computers. It's one
of the top manufacturers of hard disk drives, which it develops and
produces in San Jose. And it makes microprocessors both for itself
and other computer-makers.
</P>
<P>
   It also is one of the top software companies in the world:
Nearly three-fourths of all the corporate data in the world is
managed by IBM's software, on IBM computers.
</P>
<P>
   As if that weren't enough, IBM is among the leading makers of
supercomputers _ its Deep Blue system routed world chess champion
Garry Kasparov without breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, the company routinely leads the United States in
patents, which come out of eight research laboratories including
the Almaden Research Lab in San Jose. IBM scientists recently have
developed a hard disk drive capable of holding 25 gigabytes of
information, and have found a way to replace aluminum in computer
chips with copper, which conducts electricity 40 percent better.
</P>
<P>
   What has really enabled IBM to prosper, however, is its ability
to help businesses develop, implement and maintain computer systems
for the Internet age, including networks, intranets and electronic
commerce Web sites. IBM goes in and provides the equipment _ both
its own and other companies' _ and then services the system. Such
services now account for 25 percent of IBM's sales
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of detail and deliverables they can get into are
astounding,'' said analyst Daniel Kunstler of J.P. Morgan. ``A lot
of companies can talk about creating a seamless global network, but
this is complicated stuff, and they can deliver it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by its ``Solutions for a small planet'' TV ads, IBM
has projected itself as the company others turn to for their
technology needs. It has been far more successful in promoting that
image than has Hewlett-Packard, its nearest competitor.
</P>
<P>
   OK:  &LR; ``IBM has the largest service organization on the planet.
HP's not even close,'' said James Poyner, a respected analyst with
CIBC Oppenheimer. ``IBM has focused on pulling its various entities
together to provide a total bundle, and HP is just now pondering
these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, by acquiring Tandem and Digital Equipment, also signaled
its desire to be like IBM, but has a lot of catching up to do.
</P>
<P>
   The heady confidence in Armonk these days contrasts sharply with
five years ago, when IBM, an icon of American business since the
1920s, was on the ropes after losing money for three straight years
_ including $8.1 billion in 1993 alone.
</P>
<P>
   IBM found itself caught in a shift away from mainframe computers
to client-server systems that could be run with smaller,
less-expensive computers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, IBM's PC business was in turmoil. After
pioneering PCs in the early 1980s, the company had watched
helplessly as a horde of IBM clones overwhelmed the market.
</P>
<P>
   IBM also was having trouble in the PC software business, where
its OS/2 operating system was in the process of being overwhelmed
by Microsoft Windows.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, it was clear that the company was on the ropes, despite
restructurings that had cut the workforce from 400,000 to 300,000.
In April of that year, the board sent chief executive John Akers
packing, replacing him with Gerstner, who had been CEO of RJR
Nabisco, the big food conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstner started out with two strikes against him. He was the
first outsider ever to head up IBM, and he knew exactly zip about
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, however, both of those apparent drawbacks
actually helped. Gerstner wasn't burdened by the traditional
blue-suit mentality that had paralyzed the company. And he cared
much more about selling products than what went inside them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his grand vision for IBM, Gerstner said he didn't
have any. What he wanted to do was play to the company's strengths,
using its vast resources and global presence to forge a
product-services company second to none.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that goal, Gerstner lopped off another 35,000 jobs
and began to cut back on research spending. At the same time, he
made it plain that pure research would take second place to
research that led directly to products.
</P>
<P>
   He also retooled the PC division, reducing a confusing product
line to a manageable number of models and doing a better job of
managing the retail channel.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gerstner, despite being a technological
neophyte, recognized early on that IBM could use the Internet as a
vehicle for its global business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to focus on a strategy that unifies all parts of
IBM, and it's about using technology centered around the Web to
help customers transform their businesses and compete more
effectively,'' said John Thompson, a 27-year IBM veteran who heads
up its North American operations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, IBM returned to the black with a profit of $3 billion.
The earnings grew to $4.2 billion in 1995, $5.4 billion in 1997 and
$6.1 billion last year. Revenues also rose steadily, going from
$62.7 billion in 1993 to $78.5 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has continued on its roll this year. For the third quarter,
net income totaled $1.5 billion, and revenues were $20.1 billion.
Mainframe sales still shone and the PC business was good enough to
lift IBM to the No.3 spot in the U.S. market, behind Dell and
Compaq. Disk drive sales were strong.
</P>
<P>
   So were sales of Lotus Notes, the corporate groupware that IBM
got when it acquired software pioneer Lotus for $3.5 billion in
1995. At the time, critics said IBM paid too much, but last summer,
Lotus sold 3.4 million licenses for Notes, compared to 3.2 million
for Microsoft's Exchange, the only major competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's hard to find anyone critical of IBM these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give credit to Gerstner and his management team
for taking what had been a giant mismanaged company not nimble
enough to respond to a rapidly changing industry, and turning it
into a focused company aggressively attacking every segment of the
industry,'' said Collins &AMP; Co. analyst Bruce Raabe.
</P>
<P>
   About the only knock on IBM is its heady stock price, which has
gone from $106 a share in June to a record $170 on Friday.
Oppenheimer's Poyner downgraded the stock to a ``hold'' because he
doesn't expect the price to go much above $160.

 SHORT-HANDED SCARLET KNIGHTS STILL HAVE PLENTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RON DICKER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ This is what late November is made for: A
vulnerable nonconference opponent. An adoring home crowd. A chance
to pad an impressive record.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers took full advantage Sunday in the championship of the
Coca-Cola Classic. Using a stifling zone defense and superior
quickness, the Scarlet Knights defeated Arizona State, 67-48, at
the Louis Brown Athletic Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils (2-1) shot just 27 percent (13 of 48) and endured
a nine-minute drought in which a manageable 45-34 deficit with 16
minutes 35 seconds remaining turned into a 60-34 margin. The
11th-ranked Scarlet Knights shot 49 percent and outrebounded the
taller Sun Devils, 42-27.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers improved its record to 6-1, the best start since
1990-91, when the Scarlet Knights were 7-0. And it did so despite
missing three prominent players because of injury and illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who could have believed we could have maintained as we did?''
Rutgers Coach C. Vivian Stringer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights have developed the kind of depth that can
withstand key absences against teams such as Arizona State. Whether
they can adjust against quality opponents remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot allow adversity to kill us,'' Stringer said. ``It is
trying to. My patience is being tested. When I see the way the kids
played today, it proves that the human spirit is very resilient.''
</P>
<P>
   Players adopted unfamiliar roles as their own over the weekend.
Shawnetta Stewart, the team's steadiest scorer, assumed much of the
ball-handling duties in the absence of point guard Tasha Pointer,
whose herniated disk has created numbness in one leg. Stewart
collected 15 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists Sunday, earning most
valuable player honors for the tournament. (She had 9 points and 8
rebounds in a 70-47 victory over Buffalo on Saturday.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got it rough, but truthfully, I don't think this is
the toughest that is going to hit us,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore center Tammy Sutton-Brown logged an energetic 25
minutes, scoring 11 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in place of the
senior Jen Clemente. Clemente was released from the hospital Sunday
after doctors were able to dissolve a blood clot in her lung.
Stringer estimated Clemente's return at six weeks to three months,
but she might be out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman forward Davalyn Cunningham saw her first
significant court time over the weekend after Usha Gilmore
sustained a concussion last week. Gilmore was so sure she would
play that her parents visited from South Carolina to watch, but
lingering headaches and poor peripheral vision left her on the
bench. Cunningham scored 13 points, her second double-digit effort
in the Coca-Cola Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Linda Miles added 13 points, had three steals and
energized a Rutgers defense that forced 16 Sun Devil turnovers in
the first half and limited Arizona State to 15 percent shooting in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils, who received 16 points from center Rachel Holt,
committed eight turnovers in 10 possessions in one first-half span
as Rutgers built a 26-13 lead. Arizona State shrank the deficit to
31-27 before its shooting touch turned ice cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're the 11th-ranked team and you're missing a few key
players, you can overcome it,'' Arizona State Coach Charli Turner
Thorne said. ``When you're building a program and missing some
players, you can't do it. We played intimidated; we played
hesitant. I know for a fact we're a much better team than the way
we played.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers knows it could be better if its players healed. In the
dwindling days of November, all a coach can do is hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would really be sad and difficult for me to handle if we
can't fulfill ourselves,'' Stringer said. ``I just believe that we
as a team are capable of so much.''

 CHRON - NET FILES   HOW A STAR   OF THE NET   BURNED OUT &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Netscape Communications' meteoric rise and rapid fall is
brimming with irony. The 4-year-old Mountain View company brought
the Internet to the masses _ only to be swept aside by the growth
of the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the same company that raised one of high-tech's most
successful initial public offerings in 1995 is now West Coast
operations for America Online, a longtime pariah among the digital
elite. Even more galling to some is that AOL's marketing head will
oversee Netscape from across the country in AOL's Dulles, Va.,
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,400-person Netscape was never able to parlay its popular
Web site into a viable independent business and frittered away its
chance to dominant e-commerce. Yahoo, Microsoft and Excite all
eagerly, and successfully, developed portal sites. Netscape
eventually created the popular Netcenter, but it had clearly pulled
the trigger too late.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Netscape devolved from a browser business into a
schizophrenic quilt of part-portal, part-enterprise, part-browser
company. Compounding matters were a couple of questionable
purchases of other companies, such as audio- and video-streaming
specialist InSoft, and strained relations with software developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was indecision that resulted in a company all over the
map,'' said David Yoffie, professor of the Harvard Business School
and co-author of ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons From
Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Microsoft. ...
</P>
<P>
   The software giant lagged behind the Internet startup in the
browser market, but it quickly caught up (see the Department of
Justice's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft).
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, Netscape commanded 80 percent of the Web
browser market. Today, it clings to barely half the market. Need
further proof? Despite AOL's $4.21 billion buyout of Netscape,
Microsoft's Internet Explorer still remains the primary browser for
AOL's 14 million paying members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always look forward. I have trouble with retrospectives,''
Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen said in an interview last week.
``This whole deal was about building more strength and momentum
behind the Netscape brand. It's now bigger, stronger, faster.
(AOL-Netscape) ought to be the pre-eminent online model for the
next decade.'' (Andreessen is ticketed for a technology role at
AOL.)
</P>
<P>
   We should all thank Netscape for changing the Internet. It's too
bad, Netscape didn't change with the Internet quickly enough to
prosper.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &QL; 
 &LR; ISP FALLOUT. &QL; 
One final thought on AOL's blockbuster buyout. Internet service
providers aren't throwing rice at the AOL-Netscape marriage. In
fact, many are hopping mad. They were among Netscape's first _ and
most loyal _ customers, but are archcompetitors of AOL and may be
forced to offer Web browsers other than Navigator in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if Microsoft swoops in to take advantage of
the rift by signing some of the disgruntled ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAZE. &QL; 
The Carmen Sandiego of cyberspace is on the ultimate road trip _
and he wants to keep Web surfers guessing where he is.
</P>
<P>
   Peabody Award-winning journalist Mike Cerre is at the midpoint
of a 24,000-mile odyssey around the world in search of the origins
of holiday traditions ( &LR; excape.excite.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   So far, he's discovered the origin of the first Christmas gift
and traveled to St. Nick's hometown. (Hint: Bring sunglasses and
sunscreen, because it's closer to the equator than the North Pole.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do a `Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?' for
big kids,'' said Cerre, whose ``Excape into Xmas'' journey has
taken him to Asia and Europe this month, and will soon depart for
the Arctic Circle. ``We want to educate and entertain people at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerre's travels are the second installment in an ambitious new
media experiment/publicity stunt/online contest co-developed by
Internet guide company Excite and Sausalito television producer
Globe TV to take World Wide Web users on a whirlwind tour of the
real world. Earlier this year, San Francisco journalist Andy Valvur
hopped across the globe to visit college campuses in eight
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cerre posted his first of nine online dispatches,
cryptic journal entries laced with clues and accompanied by 16
digital images.
</P>
<P>
   Contestants then try to guess Cerre's whereabouts by surfing the
Web. Those with the most correct answers are eligible to win a trip
around the world for two or Panasonic video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Cerre's itinerary so far has included stops in Italy, Jordan
(where he was momentarily detained at the Israel border during a
Middle East crisis) and Israel. His trip concludes in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   Although the whirlwind tour at times has been a daze for Cerre _
the 51-year-old roving reporter said he feels like he's ``going on
80'' _ it also has been extremely rewarding. ``After growing up
reading about all these things, I get to learn about and experience
them,'' Cerre said. ``Even for a jaded journalist like me, it gave
me a wonderful feeling and a better appreciation for Christmas.''

Growing weary of Furby, the Gremlinesque interactive toy reputed to
be this Christmas season's ``Tickle Me Elmo''?
</P>
<P>
   One Pacifica reader _ identifying herself as ``Sparky, assistant
to the Furby Coroner, San Francisco Furby medical examiner's

battery-operated critter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought our Furby long before the battle cries were heard at
FAO Schwarz and on eBay, and the darn thing broke _ so we cracked
him open like one of Willie Brown's French toilets hit by a Muni
bus,'' Sparky said. ``The Furby Autopsy is our technical analysis
of what makes Furby tick (or rather, giggle, burp and sing
`Strangers in the Night').''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, some may be upset when they behold their god with feet
of cheap molded plastic, but we serve the greater good (which is,
of course, making people laugh),'' she said.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Curtis Martin knew that Jets center
Kevin Mawae had been teasing him not long ago, saying, ``We haven't
seen you break a long one; we're starting to question your speed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just wait, you'll see,'' Martin replied.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sunday Mawae finally saw that long run. So did all the
other Jets and all the 71,50l spectators at Giants Stadium as
Curtis Martin slithered and sprinted 60 yards through the Carolina
Panthers for a touchdown for a 10-7 lead in the first quarter of
what evolved into a 48-21 rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curtis gave us the spark early,'' fullback Keith Byars was
saying now at his locker. ``We were riding on his shoulders. Every
time we gave him the ball, something good was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Yards were happening: 110 rushing yards in 21 carries, another
33 yards on two receptions. For the season, Martin now has 1,039
rushing yards, which puts him on two pedestals: only the sixth
running back with 1,000 or more rushing yards in each of his first
four National Football League seasons, and only the fourth Jets
running back with 1,000 or more rushing yards in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Martin joined some impressive names: Barry Sanders, Eric
Dickerson, Tony Dorsett, Earl Campbell and Terrell Davis on the NFL
list; Freeman McNeil, Adrian Murrell and John Riggins on the Jets'
list.
</P>
<P>
   But that 60-yard touchdown, along with a nifty 23-yard gain on a
swing pass from Vinny Testaverde, showed that Martin's legs are
finally healthy and strong after months of nagging damage. So are
his instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're like sniffing every little opening, then your body just
drifts into it,'' he said. ``Wherever the opening was, that's where
I was going to be. On that long run, it's like when I see the hole,
I got through the hole and it feels like I was jogging. I didn't
feel like I was running fast. I felt someone on my side, that's
when I realized I had daylight in front.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin is running at his best when the Jets must be at their
best if they are to finish in first place in their East Division
for the first time since the 1968 and 1969 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   With December arriving Tuesday, the Jets know that the weather
for three of their last four games isn't likely to be as balmy as
Sunday's kickoff temperature of a sunny 61 degrees. Seattle is next
Sunday's visitor, then the Jets play in Miami on a Sunday night and
go to Buffalo on a Saturday afternoon before returning for their
season finale against New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like cold weather,'' Martin said. ``I feel it gives me an
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin thrived in cold late-season and playoff games in New
England when the Patriots went to Super Bowl XXXI, but a year ago
he missed the Patriots' last three regular-season games and two
playoff games because of shoulder and abdominal injuries. And since
joining the Jets, he's had hamstring and thigh ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs are feeling better and better,'' he said. ``This was
the best that they've felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the Jets, Martin also has had the burden of his
six-year $36 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody puts $36 million after his name, it puts more
pressure on him,'' coach Bill Parcells said. ``But he's a good
back. He can play on my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, whose speech and manner projects the persona of a pro's
pro, dismissed the moneybags burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was making minimum, nobody wrote minimum before or
after my name,'' he said, alluding to his low salaries in his
seasons with the Patriots. ``My contract isn't going to make me any
better or any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   After the embarrassing losses to the Rams in St. Louis and to
the Colts in Indianapolis earlier in the season, the Jets made sure
they wouldn't be embarrassed by losing to Carolina, which is now a
lowly 2-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next four weeks, it's going to be like a playoff game for
us,'' Mawae said. ``We've got to treat it like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But if this Jets team is to survive these four ``playoff''
games, it must do what so many Jets teams have been unable to do:
win their December games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing four teams,'' Parcells said, ``that are in the
playoff picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Parcells' arrival as major domo, the Jets had lost 15
consecutive December games. And a year ago in their first season
under Parcells, they were 8-5 going into December, then lost two of
their last three games, including the 13-10 crusher in the season
finale in Detroit that knocked the Jets out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise's most damaging December collapse occurred in 1986
when the Jets, after being 10-1, lost their last five games,
including three in December.
</P>
<P>
   So when December dawns on Tuesday and it's time to turn the
pages on all the calendars in Weeb Ewbank Hall at the Jets'
complex, maybe it would be wise not to turn the pages. Just pretend
it's still November for the next four weeks.

 CHRON - SEE'S  
 SEE'S SEES THE LIGHT OF TECHNOLOGY  &HT;     By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   See's Candy is old-fashioned _ and proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   In its cavernous chocolate factory in South San Francisco,
workers still roll bon-bons by hand. See's began accepting credit
cards only 18 months ago. And its signature shops _ with their
black-and-white tiles and quaint white settees _ haven't changed
much since See's began selling candy 77 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the admittedly stodgy confectioner tiptoed into the tech age
in July, when it launched a Web site. Since then, See's has filled
2,700 electronic orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We surprised ourselves. We don't really do progressive things
at See's,'' said Richard Van Doren, vice president for marketing at
the company, which is owned by billionaire Warren Buffett's
Berkshire Hathaway.
</P>
<P>
   Although See's lagged its competitors in going online, its
technology is in some ways more advanced. For example, See's
software can determine whether chocolate will melt before it can be
delivered, based on the recipient's address.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a Web site, See's has been growing 10 percent or
more for the past five years and expects sales to reach a record
$300 million this year. That's outpaced candy-industry growth,
which has averaged about 6 percent a year for the past five years.
To maintain that edge, See's realized it needed to go online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a missed opportunity for them not to offer
electronic commerce,'' said Julia Pickar, an Internet industry
analyst at Zona Research in Redwood City. Setting up a Web site is
a relatively inexpensive way to attract customers, she said, and
See's might as well be in the same marketplace as competitors such
as Godiva.
</P>
<P>
   As See's enters its busiest season, the Web site is seeing
action. In the past week, the number of daily hits has jumped 60
percent, and the number of online orders hit a daily peak of 82.
That's tiny compared to e-commerce giants like Amazon.com, but
See's is delighted. The majority of its online orders come from
customers who haven't ordered from See's before, and many come from
customers who don't live near a store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody waits till the end (before the holidays). I'll be
interested to see what happens then,'' said a gleeful Greg Gibbons,
the company's management informations systems director. Gibbons is
ready: See's built the system to handle as many as 1,000 orders in
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The system can do more than simply take orders. Chocolate is
perishable, so See's promises two-day delivery. Based on the
customer's address, See's can tell almost instantly if an order
will arrive within two days and whether it needs special
heat-resistant packaging to keep the candy from melting in hot
climates.
</P>
<P>
   If the company can't be sure the recipient will pick up the
candy promptly _ because it's going to a post office box or a
military base, for instance _ the software program tells customers
to choose another shipping address or to order something that won't
melt, such as Peanut Brittle, Toffee-ettes or Almond Royal.
</P>
<P>
   The company moved slowly to the Internet, working with Uptime
Computer Solutions of San Jose for about nine months before the
site met See's standards. The site resembles a See's store: It has
a black-and-white border that looks like the floor tiles and, of
course, the familiar photograph of company founder Mary See.
</P>
<P>
   Although See's used its catalog as a model, it learned it
couldn't simply transfer it onto the Web, where graphics and
layouts need to be simpler and ordering must be quick and easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't put six products on a page like we do in the
catalog,'' Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a little culture shock, the transition to the Web was
relatively easy. Because of the catalog, the company already had an
ordering system in place. The Web was simply a new source of
orders, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gibbons is working to set up a rapid checkout system and
customer registration. The rapid checkout would be an online order
form that customers who already know what they want can get to
directly. Customer registration would allow See's to remind
candy-buyers via e-mail about important dates like birthdays and
anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real education when we came to the Web. But now we've
really embraced it,'' said Van Doren.
</P>
<P>
   Customers seem to like the online option. The first electronic
order, from a woman in Southern California, came attached with a
note exclaiming ``At last!''

GRETZKY AND GREAT TOGETHER ONCE MORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the first quarter of his 20th National Hockey
League season, Wayne Gretzky's statistics weren't exactly Great
Ones. He had only two goals, his shooting percentage was the worst
among Ranger forwards, his plus-minus ratio was second-worst on the
team and he led the league in turnovers. His foot speed, dwindling
for many years, seemed about the same. But the deft hands that have
created so many goals for so many others over so many seasons
seemed to have lost some of their creative qualities. His name was
nowhere near the top 10 scoring leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like I had a few bad games, and I probably started
to get down on myself,'' Gretzky said Sunday after he helped the
Rangers beat the Nashville Predators by 5-1 at Madison Square
Garden. ``No matter what happens, confidence plays such a big
part.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two games _ a tie in Pittsburgh on Friday and
Sunday's victory _ the 37-year-old Gretzky has shown better form.
After getting one assist against the Penguins, he got a goal and
two assists against the expansion Predators. It was his first goal
since Nov. 7 and his first 3-point game of the season. With Petr
Nedved joining the Rangers in last week's trade with the Penguins,
Gretzky now has less of a burden as the team's only accomplished
center. And with John MacLean and Kevin Stevens on his wings,
Gretzky may finally have found two veteran partners who can play at
his deliberate pace and capitalize on his playmaking savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken the pressure off me in the immediate sense that
teams are aware of him,'' Gretzky said of Nedved. ``Teams
understand that he's such a solid player. As time goes on here,
matchups could prove to be a little different over the next little
while.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his linemates, Gretzky said, ``Kevin's so big and strong
and MacLean's such a smart player that what you try to do is get
them the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   After Nedved and Gretzky gave the Rangers a 2-0 lead with
even-strength goals in the first 10 minutes, Adam Graves made it
3-0 on the power play at 14 minutes 12 seconds before Darren
Turcotte got one back for Nashville at 8:30 of the second. Gretzky
then set up Brian Leetch on the power play at 11:38 of the second
and Stevens at even strength at 6:57 of the third. Gretzky might
have scored another late in the game, but he cracked a shot off the
glass, wide of goalie Eric Fichaud, who replaced the starter Mike
Dunham in the second period after Dunham left with a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean had three assists, and most other Rangers played well
against a chippy team that preferred to play a wide-open style and
rarely bothered to cover Rangers, who were standing open in good
position for shots or skating in full stride for passes. It was
only the Rangers' second victory in eight games and it left them at
6-9-7, their 19 points in the standings even with the Predators
after 22 games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Richter, the Ranger goalie, faced no Nashville shots in the
first 15 minutes and then stopped 24 of the 25 that followed.
Niklas Sundstrom, despite taking a pounding from various Predators,
put five shots on net, set up Nedved's goal and showed signs of
coming out of his seasonlong slump.
</P>
<P>
   The statistical report showed the visitors out-hitting the
Rangers by 31-28. Many of those were gratuitous attempts to
intimidate that were unanswered. With the fighting specialist P.J.
Stock back on the Hartford farm club and his fellow ruffian Darren
Langdon out of uniform, the Rangers again appeared vulnerable to
bully tactics.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Rangers' first game at home after a 1-2-2 road trip,
and they next play eight times in 16 nights, beginning Tuesday
night at home against Florida. Behind the scenes, business deals
are evolving. Neil Smith, the Rangers' president and general
manager, said again Sunday that serious negotiations to sign Leetch
to a long-term contract will begin this week. Leetch could become
an unrestricted free agent on July 1. Smith also continues to seek
a sharpshooting wing through a trade. With 11 defensemen with NHL
experience either in New York or in Hartford, he has the depth at
that position from which to deal. With Richter and Dan Cloutier
guarding the net, one of them might also be available. With the
four forward lines a mix-and-match collection, it is hard to know
for sure who is expendable or coveted by other teams.
</P>
<P>
   John Muckler, the coach, has said the Rangers hope to be .500 by
the end of December, in place to make a playoff run in the second
half of the season. Since starting the season 0-4, his team has a
respectable 6-5-7 record with its group personality and personnel
still coming together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can look for good things in the future,'' Muckler
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gretzky, with most of his future behind him, there is
still the hope that he is rounding into respectable midseason form.
``You get to a level of confidence that you get your second wind
and your second energy,'' Gretzky said. ``The more you play, the
better you play. I just feel good right now.''

GE DIVISION MAY BUY JAPAN BANK'S LEASING UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that would give it a needed edge in Japan's corporate
leasing market, GE Capital Services Corp., the huge financial
services arm of General Electric Corp., may acquire the leasing arm
of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Although GE would not confirm the negotiations, which were
reported in several Japanese newspapers, people close to the
company say talks are in progress. But they say they believe that
the $900 billion yen (about $7.3 billion) cited in the newspapers
is more than GE is willing to pay. If it does pay that much, this
would be largest corporate acquisition to date in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital, whose 28 businesses include equipment rentals,
financing and insurance, contributes about 40 percent of General
Electric's revenue and profit. Some 30 percent of GE Capital's
assets are outside the United States. Gary Wendt, GE Capital's
chairman, has been quite vocal about wanting to beef up the
company's ``small but solid'' presence in the Asia-Pacific region.
GE Capital already has a sizable presence in life insurance and
other consumer finance businesses in Japan, but so far has been
only lightly involved in the leasing business.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Credit Bank's leasing arm would give GE Capital a
ready-made platform on which to build the kind of full-service
business, including fleet manangement and maintenance, that is its
hallmark in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely interested in exploring the leasing market
in Japan,'' said Mary Horne, a spokeswoman for GE Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Credit Bank, saddled with billions of yen worth of bad
real estate loans, is struggling to survive. The company filed for
the Japanese equivalent of bankruptcy reorganization in September,
and was nationalized last month.
</P>
<P>
   Financial experts say that its leasing arm is sound, and that
would make it prime fodder for GE Capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always interested in healthy assets that may lack good
management, marketing savvy, financial backing, anything we can
provide,'' Ms. Horne said. ``And that's particularly true in
markets where things may be tumultuous.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be other rescuers in the wings for Long-Term Credit if
the GE Capital deal falls through. Japanese newspapers reported
that Sony, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, and Industrial Bank of
Japan are also interested in the leasing unit, albeit at lower
prices than GE is said to be offering. And the Japanese papers
report that other potential non-Japanese acquirers have expressed
interest as well.

SATISFACTION FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you don't think defeating Notre Dame soothes
some of USC's wounds after its loss to UCLA, fast forward 12 months
from now.
</P>
<P>
   If USC loses to UCLA next November, the Trojans will be enjoying
a follow-up victory at the Coliseum against . . . Louisiana Tech.
Yes, beating the Irish sounds better already.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough to make up for losing to the Bruins, but it's worth
something nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it erases anything at all. When I think about
UCLA, it's hurtful,'' cornerback Daylon McCutcheon said. ``But
you're remembered for your last game and this is what we'll be
remembered for.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCutcheon and the rest of the seniors, it's almost a
unanimously pleasant feeling thinking about Notre Dame. They have
built a three-game winning streak against the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   For history buffs, only four other times in the storied rivalry
have the Trojans been able to defeat the Irish three consecutive
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our senior class, we wanted to set the standard and turn this
thing around,'' McCutcheon said. ``We started something against
Notre Dame and that's special. It feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   USC can look forward to a trip to the Holiday Bowl, if UCLA
makes the Fiesta Bowl and Arizona goes to the Rose Bowl, or at
worst, a trip to the Sun Bowl. But whatever happens in a bowl, it's
doubtful that the Trojans will feel as satisfied as they did after
shutting out Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing like defense, is there?'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
``It was just magnificent defense.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true. Just look at junior linebacker Chris Claiborne's
line score: Twelve tackles, three passes deflected and one
interception.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost impossible to downplay the impact Claiborne has on
the defense. And he should have made strides with the voters of the
Butkus Award, which goes to the nation's outstanding linebacker.
Not that he was worried about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every ABC game, I just try to go out there and do something,''
Claiborne said. ``It's a game where we were on national television
and you're the only game on in the whole country. It's special.''
</P>
<P>
   USC should have made an exemption Saturday night and allowed
Claiborne to be recognized with the seniors in the pregame farewell
ceremony. He certainly won't be back next season.
</P>
<P>
   On a larger scale, Hackett also deserves plenty of credit. He
got eight wins and should be proud of what he accomplished in a
rebuilding season. The program seems better off today than a year
ago, even after Claiborne turns pro in the next few weeks.
Hackett's also off to a fast start recruiting, and if he can entice
some linemen, the Trojans will easily be ready to move up in the
Pacific-10 Conference in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, Hackett would enjoy the success without
trying to be such a revisionist with the facts. He talked after the
game about Chad Morton being a ``first-year running back'' and how
far Morton had come this year, presumably under his tutelage.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he never saw Morton play tailback in high school, but
could he really be so oblivious that he didn't realize Morton
played tailback three games last season and three games his
freshman season?
</P>
<P>
   It's a small point and one that quickly gets forgotten after a
win over an archrival.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Two more defensive stats from the Notre Dame game: The
Irish's 217 yards in offense was its fewest against USC since 1980.
Notre Dame's 123 yards rushing was its lowest total against USC
since 1984. . . .
</P>
<P>
   USC emerged relatively unscathed. Defensive tackle Aaron
Williams suffered a sprained ankle and wide receiver Windrell Hayes
strained a ligament in his foot. &QL;

Chad Morton turned the game's momentum with his brilliant spin move

There's a tremendous difference when R. Jay Soward is healthy. It

OFFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
A week after being overwhelmed by UCLA, it rebounded nicely with a

year. &QL;

DEFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
Welcome back, Marc Matock. He started and recorded six tackles. Not
bad considering he missed five games with a fractured ankle. Ennis
Davis also made some big tackles after being out most of the week
with a sprained foot. &QL;

This should have wrapped up the Butkus Award for Chris Claiborne.
Mark Cusano also became a thorn in Notre Dame's side for one last

OK, Notre Dame's QBs were awful, but Daylon McCutcheon and Co. were

<P>
   ARMOUR, S.D. _ The railroad used to rumble through the
cornfields and cow pastures here, braiding this southeastern South
Dakota town into a necklace linked to the commercial cosmos of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But the freight trains don't come this way anymore. And
increasingly, the wild oceans of lavender pasqueflower and buffalo
grass and the fields of alfalfa and soybeans surround fading
farming towns that are trying to hold on to their people and
maintain their economic pulse.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of those people are like Ethel Mingo, a 73-year-old widow
who until recently was happily ensconced at 604 Henderson Avenue
here, a trim, whisper-yellow house on a red gravel road at the
western hem of this mile-square town.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mingo has affection for this community of 850 or so people,
even though, she says, ``you can't even buy a towel in Armour.''
But she thought her days here might be numbered after a ruptured
disk, spinal fusion surgery and a ``triple aneurysm the size of a
tennis ball'' left her legs beholden to a walker and her lungs
harnessed to an oxygen tank.
</P>
<P>
   She could no longer make it to the basement to do the laundry or
up the mud room steps to the kitchen. She feared that a retirement
home in a larger town was her only option.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Mingo was just the sort of person South Dakota's
maverick governor, William Janklow, had in mind when he came up
with a way to address his state's worst problems: rural towns
faltering as family farms went under; an exodus of young people;
and too many older people with homes they could no longer handle.
</P>
<P>
   Janklow said he thought that if he could supply the elderly with
smaller homes that were easier for them to manage, then they could
stay in their towns and turn their larger homes over to younger
families, maybe luring some new blood to the rural communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to help the small town maintain its viability,'' said
Janklow, who said his state has a high percentage of elderly _ 16
percent _ and the largest proportion of small towns _ 96 percent of
the state's communities have fewer than 5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't have the services they need in a small town,''
Janklow said, ``they'll have to go to another town. I tell people,
`Quit dreaming for a General Motors plant when you're a town of 300
people and start maintaining the economic viability of your
elderly.'''
</P>
<P>
   To implement his plan, Janklow tapped a resource that South
Dakota and other states have in great supply: prison inmates. The
governor assigned prisoners to build single-story houses, complete
with accessible entrances and bathrooms for the disabled. Anyone at
least 62 years old or disabled, who lives in a town with fewer that
5,000 residents, can buy one of the houses, and have it delivered
from the prison, all at cost.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mingo bought a 768-square-foot house last year for $19,000
and had it set it on a vacant lot across the street. She sold her
old three bedroom home for $35,000 _ less than its market value _
to Warren and Pam Parker, a couple moving into town because they
could not afford to keep their hog farm.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mingo can peer out her front window and see Mrs. Parker,
tending the snow-on-the-mountain flowers that she had left in the
front yard. And she can still drive the several blocks to her son's
drugstore on Main Street where she does the bookkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Janklow, a 59-year-old Republican with a reputation as a
stubborn prairie populist, who recently stopped Canadian
agriculture trucks for inspections in a protest of federal trade
policies, was elected this month to his fourth term as governor. He
served his first two terms from 1978 to 1987, and was elected again
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He believes in putting inmates to work partly, he acknowledges,
because of what he calls his ``juvenile delinquent'' past, when he
shot holes in the water tower of his hometown of Flandreau. He was
expelled from high school and a judge sent him to the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the toughest, most hard-nosed, right-wing conservative
you've ever met,'' Janklow said. ``I believe in punishment and I
believe in retribution.'' But he said he also believes in preparing
inmates for their release with job training that gives them
``dignity and self-respect.''
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota inmates wire schools for computers, put out forest
fires and build hunting cabins and outhouses for state parks. They
raise beetles that destroy a weed called purple loosestrife. When a
tornado leveled Spencer this spring, inmates were brought to the
town to help families sift through the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Under a vast sky recently, about 60 inmates at the
medium-security Springfield State Prison 116 miles southwest of
here pounded nails and slapped on sheet rock inside a high fence
topped with razor wire. Even murderers can join the work crews, but
everyone has to apply for the jobs, which pay 25 cents an hour.
Virgil Miller, the construction supervisor, says 275 inmates, of
about 700 in the prison, are on a waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Makes the time go by quick,'' said William Eutzy, 33, who is
serving a three-year sentence for forgery. Eutzy, wiring the second
bedroom of a house destined for the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation,
has earned an electrician's apprenticeship license at the
Springfield prison. ``When I get on the streets, I'm going to get
back on my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   In another house, Ron Huffaker, 29, sentenced to 10 years for
selling marijuana, was installing oak cabinets, made by inmates at
another prison. ``Every once in a while, an elderly lady will write
a letter,'' he said. ``Makes you kind of feel good that it's going
for a good cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Janklow's method of quality control is to exploit that feeling.
``I tell them, `If you don't do a good job, you've got to
understand you're not hurting me, you're hurting somebody's
grandma,'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the first crews of inmates proudly affixed wooden
plaques beside the front door that said ``Made by the Inmates of
Team 267,'' Janklow said that was taking things a bit too far. ``I
made them take the plaques off of the front of the houses,'' he
said. ``Now, they can put them inside the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   The inmates have also begun to build day care centers that are
sold to would-be entrepreneurs in small towns, where a shortage of
child care is one reason young families leave.
</P>
<P>
   Janklow neutralized opposition from home builders by making sure
the houses were small and built in small towns so big companies
would see no profit in building them. And small contractors get
work building foundations and garages or other extras for the
houses.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 263 houses have been sold to elderly and disabled people
in 135 small towns. In Woonsocket, Edwina and Aleck Larson bought
one after Mrs. Larson lost both of her legs to illness. In Menno,
Alta Herman, her memory starting to slip, set one up on her
daughter's land, so she can live on her own but be close to help.
</P>
<P>
   Three houses have been sold in Armour, named for the
meat-packing baron and, this time of year, rising from a blanket of
autumn-exhausted cornfields.
</P>
<P>
   One went to Lyle and Janice Dierks, who have lived here for 35
years. After Dierks, 63, and his wife, 57, both learned they had
cancer, they began looking for something easier to manage than
their aging two-story house on Main Street. After a two-year
search, the Dierks, whose son has moved away, figured they would
have to move to a city _ until they saw the inmate-built homes on
display at a state fair.
</P>
<P>
   They sold their big house to newcomers, Mike and Beth Adam, a
young couple who plan to stay until their two young children are
grown and who have redecorated with Adam's hunting trophies _
white-tailed deer heads and the pelt of a sleek black bear.
</P>
<P>
   The Dierkses' new house is 10 blocks away on the south end of
Main Street, where Dierks enjoys watching the harvest bustle at the
Armour grain elevator across the street. Besides, he said, ``I'm
right in the middle of my fishing lakes here. I'd hate to have to
give that up.''

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: Who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is not a very large
difference between Florida State (No. 1) and Tennessee (2), but the
difference between Kansas State (3) and UCLA (4) is very small.

HOUSE CONSERVATIVES LOBBY AGAINST COMPROMISE ON CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the House nearly deadlocked on whether to
impeach President Clinton, several leading conservative lawmakers
stepped up their effort Sunday to sway undecided colleagues and
ward off a compromise resolution of the president's sex scandal and
its alleged cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle intensified amid agreement that a House vote next
month to impeach Clinton could pass or fail by a handful of votes.
</P>
<P>
   With the Judiciary Committee to hear testimony Tuesday from two
women who have been convicted of lying under oath about sex, as
Clinton is accused of having done, the top Republican vote counter
in the House rebutted predictions that the chamber will reject
articles of impeachment against the president.
</P>
<P>
   The majority whip, Tom DeLay of Texas, also said he will oppose
permitting the full House to vote on an alternative resolution,
such as a congressional censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the majority of the House will uphold the rule of law
and impeach the president and send the case to the Senate,'' DeLay
said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``I think it would be a travesty to
the Constitution for us to lower the standards for breaking the law
by not voting impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay said he has not counted the votes for Clinton's
impeachment. And a moderate Republican, Representative Peter King
of New York, said he knows ``at least 15 or 20'' GOP colleagues who
will oppose voting for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If only 15 Republicans break ranks, DeLay would need at least
five Democrats to vote for articles of impeachment if they are to
pass, and Democratic leaders say this is unlikely. Republicans hold
an edge of 228 to 206 in the House. A lone independent,
Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont, is expected to back
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   King, like many House members who plan to oppose articles of
impeachment, said Clinton's alleged cover-up of his sexual affair
with former intern Monica S. Lewinsky was ``reckless and
reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong, it's criminal, it's indictable, but I don't
believe it's impeachable,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's effort to impeach Clinton was bolstered by anger among
many conservatives over the president's steadfast refusal to admit
he lied under oath in a civil deposition in the recently settled
sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by Paula Corbin Jones
or in testimony before a federal grand jury overseen by the
independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a sworn affidavit he submitted last week to the
Judiciary Committee, acknowledged misleading people about the
Lewinsky affair but denied any legal culpability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to go and commit a crime,'' said Representative
Lindsey O. Graham, a South Carolina Republican who serves on the
committee. ``It's another thing to flaunt it in front of the
American people and never admit to your wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, an influential conservative who had appeared to be open
to a possible compromise resolution a week earlier, Sundaynearly
slammed the door on the prospect Sunday. He described Clinton as
``an unrepentant perjurer who should lose his job unless he changes
his tone with the American people and reconciles himself with the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Judiciary Committee tentatively scheduled to vote late
next week on proposed articles of impeachment, Clinton and his
lawyers are expected soon to submit a final memorandum defending
their position that he has committed no crime or impeachable
offense.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House is focused mainly on promoting a lesser
alternative to impeachment. The effort has gained an unlikely ally
in Representative Paul McHale, a Pennsylvania Democrat who earlier
called for Clinton to resign because of the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Although McHale said ``shame and honor should have compelled''
Clinton to resign in August, he argued that broad public opposition
to removing the president from office has since altered the
political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   McHale compared impeaching a president without the public's
approval to declaring war without public support. ``In both
cases,'' he said, ``I think it would be profoundly unwise.''
</P>
<P>
   McHale has thrown his support behind plans by several committee
Democrats to offer a harshly worded rebuke of Clinton as an
alternative to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans on the Judiciary Committee plan a counterattack
Tuesday with a day-long hearing on ``the consequences of perjury
and related crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the scheduled witnesses are Pam Parsons, a former
women's basketball coach at the University of South Carolina, and
Barbara Battalino, a former psychiatrist at a Veterans Affairs
medical center in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons was sentenced to four months in prison in 1985 for
falsely denying in a civil deposition that she had sex with one of
her players. The deposition stemmed from a lawsuit Parsons filed
against Time Inc., the parent company of Sports Illustrated, which
published a story about her affair with the player.
</P>
<P>
   Battalino was sentenced last year to six months of home
detention after she was convicted of perjury for lying under oath
in a civil deposition about her sexual relationship with a former
male patient.
</P>
<P>
   Battalino's patient sued her for harassment, and the evidence
against her included secretly recorded phone conversations between
Battalino and the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Battalino, in a recent television interview, said she hoped that
Clinton ``will somehow or another have to have a similar degree of
punishment than I have had.''
</P>
<P>
   The witness list for Tuesday's hearing also includes two federal
judges and two military officers. Democrats have also asked that
several legal scholars testify, including Alan Dershowitz, a
Harvard Law School professor.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Judiciary Committee is scheduled to take closed-door
depositions today from three individuals familiar with former White
House volunteer Kathleen Willey's allegation that Clinton groped
her near the Oval Office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The individuals are Nathan Landow, a Democrat fund-raiser who
discussed the allegation with Willey; Bruce R. Lindsey, a White
House deputy counsel and close adviser to Clinton; and Robert S.
Bennett, Clinton's lawyer in the Jones case.

ALEUT SACRED OBJECTS TO BE AUCTIONED AT SOTHEBY'S DESPITE
PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Calif., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By MARGARETT LOKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite tribal protests, two pieces of Aleut Indian
art will be included in an auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan on
Wednesday, the auction house and the seller say.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe contends that part of its cultural heritage has been
lost and should be restored. The seller contends that the objects,
a wood mask dated between 1510 and 1660 and an early bentwood
hunting hat, may well be better off in private hands.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Young, cultural heritage director of a tribal
organization representing Aleut tribes of the Aleutian and Pribilof
Islands in Alaska, asked Sotheby's and one of its consignors,
Adelaide de Menil, to withdraw the two pieces because they are
``part of cultural traditions that have been lost and Aleuts are
struggling to regain.'' Ms. Young has also suggested that Ms. de
Menil donate the objects to the association.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Menil turned down the request; her husband, the
anthropologist Edmund Carpenter, responded last Friday to Ms.
Young's letter, noting that since 1990, federal law ``allows your
organization to take possession of virtually any object relating to
Aleut heritage in virtually every museum in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``as a safety factor,'' it was better that
privately held specimens remain so. ``Tribal museums still lack
adequate funding to guarantee protection,'' he wrote. ``I fear much
may be lost. We agree on goals; we differ on immediate action.''
(Both Ms. Young and Carpenter made copies of their letters
available to The New York Times.)
</P>
<P>
   The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of
1990 requires federally financed museums and institutions to
compile inventories of their Indian collections and to work with
tribes and Indian nations on the return of their human remains,
ritual objects and items of cultural patrimony. Earlier this month,
for instance, the National Museum of the American Indian in
Manhattan returned more than 400 sacred masks to the six-member
Iroquois confederation, near Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors, dealers and private institutions like auction
houses, however, are generally not bound by this law. And in recent
years, Indian groups have publicly and privately tried to persuade
collectors to accept their view of ritual artifacts and their
importance in the continuing cultural life of Indian communities.
</P>
<P>
   Many American Indians and their non-Indian advocates uphold the
traditional notion that ritual objects are living, sacred beings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Young, a non-Indian archeologist trained at the University
of Pennsylvania and the Smithsonian Institution, who has had 20
years' experience working in museums in Alaska, explained that the
wood mask in the Sotheby's auction ``was not created for sale but
for ceremonial purposes.'' It was then put in a cave and ``left to
return to earth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing that this object represents to people
nowadays,'' she said, ``would be the spirituality their ancestors
had, as well as their creative and artistic qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Young is not arguing for the return of the pieces because
they are ceremonial or religious objects. Rather, she contends,
Aleuts, who are mostly Russian Orthodox, need to have these objects
close by and accessible in order to learn about their rich cultural
past. Aleuts are undergoing ``an unprecedented cultural revival,''
she said, but most of what has survived of their exquisitely
crafted objects is not in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Aleut culture and people were almost wiped out by
the Russians in the mid-18th century. The islands were sold to the
United States in 1867 with the purchase of Alaska. ``Things calmed
down,'' Ms. Young said, and ``communities could go back to the
traditions that they could remember.'' Then came World War II, when
the Japanese took the residents of one island to a prisoner-of-war
camp in Japan, and the United States removed the rest of the Aleuts
to internment camps.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said he recognized that ``collectively the white
culture has a lot to answer for.'' But he was disturbed, he said,
by a political correctness in which ``we treat all victims as
heroes.'' He said he had a deep interest in Indian cultures and,
with his wife, had long acquired tribal pieces on behalf of public
museums. Even though he believes that people should ``possess and
identify with their own history,'' he said, ``art is not something
you inherit; it's something you earn. And the makers of the objects
are artists, the objects examined by a community of alert critics,
their own people.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was not sanguine about a large-scale removal of
objects to Indian heritage centers. Many of the major Eskimo sites
in Alaska are being looted, he said. On a recent visit to Point
Hope in Alaska, where there was supposed to be a protected Eskimo
site of hundreds of Ipiutak house ruins dating from about A.D.
600-1200, he said he found ample evidence of recent looting.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Young said she understood Carpenter's concern about
preservation. But, she said, ``every Alaska native group that I
know who is building a tribal heritage center is concerned about
the preservation of objects in their care.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Young's tribal group and others like it are being helped in
their quest to recover ritual objects by the Manhattan-based
American Indian Ritual Object Repatriation Foundation. Its
president, Elizabeth Sackler, a daughter of Arthur Sackler, a noted
collector of antiquities, created her foundation soon after a 1991
Sotheby's auction when the Hopi and Navajo tribes unsuccessfully
tried to have three sacred masks withdrawn from the auction block.
At the auction, Ms. Sackler purchased the masks and returned the
objects to the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   The Aleuts are not the only Indian tribe seeking to halt the
auction of objects in Sotheby's sale on Wednesday. Dale Ann Frye
Sherman, the repatriation coordinator of the Yurok tribe in
Northern California, sent a fax to Sotheby's Sunday, requesting
that the consignor consider withdrawing from the sale an important
apron used in religious ceremonies ``until such time as we can find
a way to buy it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the foundation, a collector recently returned a basket
cap to the Yurok tribe. ``This summer,'' Ms. Sherman said, ``it
came and danced in ceremonies.''
</P>
<P>
   The skirt, or apron, worn by the dancer was similar to the one
in the Sotheby's sale, with its intricate rows of shells. The
essence of the skirt at Sotheby's, she added, ``is a celebration of
life and it was made so that the creator could see it and know that
we the community are grateful.''

UCLA FALLS TO CREIGHTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Typical of the UCLA men's soccer team's 2-0 defeat
to Creighton in Sunday's NCAA second round:
</P>
<P>
   Defender Nick Paneno, a La Canada High graduate, came down with
the flu late Saturday. It kept him up for much of the night.
</P>
<P>
   When Sunday arrived, Paneno still felt the effects, but he
didn't want to tell anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want people to think I was ill,'' Paneno said.
</P>
<P>
   So he told UCLA coach Sigi Schmid, who decided to start Paneno
anyway. Paneno made a go of it, like the rest of his teammates, but
things caught up. Paneno tired and came out after 41 minutes.
Later, he returned and played the final 25{ minutes.
</P>
<P>
   So it went with the Bruins (17-4), the defending NCAA champions.
Paneno was ill. Forward Seth George played with an injured ankle.
So did defender Shaun Tsakiris.
</P>
<P>
   So did midfielder Sasha Victorine, who played out of position
because St. Francis High graduate Pete Vagenas hurt his ankle in
Friday's practice and couldn't play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When five of your top 14 are injured, it takes a lot away,''
Schmid said. ``It hurts our depth and continuity because guys like
Seth can't train during the week. I was hoping to sneak in another
week and get everybody back healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   So there they were, reduced to gutty-little-Bruins status. But
at this point in the season, as Schmid said, ``The game of soccer
is one where every team has its chances. You have to convert
them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's harder on a muddy field, and for UCLA, it's especially
harder against a three-forward offense. Washington handed the
Bruins their only other home loss this season Nov. 13 using the
same approach.
</P>
<P>
   Against Creighton, UCLA struggled for ball control and often
failed to put foot to ball on open shots. The Bruins pressured in
the first 15 minutes, but by the time they regained control, there
was about 12 minutes remaining and Creighton (16-3-2) had a
two-goal lead. UCLA peppered Creighton goalie Tom Zawislan in the
final 12 minutes, but most came right at him as he earned his
seventh shutout this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to make any great saves,'' Zawislan said.
``Everything was pretty routine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had eight straight NCAA road games,'' Creighton coach
Bret Simon said. ``That has helped these players get used to being
in the lion's den and keep composure.''
</P>
<P>
   You also have to be able to stop the big-match players.
Creighton, which started its program in 1990, has one in midfielder
Richard Mulrooney, the Missouri Valley Conference's player of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Mulrooney set up both Bluejays goals giving him 51 career
assists, an amount only six other Division I players have reached.
</P>
<P>
   In the 17th minute, he nailed a free kick ahead to defender
Peter Henning, who headed it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask the guys on the team, they'll say we're pretty
confident on set plays,'' Mulrooney said. ``I hit a good ball and
Pete got a head on it.''
</P>
<P>
   His second assist, in the 60th minute, might have been more
impressive. Standing just outside the penalty area, Mulrooney could
have passed ahead to a teammate in front of the goal, but that
teammate would have been offside. So Mulrooney passed into the left
corner where Mike Bustos was breaking. Bustos' centering pass to
Brian Mullan found the back of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``His ability to make right decisions and be patient is key,''
Simon said.

SPORTS COLUMN: WITH THREE UNDEFEATEDS, BCS HAS PROBLEMS

 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three big games remain in a wild college football season, and
the things we know for sure can be counted on one hand.
</P>
<P>
   One, Ricky Williams of Texas earned his Division I-A career
rushing record and deserves the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Two, Idaho will face Southern Mississippi in the Humanitarian
Bowl, and Tulane's reward for an undefeated campaign is a matchup
against Brigham Young in the Liberty Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Three, Notre Dame's 10-0 loss to Southern California knocks them
out of a Bowl Championship Series game.
</P>
<P>
   Four, the Syracuse Orangemen are in a BCS game, and bowl
organizers who wear more gaudy sports coats aren't too happy about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Five, if the BCS favorites all win next weekend _ top-ranked
Tennessee plays Mississippi State, second-ranked UCLA faces Miami
and third-rated Kansas State takes on Texas A&AMP;M _ someone will be
left lamenting about the unfairness of it all.
</P>
<P>
   All of this leaves a whole other hand for the so-called keepers
of the college game _ the news media, coaches, conference
commissioners and bowl organizers _ to slap each other around for
agreeing to this computer-driven BCS formula. Or they can use that
free hand to twist each other's arms to do the right thing and make
the most meaningful bowl matchups happen.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens when the three top unbeaten teams finish
their seasons next Saturday, the BCS has added interest and fueled
conversation about college football. It isn't quite the March
Madness of the basketball tournament, but the mystery of the BCS
ranking has raised the game's awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Besides matching No. 1 against No. 2 in a true title game this
year at the Fiesta Bowl, BCS organizers have said repeatedly that
their secondary mission was to make the Rose, Orange and Sugar
bowls games that people wanted to see. Heading into the final
weekend, however, both goals are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   If Tennessee, UCLA and Kansas State each win, the Volunteers and
the Bruins will meet in the Fiesta Bowl because the Wildcats can't
make up enough computer points in the strength-of-schedule
component of the formula _ especially after Texas A&AMP;M lost to Texas
on Friday. That is tough for the BCS. It's unfortunate that any
undefeated team is locked out of the title game, but the Wildcats
happen to be ranked No. 1 in the coaches poll.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the year, the coaches agreed to award their
final No. 1 ranking to the winner of the Fiesta Bowl as a way to
legitimize the claim that it was a title game. Now, they are in the
strange position of having to abandon the team that they believed
was best and crown another champion for no reason other than
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this embarrassment can be compounded depending on what
the Rose, Sugar and Orange bowls decide to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl is locked into Big Ten champion Wisconsin (10-1),
and its organizers appear to want to stay out of the back-room
deal-making by selecting Arizona (11-1). The Wildcats have never
appeared in the Rose Bowl. Their only loss is to UCLA, and the
bowl's traditional Big Ten-Pac-10 flavor will remain intact. The
game's organizers have no incentive to jeopardize their gate.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams travel well, and if the Bruins manage to lose at
Miami, they will bump Arizona because they won the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we have to be UCLA fans,'' Arizona quarterback Keith
Smith acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   So that leaves Kansas State to the Sugar Bowl. But getting the
matchup the Wildcats deserve is problematic. Florida State (11-1)
is ranked fourth in both polls, as well as in the BCS, and has
impressed The New York Times computer so much that it has the
Seminoles ranked No. 1. Their sole loss was early in the season and
they have played one of the strongest schedules in the country,
with victories over Texas A&AMP;M, Florida, Southern Cal and Georgia
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida State is the Atlantic Coast Conference champion and
that league has a tie-in with the Orange Bowl, which doesn't want
to give up the Seminoles _ especially when Syracuse (8-3) is the
likely opponent. It doesn't matter that in Donovan McNabb the
Orangemen have one of the most exciting players in the game. Or
that Syracuse lost one thriller to Tennessee and won another
against Virginia Tech over the course of a grueling season.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Bowl can't count on central New York to migrate south
to watch its team, so it needs the numbers that Bobby Bowden and
Florida State will bring. Ohio State (10-1) is the alternative to
Florida State, and the Buckeyes are not ikely to draw as many
people.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Buckeyes are left to test Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what we've done, for goodness' sakes,'' Ohio State Coach
John Cooper said. ``We had eight games over 500 yards total
offense; we led the Big Ten in total offense. We averaged 7.7 yards
every time we snapped the ball in the Michigan game against a
defense that, the last eight weeks of the season, some people
thought was the best in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes also lost late to Michigan State and ranked behind
Florida State in every poll and computer service. Their schedule is
far weaker than that of the Seminoles. Yes, it might be a good
game. But Kansas State might be in a position to win a split
championship. The Wildcats are a solid No. 2 in the media poll and
if UCLA _ ranked No. 3 by the news media _ were to beat Tennessee,
it could open the door for the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   No one may be clear on who is No. 1 and No. 2, but every measure
points to Florida State being among the nation's top four teams.
The BCS may not be able to put together a definitive title game,
but if it can match its No. 1 team against its No. 2 team, it
should be able to match its No. 3 and No. 4 teams with some
forceful arm-twisting.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State deserves that game and the chance to capture a part
of a split title.

SEARCH CONTINUES FOR ESCAPEE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By JIM HENDERSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HUNTSVILLE _ Prison officials Sunday appeared to be digging in for
a longer-than-anticipated search for a death row inmate who escaped
from the Ellis I Unit late Thanksgiving night.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, escapees are caught within a couple of
hours,'' said Gary Johnson, director of Institutions Division of
the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. ``If they are not caught
within a few hours, it can become extended.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, convicted killer Martin E. Gurule, 29, had been
outside the prison walls for more than 60 hours, eluding
bloodhounds and avoiding detection by the sparsely inhabited woods
south and east of the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe he is inside the perimeter,'' said Johnson,
referring to the six-square-mile area that was cordoned off within
an hour of the escape.
</P>
<P>
   Martin went over two razor-wire topped fences and fled into the
woods shortly after midnight Friday, authorities said. Six other
death row inmates also attempted to flee but surrendered when
guards fired at them.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates have been interviewed extensively by investigators,
Johnson said, and they have not indicated that the escape included
plans beyond getting outside the walls _ one factor that leads
authorities to believe that Gurule has not gone far.
</P>
<P>
   TDCJ officers have continued to maintain the original perimeter
and the search was stepped up on Sunday as state troopers began
stopping and searching cars entering and exiting settlements and
subdivisions in the area.
</P>
<P>
   If Gurule is still in the area, he may try to hide under a
vehicle, officers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, he's going to get tired,'' Johnson said. ``He's
going to get cool at night and hot during the day and he couldn't
have had much sleep since Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reliable sightings of the escapee, Johnson
said, but that could change as residents of the area return home
from holiday trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them could discover their house(s) have been broken
into or cars were stolen _ things we don't know about now,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the escape, officers have been called to three residences
in the area, but none produced a lead, they said.
</P>
<P>
   A house was broken into but the only missing items were a pillow
case and some silverware, authorities said. In another, a mobile
home was believed to have been burglarized but nothing was taken,
they added.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, a resident of Riverside reported that he had
found an intruder _ matching Gurule's description _ under his house
and fired several shots at him with a semiautomatic pistol,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs picked up a scent, and officers said they found no spent
casings. Shortly before midnight, they withdrew from the location
and there was speculation it was a ``crackpot call.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that he was disappointed but not surprised by the
absence of sightings. Escapees often find a place to ``lie down''
and try to wait out a search, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Like others involved in the manhunt, Johnson said he is counting
on the elements and the terrain to force Gurule's surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleep deprivation is a big thing,'' Johnson said. ``He
(Gurule) couldn't be getting any sleep out there. We've had three
helicopters providing air cover. We've had dog teams out there
every two or three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear dogs yelping, you don't know where they are
going or where they are coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurule, 29, was awaiting execution for the 1992 slaying of two
men during a restaurant robbery in Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said he and the other six death row inmates cut a
small hole in a recreation yard fence, made their way to the roof
of their cell block and hid there for three hours before
approaching the fences.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said prison guards fired at least 18 shots at them.
While the others dropped to the ground and surrendered, Gurule
scaled the two outside fences using clothing or a blanket to help
protect him from the razor wire, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   They said that blood on the wire indicated that Gurule may have
been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that they believe that the hole in the
recreation yard's fence was cut with a hacksaw, which has not been
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have just been a hacksaw blade,'' TDCJ spokesman Glen
Castleberry said. ``It might have been just a small piece of a
hacksaw blade.''
</P>
<P>
   The manhunt has involved an estimated 500 law-enforcement
officers but Johnson said they are not beating the bushes on foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would contaminate the area,'' he said. The prison's
bloodhounds are not trained to recognize the unique scent of an
individual, he said, but will track any human scent.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, most of the officers have been deployed on foot along
two farm roads that form two sides of the perimeter. At any given
time, about 250 of them maintain those stationary positions, each
within sight of the positions on either side of them.
</P>
<P>
   Only the dogs and the horsemen who accompany them have ventured
into the rugged landscape where Gurule is believed to be hiding.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Keyshawn Johnson stood outside the New
York Jets' locker room late on Sunday afternoon, holding forth for
yet another wave of reporters in the wake of a 48-21 Jets victory.
</P>
<P>
   The star receiver had enjoyed another stellar day: 3 receptions
for 77 yards. But his biggest play had come on the run, and that's
what everyone had crowded around to hear about.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second quarter, Johnson executed a perfect
end around. He had turned the corner, which opponents had doubted
that he could do, and he had turned upfield and outrun the
secondary, which opponents had doubted that he could do.
</P>
<P>
   Now Johnson was crowing. ``I've asked for that play to be put in
our play book,'' Johnson said. ``I know that I can get around that
corner. Everybody says, `He doesn't have the necessary speed, he's
not a fast receiver, he's a possession receiver.' You always try to
prove a point, you always try to prove people wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was interrupted in midthought as the door to the Jets'
locker room swung open. Out walked Bryan Cox, the volatile outside
linebacker. Cox, accompanied by his young son, Bryan Jr., coaxed
his son to ask Johnson to autograph his hat.
</P>
<P>
   This was a great snapshot: The Jets' two most outspoken and
bodacious players caught in a semitender moment. Each player had
achieved a milestone on this afternoon: Johnson's touchdown was his
first running touchdown as a professional. Cox's third-quarter sack
of Steve Beuerlein in the end zone was the first safety of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox hadn't seen Johnson's touchdown run. ``You didn't see my
T.D.?'' Johnson asked, his voice laced with a trace of
disappointment. Cox hadn't, but there was something else that he
did see. ``I saw that linebacker run you down,'' he said. ``Tell
them about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Cox. He was referring to a play in the third quarter
when Johnson caught a pass and ran 37 yards only to be caught from
behind by Kinnon Tatum, a 6-foot, 222-pound linebacker. Johnson
finished signing the cap and Cox and his son began walking away.
But now suddenly the receiver had gone from basking in the sun to
explaining himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get going,'' Johnson said, trying to explain why he
had been caught from behind. ``For me to stop and start again, it's
kind of difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cox just walked away with a smug smile on his face, acting
as if he hadn't heard. In a teasing way on an otherwise great day
for the Jets, Cox was reminding his young teammate that the hard
part of the season is yet to come, that in the long run it's what
you don't do that sends teams home frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day Cox had played down his own big play, which
resulted in the safety. ``It was good,'' he said. ``But you really
have to be blessed to get those kinds of plays. I was able to run
in free on that play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said that he was disappointed in the two touchdowns the
Jets' defense had allowed in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still immature,'' Cox said. ``We still didn't put our
feet on their throats when we had them down. That's something that
a great team has to do. I was disappointed that we didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox was echoing what Jets Coach Bill Parcells had said during
his post-game remarks. Asked continually about the game and what it
meant, Parcells, answering sharply and shortly, said, ``This was a
good game, a good game to get out of.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, like Cox, also played down Johnson's rushing
touchdown. ``That wasn't all there was to this game,'' he said. ``I
know that it was esthetically pleasing, but that's not what this
game was about.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Parcells if Johnson still had room to improve.
Parcells rolled his eyes and said in an exasperated tone of voice,
``Are you kidding me?'' Parcells spoke of nuances yet to be
mastered by Johnson: running pass routes, reading coverages. ``This
guy has got a lot to learn,'' Parcells said. ``An awful lot. I
guess I'm just a little harder to please than most.''
</P>
<P>
   On a winning afternoon, a bold young player, a cagey veteran and
a wise old coach began preparing for a grueling final stretch. The
only time Cox became passionate was when he referred to comments he
had made last week about racism by the National Football League. He
made the comments after the league fined him $10,000 as a result of
two hits he made on opposing players in last Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Cox said his error was not the content of his
statements but their timing. ``I feel that the things I said this
week, although they may have been very accurate, weren't timely,''
he said. ``I said what I said, but I said it at the wrong time. I
took away from the preparation my team was doing. It didn't take
away from it, as it turns out, but it could have.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Jets begin a hopeful march toward the playoffs and
payoffs. One young player, Johnson, is exuberant, but the veterans
like Cox begin to get nervous. They know how slender the thread is
between winning and losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel good that our team came to play today and didn't
let my situation be a distraction,'' Cox said. ``We've proven that
we can win at home. But now we've got to prove that we can do it on
the road.'' &QL;

 JETS, GETTING SERIOUS, ROUT PANTHERS, 48-21 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Now, the New York Jets say, they are
getting serious. And on Sunday they proved it on the field.
</P>
<P>
   They continued their biggest point-scoring splurge in 30 years
with a commanding 48-21 rout of the Carolina Panthers at Giants
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most points the Jets had scored in a game since 1986,
and it was the seventh straight game in which they have scored at
least 20 points. The last time that happened, Weeb Ewbank was
coach, Joe Namath was in charge of the offense, Matt Snell was
running, Don Maynard was catching and the Jets were headed to their
only Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows how far the 1998 edition can go? This much is certain:
They have an 8-4 record, having won six of their last seven games;
they are tied with Miami for first place in the American Football
Conference East, and winning the division title is in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' Vinny Testaverde said, ``that if we run the
table, we win the division.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, in a crushing performance against the 2-10 Panthers, the
Jets overcame their unsettling inability this season to beat the
league's have-nots. They scored in a variety of ways: on Bryan
Cox's first career safety; on wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson's
first career run; twice on Testaverde-to-Wayne Chrebet passes, and
four times on field goals off John Hall's suddenly accurate foot.
And along the way a newly healthy Curtis Martin rushed for a pair
of touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a good one to get out of the way,'' coach Bill
Parcells said. ``Now we can concentrate on our conference.'' The
Jets face the Seattle Seahawks here next Sunday, then finish with
games against their leading division rivals, the Dolphins, Bills
and Patriots, all of whom they have beaten once.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers came into Sunday's game reminding the Jets of their
earlier losses to the Colts (2-10), Ravens (5-7) and Rams (3-9).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen it before,'' Testaverde said. ``What we didn't want
to happen is what happened to us in previous games.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no fear of that. Not with Martin amassing 110 yards on
only 21 carries, or Chrebet snaring seven passes for 107 yards, or
Johnson adding 77 more on three receptions. Testaverde completed 76
percent of his passes (16 of 21 for 255 yards, with the two
touchdowns and no interceptions), and his touchdown-to-interception
ratio now stands at 20-4.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, meanwhile, sacked the Panthers' Steve Beuerlein
five times. Anthony Pleasant, a quiet end on a no-name,
predominantly free-agent defensive line, got to Beuerlein twice,
while the always active linebacker Mo Lewis had eight tackles and
two assists to lead the Jets for a second straight game. The
Panthers were held to 82 rushing yards while the Jets' offensive
line helped block for 201.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers were overshadowed by the growing sense of
urgency that the Jets finally seem to have accepted, and appear
able to handle. It was their second straight powerful performance,
coming only a week after they routed the Oilers, 24-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we had to prove it to ourselves,'' Martin said,
``but it's what a good team does.''
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed to bother the Jets hardly at all when the Panthers
grabbed a 7-3 lead on their first possession. Fred Lane's 1-yard
touchdown run was set up when the Jets blew their assignments: On
third-and-11, Jerome Henderson dashed onto the field too late to be
in position to cover the dangerous Rocket Ismail, and Corwin Brown
could not handle him. Beuerlein connected with Ismail on a 62-yard
play, the longest pass against the Jets this season.
</P>
<P>
   But two plays after Lane's score, Martin produced his longest
run as a Jet, 60 yards, for the Jets' first touchdown. He cut this
way and that over his beloved artificial turf _ a surface that is
likely to be replaced by grass next year in Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like turf,'' Martin said after a game that included several
pinball-machine type runs, in which he spun and bounced off
players. ``I think I'm faster on it, but I'll do whatever the
majority of the guys want.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it went, a powerful, efficient ground game, a pressure
defense doing so many things right. The offense, orchestrated from
high above the stadium by the coordinator Charlie Weis, even called
on Johnson to try an end-around midway through the second period
and it was good for a 35-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing a good job utilizing the talents I have on the
field,'' said Johnson, who always praises those he believes are
smart enough to give him the ball.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any question which way the game was headed, Martin
provided the answer early in the third period. After Aaron Glenn's
career-high fifth interception of the season, the Jets had the ball
on the Panthers' 30. Testaverde tossed a 19-yard pass to Keith
Byars, who knocked Kevin Greene out of the game in a
helmet-to-helmet collision when the linebacker tried to tackle him.
Martin then went over from 1-yard out for a 29-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina was backed up on the next drive, thanks to one of its
10 penalties and a good kickoff by Hall. Cox, a week after his
controversial performance against the Oilers that led to a $10,000
fine for unnecessary roughness, sacked Beuerlein in the end zone,
giving the Jets two points and setting up a free kick that they
quickly turned into a 36-yard Testaverde-to-Chrebet touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   The defense relaxed, yielding a pair of Carolina touchdowns, but
early in the final period Testaverde and Chrebet connected again,
this time for 21 yards. Chrebet was in on the play instead of
Johnson, who was, according to Testaverde, ``a little nicked up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days,'' Beuerlein said later, ``it goes like this.'' Many
of the fans in the crowd of 71,501 had seen the Jets have those
kinds of days only a few years ago. Perhaps that is why most of
them were still around in the fourth quarter. This is still sort of
new.

TEAMS COMPETING FOR SAME FREE AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a month or so, the Mets and the Baltimore Orioles have
talked about a possible deal for Mets catcher Todd Hundley. But
now, instead of being trading partners, they have a growing rivalry
as they compete for the same free agents, Robin Ventura and B.J.
Surhoff.
</P>
<P>
   The teams had both made offers to Surhoff, who is scheduled to
visit the Mets Tuesday, but during the weekend the Orioles threw
their money into the ring for Ventura, too. The Mets had offered
Ventura, a 31-year-old third baseman, $28 million for four years;
the Orioles raised them by about $1 million a year. Ventura is
believed to be looking for more than that.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles also enhanced their offer to Surhoff. They did not
guarantee a fourth year, which the Mets have not done either, but
the Orioles made it possible for the fourth year to become
guaranteed depending on the number of games he starts. The
Pittsburgh Pirates have offered Surhoff, 34, four guaranteed years,
and that is what he would like from the Orioles and the Mets, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles' Ventura initiative is intriguing because if they
sign him, Cal Ripken Jr. _ who in 1997 switched from a permanent
spot at shortstop to third base _ would move to first base. A club
official said that the possibility had been discussed with Ripken
and that he would be reluctantly amenable to a switch.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets signed Ventura, it would also necessitate a switch.
Edgardo Alfonzo would move to second base from third base.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Orioles stepped up, only the Mets had made a serious
offer for Ventura, who came back this year from a broken leg and
hit 21 home runs and drove in 91 runs for the Chicago White Sox.
Since the Orioles made their offer, Ventura's agent, John Boggs,
has spoken with Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, to
determine what the Mets' next move, if any, will be.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have not indicated that they would sign both Ventura
and Surhoff, but the Orioles are prepared to do that. The Orioles
would also sign Surhoff, who has played for them the last three
years, even if they reach agreement with Albert Belle, which they
expect to do in the next couple of days. Belle would play left
field and Surhoff would move to right.
</P>
<P>
   What the Orioles will not do is sign both Ventura and Rafael
Palmeiro, their free-agent first baseman. They have offered
Palmeiro $45 million for five years, but he has not indicated a
desire to accept it. If they do a deal with Ventura first, Palmeiro
will be gone.
</P>
<P>
   As for the prospects of a Hundley trade, a Baltimore official
said that the Orioles understood the Mets were talking to the Los
Angeles Dodgers and may trade Hundley there. The Mets apparently
want more from the Orioles than Baltimore is willing to give.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have talked to the Orioles about Charles Johnson,
the Dodgers' catcher, but the Orioles are not sure they want to
make that trade either. It would depend on what players they would
have to give up.

MAJOR BONUS FOR O'MEARA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA QUINTA, Calif. _ Mark O'Meara attributes his impressive year
not only to consistency but the right timing. His timing was good
again Sunday at the 16th Skins Game.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, enjoying one of his best years in professional golf,
made it $430,000 sweeter. The winner of this year's Masters and
British Open won $280,000 in the final nine holes at Rancho La
Quinta Country Club, finished with eight skins overall and won a
Skins Game-record $430,000.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Tom Lehman, who won last year's competition
with $300,000, finished second with seven skins and $420,000,
thanks to a $270,000 victory over hard-luck Fred Couples in a
six-hole playoff, the longest in Skins Game history. Couples, who
had several chances to win the playoff, was third with $150,000.
Greg Norman became the 10th player in Skins Game history to be shut
out.
</P>
<P>
   Couples won Sunday's first three skins (worth $150,000) with an
eight-foot birdie on the par-5, 576-yard 12th hole, but O'Meara won
the next four, which were worth $280,000. He hit an 8-iron approach
shot to three feet on the par-4, 430-yard 16th hole and barely made
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous on that putt,'' he admitted. ``I knew
what was on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, however, wasn't around for most of the playoff. He
bogeyed the first extra hole after hitting his tee shot into a
fairway bunker on the par-4 18th and missed a five-footer to save
par. So he sat around and did a little spectating. Norman dropped
out on the third hole and was heading home by the time the playoff
was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the first few holes,'' O'Meara said, ``but then I
got tired of walking around and just sat down by the ninth green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fun playoff,'' said Lehman, who will under shoulder
surgery this morning in Los Angeles. He said he hoped to be playing
again in late January. ``The whole day was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's final nine holes were exercises in frustration not only
for Norman, who returned to competitive golf two weeks ago in the
Shark Shootout at Sherwood Country Club, but for Couples. He missed
an eight-footer for birdie on the first playoff hole, a six-footer
on the next hole, followed by a 10-footer on the third playoff hole
and, finally, a 12-footer on the sixth and final hole of the
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who kept the playoff game going with a 6-iron to two
feet on the par-5 ninth hole, hit a 9-iron from 138 yards to four
feet on the next hole and sank it for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who has won $720,000 in the last two Skins Games, said
he would love to return, but only O'Meara, this year's winner, is
guaranteed a spot in next year's field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do what I can do to earn my way back,'' joked Lehman, who
set a record with 10 birdies over the two-day competition. ``I
better do something good.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara has had no trouble doing that in a year he said gives
him great pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a tremendous sense of accomplishment,'' he said. ``I
always considered myself to be a solid, consistent player, but I
didn't necessarily know if I could take my game to this level.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what happens in the future, I'll take great pride in
what I've accomplished.''

 &HT;    Early Birds clinch a berth
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ There has for some time been a fuss over whether the
Atlanta Falcons can win with a quarterback other than Chris
Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday in the TWA Dome, two quarterbacks other than Chandler
steered the Falcons to the playoffs. But neither starter Tony
Graziani or relief pitcher Steve DeBerg were most responsible for
Atlanta's 21-10 win over the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, credit the third 10-win season in franchise history to
Jamal Anderson, who rushed for a career-high 188 yards, and a
defense that continues to defy its NFL ranking (No. 17) while
stifling opponents.
</P>
<P>
   For the second game in a row, Atlanta (10-2) lowered its season
standard, allowing just 174 yards. Last week, the Bears managed
just 204.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have won 16 of the pat 20 games, matching the best
streak in franchise history (1978-81), and remain alone in first
place in the NFC West. Only Minnesota (11-1) leads them in the race
for homefield advantage through the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Know what's most amazing?
</P>
<P>
   Even though Atlanta clinched a playoff berth for just the sixth
time in the 33 years since the team was born, there was no
champagne in the lockerroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to be in the playoffs. Now we want to improve our
position,'' said coach Dan Reeves, who tied former Vikings coach
Bud Grant for eighth-place all time in NFL wins with a record of
158-117-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've overcome so many things that people said hadn't been
done, and today, winning without Chris is one of those hurdles I
thought we had to cross. I thought (before the season) maybe we
could improve from 7-9 to 9-7, or if we played really well, 10-6.
It's OK to change that goal now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's OK, too, to look at the Chandler factor in a different
light.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Atlanta was 7-3 in games he started and finished, and
0-6 otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they're 7-1 in games he starts and finishes, and 3-1
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was, however, the first game in four Chandler that missed
entirely that Atlanta has won.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons beat the Rams 3-0 with Graziani at quarterback in
the first half, and 18-10 with DeBerg at quarterback in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis helped, as Rams' coach Dick Vermeil in the second half
benched quarterback Tony Banks for the first time in 41 starts. And
St. Louis rookie running back Robert Holcombe led his team with 38
yards on 14 carries.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta has flopped in games like this before.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used to take games like this for granted, and let Banks
throw for 300 (actually, a career-high 401 yards last year in a
34-31 loss in Atlanta),'' said defensive end Chuck Smith. ''This
ranks up there with the smothering-est days on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some smothering going on, alright, especially in the
second half, when St. Louis mustered just 66 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which had three sacks, blitzed Banks like mad,
''because we knew with his (sprained) ankle, he wouldn't be able to
move as much,'' defensive coordinator Rich Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Falcons who looked flat-footed in the second
half, when the Rams' Tony Horne returned a kickoff 102 yards for a
touchdown, and a 7-3 Rams lead.
</P>
<P>
   From a psychological standpoint, even that was good.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta would not only have to win without Chandler, but rally.
</P>
<P>
   On the next possession, Anderson had 57 of the Falcons' 60 yards
before a 32-yard field goal by Morten Andersen cut the score to
7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Two St. Louis possessions later, Atlanta defensive tackle Shane
Dronett's 9-yard sack of Banks left the Rams at the Atlanta 5.
Then, Tim Dwight's 19-yard punt return gave Atlanta the ball at the
Rams' 28.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, DeBerg set up in the shotgun, and hit wide
receiver Terance Mathis on a post pattern for a 27-yard touchdown.
Anderson's two-point conversion run gave the Falcons a 14-7 lead
they never surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   You had to be in the lockerroom afterward to feel the vibe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes me feel a lot better because I've had kind of a guilt
thing,'' Chandler said. ''I felt like I was letting guys down. For
us to get a win . . . kind of takes that monkey off the whole
team.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg, as usual, was laughing like a hyenna.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a better team with Chris, no doubt about it,'' he said.
''(When he's not playing) the defense has to play better, the
offensive line has to play better, and the quarterback has to do
what he has to do to win. We proved we can do it today. This was a
really special team victory.''

BEING DEFENSIVE A PLUS FOR UP-AND-DOWN STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The difference between the Stars' past two
performances _ a 5-2 loss to the New Jersey Devils and a 4-0
victory against the Washington Capitals _ was like dark and light.
</P>
<P>
   But players say they can't try to evoke that difference by
simply flipping a switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't rely on trying to just turn it up when we want to
turn it up,'' defenseman Darryl Sydor said. ``That's the thing
we've got to get sunk into our heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The ease of the Stars' turnaround from the Wednesday loss to the
Friday victory appeared easy. Stars players were given a stern
lecture and a Thanksgiving Day practice, then went out and played
the same kind of hockey that earned them the Presidents' Trophy
last season for having the best record in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   But the players said that while the transformations appeared
simple from the outside, it was considerably more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do it right and it works, it looks easy,'' winger
Jamie Langenbrunner said. ``But it really isn't easy. It takes a
lot of discipline and it takes a lot of hard work. And we had to
get the focus back to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Devils, the Stars allowed three goals in the first
period and never recovered. Against the Capitals, they scored twice
in the first five minutes and never changed their game.
</P>
<P>
   The difference came because the Stars played a game predicated
on thinking defense first, coach Ken Hitchcock said. Instead of
looking for the quick goal and making the dangerous play, the Stars
protected their end of the ice and were, ``Intent to play a 1-0
game, if that's what it takes,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   And from that, the Stars scored more goals than they had in the
previous three games _ when they were trying to be offensively
creative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were looking to score a lot of goals and not play
hard,'' Langenbrunner said of the Stars' inconsistent play. ``But
when you play the way we did _ so defensively oriented _ and still
score four goals, it kind of brings more people on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Stars are hoping they can assimilate two more players
into their lineup _ Brett Hull and Jere Lehtinen _ and continue the
defense-first philosophy. Hull is recovering from a bruised kidney
and a groin strain, and Lehtinen has a broken right thumb. Both are
expected to be in the lineup Wednesday when the Stars open a
four-game road trip against the San Jose Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, in a rare moment of charity, said his team should be
proud to have overcome the loss of Hull and Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're missing impact players,'' he said. ``And to come out of
that stretch with three wins, a loss and a tie is a pretty sound
accomplishment. This is a building process and sometimes you really
have to get hit with something that hurts, that has pain in it, to
get the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the players say, they know what the message is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to be consistent in this league to play the game we
want to play,'' captain Derian Hatcher said. ``It's a hard game
physically and it's a hard game mentally and you have to be ready
to pay the price. I think we're starting to get back to that.''

RANGERS WAITING ON WORD FROM JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Randy Johnson is expected to decide his
future by today, and the Rangers don't sound optimistic that he's
coming to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard rumors that it's either the Angels or Arizona,''
Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said yesterday. ``But I haven't
heard that from them. Until I hear that from them, I'm going to
wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, despite offering a four-year contract worth $50
million, have never seemed to be the frontrunner in this pursuit.
All along it has seemed that Johnson was torn between playing for
the Arizona Diamondbacks, allowing him to live in his home near
Phoenix year-round, or the Anaheim Angels, who fit his desire to
play for a competitive American League team that trains in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson's agent, Barry Meister, continued to insist
yesterday that it still is between four teams and that the Rangers
and the Los Angeles Dodgers have not been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to decide between four clubs,'' Meister
said. ``We expect to decide \Rtoday\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said, ``There are
attractive features about every club. We feel we're right in the
thick of it. Until I get a yea or a nay, we're optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have known from the start they were at a
disadvantage because of Johnson's desire to pitch near his home in
Phoenix or at least be able to train there in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's it, then there's nothing we can do,'' Melvin said.
``All the other criterion we seem to fit. The team is competitive,
nice ballpark, we fit as far as ownership, we fit everything except
the spring training site, and it's not Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers need to know, one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   If they can somehow persuade Johnson to come to Texas, then they
have made a significant upgrade to a division championship team and
can build a starting rotation around three pitchers - Johnson, Rick
Helling and Aaron Sele _ who combined for 58 victories last season.
</P>
<P>
   They also will have countered the Angels' signing of free-agent
first baseman Mo Vaughn. The Rangers could then concentrate on
re-signing shortstop Royce Clayton and first baseman Will Clark, do
some tinkering with their depth and head to spring training with
possibly their strongest team ever.
</P>
<P>
   That is if Johnson has a favorable impact both on and off the
field. There's no question that he's the most dominating
left-handed pitcher in baseball. But he's also 35 with a mercurial
personality and a history of a bad back. Both can be troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers don't get him, they would at least breath easier
if Johnson chooses to go to the National League. But if Johnson
signs with the Angels, the Rangers take a hit both in staying
competitive on the field and in the public relations department.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, who finished just three games behind the Rangers,
would be much improved by signing Vaughn and Johnson. The Rangers,
even if they re-sign Clark and Clayton, will have done nothing to a
pitching staff that had a 4.99 earned-run average, third worst in
the American League. Nothing except lose Todd Stottlemyre to free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   There is little left in the free-agent market _ Tim Belcher, Bob
Tewksbury _ that would help the Rangers. Their best hope would be a
trade for one of the few pitchers who might be available: Kevin
Appier of the Royals, Ismael Valdes of the Dodgers, Joey Hamilton
of the Padres or Pat Hentgen of the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   They would rather have Johnson, but right now it's not looking
good.

TERRIFIC TRIO ON VERGE OF QUALIFYING FOR SENIOR TOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLES CLINES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It's not common, but not unheard of for
three golfers from the same city to reach the final stage of
qualifying for the Senior PGA Tour. But having a threesome from the
same club making it is considered about as likely as carding a
hole-in-one.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it happened two weeks ago in San Antonio when
Ridglea Country Club members John Grace, Wayne Wright and Don
Dodgen shot low enough to be among the 13 from that site to advance
to the final stage of qualifying that begins tomorrow in Florida.
And another member, former Senior PGA Tour player Robert Landers of
Azle, missed by a shot making it a foursome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think it would be hard enough to have three guys from
the same city qualifying, but from the same club has to be
something,'' said Grace, a Fort Worth real estate developer who
decided to try his luck as a senior professional after turning 50
in April.
</P>
<P>
   The Senior PGA Tour, which is for golfers 50 and older, doesn't
keep records reflecting club affiliation, but officials agree that
it's probably an unusual happenstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like that's all people have been talking about at the
club,'' said Wright, who sold his women's clothing manufacturing
business two months ago so he could put all his energies into
qualifying for the senior tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all friends and play golf quite a bit together, so it's
really something,'' added Dodgen, who said he hasn't yet quit his
day job as a petroleum ``land man.'' He does contract work for
various oil companies in the field.
</P>
<P>
   All three have more in common than being from the same club.
They all have extensive golfing backgrounds, so they didn't decide
they would do this as just a lark when they turned 50 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Grace, who played golf at the University of Houston, has been
one of the nation's top amateurs for years, and was runner-up to
Jerry Pate in the 1974 U.S. Amateur. He has won numerous
tournaments, including the Texas Amateur and Mid-Amateur titles. He
also has played on the U.S. Walker Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, a former University of North Texas player, competed on
the PGA Tour for three years beginning in 1975 before losing his
card, and has enjoyed success on mini-tours and state events.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgen, who played at TCU, competed in the 1969 and '70 U.S.
Amateurs, qualified to play in the Byron Nelson Classic as an
amateur and tried qualifying for the PGA Tour three times. He
played in several mini-tour events, and was the pro at Lost Creek
Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a difference in the three, it's that Grace has
played steadily through most of the years, while Wright and Dodgen
took extensive breaks from the game when they entered other
business fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finished 13th in the Texas State Open in 1979, and I think
that was the last time I played competitively until about a
year-and-a-half ago,'' Dodgen said. Even then, Dodgen wasn't
playing that much. But he had enough people urging him, including
his brother-in-law Garry Lisby, Grace, his wife Sue, and his niece,
TCU player Angela Stanford, that he decided, ``What the heck. I'm
not getting any younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace weighed the options of staying an amateur or turning pro,
and saw more benefits by playing for money. And with about $48,000
in winnings and the Texas Senior Open title since his decision, he
said he made the right choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made more than I've spent, but you can't really make any
big money unless you get on the senior tour,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright has played in Iron Man and other mini-tour events since
turning 50 and has several top-10 finishes on the Heartland tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing was to get back to being tournament tough,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgen said regaining tournament toughness also has been his
focus since turning 50, and he was encouraged about his comeback in
San Antonio, where he opened with an 81 as a cold front, wind and
fast greens made conditions difficult.
</P>
<P>
   He, Grace and Wright are confident they have as good a chance as
anyone in qualifying at Grenelefe Golf &AMP; Tennis Club in Haines
City, Fla., though they add it'll take a little luck, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 110 players from all over the world trying to
qualify, and all of them are good players,'' Grace said. It's a
week, he said, a person has to be on top of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't afford one bad round, or even one mediocre round,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   All three said if they fail to be one of the eight to earn
all-exempt status for next year, they aren't going to dump their
clubs in the closet. This won't be a one-shot deal. Wright and
Grace said they'll give their senior tour aspirations at least two
or three more years if they don't earn their cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving myself a two-year deal on this thing,'' Wright
said. ``I'll do a lot of Monday qualifying and will play in
different stuff next year if I don't make it. But my plan is making
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace said he has discovered that playing golf for a living is
something he likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed the heck out of this year,'' he said. ``I've got
an alternate plan. When I started, I kind of said I'd give myself
three years. But I don't know. It'll be at least that. But right
now I'm not looking past this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgen said he probably would try again next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just depends on the circumstances,'' he said. ``I'm not
counting myself out, but I'm realistic, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the alternate plans could be laid to rest by earning
a berth on the Senior PGA Tour. And it's highly doubtful that a
club's threesome has ever done that.

IS DE LA HOYA FACING THIRD STRIKE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The carefully crafted ``Golden Boy'' image is taking a beating.
</P>
<P>
   First came the news that Oscar De La Hoya _ the unrivaled
darling of boxing _ had fathered children out of wedlock. Strike
one. Then he was seen drunk and carousing in Cabo San Lucas,
Mexico. Strike two.
</P>
<P>
   And now this: He has been sued in San Bernardino County Superior
Court for allegedly raping an underaged girl in the same Mexican
town 2{ years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Strike three?
</P>
<P>
   We can't judge whether he's guilty or innocent without the
facts. And, as is often the case with rape, we might never know for
sure because it often is one person's word against another's.
</P>
<P>
   If it's true, he deserves what he gets.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it's not, however; even if this unidentified,
now-18-year-old woman has devised this story as a means of claiming
a fortune, this could hang over De La Hoya's head. It will go away
completely only if there is no doubt about his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's representatives are dismissing the allegations as
an attempt at extortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absolute outrage because nothing ever happened.
Nothing, nothing,'' said fuming promoter Bob Arum.
</P>
<P>
   However, the women's attorney has answers to two obvious
questions: Why did she wait so long to take action? And why didn't
she notify authorities in Mexico?
</P>
<P>
   The attorney, Lisa Maki, said the lawsuit was delayed until the
woman was emotionally equipped to handle litigation. And Maki
claims her client did contact Mexican authorities six months ago
(still, two years after the alleged incident), but they were
unwilling to help.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see what comes out in court _ De La
Hoya's people have vowed to fight _ and the resulting fallout. This
certainly will take a personal toll on De La Hoya regardless of the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   He's extremely sensitive about his public image; he needs to be
loved. He reportedly was reduced to tears when he was booed by
Mexican fans at a public appearance not long ago.
</P>
<P>
   This must be killing him emotionally. And there could be other
ramifications. De La Hoya's clean-cut image is one thing that has
endeared him to fans and sponsors, who have paid millions for
endorsements and advertisements. Will this turn off his public?
Will sponsors be less inclined to employ him to sell their
products?
</P>
<P>
   Again, De La Hoya could be the victim here. This woman could be
lying, which would be another sad example of how vulnerable public
figures can be. No innocent person deserves this. And, again, she
could be the victim, which would be far sadder.
</P>
<P>
   With all that has happened, the public De La Hoya is no longer
the innocent kid who captured America's heart by dedicating his
Olympic gold medal to his late mother in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hernandez, De La Hoya's principal adviser, said the fighter
never meant to portray himself as an angel. He said De La Hoya is
only human. However, no one around one of the sport's great
champions ever imagined this could happen.
</P>
<P>
   __ No Sugar-coated documentary: When the name Sugar Ray Robinson
is mentioned, the first thing that comes to mind is this: greatest
pound-for-pound fighter of all time. Yes, even greater than Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most schooled boxing buffs know much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   That's why HBO's ``Sugar Ray Robinson: The Bright Lights and
Dark Shadows of a Champion'' _ which premieres on Dec. 8 _ is long
overdue.
</P>
<P>
   The hour-long documentary chronicles Robinson's remarkable
career as the nearest thing to a perfect fighter and the fast life
he lived, in which he was always the center of attention.
</P>
<P>
   It also explores his ugly sides, portraying him as a abusive
husband and neglectful father _ based on comments made by his wife
and children _ and covering his descent into poverty and dementia
pugilistica.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a pretty picture _ but a complete and worthwhile one.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rabbit punches: Former WBC featherweight champion Kevin
Kelley has agreed to headline the Dec. 17 card at the Country Club
in Reseda, according to promoter Peter Broudy. His opponent has yet
to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, 31, isn't what he used to be but remains an exciting
slugger.

COWBOYS WORKING ON CLOSING GAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Before Thursday's 46-36 Thanksgiving Day loss to
the Vikings, Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman and receiver Michael
Irvin scoffed at any suggestion that the game might gauge whether
this Cowboys team is of championship quality.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Irvin, ``nobody with less rings than me can tell
me what it takes to get the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   What was even clearer after the Randy Moss-led blowout, is that
if a lot doesn't change between now and the playoffs, the Vikings
will be telling the Cowboys about this year's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that the Vikings (11-1) are the NFC's best
team. The Cowboys (8-4) are going into the final four weeks of the
season looking to try to close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me want to go harder,'' Cowboys guard Nate Newton
said. ``I just want to crank it up and go higher. I think the team
feels the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Topping their agenda is getting healthy, and it appears that the
Cowboys' banged-up secondary will be close to full strength for
Sunday's matchup against the Saints. Cornerback Deion Sanders, who
missed the Vikings game with a sprained toe, is expected to be
back. As is reserve cornerback Kevin Mathis, out the past three
games because of a fractured forearm.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Cowboys also must work to cut down on a litany of
penalties that have plagued them in recent weeks _ 13 for 152 yards
against the Vikings and 15 for 129 yards the previous outing
against the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Consistency in the running game _ Emmitt Smith rushed for just
44 yards on 18 carries against the Vikings _ and red-zone
efficiency also are areas on which the Cowboys need to focus.
</P>
<P>
   But there was good news coming out of yesterday's games. The
Cowboys' lead over the Cardinals (6-6) in the NFC East race is back
to two games, thanks to Arizona's 34-24 loss to the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   The magic number for the Cowboys to clinch the East is two, as
two wins, a win and a Cardinals loss or two losses by the Cardinals
would give the Cowboys their sixth division crown in the past seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   The math is simple; however, making it a reality won't be easy _
especially the next two weeks at New Orleans (5-7) and at Kansas
City (5-7).
</P>
<P>
   The Saints are playing for a playoff berth and have proven to be
tough at home. And the Cowboys will find out the following week
what the Cardinals learned yesterday: Despite the Chiefs' so-far
dismal season, they are better than their record, and they are
tough to beat in Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys close the season at home against division rivals
Philadelphia (2-10) and Washington (3-9). Both have improved from
the last time the Cowboys played them, and both would love nothing
more than to salvage some of their own disappointments by ruining
things for the Cowboys.

SQUEAK, SOLIS PULL MATRIARCH SURPRISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Half of the winners in Hollywood Park's Turf
Festival stakes the past three days came from New York. That was
surprising enough for local horseplayers. But the stars of the
weekend's main event, the $700,000 Matriarch for fillies and mares,
came from further away than that Sunday. They came from sheer
oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Squeak, her major summer victory at Hollywood forgotten after
sound defeats at Del Mar and Santa Anita, rebounded by swooping
past all seven opponents and winning by six lengths under leading
jockey Alex Solis.
</P>
<P>
   That was after runner-up Real Connection, the old one-eyed mare
who'd won once in her past 31 races, took a clear lead at the top
of the stretch only to finish second as the 41-1 long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Favored Auntie Mame, trying to advance her candidacy for a 1998
Eclipse Award, was never in contention and finished fifth. Fiji,
who missed the race because of a cough, now is certain to win the
division championship.
</P>
<P>
   The handlers of Squeak won't get an award but can take
satisfaction in showing up the experts with short memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the only horse nobody mentioned all week,'' trainer
Ben Cecil said in the winner's circle after owner Gary Tanaka's
4-year-old English-bred ran 1\ miles on ``yielding'' turf in
2:05.08 and paid $15.20. ``She won a nice race (the Beverly Hills
Handicap) here over the summer, then she ran two bad races and she
was forgotten about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that's often when they tend to run their best. Every
time I run a horse and no one mentions it, they seem to run well.''
</P>
<P>
   Squeak no doubt appreciated the wet grass, having won on
``good'' ground in England, and enjoyed a trouble-free ride by
Solis, aboard her for the first time. But for a moment, it appeared
Real Connection and David Flores would spring the upset of the year
as they cut the corner and led with less than a quarter-mile to go.
</P>
<P>
   Real Connection, a 7-year-old who lost her right eye in an
accident as a yearling, once was the epitome of an overachiever but
recently has been overmatched in big races. Trainer Mel Stute said
she was supposed to retire after the Matriarch, but he feared the
improved effort would encourage owner Bill Thomas to keep her
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's run 72 times (winning seven). She's done absolutely
everything asked of her,'' Stute said. ``I'd hate to see anything
happen to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Two more long shots, 15-1 Green Jewel and 22-1 Society Dream,
finished third and fourth in the Matriarch, the year's richest turf
race for fillies and mares.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon's other Turf Festival stakes, the $500,000
Hollywood Derby, produced another big payoff as Vergennes ($37.60)
and jockey John Velazquez won by 1} lengths over 15-1 Dixie Dot Com
while favorites Ladies Din and Dr Fong ran fourth and fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies Din trainer Julio Canani blamed the soft footing and Dr
Fong trainer Neil Drysdale blamed traffic trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Vergennes made Velazquez the only multiple winner of the Turf
Festival and capped the big weekend for New York-based horses. The
3-year-old gelding was coming off a victory in Belmont Park's
Jamaica Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Velazquez also rode New York's Incurable Optimist to victory in
the Generous Stakes for 2-year-olds on Saturday. Rick Wilson rode
New York's Soldier Field to victory in the Hollywood Turf Express
sprint on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The locals won Saturday's Citation Handicap with Military and
Friday's Miesque with Here's to You.

   SEARCH CONTINUES FOR ESCAPEE
</P>

HUNTSVILLE _ Prison officials Sunday appeared to be digging in for
a longer-than-anticipated search for a death row inmate who escaped
from the Ellis I Unit late Thanksgiving night.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, escapees are caught within a couple of
hours,'' said Gary Johnson, director of Institutions Division of
the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. ``If they are not caught
within a few hours, it can become extended.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, convicted killer Martin E. Gurule, 29, had been
outside the prison walls for more than 60 hours, eluding
bloodhounds and avoiding detection by the sparsely inhabited woods
south and east of the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe he is inside the perimeter,'' said Johnson,
referring to the six-square-mile area that was cordoned off within
an hour of the escape.
</P>
<P>
   Martin went over two razor-wire topped fences and fled into the
woods shortly after midnight Friday, authorities said. Six other
death row inmates also attempted to flee but surrendered when
guards fired at them.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates have been interviewed extensively by investigators,
Johnson said, and they have not indicated that the escape included
plans beyond getting outside the walls _ one factor that leads
authorities to believe that Gurule has not gone far.
</P>
<P>
   TDCJ officers have continued to maintain the original perimeter
and the search was stepped up on Sunday as state troopers began
stopping and searching cars entering and exiting settlements and
subdivisions in the area.
</P>
<P>
   If Gurule is still in the area, he may try to hide under a
vehicle, officers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, he's going to get tired,'' Johnson said. ``He's
going to get cool at night and hot during the day and he couldn't
have had much sleep since Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reliable sightings of the escapee, Johnson
said, but that could change as residents of the area return home
from holiday trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them could discover their house(s) have been broken
into or cars were stolen _ things we don't know about now,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the escape, officers have been called to three residences
in the area, but none produced a lead, they said.
</P>
<P>
   A house was broken into but the only missing items were a pillow
case and some silverware, authorities said. In another, a mobile
home was believed to have been burglarized but nothing was taken,
they added.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, a resident of Riverside reported that he had
found an intruder _ matching Gurule's description _ under his house
and fired several shots at him with a semiautomatic pistol,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs failed to pick up a scent, and officers said they found no
spent casings. Shortly before midnight, they withdrew from the
location and there was speculation it was a ``crackpot call.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that he was disappointed but not surprised by the
absence of sightings. Escapees often find a place to ``lie down''
and try to wait out a search, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Like others involved in the manhunt, Johnson said he is counting
on the elements and the terrain to force Gurule's surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleep deprivation is a big thing,'' Johnson said. ``He
(Gurule) couldn't be getting any sleep out there. We've had three
helicopters providing air cover. We've had dog teams out there
every two or three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear dogs yelping, you don't know where they are
going or where they are coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurule, 29, was awaiting execution for the 1992 slaying of two
men during a restaurant robbery in Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said he and the other six death row inmates cut a
small hole in a recreation yard fence, made their way to the roof
of their cell block and hid there for three hours before
approaching the fences.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said prison guards fired at least 18 shots at them.
While the others dropped to the ground and surrendered, Gurule
scaled the two outside fences using clothing or a blanket to help
protect him from the razor wire, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   They said that blood on the wire indicated that Gurule may have
been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that they believe that the hole in the
recreation yard's fence was cut with a hacksaw, which has not been
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have just been a hacksaw blade,'' TDCJ spokesman Glen
Castleberry said. ``It might have been just a small piece of a
hacksaw blade.''
</P>
<P>
   The manhunt has involved an estimated 500 law-enforcement
officers but Johnson said they are not beating the bushes on foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would contaminate the area,'' he said. The prison's
bloodhounds are not trained to recognize the unique scent of an
individual, he said, but will track any human scent.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, most of the officers have been deployed on foot along
two farm roads that form two sides of the perimeter. At any given
time, about 250 of them maintain those stationary positions, each
within sight of the positions on either side of them.
</P>
<P>
   Only the dogs and the horsemen who accompany them have ventured
into the rugged landscape where Gurule is believed to be hiding.

PANIC SETS IN OVER NEW FOURTH GRADE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new reading and writing test will be given to fourth graders
across New York state early next year, and it is so different from
traditional tests that teachers and parents can barely contain
their panic.
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessors, the test includes multiple-choice
questions, with circles that must be filled in with a No. 2 pencil.
But for the first time it also has pages of blank lines for
children to take notes on a story read aloud, write literary
criticism and craft a personal essay _ and it is given over three
days.
</P>
<P>
   The test, called the English Language Arts test, is based on new
standards that require fourth graders not only to read proficiently
but also to write analytically about what they have read.
Two-thirds of the test consists of writing about literature.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers contend that not all 9-year-olds are ready for a
test that requires so much abstract thinking and writing. ``It's
like a ride in an amusement park,'' said Nancy Baron, a teacher at
the Chatsworth Avenue School, a public school in Larchmont. ``There
are some children who shouldn't go on that ride right now because
they are too short.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of the test are sure to have major consequences. In
New York City, for example, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew has
decreed that beginning in 2000, fourth-graders who flunk the test
will not be promoted to fifth grade. And if the children fail,
their schools will be judged as failues, too, subject to state
monitoring and the possible removal of principals and teachers. In
the suburbs, test scores help determine real estate values.
</P>
<P>
   The state is also introducing a new fourth-grade math test, and
new English and math tests in the eighth grade, all subject to the
new higher standards. Those tests are being given from June 1 to 4.
</P>
<P>
   But the anxiety over the English test is especially high because
it will be given on the week of Jan. 11, an hour each day for three
days. In the past, standardized tests were always given in the
spring _ and always on a single day. Even teachers who believe that
fourth graders can be trained to take the new English test are
looking up and realizing that there are only six weeks to go _ just
enough time to cram, at best.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Baron, the teacher from Larchmont, gave the pilot test in
February and said that many children had trouble going beyond
repetition of the facts in the story to inferential leaps. For
instance, she said, after reading a story about a plague of toads,
most children could describe how the toads had infested gardens and
slept inside boots. But it was beyond them to connect those details
to an essay question about ``how life had changed'' for the people
of Australia. Many children complained, Mrs. Baron said, that the
story did not describe life before the toads came.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for correct spelling, grammar and punctuation was
also daunting, said Mrs. Baron, a teacher for 31 years. ``Children
usually come in, they're big on run-on sentences,'' she said.
``They ignore punctuation, they're so interested in getting
everything down. They love writing. They love reading. But the
writing they do is mostly conversation, punctuated incorrectly,
with every detail of somebody's life in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing is such a personal act for young children, Mrs. Baron
added, that failure could be devastating. ``Let me give a
short-answer test that doesn't take a child's soul and put it on
paper,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In what many teachers agree is the hardest part of the test, on
day two, the teacher must read a story out loud, twice. During the
second reading, children must take notes in a given page in their
test booklets. They are not allowed to see the text. Then they have
50 minutes to answer some short questions and draft two essays _
paying attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation and paragraph
structure _ based on the reading they have heard.
</P>
<P>
   In an intensely visual culture, dominated by video, TV and
computer games, many children have never developed the ability to
retain what they hear, many educators warned.
</P>
<P>
   The State Board of Regents authorized development of the test in
April 1994, before the current class of fourth-graders started
school. It was developed by a statewide committee of teachers, in
partnership with CTB/McGraw-Hill, a standardized-testing company.
</P>
<P>
   The new test puts New York among a handful of states, including
Kentucky, Massachusetts and South Carolina, that have tried to rank
students and schools by how well they meet a written standard of
performance, rather than along a national curve that determines
what is average, above and below average.

DOLLAR FOR YOUR THOUGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COSTA MESA, Calif. _ There are only nine practice players
available, so the chunky kid with a white T-shirt, black sweats and
a diamond-studded earring grabs a ball. He runs the second team's
offense, and it looks about a zillion times better than the
starting unit.
</P>
<P>
   He fills the hoop with sweet jumpers and layups after quick
drives. He plays the two-man game brilliantly, draining the
3-pointer or kicking it back inside for an easy deuce. There's no
stopping him.
</P>
<P>
   It's eerie. This kid, the supposed student manager, knows the
game better than anyone on the floor. He thinks on a higher level
than anyone else on the floor, so he begins giving pointers.
Stopping practice to explain what went wrong. Why it went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He sure is cocky.
</P>
<P>
   There are no whistles, but the action stops when the kid speaks.
</P>
<P>
   It goes this way for an hour. Maybe a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   Until practice ends and the players meet at center court for
circle talk. And this kid pontificates for 10 minutes on what went
right and wrong. On why Southern California College, a tiny NAIA
school, is 2-3 instead of better.
</P>
<P>
   On things that have plagued the Vanguards since the first
practice. Players are singled out, yet no one is disrespectful of
the kid with the big-time game and boyish looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mental. You miss a shot and you worry about that and it
causes you to miss the next shot,'' he says. ``It's what you've
been doing since the first day of practice. You've got to be strong
enough, mentally, not to allow that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The kid, as it turns out, is no student manager. He's a coach.
The head coach. The 22-year-old first-year head coach who many of
these kids grew up watching.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Cameron Dollar was starring at UCLA. He's now
running the program at this tiny Christian school south of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's correct. Cameron Dollar, the same kid who played 36
minutes and had eight assists as a sophomore in the 89-78 win
against Arkansas in the 1995 NCAA title game, is already a head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to that game in Seattle and I watched his college
career,'' says sophomore guard Dennis Keane, the only returning
starter for the Vanguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird. He got the job and it was like, `Cool, a big name
and that will help us with recruiting.' Then you hear he's
22-years-old and it gets you thinking, `I don't know if I could
play for a coach that young.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then Dollar meets with you. As a player you begin to forget his
age, and the fact that he's younger than most of the players he's
coaching becomes irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you pick up only on his basketball wisdom, on his
thirst for the game and his promise to build a program with good
kids who have strong Christian values.
</P>
<P>
   This is also why Cal State Northridge coach Bobby Braswell is
concerned. Braswell respects Dollar tremendously, which is why
Braswell agreed to play an NAIA school. That happens tonight at
CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he doesn't show up in a uniform,'' Braswell said. ``It
says a lot about him, what kind of person he is and what kind of
character he has and what people in this community feel about him
to give him that job at such a young age. He's very talented. He's
going to be a pretty good coach.''
</P>
<P>
   If Dollar did suit up, he would, with little question, be the
best player Southern California had on its side. Even the players
know this. They listen to him intently _ nearly in awe that they
share the same crowded court with Dollar in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar, not in peak shape but fit enough to scrimmage for a few
hours, is two years out of UCLA and in his second year of coaching.
He spent last season as an assistant at UC Irvine, and in April
replaced Southern California College veteran Bill Reynolds, who
retired after 17 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the court you can't really tell we're in the same age
group,'' said sophomore point guard Ardis Curtis, 19, a transfer
from Long Beach State. ``You tend to think (of) someone your own
age as a friend, but that's not the case. It's probably because
he's a winner and he knows what it's going to take to win. Not many
people his age have done what he's done, won the national
championship and be a head coach.''

<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FOR what's left of the college football season to have any real
meaning, something very unlikely must happen in St. Louis on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Either that or something at least as improbable in Miami and/or
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   We simply must not go into this bowl season with three
undefeated teams deserving of national-championship consideration
when an arbitrary, capricious system allows only two to tango for
the title.
</P>
<P>
   Since it seems an extremely safe assumption that Miami's
Hurricanes, having just surrendered 66 points to Syracuse, won't
whip up more than a gentle breeze of opposition for 10-0 UCLA, or
that Mississippi State will volunteer an upset of 11-0 Tennessee,
it's going to come down to what Texas A&AMP;M can do to shut down 11-0
Kansas State in the Big 12 Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   Little, we assume. Despite the many W's the Aggies have posted
during the R.C. Slocum era _ 93 _ they have almost never claimed
the unexpected ones. Worse, the Wildcats, who may need a
triple-digit victory to successfully plead their case for a Fiesta
Bowl berth, will be bereft of merciful tendencies. If you thought
Nebraska 54, A&AMP;M 15 last December in San Antonio got bad
</P>
<P>
   Having repealed Michael Bishop's First Amendment rights for most
of the season, coach Bill Snyder knows he owes his
Heisman-hallucinating quarterback every chance to do unto the
Aggies as Heisman winner-to-be Ricky Williams did unto them Friday
in what turned into perhaps the greatest A&AMP;M-Texas game ever
played.
</P>
<P>
   While Bishop by his lonesome is no Ricky, the 'Cats are
significantly tougher across the board than the Longhorns. Remember
their 48-7 butchering of Bevo early in the season? That was not a
chance occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, under similar circumstances, Texas knocked off the
mighty Cornhuskers a couple years back in the TWA Dome, a victory
that will forever stand as the highlight of the ill-fated John
Mackovic's tenure. Now, Slocum needs for his lads to make the same
sort of exclamatory statement on his behalf, because although his
job appears to be in no imminent danger after a 10-victory year,
his reputation again badly needs a little spit-shining.
</P>
<P>
   The charismatic Mack Brown, even though he's losing his
dreadlocked meal ticket, may be poised to steal Texas back out from
under R.C. Although the Aggies have enjoyed the better decade, the
Longhorns still have the weight of history on their side.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Ricky, most everybody tuned in Friday despite the
early hour. What they saw was what UT football used to be:
larger-than-life burnt-orange gladiators doing grand things before
huge crowds. You can argue how the game helped both schools recruit
for next season, but believe me, it helped Texas more.
</P>
<P>
   Brown impressed almost as much as Williams did. He earned his
stripes for the way Texas reclaimed its cool after blowing an
unblowable lead. That final drive, leading to the winning field
goal, was a masterpiece of calm, collected thinking by a coaching
staff operating in perfect lockstep with a redshirt freshman
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum, in turn, is a good enough coach _ and scheduler _ to
ensure a 78-percent winning pace over his 10 seasons. However, as
previously noted, an upset specialist he isn't. While his taking
revenge on Nebraska in October was seen as a breakthrough of sorts,
giving his Aggies their first-ever victory over a team ranked as
high as No. 2 in the land, we soon realized that these
now-thrice-beaten 'Huskers would prove to be nothing special,
certainly relative to their recent glory days.
</P>
<P>
   But K-State is something special. Under the autocratic Snyder, a
throwback to a time when coaches could get away with acting
godlike, the Kansas Aggies have come further faster than almost any
program ever. Snyder has accomplished in backwoods Manhattan what
Slocum hasn't been able to do in semi-urban College Station, and
he's doing it with a young man, Bishop, plucked off Texas A&AMP;M's
back 40.
</P>
<P>
   Many Aggies fans were furious after the humiliating outcome of
the '97 Big 12 Championship Game. The 10-0 run this season _ after
the predictable loss in the opener to Florida State _ placated all
except the hysterically ardent of R.C.'s critics, but A&AMP;M can still
end the current year with an 0-3 free fall that will stir up
broader anti-Slocum sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he may be coaching the most important game of his career
Saturday, for both his own sake and the sake of clarity on the
muddled national scene. And when I say coach, I mean coach, because
his players don't measure up to Kansas State's.
</P>
<P>
   He will have to outthink Snyder in St. Louis, as Mackovic
outthought Tom Osborne under the same roof. This is a test, a huge
test, for R.C.
</P>
<P>
   With, again, lots of folks watching.

(ATTN: N.Y.)  
 DANTE FASCELL, FORMER FLORIDA CONGRESSMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dante B. Fascell, a Florida Democratic congressman who was
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee from 1984 through
1992, died on Saturday at his home in Clearwater, Fla. He was 81
and had lived in Miami until June.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was colon cancer, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Fascell (pronounced Fah-SELL) began serving on the Foreign
Affairs Committee in 1957. He was a strong supporter of Israel and
a fervent opponent of President Fidel Castro of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   He represented voters in Dade County and in the Florida Keys
from 1955 through 1992, when he did not run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, President Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal
of Freedom with a citation calling him ``a man of reason and
conscience'' who was ``courageous in war and public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Fascell strongly favored bipartisanship in foreign policy. In
his last years in Congress he frequently voted with Republicans on
foreign policy issues, particularly those involving Latin America.
His opposition to any softening of U.S. policy toward the Castro
government and his backing of the Reagan administration's efforts
to undermine the Sandinistas were welcomed by immigrants from Cuba
and Nicaragua, who constituted 40 percent of the population of his
district.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate over U.S. policy after Iraq invaded Kuwait, in
1990, and before the Persian Gulf War, in 1991, he was one of the
leading Democrats who supported President Bush's decision to send
American forces to the area and to form a coalition with other
nations to defeat Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last year, Fascell said he took pride in his
fight for human rights abroad, particularly on behalf of people _
known as ``refuseniks'' _ who had been prevented from leaving the
Soviet Bloc. ``Ultimately,'' he said, ``our human rights effort
helped lead to the disintegration of the entire eastern empire.''
</P>
<P>
   In domestic affairs, he was regarded as a liberal on social and
environmental issues, and he gained admiration from Floridians for
his ability to direct federal money to projects he favored.
</P>
<P>
   Fascell's decision not to run in 1992 surprised many Floridians.
Political analysts said a significant factor was that he had been
seriously affected by a court-ordered plan for the reapportionment
of congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   After stepping down, Fascell, who served in the Florida
legislature from 1951 to 1954, became a partner in a Miami law
firm, Holland and Knight.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Jeanne-Marie

 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
GRIPPING a baseball always had been so simple, so joyful for Andy
Yount. Grab the ball, launch into the windup, and let it go with a
humming velocity that only a few young men can dream about.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this time last year, however, a series of events seemingly
had robbed Yount of his talent and derailed what had the makings of
a successful career as a pitcher. Gripping a baseball suddenly had
become so complex, so maddening.
</P>
<P>
   It was not even the main focus of his world anymore. Getting a
grip on his life had become far more important. Now, at age 21,
Yount is back on track to fulfilling his dream of pitching in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   He once again has a grip.
</P>
<P>
   Yount recently completed a successful Fall Instructional League
season with the Detroit Tigers and is looking forward to next
spring, when he will resume a career that seemed over six months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank God that I'm able to throw the ball again,'' said
Yount. ``For two years, I didn't think I'd be able to do that. It
was a pretty dark time.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, Yount was among the brightest pitching prospects in the
nation. He was a star pitcher at Kingwood High School and the No. 1
selection of the Boston Red Sox in the June 1995 amateur draft. He
signed a contract that included a bonus of nearly $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   He could consistently throw a fastball in the mid-90-mph range
and was learning the nuances of other pitches to set it up. In his
first professional season in 1995, he was voted the No. 2 prospect
in the Gulf Coast Rookie League.
</P>
<P>
   Yount's success seemed almost predestined. There was little
doubt he would advance rapidly through the Boston minor-league
system and pitch at Fenway Park. There was no limit to what could
happen.
</P>
<P>
   But in November 1996, a tragedy begot a stunning change in
Yount's fortunes. While Yount was pitching in the Florida
Instructional League, he received news that his best friend, Nathan
Hicks, had been killed in a car accident in Houston. In November,
Yount visited his friend's grave back home and for some reason was
holding a glass in his right hand. Overcome by grief over the loss
of his friend, Yount squeezed the glass harder and harder until it
shattered. His hand was cut from the top of his middle finger to
the middle of his palm.
</P>
<P>
   A tendon in the middle finger was severely damaged. One
operation led to another and another and another. Nine times,
doctors tried to repair the damage. The tendon was shot, and Yount
had no feeling in his middle finger, which was permanently locked
in a claw-like position. He couldn't throw with any consistency,
and his spirits understandably sank.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I'd sit and stare and wonder what had
happened, why it had happened and what was going to happen,'' Yount
said. ``Every day, I'd wake up and look at my hand and just know
that I was going to wake up and this nightmare would be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd wonder what would have happened if I hadn't taken that
glass to Nathan's grave. I'd wonder where I'd be pitching, what
kind of year I'd be having. I tried as hard as I could not to play
the what-if game, but it was hard not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount enrolled at the University of North Texas in August 1997
in an effort to try to put baseball behind him. He hadn't pitched
in over a year when the Red Sox released him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole time in the back of my mind, I kept thinking, `Well,
this time the operation will work, and things will go right back to
the way they were,''' Yount said. ``Then I got released by the Red
Sox, and it hit home. It pretty much destroyed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his love had revolved around baseball since he was a
small boy, Yount turned away from the game. He quit watching it on
TV and following the standings in the paper. He wondered how his
Kingwood High teammates Mike Mangum (the No. 1 pick of the Colorado
Rockies in 1997) and Jeff Austin (the No. 1 pick of the Chicago
White Sox in 1998) were doing, but even their success brought Yount
another round of the what-ifs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I was just going to college and taking some
basic courses, trying to figure out what I wanted to get into,''
said Yount. ``At times I thought I might want to get into coaching,
to try to have some connection with baseball. I just didn't know
what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   One day last spring in Denton, Yount, who had not tried to throw
a baseball with any velocity for nearly 18 months, experienced a
moment that he interpreted as a message for him not to quit, to
give it another chance.
</P>
<P>
   A few friends were playing home-run derby, and Yount was
shagging balls in the outfield and tossing them back toward the
infield. Suddenly, he had the desire the throw the ball overhand _
and hard. He was amazed at how good it felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds like a clich, but it was like something was
inside of me telling me not to give up,'' said Yount. ``I wanted to
give it another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, Yount started what likely will be a long and
tedious comeback. He contacted Alan and Randy Hendricks, the
Houston-based agents who had represented him when he signed with
Boston in 1995. Joe Sambito, the former major-league pitcher who
works as an agent for the Hendrickses, spoke often with Yount about
what he needed to do to resume his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited, because I always hoped Andy would get past
everything and try again,'' Sambito said. ``We talked a long while
about what he needed to do to get his arm in shape to pitch and to
get his body in shape. He worked very hard, and the result was an
Andy Yount who could still throw with the same velocity but was in
better shape and was more mature.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hendrickses got word out to teams that Yount was going to
throw at Rice University in August, and several scouts came to see
if the hand injury would prevent him from resuming his career. The
Detroit scouts quickly recommended that the Tigers take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that this was a kid who was 21 years old and throwing
the ball in the 90 to 94 (mph) range,'' said Greg Smith, the
Tigers' director of scouting. ``A lot of times in these situations
where you've got a guy trying to come back, well, they're not quite
as far along as you were led to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't the case with Andy. He threw loose and easy and
had good velocity. We have a need for young pitching, and we
convinced him that his path would be clear if he signed with us and
pitched well.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount signed with the Tigers for a reported $60,000. He says
other teams offered more money, but the Tigers and the Hendrickses
have a good relationship, and Yount was impressed with the Tigers'
honesty. In the Instructional League, Yount gained strength as the
season progressed. By the end of it, Smith and Steve Boros, who
runs the Instructional League for the Tigers, were impressed with
Yount's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our standpoint, he pitched very well,'' Smith said. ``He
was in shape and got in better shape. Right now, the concern or the
measuring stick to the comeback is what happens with his second and
third pitch. He has experienced some difficulty in coming up with
the breaking ball. But we were encouraged with what we saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perverse way, that accident might end up helping him get
better movement on his pitches. Plus, I think going through what he
went through had a big effect on him. Sometimes, guys who are No. 1
picks can get a little spoiled. I don't know if that was the case
with Andy, but I know that having to battle through this and
realizing he might never play again should make him appreciate
whatever he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount understands that coming up with pitches to complement his
fastball will determine how far he advances. But he has had some
success making the ball sink and run because of the way he must
hold it in his crooked middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the really strange part to all of this,'' he said. ``If
I can get consistency with sinking the ball because of the way my
finger is, then this whole thing might end up being a plus. There
were times when the ball just zipped and dipped.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of agony, Yount is talking like a pitcher again.
He says the diverse path his career took has taught him to
appreciate what he has now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong. I'd trade it all in a minute for the way
things were before,'' Yount said. ``But nobody has gone through
what I've gone through to get where I'm at. I lost a couple years,
but now I'm back to having a chance again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think that because I got a lot of money, that
was all that mattered. If I was just going to play for the money,
that's fine. But I'm playing because I love it. Who knows what's
going to happen, but I think this is going to make a heck of a book
someday.''

HELEN MALSED, TOY INVENTOR SOUPED UP THE SLINKY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Helen Herrick Malsed, a lumber baron's daughter whose
imagination gave rise to the popular Slinky Dog and Slinky Train
toys, died Nov. 13 in Seattle, her home for almost 60 years. She
was 88.
</P>
<P>
   She created more than 26 toys or games, including the first
board game based on Roman numerals, said Fredrick Malsed, her son.
</P>
<P>
   Among her other inventions, Malsed said, were irregular-shaped
interlocking beads sold as ``jewelry'' for children. The beads were
large, to eliminate the risk of choking; she sold that idea to a
major toy manufacturer in 1958 for $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   By then, her son said, Mrs. Malsed was collecting royalties of
$60,000 to $70,000 annually. The checks continued for the 17 years
of her patent for the idea that she proposed to the company that
made the Slinky.
</P>
<P>
   That company is James Industries of Hollidaysburg, Pa., the
inventor and manufacturer of the original, unadorned Slinky, a
coiled 80-foot-long steel wire equally capable of somersaulting
gracefully down steps or ending up at the foot of the steps in a
maddening tangle.
</P>
<P>
   Invented in 1944 by Richard James, an engineer who worked at a
Philadelphia shipyard, the toy was named by his wife, Betty, and
the following year the sinuous Slinky was on its way to sales of an
estimated 250 million. Eventually a Slinky wound up under the
Malsed Christmas tree, where according to family legend, 6-year-old
Fredrick thought to ask, ``I wonder what this could do with
wheels?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother had always listened carefully to children,'' Malsed
said, ``so she immediately got father to go to the basement, take
the wheels off another toy and try to solder them on a Slinky
spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, Richard T. James II said, ``Mrs. Malsed sent us
a letter and some drawings, suggesting we put the Slinky in the
body of a pull-toy, and we liked the idea.'' While Mrs. Malsed and
James Industries maintained ``a very nice relationship'' even after
her patent expired, James said, he did not remember her ever
visiting the factory.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Malsed invented pull-toys for other manufacturers, but none
as popular as those for Slinky.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Cincinnati, Mrs. Malsed spent her first 16 years in St.
Maries, Idaho, before moving to Spokane, Wash., with her family.
Her father, Fred Herrick, had lumber operations in seven states
from Washington to Florida, Malsed said, and traveled to the sites
in his private railroad car. But he lost $12 million in the
Depression, and his daughter Helen was forced to drop out of
Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   After studying advertising in San Francisco, she was offered a
job at the Frederick &AMP; Nelson department store in Seattle, where
she met and married Marion Parker Malsed, who sold men's clothing
in the store.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Malsed's husband died in 1973. In addition to her son, also
of Seattle, she is survived by her sisters, Catherine Chastek of
Spokane and Fredrica Adams of Seattle, and two grandchildren.

BIOMEDICAL ENGINEER ENVISIONS ARTIFICIAL REPLACEMENTS FOR FAULTY
ORGANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The future is a wondrous place for Alfred Mann.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of seven electronics and biomedical firms, including
Sylmar, Calif.-based MiniMed Inc., Mann envisions a day when the
deaf can hear, the blind see and the chronically ill leave their
conditions behind.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know him say the 73-year-old engineer will be at the
forefront of such progress.
</P>
<P>
   Mann has spent a lifetime developing devices that augment or
replace defective parts of the human body. In the process, Mann has
accumulated a personal wealth estimated at $500 million, allowing
him to fund the planned construction of biomedical research centers
at the University of Southern California and the University of
California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life has been a fairy tale,'' the nuts-and-bolts scientist
said, apparently as amazed as anyone at his good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Now well past the age when most of his peers have retired, Mann
is embarking on some of his most ambitious projects to date,
applying 50 years of engineering prowess to conditions as varied
and stubborn as blindness and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   While the projects are daunting, even fantastic by some
reckoning, those who have worked with Mann say he has seldom taken
on a job he didn't see through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd call this (guy) the most excellent medical device story of
the century,'' gushed Salomon Smith Barney analyst Melissa Wilmoth.
</P>
<P>
   Fairy tale, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Mann's business fiefdom is MiniMed, based in the
suburban Los Angeles community of Sylmar approximately 24 miles
north of downtown, and it is at that 485-employee company that much
of the work which most excites Mann is being done.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed specializes in diabetes-control devices, including a
popular insulin infusion pump that eliminates the need for repeated
daily injections of the glucose-regulating drug. The company has
seen sales climb to roughly $100 million annually and is considered
the U.S. firm best poised to profit from a growing awareness,
particularly among health plans, of the need for aggressive
treatment of types 1 and 2 diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (insulin pump) market is only 6 to 7 percent penetrated
in the U.S.,'' said Scott Wilkin, an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read
in New York. ``There's a lot of legs left in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Parallel to the pump, MiniMed has been developing an implantable
sensor for continuous, real-time testing of a diabetic's blood
sugar level, eliminating the need for repeated finger pricks to
draw blood. By combining that sensor with the pump, Mann hopes to
``close the loop,'' producing the world's first artificial
pancreas, able to simultaneously monitor and adjust a diabetic's
glucose level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be revolutionary, the end of the problems of diabetes
as we know it,'' said Dr. Francine Kaufman, former president of the
American Diabetes Association and a professor of medicine at USC.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said that while the technological hurdles involved have
to date prevented the development of such a device by others, ``I
have no doubt Al Mann will do it. He is a visionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Using much the same concept, Mann and MiniMed are pursuing a
pump system for more effective dosing of AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Patients on certain AIDS medications take pills or injections
throughout the day to compensate for the drugs' short
effectiveness, periods often as small as two hours. To dampen the
peak-and-valley effect that such a regimen inevitably causes,
patients are kept on doses high enough so that even when the drug
level in their bodies tapers off prior to their next injection, it
is still concentrated enough to fight the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Mann is working on a pump system that, as with insulin, would
dribble the drug out steadily and at ideal concentrations. The
anticipated result is that patients could cut their current doses
by up to 98 percent with no drop in efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At higher drug concentrations the side effects are greater and
there are more costs. The whole idea is to try to minimize those,''
Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   While pumps dominate MiniMed, neural stimulation is the theme at
Advanced Bionics, another Mann company in Sylmar. Arguably more
research-oriented than MiniMed, the firm uses artificially
generated electrical impulses to simulate bodily functions such as
hearing and muscle control.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Advanced Bionics' biggest hit has been a cochlear
implant that allows a wide category of profoundly deaf patients to
hear. ``That's not a small feat,'' Mann said. But now Mann has
turned his sights on vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a straightforward approach,'' Mann said, though what he
describes is anything but. By attaching hundreds of electrodes to a
light-sensitive computer chip and then connecting each lead to the
optic nerve, the hope is that Advanced Bionics engineers can
construct an artificial eye.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the number of electrodes, Mann said. ``Right now
we have about 60 and in the near future should have a few more. But
you need on the order of a thousand,'' he said. ``We have an
in-house time line of four years if everything goes right.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar technology is being explored for restoring muscle
control to paraplegics, continence to people who have lost bladder
control and for the easing of chronic pain.
</P>
<P>
   As with most of Mann's undertakings, Advanced Bionics' work
promises not only a better quality of life for the devices' users
but enormous profits for its creator. Indeed, while Mann has said
money is no longer a strong motivator, he is a true believer in the
link between science and business. Fostering that connection is the
purpose of the university centers he is funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept of these institutions is to . . . be a
bridge, to create on a university campus an industrial lab that
licenses its research to companies for manufacturing and
marketing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the centers is expected to be opened at USC before
2000, with the UCLA facility to follow.
</P>
<P>
   With arguably his fullest plate ever, Mann, a divorced father of
six, said he has no time to worry or desire to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Us older guys get up at night and go to the bathroom a lot.
When I get up, sometimes I have difficulty falling asleep again.
But it's no worry; I'm usually thinking about some device I'm
trying to figure out. . . . I just like to work.''

TOXIC CLEANUP IS NEEDED AT HARTFORD STADIUM SITE, OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The riverfront land that is to be the site of
a stadium for the New England Patriots is contaminated with toxic
materials, regulators said Sunday, which could threaten the state's
promise to have the football field ready in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators said the site along the Connecticut River
contained toxic leftovers from a former coal gasification plant and
from yards where barges unloaded coal for other plants on the site
in the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   John DeVillars, the Environmental Protection Agency's
administrator for New England, said the stadium site had ``fairly
significant contamination,'' including coal tar, hydrocarbons and
volatile organic compounds, but could be cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply a question of time and money, not a question of
whether or not the project can go forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Devillars said that the project would require at least three
federal and state environmental approvals, and that the stadium
developers must compile and submit an environmental impact report,
which can be a lengthy process.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, a Patriots official signaled flexibility
Sunday about the deal, which had been presented to legislators as
all but a take-it-or-leave-it proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timetable is very important to us,'' said Andy Wasynczuk,
the team's vice president for business operations. Speaking of the
environmental issues at the site, he added: ``Our hope and
expectation is to be ready for 2001. But we obviously are going to
need to respect the seriousness of these things, and work through
them as they come up. We can't expect this thing to be clear
sailing from the beginning to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the process could be delayed further by a civil
rights complaint against the state Department of Environmental
Protection that is now being reviewed by the EPA. The complaint was
filed by neighbors of a Hartford landfill where deposits from a $1
billion redevelopment project already planned for the site were to
be dumped. The redevelopment project, Adriaen's Landing, includes a
hotel and convention center in addition to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the state Senate, Kevin Sullivan of West
Hartford, has been an enthusiastic backer of the stadium project,
but he said the environmental question was one of several that had
caught legislative leaders off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told face to face by the governor's negotiators, `The
site is clean,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The announced cost for the stadium project was $350 million. But
state legislators, who would have to approve the deal, have been
told that the price, allowing for inflation, is expected to be $375
million. Analysts have scoffed at Gov. John G. Rowland's claim that
the stadium can be built at no cost to taxpayers. The new expenses
seem likely to add to legislators' skepticism as they head toward a
special session of the Connecticut General Assembly on Dec. 15,
when a vote on the deal is to be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland remained optimistic _ even ebullient _ as he discussed
the stadium in an interview after showing off the Christmas
decorations at the Executive Residence on Sunday. He acknowledged
that the project faced complications, but he said all of them had
been anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel we can work these issues out,'' he said. ``In a
worst-case scenario, would it be a different location? It's
possible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The governor said that in response to the concerns of
legislators, he hoped to add to the contract a significant penalty
or ``exit fee'' _ perhaps $10 million _ if the Patriots were to
leave the stadium before the 30-year lease ended.
</P>
<P>
   There could be two other hurdles, according to Hartford and
state officials. A plant that now operates on the site, supplying
steam to downtown office buildings, would have to be moved, and the
plant's owner, C.T.G. Resources Inc., said the cost would be about
$100 million. And lawyers for the state are looking into the
possibility that because of the deal's structure, the bonds that
would be sold to finance the stadium might not be tax-exempt,
increasing the state's cost of borrowing the money.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-exempt status of the bonds could be jeopardized under
federal law, state officials said, because more than 10 percent of
the project might be paid back by a private business _ in this
case, a ticket tax that the Patriots would pay the state. If the
bonds were not tax-exempt, the state would have to pay a higher
interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Ryan, secretary of the Connecticut Office of Policy and
Management, said the state's bond lawyers believed that at least a
major part of the bond issue would be tax-exempt. ``That is clearly
a major issue for us,'' he said.

FISET SET TO RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Not that we haven't heard this before, but Stephane
Fiset appears ready to return to the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks after his first groin strain and nearly five weeks
after his second, the Kings' No. 1 goalie is expected to start
tonight when the Kings (6-13-3) visit the Montreal Canadiens
(7-12-2) in a scintillating matchup of teams that each have lost
seven of eight games.
</P>
<P>
   For Fiset, a Montreal native, his anticipated return couldn't
have come at a better time, even though the Kings haven't won a
regular-season game in this city in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always special,'' Fiset said of playing in his hometown.
``You play in front of friends and family. It's always special to
come back here and play against the Canadiens.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset is accustomed to visiting Montreal as an opponent, having
broken into the NHL with the Quebec Nordiques, who became the
Colorado Avalanche in 1995. Of the old rivalry between the
Canadiens and Nordiques, Fiset said, ``It was pretty big. It put,
not pressure, but more fun to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all in the past and Fiset is hoping his injury problems
also are behind him. He said he is going to try not to remember
Oct. 28 in New Jersey, the night he returned from his first injury
only to suffer a second one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I start thinking about that, for sure, I'm going to get
hurt again,'' Fiset said. ``So I'll just do my workout and make
sure I'm in good shape and work with the trainers to make sure it
doesn't repeat again.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Scouting trip: General Manager Dave Taylor and director of
player personnel Bill O'Flaherty went on a scouting trip Sunday,
taking in a pair of junior games: Hull at Shawinigan and Halifax at
Quebec City. At the first of those games, they watched Shawinigan
defenseman Mathieu Biron, the Kings' first-round draft choice this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor attended the Canadiens' game against Pittsburgh at the
Molson Centre on Saturday night and was seated next to Vancouver
general manager Brian Burke. With the league-wide sweepstakes in
high gear to acquire disgruntled Canucks star Pavel Bure, what did
Taylor and Burke discuss?
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about the rain in Los Angeles,'' Taylor said coyly.
</P>
<P>
   Mighty Ducks general manager Pierre Gauthier also attended
Saturday night's Canadiens game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Loose pucks: This will be the only meeting between the Kings
and Canadiens. Last season, the Kings were 0-2 against Montreal,
losing by a combined margin of 6-1. The Kings are 7-42-11 all-time
in Montreal. . . . The Kings have lost 98 games to injury in the
first 22 games. Last season, they lost 33 games to injury in the
first 22 games. . . . The Kings' record is their worst through 22
games since a 5-15-2 start in 1985-86.

OFF THE WALL: MALONE'S HAPLESS HOLIDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-six shopping days 'til Christmas and the mall is decked
elbow-to-elbow with big-wheelin' GMs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dodgers' Kevin Malone is circling around the
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Might as well wheel into the handicap slot, bud, 'cause in a
replay of what happened in Baltimore, there's a brain lock when it
comes to distributing a bottomless pile of money.
</P>
<P>
   Acting and looking more and more like Herman Stiles _ the
befuddled gump of a high school assistant coach for Burt Reynolds
in ``Evening Shade'' _ Malone finds himself with a one-in-four
chance of getting Randy Johnson's scrawling on a $50 mil contract
today, the Unit's self-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
   All R.J. has to do is look at what Malone has done to sweeten
things for him thus far: one set-up guy named Mel, another who's
been through the Mills, and he's talked his Lasorda-appointed
closer out of working for Marge Schott. And his pitching coach will
be a guy who specialized in knuckleballs.
</P>
<P>
   Whooo-eee.
</P>
<P>
   We're all geeked up for Vero Beach now, while the Unit heads for
Phoenix. Just can't wait for that two-game transcontinental freeway
series with the N.Y. Yankees in March when Bernie Williams comes in
to make a shoestring catch on Devon White's pop fly to end the
fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   So Fox followers, just don't be too stunned when El Unite flips
a coin today _ Jerome Bettis can even call it _ and demystified
L.A., which will consider Todd Hundley its next big-money target,
comes up the whiner. . . .

 &HT;    Shoe flies; Georgia squeaks by Texas
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The wheels didn't come off for the struggling
University of Texas men's basketball team Sunday night against
talented Georgia. But unfortunately for the Longhorns, Ivan
Wagner's shoe did.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, Texas' junior point guard, lost his balance when he came
out of his left shoe while going up for the potential game-winning
shot in the final second. Wagner slipped, the ball went astray, and
the Bulldogs escaped with a 78-77 victory before 6,024 onlookers in
the Erwin Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's the Reeboks,'' UT guard William Clay joked sadly
after the hard-luck Longhorns fell to 0-4 and saw leading scorer
Kris Clack dislocate his right shoulder on the game's final play.
Georgia improved to 4-1 thanks to center Robb Dryden's career-high
22 points on nine-of-12 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Clack, designated to take the last shot, was hurt when the
Bulldogs' zone collapsed on him with time running out. He managed
to flip the ball to Wagner on the baseline to the right of the
basket before collapsing in pain. Wagner said he had a relatively
open path to the hoop but slipped when his shoe fell off and was
forced to throw up an unanswered prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an easy layup, had my shoe stayed on,'' Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he (Wagner) had us beat for a layup, or we were
going to foul him,'' Bulldogs Coach Ron Jirsa said. ``I couldn't
see exactly what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   UT officials said Clack's shoulder will be X-rayed today.
First-year coach Rick Barnes was uncertain how much time, if any,
his senior All-Big 12 candidate will miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't seem to get any luck at all,'' said Barnes, who also
was forced to play the final three minutes, 22 seconds without
Chris Mihm after the 7-foot center collapsed in agony with severe
cramps in both legs.
</P>
<P>
   Clack had given the Longhorns a 77-76 lead with 21.1 seconds
remaining when he hit a short jumper in the lane _ his second
straight field goal in 24 seconds after missing 15 of his first 16
shots. Out of timeouts, the Bulldogs answered when point guard G.G.
Smith was fouled by forward Gabe Muoneke with 9.3 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who finished with 16 points, hit both free throws despite
a full UT timeout before the first one and a 20-second timeout
between them.
</P>
<P>
   With Mihm resting under the north basket on the opposite end of
the floor, Clack became Texas' first option on the final play
despite his earlier offensive struggles _ ``When it got down to
money time and we needed him to step up for us, he did,'' Barnes
said. Muoneke, who finished with a game-high 23 points, was the
second option, but when Georgia swarmed him, Clack saw Wagner free
on the baseline and got him the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, off to its worst start since 1974, played gallantly
against the Bulldogs, whose only loss is a seven-point decision at
North Carolina. With Clack suffering a horrendous shooting night
until the final 46 seconds and Mihm missing at the end, the
undermanned Longhorns had to scramble even more than usual and
several players stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke was the main contributor. The junior forward scored with
23 points (three of four three-pointers) and did a marvelous
defensive job on Georgia's Jumaine Jones. The Bulldogs' sophomore
entered the night with a team-high 20.8 scoring average, but was
limited to only three points, all free throws, and attempted only
four field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Dryden helped pick up the slack for the Bulldogs, however. His
scoring output was seven points more than the 7-foot-1-inch
sophomore scored all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Also playing well was Clay, who kept the Longhorns within
striking distance in the first half by hitting all five three-point
attempts. He scored all his 17 points in the opening half.
Seldom-used backup center Marlon Drakes hit all four of his field
goals for a career-high eight points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel for these guys,'' Barnes said of the Longhorns,
who rallied from a 74-68 deficit with three minutes remaining. ``I
hate it for them, but they really are working hard and getting
better.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Nov. 30:
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts of a cold winter add a measure of urgency to this
year's New York Cares Coat Drive, which starts tomorrow. This
valuable charitable program, now in its 10th season, collects
``gently used'' adult and child-sized winter coats for distribution
to the homeless, the elderly poor and needy youngsters in New York
and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Before the drive ends on Dec. 31, its organizers hope to collect
more than 85,000 usable parkas and overcoats. The need is great,
and it is easy for people lucky enough to own extra coats to share
with those who cannot afford even one.
</P>
<P>
   For those wishing to make a donation, the drop-off sites include
all police stations in New York City, all Con Edison business
offices in the city and Westchester County and all Blockbuster
Video stores in the city, Long Island and New Jersey. Other sites
include all Loews/Sony theaters and NCA dry cleaners in New York
City and New Jersey, and Home Depot stores in the city, Long Island
and Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   On weekdays from 7:30 to 9:30 a.m., coats can be deposited at
Grand Central Terminal near the 42nd Street and Vanderbilt Avenue
entrance, and at the Amtrak concourse entrance and the Long Island
Rail Road level in Penn Station. Those wishing more information
about making a donation or setting up a drop-off site may call

ANALYSIS: WHAT LED TO UNION'S DOWNFALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The takeover of District Council 37, New York City's
largest municipal union, by its parent union in Washington is a
stark indication of how far the council has fallen.
</P>
<P>
   The parent union hopes to restore order, integrity and a little
luster to the disgraced district council, which is the target of a
district attorney's investigation into allegations of vote fraud,
embezzlement and kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   But transforming the council into an effective fighter for its
more than 100,000 members will not be easy. In some ways, the
council, a coalition of 56 union locals, resembles less a union
that battles for its members than a dues-paying club whose leaders
take bloated salaries and extravagant trips.
</P>
<P>
   When Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees, named one of his top aides,
Lee Saunders, to run the district council, neither man tipped his
hand about what reforms would be instituted. But Saunders, as
trustee, can be expected to introduce far-reaching changes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the move leaves many questions unanswered. Will Stanley
Hill, the executive director of the council who was pushed aside
Saturday, ever take back his old post? How many union officials
will be indicted as a result of the inquiry by the Manhattan
district attorney? What will happen to Albert Diop, who was widely
considered the man behind the council's throne and whose local was
the locus of the voting fraud in the 1996 contract ratification?
What will shunting Hill aside mean for his ally, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, and for the council's five-year contract with the city?
</P>
<P>
   A small group of dissident leaders is already proposing changes.
They say the council's executive director should be directly
elected by all members; the current process is dominated by a
handful of leaders. In light of a history of election fraud, the
dissidents say every council election and ratification vote should
be overseen by an independent outside group, like the American
Arbitration Association. And these critics say the council's
executive board needs to be reorganized so that it is no longer a
group of unquestioning supporters of the executive director. Many
board members receive a stipend of $30,000 or more each year for
attending one or two lavishly catered meetings a month.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with District Attorney Robert Morgenthau's
investigation say more than one-third of the council's 24 board
members are under investigation. Joseph DeCanio, president of a
highway laborers' local, has pleaded guilty to embezzling more than
$50,000 as part of a scheme to supply Thanksgiving turkeys to other
locals. The heads of four other locals are being investigated for
buying turkeys from DeCanio and perhaps receiving kickbacks from
him.
</P>
<P>
   Francine Autovino, president of a local representing City
University administrative assistants, is being investigated over
the disappearance of $190,000 from her local's treasury. She denies
any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are also investigating Charles Hughes, president of
a local for cafeteria workers and crossing guards. An internal
judicial panel expelled Hughes from the union after finding that he
embezzled more than $1.7 million. Hughes' lawyer insists he is
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   And Diop, who heads the clerical workers' local, is under
investigation over his local's paying rent for him to use a
penthouse apartment in the district council's headquarters. Diop's
local flew more than 100 people to AFSCME's recent convention in
Hawaii. Prosecutors are looking into that, too, along with Diop's
role, if any, in the 1996 voting fraud. Diop denies any
participation in the fraud and council officials say he did not
live in the penthouse. Robert Myers Jr., treasurer of Diop's local
and the treasurer of the parent district council, is also under
investigation into the writing of checks on Diop's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as bad as any union mess since the federal takeover of
the Teamsters in 1989,'' said Arthur Schwartz, a lawyer for several
locals in the council.
</P>
<P>
   Several supporters say Hill will probably seek to regain the
executive director's post when the trusteeship ends. But Hill's
critics predict that AFSCME will bar him from that position by
concluding that he breached his fiduciary duty by not preventing
corruption from flourishing on his watch. Among the names mentioned
as possible successors to Hill are Charles Ensley, president of a
local representing 14,000 social workers, and Saunders _ that is if
he puts the pieces back together and deftly lines up political
support.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's passing from the scene could make labor relations tougher
for Giuliani because Hill has been so conciliatory to the mayor,
whom he enthusiastically supported in last year's election.
Saunders, is expected to take a more aggressive stance on numerous
issues, including workfare and contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   With Hill having admitted that the council's contract was
ratified through fraud, several council leaders and some other
unions whose contracts are patterned after the council's are
demanding that their contracts be reopened. And several locals in
the council say they will sue the city Monday, charging that it
owes the union damages on the ground that city officials knew or
should have known about the fraud in the 1996 ratification vote.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor undoubtedly recognizes that if he agrees to reopen any
contracts, it might make him look soft on labor and could hurt his
conservative credentials at a time when he may seek the vice
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Giuliani wants to run for a U.S. Senate seat and
needs to tack toward the center and woo unions, then, labor experts
say, it would make political sense for him to reopen the unions'
contracts. The unions now screaming at the mayor may warm up to him
if he offers them a 1 percent or 2 percent raise above what their
existing contracts provide.

EDITORIAL: CONFRONTING AN UNFAIR CENSUS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Nov. 30:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court will hear arguments today on the legality of
the Clinton administration's plan to use statistical sampling in
the 2000 census. The purpose of the sampling is to correct for the
predictable undercounting of poor minorities by conventional
census-taking methods. The court's judgment will be momentous, both
for its immediate practical consequences and its symbolic message.
</P>
<P>
   Mandated by Article I of the Constitution, the decennial census
count is the basic arithmetic of democracy. It influences the
division of political power in Congress and the states, and shapes
the flow of many government benefits. Absent a statistical
adjustment, minority groups will continue to be disproportionately
undercounted and the areas they live in will be shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy is not trivial. While the 1990 census missed
about 2 percent of the nation's overall population, it missed 4.8
percent of the black population and 5.2 percent of the Hispanic
population. Statisticians support the feasibility of using sampling
methods to improve the count's accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Court are two recent lower court rulings from
Washington and Virginia that held the planned use of sampling as
part of the next census to be illegal, at least for the purpose of
apportioning seats in Congress. Those rulings relied on a Federal
Census Act provision that requires the Secretary of Commerce to use
sampling in determining population ``except for'' the purpose of
congressional reapportionment. But that statutory language was not
meant to bar sampling for reapportionment, merely to make its use
discretionary.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans behind both lawsuits speak in high-minded
tones about the potential for political manipulation if sampling is
used. What they really fear is not a phony count but the
possibility of an accurate count that would increase the political
power of predominantly Democratic areas. They also claim that
sampling violates the constitutional requirement of an ``actual
enumeration'' of the population. But the court should not embrace
such a frozen view given the Framers' clear intent to provide a
reliable tally.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the court dismissed claims that the federal government
has a constitutional obligation to adjust census results to correct
the racially disparate undercount. But it did not say that such a
correction is impermissible. For the justices to do so now would
disregard the statute and the vital principles of equal political
participation and one person, one vote.

COMMENTARY: REPUBLICAN FEUDS YIELD A NEW PARTY DIALECTIC
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mention the deep rift in American politics, and everyone thinks
of Republicans and Democrats. But the last election revealed a more
subtle division between political professionals and voters. Indeed
some Republicans feel that behind the party's destructive obsession
with President Clinton was a larger structural problem: a centrally
controlled fund-raising and attack strategy that lost touch with
the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Republican to challenge the system is Sen. Chuck
Hagel of Nebraska, who wants to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky as director of the party's Senate election operation. As
the Senate GOP's fundraiser-in-chief, McConnell harvested huge sums
in unregulated ``soft money'' from special interests to pay for
negative ads against Democrats. He also battled campaign-finance
reform sponsored by Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Russell
Feingold of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign reform is needed to wipe away the corrupting influence
of the open-ended contributions from corporations, unions and rich
individuals that have been outlawed for candidates for most of this
century. But Hagel is not running as a campaign ``reformer.'' He
opposed the McCain-Feingold ban on unlimited donations to both
parties and independent groups using the funds for television ads
close to an election. Unlike McConnell, however, Hagel says the
current system does not work and needs to be changed. His practical
argument may be more persuasive than the reformers' philosophical
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``soft money'' has to be raised and spent by parties,
not candidates, McConnell served as the mastermind in Washington.
Hagel wants to redirect Senate fund-raising to ``hard money,'' for
spending by candidates as they see fit. He hopes to tap the anger
among Republicans at McConnell's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, for example, McConnell spent money for negative
ads on flag-burning and abortion against Feingold. They backfired,
and Feingold won. California Republicans also feel that they might
have beaten Sen. Barbara Boxer if they had spent the money
themselves. Everyone is angry over McConnell's refusal to give much
money to Rep. Linda Smith, who lost to Sen. Patty Murray in
Washington state. Ms. Smith was being punished for her support of
campaign reform.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel also notes that the Republicans have to limit the
open-ended spending for the mostly negative ads by the Christian
Coalition, labor unions and other groups that have often done more
harm than good. The principle that candidates who control their own
spending have a better chance to win could be much more persuasive
than any lofty arguments about reform.
</P>
<P>
   In the current Senate, a majority already supports campaign
reform. Now one newly elected Republican, George Voinovich of Ohio,
is on record favoring the McCain-Feingold bill. If Hagel defeats
McConnell _ a big ``if'' because of fierce opposition by Trent
Lott, the majority leader _ it could drastically improve the
chances of a campaign overhaul. Senate Republicans vote this week
on Hagel's challenge. Whatever the outcome, the vote could reflect
discontent with Lott's and McConnell's use of soft money to push
ideological positions at the expense of candidates.

EDITORIAL: SUBSIDY FOR THE STOCK EXCHANGE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Nov. 30:
</P>
<P>
   New York City's economy is diverse, but no industry comes close
to the financial business in its importance to the welfare of the
city. The New York Stock Exchange, which has been on Wall Street
for more than 200 years, is both the symbolic and actual center of
that business. Now the exchange says it needs to expand its trading
floor to make its operations more international and to remain
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The question that faces the Giuliani and Pataki administrations
is whether a financial-aid package intended to keep the exchange in
lower Manhattan is corporate welfare on a grand scale or a
necessary investment to preserve the city's tax base. Keeping the
exchange in its traditional location will require the largest
subsidy package in city history, but the investment is justifiable,
for the loss of the tax revenues generated by the exchange and
related businesses would be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for the city and state to buy the block across
Broad Street from the exchange's current facility _ between Broad
and William Streets and between Wall Street and Exchange Place. The
historic facade of the J.P. Morgan building at 23 Wall Street would
be preserved as the buildings on the block were torn down.
</P>
<P>
   In their place would rise a large office tower, with the bottom
floors containing the new trading area, and associated computer
operations, while the upper floors would be rented out to corporate
customers. The rent from the exchange and the payments in lieu of
taxes from the developer of the office tower are expected to offset
the $250 million to $300 million cost of acquiring the land.
</P>
<P>
   The city and state would pay up to $450 million to build the new
trading area, with the exchange paying several hundred million
dollars to outfit it. There would be $160 million in tax
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Such a generous package may seem excessive. But a decision by
the exchange to leave lower Manhattan would damage the city's
economy, and the exchange has threatened to move to New Jersey if a
deal is not reached by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   We understand why some oppose on principle any concession to the
blackmailing tactics of businesses that threaten to move unless
they get public assistance. But the reality is that if New York
City refuses to play this game, other, hungrier cities and states
will take advantage of that passivity. Then Manhattan, in
particular, will see its prestige residents lured away like so many
free agents.
</P>
<P>
   If the exchange did leave, the city and state would lose much of
the income taxes now paid by those who work at the exchange. Many
companies that need to be close to the exchange would also move,
causing property values _ and property tax revenues _ to fall
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange is the pre-eminent stock exchange in
the world, but it faces challenges from Europe, where the new euro
currency will encourage consolidation and major exchanges are
trying to cooperate. The new trading floor will help the Big Board,
and the taxes generated by its location in Manhattan will more than
offset the high cost of this plan.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Silber, a hematologist and educator, died on Nov. 3
at his home in Durham, N.C. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart disease, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   At his death Silber had been a clinical professor of medicine at
Duke University Medical Center in Durham for six years. He was
director of New York University School of Medicine's hematology
division from 1968 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   His scientific research focused chiefly on leukemia and on the
treatment of hematologic malignancies. In 1989 he was one of a
group of scientists who reported in the journal Science that a drug
derived from a Chinese tree had proved to be a potent agent against
colon cancer in experiments on animals.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Vienna, he went with his family to the Dominican
Republic in 1939 to escape Nazism. The family came to the United
States in 1945, and he received a bachelor's degree in 1950 from
New York University and a medical degree in 1954 from State
University of New York, Downstate Medical Center, in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the New York University medical school faculty in
1962. The honors he received included a Guggenheim Fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   His 1954 marriage to Barbara Carol Antell ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Barbara Kamhi Silber; two daughters, Dr.
Andrea Dickey of Guilford, Conn., and Laura Silber of Manhattan;
two sons, Jeffrey of Ithaca, N.Y., and Michael of Manhattan, and
four grandchildren.

BISHOPS APPEAL FOR MORE HURRICANE AID

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the Sunday after Thanksgiving, the archbishop of
Honduras said he had come to St. Patrick's Cathedral mainly to give
thanks.
</P>
<P>
   But in his chronicle of the devastation a hurricane called Mitch
had wrought on his country, Archbishop Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga
made one thing plain: the time for giving was not over.
</P>
<P>
   With bridges and highways washed away, crops destroyed and
disease spreading quickly among the very poor, he said, the wrath
of Hurricane Mitch was not likely to end anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two days, we went backwards 50 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a month after the hurricane, the deadliest natural
disaster to strike Central America this century, killed more than
10,000 people in Honduras and Nicaragua, the archbishop said the
planes bearing food and relief supplies from abroad were coming
less and less often _ ``I would say rather seldom.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal by the archbishop, who spoke on Sunday morning, was
followed in the afternoon by that of Bishop Leopoldo Brenes of
Nicaragua. A collection was taken up on Sunday for Central American
flood relief; so far, the New York Archdiocese has distributed
about $3.75 million in food, medicine, water and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   As residents of Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, braced for
another round of rain and flooding, Rodriguez stressed that the
need for immediate short-term relief remained. Bodies were still
being pulled from under the wreckage, he said, with some 7,000
Hondurans confirmed dead and another 8,000 missing.
</P>
<P>
   In Tegucigalpa alone, he said, more than 150,000 people remained
homeless and the city's poorest neighborhoods lacked potable water.
Cases of dengue and typhoid have been reported, he said, and
hepatitis and malaria, chronic health concerns in Honduras, have
worsened.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop said people were afraid to eat meat for fear of
what the surviving livestock may have eaten.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop urged officials in Washington to consider giving
temporary legal status to illegal Honduran immigrants working in
this country.

CIGARETTE FACTORY PUFFS ECONOMIC LIFE INTO TRIBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MACY, Neb. _ They tried bingo and bombed. Next, the Omaha
converted their 2,000-seat hall into a health club. It didn't make
enough to pay utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, much of the hall hums with machines that roll North
Carolina tobacco with paper and filters and stuff the resulting
cigarettes into packs, then into cartons and finally into cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to make some money and to create a few jobs,''
said Elmer Blackbird, Omaha tribal chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The American Indian tribe desperately needs both.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment among the 3,200 or so Omaha who live on the
reservation exceeds 70 percent. And gambling profits, a bonanza for
so many other tribes, have always eluded them. They opened a casino
several years ago in Onawa, Iowa, but when the state legalized
riverboat gambling, the tribe's remote gaming location lost 75
percent of its take.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to menthol, full flavor, light and ultralight
Omahas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking about buying some more equipment so we can make
100s,'' said Franklin Dick, general manager of the only tribally
owned cigarette factory in the country. Those longer 100s
cigarettes, he said, are in demand for the bargain hunters the
Omaha brand is after.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tell us that if we can just make 100s, business will
really take off.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Omaha Nation Tobacco Co. plant produces more than
40,000 cartons a week _ well short of even 1 percent of the
domestic cigarette market. But that's business enough to employ 14
workers _ a dozen Omahas and two nontribal technicians. More than
200 other members of the tribe have applied for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part the tribe's status as a sovereign nation gives
it little economic advantage. Only those very few cigarettes sold
from one Indian to another on the Omaha reservation in northeast
Nebraska and west-central Iowa are exempt from state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tribe prices its smokes low _ at roughly half what
Marlboros or Camels sell for _ and has tapped an informal network
of stores on tribal reservations that sell large quantities of
cigarettes of all kinds at roadside shops across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes sold by American Indians to non-Indians on Indian
land are subject to state taxes, although states often have
difficulty collecting the surcharges. Many tribes have compacts
with state revenue departments, agreeing to collect the tax on
reservations in return for half the money.
</P>
<P>
   When the price isn't discounted, sales are weak. At the Golden
Eagle Casino owned by the Kickapoo tribe near Horton, Kan., the
Omahas were put in a machine and sold at the standard $2 price
charged for other brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sold about two packs in two months,'' said Juell Keo,
casino purchasing agent.
</P>
<P>
   If the tribe can command just 1 percent of the cigarette market,
a federal ``buy Indian'' law would require them to be carried at
every American military outpost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't handle that volume yet,'' said Dick. ``But down
the road that would mean quite a few jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Omaha reservation the cigarettes sell for 80 cents a
pack. On the Cheyenne reservation in Oklahoma a carton of 10 packs
sells for $7.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ship them everywhere, from Long Island to Washington
state,'' said Dick. ``They're really catching on at other
reservations.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribes, in fact, make for an especially good smoking market. In
nearly every category _ men, women, high school seniors _ smoking
among Indians is about 30 percent above the national average,
although the rates vary widely from tribe to tribe. Studies by the
Indian Health Service blamed 10 percent of Indian deaths on
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very serious health issue among Indians,'' said W.
Craig Vanderwagen, the director of clinical and preventative
services for the Indian Health Service.
</P>
<P>
   And that has some Omaha feeling at least uncomfortable about the
tribe's tobacco business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live among my Omaha people, and we're all pitiful. You know,
we're in terrible poverty,'' said Barry Webster, director of the
Four Hills of Life Wellness Center, in Macy. ``The cigarette plant
is good in the sense that it's providing jobs....But I hate to see
our people hurting themselves with the smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   The plant has had some troubles. Blackbird, who leads a new
tribal council elected this month, said that the cigarettes were
producing modest profits for the tribe and that the new tribal
administration hoped to improve management at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard rumors that there's some (financial)
irregularities at the plant,'' Blackbird said. Federal and tribal
authorities report that no charges have been filed in connection
with the tribe's cigarette operation.
</P>
<P>
   Dick, a member of the council that was defeated in the November
elections, said recent audits found no evidence of theft.
</P>
<P>
   So the plant keeps coughing up cigarettes by the case, a small
but hopeful economic engine on a reservation with virtually no
other Indian businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management of any new kind of business is tough in areas like
this because you don't have somebody with the specialized
experience just sitting around locally,'' said Russell Bradley of
the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. ``But as time goes on, as they
learn how to run the operation, the plant's got real potential.''

FUGITIVE HACKER TAUNTS AUTHORITIES WITH ONLINE JOURNAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES -- Celebrated in the underground world of hacking
as a self-styled playboy and a snitch, Justin Petersen has never
kept a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   After an arrest for minor hacking crimes in the early 1990s, the
long-haired, one-legged Hollywood resident turned informant for the
FBI, using federal money to supplement his love of fast cars, fast
women and Sunset Strip nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the second time in five years, he's picked up his hard
drives and hit the road -- on the run from the same federal
government he used to work for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alas, rest assured I am somewhere having fun with a
nice-looking lady, enjoying the first freedom I have felt in some
time,'' according to a letter signed ``Justin'' that showed up
recently on his Web home page.
</P>
<P>
   Federal marshals have issued an arrest warrant for Petersen,
accusing him of violating his probation for an earlier hacking
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange twist to the fugitive-law enforcement
relationship. While the feds won't say a word about the
investigation, technology has allowed Petersen to document his run
from the law.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Nebraska native's phone answering machine says
``I'm gone, baby'' -- but those who leave messages receive
responses. His Web site has constant updates, and he's apparently
still answering his e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I find this whole situation amusing,'' he wrote.
``Everyone seems so interested in what the hell I'm up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Petersen, who lost his leg in a motorcycle crash on Sunset
Boulevard, has furnished dozens of recent pictures on his Web site
-- most showing the hacker with his shirt unbuttoned and an
attractive woman on his arm.
</P>
<P>
   His last stint as a fugitive lasted from October 1993 to August
1994. Prosecutors claim he hacked into Heller Financial bank while
he was on the run and paid himself $150,000, phoning in two bomb
threats to make sure wire transfer officers were away from their
desks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Steven Wilson sentenced Petersen to 41
months in prison for those crimes and a few others, adding a
three-year supervised release.
</P>
<P>
   He served the time, but court records show that Petersen was
accused this summer of violating four tenets of his release
agreement -- which ordered him to pay $40,000 and stay away from
computers except at work.
</P>
<P>
   After an Aug. 24 hearing, attended by Petersen and his lawyer,
Wilson sent him to a halfway house, ordered him to abide by the
terms of his release and enter a psychological treatment program
that was recommended by his probation officer.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, he was gone, and Wilson issued a
warrant for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   While the case file offers some explanation as to what led up to
Petersen's most recent dash from the criminal justice system,
federal officials are disclosing very little about their attempts
to get him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently there is an active investigation pending on Mr.
Petersen,'' said U.S. Marshal spokesman Victor Zamudio, declining
to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Also mum was David Schindler, the assistant U.S. Attorney who
prosecuted Petersen and is getting ready for the trial of hacker
Kevin Mitnick. Schindler declined to comment beyond the contents of
the case file. Officials at the U.S. Probation office declined to
comment on the case at all.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the feds, Petersen apparently is more than happy to
discuss every aspect of his run from the law, as long as the
discussion takes place online.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after a message was left on his telephone answering
machine seeking comment, a letter appeared on his Web page,
explaining that he took a job overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regarding my fugitive status, this is mostly a nonstory,''
Petersen wrote. ``I had a personality conflict with my parole
office and could not come to terms.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended the note with a request to ``report responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your life history and financial records are only keystrokes
away,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is alive with rumors concerning Petersen's
whereabouts. Kevin Poulsen, a convicted hacker Petersen helped put
away for a five-year jail term, since served, has typed several
articles in his column on a Web site called ZDTV.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent column, Poulsen called Petersen ``an aging Lothario
fallen on hard times and perhaps struggling to hold on to some
semblance of his flamboyant lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   One apparently false rumor has U.S. Marshals desperately trying
to track Petersen down to testify in the Jan. 19 trial of hacker
Mitnick, a former Pierce College student who faces various charges
that stem from his own fugitive hacking spree.
</P>
<P>
   While Schindler said the Mitnick case ``is not based on Mr.
Petersen's testimony,'' he declined to comment on his witness list.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Richard Sherman, who is defending one of Mitnick's
co-defendants, said Petersen will not testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has stated in writing that Justin Petersen
isn't going to be a witness in this case,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman laughed at the suggestion that he or Mitnick's lawyer
Donald Randolph might make Petersen a defense witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given his history, would you?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Sherman expects Petersen to find his way back to
jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be back in custody soon,'' Sherman said. ``He's not
very successful in his running endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Petersen, not surprisingly, addressed that topic, too, revealing
that he may even end all the fuss himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am still considering simply turning myself in and getting it
over with,'' he said. ``Regardless, if I happen to get apprehended,
it will be of little concern to me.''

THE NOV. 10 HORROR OF ST. JOSEPH, MO.: A RETELLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHAWNA A. HAMEL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. JOSEPH, Mo. _ (On Tuesday, Nov. 10, William Eldon Lattin Jr.
went on a shooting spree in the streets of St. Joseph. He fired
nearly 300 rounds that day, killing a St. Joseph police officer and
wounding four other persons. This re-creation is based on public
documents and interviews with police, witnesses and victims.)
</P>
<P>
   It was the afternoon of Nov. 10, and William Eldon Lattin Jr.
stood in front of his bathroom mirror. Clumps of brown hair
littered the floor. He slid a razor across his scalp.
</P>
<P>
   He was 6 feet tall, slender, 33 years old. He was also, in a way
we cannot understand, angry and determined. He shaved the sides of
his head, careful toleave a 3-inch wide strip of hair from his
forehead to the base of his skull. His Captain Hook mustache
drooped over the corners of his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor of his studio apartment were boxes that once
contained guns, a gas mask, shell casings, gun magazines, gun
parts, gunpowder.
</P>
<P>
   Two empty vodka bottles lay on top of the kitchen trash can.
Beneath them, in the trash, were the shredded remnants of his
Social Security card and other personal papers. He wouldn't need
them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled on a long-sleeved shirt and combat fatigue pants,
olive drab camouflage swirls against a tan background.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up two bandoleers of shotgun shells, 49 shells in all,
and strapped them around his waist. He draped a magazine vest for
his assault rifle ammunition over his chest and clipped a sheath
knife with a 6-inch blade to it. He slid a black-powder handgun
into the front pocket of his fatigue pants.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up the 12-gauge pump shotgun with the shoulder sling
and strapped it over his right shoulder. Finally he picked up the
MAK 90, a variation of the AK-47 assault rifle, 7.62 mm bore,
semiautomatic. He cradled the rifle in the crook of his right arm,
and stepped over the weapons and ammo on his living room floor.
</P>
<P>
   He jammed a 30-round banana clip into the MAK 90, locked a round
into its chamber and, shortly after 5 p.m., stepped out his front
door and into the cool, hazy dusk.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph Police Sgt. Billy Paul Miller had to serve a probate
warrant on the north side of town. After 11 years on the force,
serving warrants was routine, something he could do in his sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 33, was clean-shaven, with short, brown hair and blue
eyes and a quick smile. He was stocky and strong and a team leader
of the police SWAT team. He'd been married 10 years and had two
daughters he adored. He loved his family, his church, his friends
and his job.
</P>
<P>
   His job. In truth, there was only one thing Miller would change
about his work if he could. A day in November 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The call was a domestic dispute. Shots had been fired. When he
arrived alone at the family's house, he encountered a man with an
assault rifle. After a short chase the man turned on Miller and
took aim. Miller shot him in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   The department gave him a Medal of Valor. Deep inside, Miller
hoped he'd never have to use his gun again.
</P>
<P>
   But that was years ago, and far from his mind as he prepared to
serve a warrant. Sgt. Terry White pulled up in another car in case
Miller needed help.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and White were only a few steps away from their patrol
cars when a dispatch call over their radios startled them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shots fired! Shots fired! There's a man down!'' one of the
dispatchers shouted over the radio, her voice shrill. ``The area of
22nd and Frederick!''
</P>
<P>
   Miller and White ran back to their patrol cars and jumped in.
They cranked up their lights and sirens and roared toward whatever
was happening on 22nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Lattin walked purposefully down the street, MAK 90 under his
arm, picking targets.
</P>
<P>
   He stared straight ahead, poker-faced, making no eye contact
with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   He began to shoot over the tops of cars, warning shots. When the
shooting started, people began screaming, and car tires shrieked as
drivers jammed on brakes and wheeled out of his way.
</P>
<P>
   Police had yet to arrive, and Lattin waved most cars to go
around him as he marched down the street in his camouflage
fatigues, the shotgun slung tight against his back, the MAK 90
hooked under his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Then he spotted a new white Pontiac Sunfire, driven by a young
woman, coming toward him. She was about 30 feet away and could not
see Lattin as he raised the MAK 90 to his shoulder and locked in
his target.
</P>
<P>
   Valorie Sharp was about to turn onto Colhoun Street from 22nd
Street, going to pick up her son from his grandparent's house three
blocks away. It was then that her windshield exploded. The stench
of gunsmoke made her choke. The noise of the breaking glass
deafened her.
</P>
<P>
   She put her hands to her face. Blood oozed through her fingers
and dripped onto her lap.
</P>
<P>
   She got out of the Sunfire and took five steps before she fell
in the street. Her legs felt heavy, every step an effort. She had
been hit in the face by shards of metal after the bullet smashed
through the windshield. The one eye in which she'd been shot was
swollen, the other filled with scraps of lead. She could barely
see.
</P>
<P>
   She got up, took two more steps and fell again. Gunshots
crackled. She began crawling. Cars sped past her; she could hear
bullets hitting them; she could feel bullets ricochet off the
ground close to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you all right, honey?'' a man's voice said.
</P>
<P>

   ``You do, so stay down.''

   The man helped her up and into his truck, shutting the door
behind her. She lay exhausted against a box of light bulbs,
thinking of her son, her husband, the three of them rushing to get
ready for work and school that morning, laughing. The man in the
truck called an ambulance. He later drove off without identifying
himself. MORE

MISSOURI'S DIOXIN-TAINTED SOIL SENT TO KANSAS FOR INCINERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: When federal regulators last year discovered more
dioxin contamination in eastern Missouri, they were at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks earlier they had dismantled the incinerator in Times
Beach, Mo., where dioxin-contaminated material from 27 sites in
eastern Missouri had been burned. What would they do with their
latest find?
</P>
<P>
   Today they have a solution: Send it to Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Dioxin-tainted soil from Ellisville, Mo., and McDonnell Park in
St. Louis County is going to Coffeyville, Kan., where an
incinerator is burning the waste.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 18 the unit began the burning after passing new state
inspections. The incineration could continue at least 10 months, as
some 12,000 tons of material must be burned.
</P>
<P>
   The soil is being transported by truck from eastern Missouri to
Coffeyville.
</P>
<P>
   Some southeastern Kansas residents worry, however, that high
rates of cancer there might be related to the incineration of toxic
wastes in Coffeyville and area cement kilns and manufacturing
plants. They do not welcome any more incineration of toxic waste,
especially dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have too much cancer here already,'' said Terry Smith of
Cherryvale, whose daughter died of cancer. ``We think the Kansas
Department of Health and Environment shouldn't continue to let
these polluters operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas regulators will ensure that the incinerator continues to
operate in compliance. Environmental Protection Agency officials,
however, checked to ensure that the company had been in compliance
with all regulations before deciding to send its dioxin waste to
Coffeyville, said Bob Feild, the EPA's dioxin project coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the testing that has been performed, both initially
and in 1997, demonstrates that this material can be safely treated
at this facility,'' Feild said.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent public hearing some southeastern Kansas residents
expressed doubt. About 60 residents wore T-shirts bearing the names
of children diagnosed with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a quiet protest,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators, such as EPA officials, said they thought that as
long as the incinerator adhered to the strict regulatory limits in
its permits, its emissions should not pose any additional health
threat to area residents, said Don Brown, a spokesman for the
Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has given the University of Kansas about $400,000 to
conduct a multiyear health assessment of southeast Kansas
residents. In 1995 state officials confirmed that Labette County
had high rates of some childhood cancer, but it could not link the
cancers to any cause.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA decided to pursue the health study, though, when it
became clear that many residents in southeastern Kansas remained
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The incinerator accepting the Missouri dioxin waste is operated
by Safety-Kleen. For years Aptus operated it as the nation's only
commercial incinerator permitted to burn dioxin waste.
</P>
<P>
   The incinerator had been idle until the EPA approached
Safety-Kleen about restarting it for the dioxin-contaminated waste.
</P>
<P>
   Dioxin, the unwanted byproduct of some manufacturing processes,
has been linked to cancer and reproductive- and immune-system
disorders. The EPA has required in eastern Missouri that soils be
cleaned to a level no more than 1 part per billion, an extremely
stringent requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrations of dioxin were detected at McDonnell Park as high
as 275 parts per billion.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago a waste-oil hauler sprayed driveways, roads, horse
arenas and others sites to suppress dust. The oil was contaminated
by dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup in eastern Missouri has cost an estimated $200
million, excluding the discovery of the two new sites. EPA has
estimated the costs of cleaning up those new sites at $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Syntex Agribusiness, the company that the EPA has held
responsible for the dioxin cleanup in eastern Missouri, has agreed
to pay for a large part of the new cleanup costs, said Feild. The
federal portion _ about $5.5 million _ will come out of the federal
Superfund program, Feild said.
</P>
<P>
   An order detailing that arrangement has yet to be filed in
federal court.

SOME IDEAS ARE JUST TOO GOOD TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It's time once again to get into the holiday
spirit by dipping into the ol' mailbag and allowing some valued
contributors to do most of the heavy lifting. What are long
weekends for, if not to dedicating oneself to avoiding work?
</P>
<P>
   Today's lead-off hitter is a guy with what seems a capital idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of tying Social Security's (annual cost-of-living
increases) to (rises in) the Consumer Price Index-W or E (based on
worker or elderly spending patterns), how about tying it to the
CPI-HS, otherwise (known as) congressional pay increases (for the)
House and Senate?'' Dear Brilliant:
</P>
<P>
   What a concept! While we're at it, why don't we scrap the
congressional pension system entirely and bring past, present and
future members of Congress into the Social Security system
exclusively? (And if such a thing were doable, the right honorables
should be required to serve in office for at least 40 quarters
before they become fully eligible for benefits.)
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Social Security, it has been much on people's minds
in the debate over how to use the putative federal budget surplus
to ``save'' the system. This reader's question provides an example
of how confusing the issue is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand (your comment that) the `surplus can't be
saved.' Can't the surplus be used to pay back some of the Social
Security IOUs (from the Treasury)? In other words, put more money
into the trust fund.'' Dear Confused:
</P>
<P>
   There is no legal mechanism allowing for tax revenue to be
``saved,'' in the sense you understand the term. It can be spent,
or used to retire debt. The Treasury debt held by the Social
Security trust fund is comprised of nonmarketable securities. Your
way only makes sense if the trust fund surplus could be invested in
assets with market value, such as stocks, bonds or certificates of
deposit. Everyone claims the trust fund will help finance benefits
when outgo begins to exceed revenue in 15 to 20 years, but how? Its
assets are merely claims against the Treasury that must be
redeemed. This will require higher taxes, more borrowing, adjusting
federal budget outlays, or a combination thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Moving right along to another issue that's equally confusing,
one reader has his doubts about the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been reading about the Federal Reserve...If (it's)
true, (its operations) would seem to be the greatest fraud ever
perpetrated on the American people. (My) friends either don't
believe it, or say it's militia propaganda.'' Dear Wondering:
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve stirs strong passions among those who think
about such things enough to have an opinion on them. Some see the
Fed as the devil incarnate, while others credit it with being
responsible for U.S. economic stability. The hard truth is that
central banking is a fact of life in the modern world. The United
States couldn't function in the global economy without a central
bank. Given this, would you rather have a monetary system run by an
agency with some political independence, or one run by Congress and
the White House? What Fed haters fail to appreciate is how badly
screwed up things would likely be if politicians were in charge of
the nation's financial system.

THE BIG CITY: COOLING DOWN LUXURY FEVER IN GIFTS RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before the lunch at Lespinasse, Dr. Robert Frank's
theory seemed unassailable. Frank, an economist with a radical
proposal to reduce conspicuous consumption, thinks we would all be
happier if we spent less money this holiday season, and he
illustrated his point during a morning shopping expedition on Fifth
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   After examining a $9,500 porcelain hawk in Trump Tower and a
$55,000 brooch at Tiffany, he found the ultimate gift at Asprey &AMP;
Garrard. It was for the man who owns a half-dozen mechanical
watches _ the kind that are powered by the movement of your wrist,
cost $20,000, keep time less accurately than a $20 quartz watch and
stop running when not worn. To keep them all ticking, the store
offers a $5,700 leather-encased box equipped with six
battery-powered mechanical wrists.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is just fantastic,'' Frank tactfully told the sales clerk
as he marveled at the box. He waited until he left the store to
make his point: ``It's easy to imagine that there are better uses
for that $5,700.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank does not object on moral grounds to expensive watches or
the people who love them. He is neither a socialist nor an ascetic.
Frank, a professor at Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School
of Management, is a free-market economist who believes society is
usually better off when individuals are free to greedily pursue
their own self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to luxuries like watch-rotating boxes, Frank
thinks that the pursuit of individual self-interest leaves everyone
worse off. In his forthcoming book, ``Luxury Fever'' (Free Press),
he argues that conspicuous consumption is a collective-action
problem, like an arms race: the more your neighbor spends, the more
you must spend just to stay even.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lavish spending by people at the top of the scale sets a
standard that affects everyone below,'' he said. ``When the rich
are wearing a different $20,000 watch every day, the middle class
feel they need $1,000 watches. If the other people competing for a
job are wearing $1,500 suits, you're at a disadvantage if you go to
the interview in a $300 suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank maintains that the recent surge in luxury spending has
bought little extra happiness, because studies show that the joys
of consumption are relative and fleeting. Your satisfaction with
the size of your home depends not so much on its square footage but
on how it compares with the size of your neighbors' homes. Trading
in a Camry for a BMW makes you happier only for a short time, until
the new level of luxury seems routine to you (and your neighbor
buys a Porsche).
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd all be happier,'' Frank said, ``if everyone spent less on
luxury goods. We wouldn't have to work such long hours, so we'd
have more time to spend with our families. There'd be more money to
spend on education and health, and more savings for capital
investments that would make society richer in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   To test this theory, Frank was invited to lunch in the rococo
splendor of Lespinasse at the St. Regis Hotel. Over foie gras, he
explained his remedy for conspicuous consumption: replace the
income tax with a simple, progressive tax on the total amount you
spend each year (which could be easily calculated by deducting your
savings from your income). This scheme sounded fine until the
waiters presented the risotto.
</P>
<P>
   It was served with asparagus, chanterelle mushrooms and diced
lobster, and was accompanied by the crowning glory, emulsion of
white truffle oil frothing in a footed silver bowl. Whatever one
thought of the value of rotating-watch boxes, there was no denying
that adding this truffle oil emulsion to the risotto increased the
sum of human happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money does buy wonderful things,'' Frank said as he savored
the taste. He conceded that his tax system would make such meals
more expensive _ a person in the top bracket might pay $50 tax on
this $75 lunch _ and therefore rarer. But he insisted that we could
somehow survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our satisfaction here comes from knowing that this is
the finest lunch we can buy in New York,'' he said. ``The problem
is the cost of the finest lunch in New York has risen much faster
than the rate of inflation, so we're spending much more today for
it than we did 20 years ago. If we could just stop that trend, we'd
get more satisfaction for less money.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the truffle oil emulsion?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we might have to do without the truffle oil,'' he said.
``But we wouldn't miss it so much.''

<P>
   ST. JOSEPH, Mo. _ without identifying himself.
</P>
<P>
   When the ambulance arrived, paramedics slid Valorie Sharp
inside. Minutes later, Jack Martin, 57, owner of Jack's Auto Sales
on 22nd Street, joined her. He had been shot in the stomach, chest
and forearm. Sharp remembers briefly seeing, hearing, the
blood-covered Martin groaning.
</P>
<P>
   Then she heard a dispatcher over the MAST scanner: ``An officer
is shot, and he's still in his car.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sped south, Miller listened to dispatchers on the radio. A
man dressed in camouflage clothing was walking down 22nd Street in
the city's midtown area, randomly shooting at people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm under fire!'' an officer yelled over the radio, his voice
choppy, as if he was running.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was almost there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got another victim down, 22nd and Colhoun!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Officer Arn is in the area,'' dispatchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and White reached the corner of 22nd and Frederick. The
scene was chaos. Miller pulled his patrol car into the middle of
22nd Street to block the intersection. He could hear gunfire, and
surreal screams.
</P>
<P>
   People lay under their cars, or crouched down inside them. One
man pressed himself tight against a retaining wall, trying to hide.
Men, women, children ran down sidewalks, through parking lots, on
the streets, anywhere to get away from the gunshots. Miller could
not see the gunman, but sounds of his shooting echoed off the
midtown buildings. He knew he was close.
</P>
<P>
   Lattin walked up the steps of Calvary Baptist Church on 22nd
Street and kept firing. He had more than 300 rounds left.
</P>
<P>
   He saw a new blue Ford pickup rolling down the street to the
right of him, and he took careful aim. His shot blew out the back
window of Kenny Cordonnier's truck.
</P>
<P>
   As the truck roared away, Lattin spotted another target farther
down the street, a police car with a cop inside. He aimed again and
started squeezing the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Bradley Thomas Arn was not even out of his patrol car
when seven bullets crashed through his rear window and driver's
seat. One hit him in the back of the head.
</P>
<P>
   White and Miller, pistols drawn, ran from their patrol cars to
the northwest corner of Kovacs Affiliated Food Store. Another
officer stood nearby, his voice anxious and urgent, his gun in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's over there! He's over there!'' the officer yelled. He
directed White to the west side of the building.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman was trapped behind a church, about 50 yards south of
Kovacs. Miller ran to the building's east side, his gun out, the
empty holster slapping his hip. He could hear the popping of
gunfire and see cars rushing westbound on Colhoun Street. But he
couldn't see the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   He took a deep breath and pressed himself against the store's
cold brick wall. He edged down the side of the building and slid
behind a cinder-block cooler that jutted out several feet.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the building, White was watching the
gunman, who'd wheeled to face him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police officer!'' White shouted, his pistol out in front of
him. Lattin raised the MAK 90 and fired six rounds at him. White
jumped back, squeezing against the building for cover.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman had not tried to take cover. He stood straight up,
holding his ground, firing at any officers in view.
</P>
<P>
   As Lattin fired at White, Miller took a quick peek from around
the cooler's corner. He saw the gunman's profile, the rifle against
his shoulder, looking ahead, to Miller's left. He was nearly 50
yards away. For Miller, armed with a .45-caliber pistol, it was a
shot verging on the impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's precision shooting,'' Miller thought. ``There can be no
reasoning with this guy. There can be no good end to this. I can
take him down from here.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned to an officer standing behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking the shot,'' he said. ``This guy has got to be
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   He stepped out from behind the cooler, took two steps toward the
shooter and raised the .45 with both hands.
</P>
<P>
   He squeezed twice, the big .45 booming, bucking against his
arms. Lattin went down. Miller kept his eyes on Lattin's still
form. He got on his radio:
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspect is down. Cover him with your weapons. Cover me.''
</P>
<P>
   He angled behind the gunman as White and other officers emerged
from the other side of the building.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman did not move. Miller holstered his gun and took the
semiautomatic rifle from the gunman's hands, noticing the two
bandoleers of shotgun ammunition. Another officer bent down and
cuffed him.
</P>
<P>
   Miller looked closely at the side of the dead man's face. He had
been killed by a single round to the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   He looked again. He knew him. He and Lattin had gone to high
school together. He'd killed a classmate.
</P>
<P>
   Miller turned and walked away from the scene, dazed, heading
toward his patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God,'' he remembers thinking. ``It happened again. I can't
think of any other way that situation could have been resolved
peacefully, but it had to happen again. I had to do it. I just had
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Lattin's 20-minute shooting spree had killed one policeman and
wounded four other persons. He had fired about 280 rounds and had
at least 300 left.
</P>
<P>
   Drained and exhausted, Miller walked away from the scene. He
walked down an alley when an older woman approached him, grabbing
his sleeve to get his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it over? Is it?'' she asked quickly, nervously, trailing
alongside him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's over,'' he said softly, not stopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is everyone all right?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Miller took a deep breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, everyone was not.

   A psychotherapist was hurrying to an appointment by cab when she
realized she had left her purse at home. She told the driver, but
reassured him that there would be someone at the other end who
would lend her the money to pay the bill. ``That's all right,'' he
replied. ``You look like a nice old lady, and I'm sure I can trust
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The therapist, who prefers to remain anonymous, bristled
inwardly but began to search her pockets and found a long forgotten
$20 bill. She reported her success and added, ``I must tell you
that I did not appreciate your calling me an old lady, even a nice
one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' he answered, ``I knew you'd be angry at yourself for
forgetting your purse so I figured you might as well transfer some
of that anger to me.'' She was rendered speechless by this display
of psychology and she said she now regarded cabdrivers with a
newfound respect.

   Last Halloween two boys, about 9 or 10 years old, knocked at the
door of Gaetano Limoncelli and held out their goody bags without
comment. When Limoncelli asked, ``What do you say?'' they thought
for a moment and finally came up with ``Thank you.'' ``No,''
Limoncelli replied, ``why are you here?'' Their reply, of course,
was ``Trick or treat.'' Limoncelli then asked them what they would
do if he did not give them a treat. They became pensive. Finally,
the younger boy said, ``I'll sue you.''

BRONX SCRIBE REPAIRING TORAH DAMAGED IN HURRICANE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Stephen Underberg, a retired retailer living in
Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., the devastation of Hurricane Mitch, in
which at least 11,000 Central Americans lost their lives, was grim
but distant. ``It was just another hurricane story,'' said
Underberg, 62.
</P>
<P>
   Then he heard about an e-mail message from Honduras. His
son-in-law received it from a business associate in Tegucigalpa,
the capital city, who told him about the 35 Jewish families there
whose synagogue was destroyed by flood. One of their sacred Torahs
was lost, and their remaining Torah was dug out of three feet of
mud, water-stained and disfigured.
</P>
<P>
   The Hondurans needed a sofer, or scribe, to repair it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my proudest days was when I could say, `We have a sofer
for you''' Underberg said.
</P>
<P>
   When the sofer, Rabbi Emmanuel Vinas of the Bronx, crouched
Sunday over Underberg's dining room table, where the Tegucigalpa
Torah had been placed after a journey of more than 2,200 miles,
someone asked if the wrinkled, smeared parchment could be saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Vinas said softly, his hands and fingers stained to
the color of gunpowder after inspecting it for more than an hour.
``Yeah, but I haven't gotten to the end of the scroll yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It may take $10,000 in materials and other costs and perhaps two
years to restore the Torah, Vinas said, but it could be done.
</P>
<P>
   The Torah is more than a scroll of animal-skin parchment
containing the first five books of the Old Testament, said Vinas,
30, who has been a scribe for eight years. It is a symbol of the
Jewish community extending back to Moses, he said. But Torah repair
is time-consuming because it can only be done by a sofer, who
writes on the parchment by hand with a quill made from a kosher
animal, like a turkey or quail.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100 native-born Honduran Jews, expatriate Americans and
Israelis are members of Communidad Hebrea de Tegucigalpa. The story
of how their Torah traveled from hurricane-ravaged Honduras to
Underberg's three-bedroom house in suburban Westchester is a story
of determination and faith.
</P>
<P>
   When Hurricane Mitch hit Tegucigalpa Oct. 30, Rio Choluteca
flooded, swept through the front wall of the synagogue of
Communidad Hebrea and covered the converted three-bedroom house in
20 feet of inky water. The flood broke the ark that contained the
two Torahs, one brought over by immigrants from Hungary and the
other from Germany shortly after World War II. Frantic congregants
could find only one Torah, the one from Hungary, in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Rembo, 48, an American Jew who owns a health maintenance
organization in San Pedro Sula, 200 miles north of Tegucigalpa,
sent an e-mail to Underberg's son-in-law, Harry Mueller, his
business associate in Connecticut. Could Underberg find a sofer?
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, Underberg's wife, Judy, is on the board of
directors of the Jewish Community Center in nearby Tarrytown, which
had recently hired Vinas as director of Jewish education.
</P>
<P>
   The Tegucigalpa Torah was spirited out of Honduras. The Torah
will stay in Vinas' study for what he estimated will be 5,000 hours
of repair work.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SAN DIEGO _ The Denver Broncos almost proved nobody's perfect, but
they overcame four first-half turnovers to become the NFL's first
12-0 team since the 1985 Chicago Bears.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Broncos mauled the San Diego Chargers 31-16 on Sunday night
for their 17th consecutive victory dating to last season when they
won Super Bowl XXXII. They moved one step closer to achieving their
goals of becoming the NFL's first 19-0 team and joining the 1972
Miami Dolphins as the league's only unbeaten and untied champion.
</P>
<P>
   In their last four games, the Broncos play Kansas City in
Denver, visit the New York Giants and Miami and host Seattle. The
Dolphins game is their next and last prime-time appearance in the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos survived John Elway's three interceptions and
fumbled snap in the first half to defeat the fired-up Chargers for
the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange first half, the Broncos and Chargers combined for
eight turnovers. The first two quarters at Qualcomm Stadium showed
just how good and bad the Broncos can be. They played their worst
half of the season, but rather than falling behind, they led by 11
points at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the Broncos commit four turnovers and still lead 21-10?
Because Elway also threw three touchdown passes, including two
after Denver interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers, who had won their past two games when quarterback
Craig Whelihan replaced No. 1 pick Ryan Leaf, also committed four
turnovers, including three interceptions by Whelihan.
</P>
<P>
   Before this game, Denver had committed only nine turnovers all
season, including two fumbles. Elway and center Tom Nalen
mishandled the snap on the first play, and San Diego linebacker
Junior Seau recovered at the Broncos' 25. That first turnover led
to John Carney's 27-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos struggled on offense. If not for San Diego's
turnovers, they wouldn't have had much to show for the first half
because the Chargers' No. 1-ranked run defense threw a blanket over
running back Terrell Davis, who carried nine times for 32 yards in
the first two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Elway and Davis needed help from the defense to jump-start the
offense. When cornerback Darrien Gordon intercepted Whelihan and
returned it 17 yards to the San Diego 22, the Broncos scored for
the first time. Elway found receiver Ed McCaffrey open for a
15-yard touchdown. Jason Elam kicked the extra point for a 7-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's best drive came midway through the first quarter when
it covered 66 yards in five plays. Once again, Elway and a
wide-open McCaffrey combined for the touchdown. This one went for
37 yards. Elam made it 14-3 with 6:43 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, it seemed another Denver rout was on, but the
Chargers momentarily regained their composure, thanks to Whelihan.
On an 81-yard drive, he completed four passes for 56 yards. Running
back Terrell Fletcher, who was elevated to the starting lineup when
the injured Natrone Means was lost for the season, scored on a
13-yard run to make it 14-10.
</P>
<P>
   On their next series, the Chargers looked as if they were going
to take the lead. They reached Denver's seven, but reserve running
back Kenny Bynum fumbled at the five. That was it for San Diego's
offense. From there, it became a comedy of errors and Elway and
Whelihan were the featured performers.
</P>
<P>
   First, Elway was intercepted by cornerback Charles Dimry, who
returned it 30 yards to the Denver 41. The scoring chance was
squandered when Whelihan was intercepted by cornerback Darrius
Johnson at Denver's 49.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of that Denver series, Dimry intercepted Elway
again, but the Chargers could do nothing with it.
</P>
<P>
   Elway made it three interceptions on three consecutive series
when safety Greg Johnson picked off a long pass at the San Diego
two. Two plays later, linebacker John Mobley intercepted Whelihan,
and a San Diego facemask penalty gave the Broncos a first down at
San Diego's 19.
</P>
<P>
   Elway didn't waste this opportunity. On the second play, he
threw a perfect pass to the corner of the end zone, where Rod Smith
caught the 13-yard touchdown pass, giving Denver the 21-10 lead
with 49 seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos opened the second half with a drive becoming of the
defending Super Bowl champion. After stopping the Chargers on three
downs, Denver got the ball at its five. Fourteen plays, 95 yards
and eight minutes, 20 seconds later, the Broncos had a 28-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Elway completed five passes on the drive. Offsetting penalties
rubbed out his 18-yard touchdown pass to Smith on third-and-seven.
No problem. On the next play, the Chargers rushed only three
linemen, and Elway got enough time to throw an 18-yard TD pass to
tight end Shannon Sharpe, who made an outstanding catch to beat
cornerback Scott Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, who didn't catch a pass until 5:22 remained in the third
quarter, broke off his route and headed for the end zone when he
saw Elway scrambling and looking for a receiver. Sharpe caught the
ball in the back of the end zone, and Elam boosted the lead to 18
with 4:34 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   To say Denver dominated the third quarter would be an
understatement. San Diego had two series and went three-and-out
both times.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos had only two possessions in the third quarter as
well, but they scored twice. Elam's 34-yard field goal increased
Denver's lead to 31-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers scored their final TD when Whelihan threw a 47-yard
pass to Bryan Still with 5:03 remaining.

BRONCOS DEFEAT CHARGERS, 31-16 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Even the great teams, every now and then, play a
game so bad that they want to burn the game film. The Denver
Broncos are a great team, but they played in one of the ugliest
games of the season against the San Diego Chargers on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   After a first half that included eight turnovers by the teams,
the Broncos settled down thanks to the steady influence of their
offensive stars: rushes by running back Terrell Davis as well as
quarterback John Elway's passes to Ed McCaffrey, Rod Smith and
Shannon Sharpe. Denver's first drive in the third quarter went 95
yards in 8 minutes 20 seconds and ended with Elway making a great
18-yard throw to Sharpe in the end zone. It was the Broncos' best
drive of the game, and it gave Denver a commanding 28-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the Broncos' 31-16 victory at Qualcomm Stadium
keeps alive the most-watched streak in sports. The Broncos improved
to 12-0 with four games remaining. The Super Bowl champions are
trying to win not just 16 games, but 19, which would give them
another Super Bowl title.
</P>
<P>
   Denver is only the fourth team in National Football League
history to go undefeated in 12 games, joining the 1934 Chicago
Bears, the 1972 Miami Dolphins and the 1985 Bears.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' dreams almost came to an end on Sunday night. Elway
threw four touchdown passes, but also three interceptions, and the
Denver offense was sluggish and sloppy in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the third quarter, and Bronco receivers were wide
open. Davis, who had only 32 yards in the first half, squeaked
through tight holes in the second half. While Davis was not a huge
factor, he still passed the 1,500-yard mark for the season, making
him only the second player in league history to rush for at least
1,500 yards in three consecutive seasons. The Detroit Lions' Barry
Sanders did it from 1994-97.
</P>
<P>
   This game could have been one of the possible roadblocks in
Denver's quest for an undefeated season. First, the Broncos might
have lost some incentive because they knew coming in that, hours
earlier, Oakland had lost to Washington, which meant the Broncos
had captured the American Football Conference West before they even
took the field.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Chargers had not allowed a 100-yard game by an
opposing rusher all year. They had shut down good running backs
like Buffalo's Antowain Smith, Tennessee's Eddie George,
Indianapolis's Marshall Faulk, Oakland's Napoleon Kaufman and, yes,
even Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Davis was held to a season-low 69 yards on 20
carries by the San Diego defense. The Broncos still won easily, but
that game left a bad taste in the mouth of Davis, who is from the
San Diego area and likes to do well against the Chargers no matter
where the game is played.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers knew that the only chance they had to beat Denver
was to jump on the Broncos early and keep the score close. That was
because Denver had outscored its opponents this season by 131-23 in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And San Diego scored first. When Denver made a rare mistake _
Elway bobbled a snap and the ball was recovered by linebacker
Junior Seau at the Broncos' 25 _the Chargers scored, although they
managed only a 27-yard field goal by John Carney. That seemed like
a bad omen, because a turnover like that should produce more than 3
points. Sure enough, Denver got two quick touchdowns, on passes to
McCaffrey of 15 and 37 yards, for an early 14-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But San Diego was not ready to capitulate. Finding inspiration
in the sometimes good play of the backup quarterback Craig
Whelihan, who was starting in place of the benched Ryan Leaf, and
the great play of Seau, the Chargers cut the lead to 4 points after
a 13-yard touchdown on a draw play by running back Terrell
Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   The teams then went through a period of sloppy play. Elway was
sacked by Seau, and Chargers running back Kenny Bynum fumbled at
the Denver 5-yard line when San Diego could have taken the lead.
That was followed by an interception of Elway by Charles Dimry, who
made an over-the-shoulder catch of a pass intended for McCaffrey.
More sloppiness: Whelihan was intercepted by cornerback Darrius
Johnson. Then Dimry picked off Elway again. During one stretch in
the second quarter, there was almost a turnover a minute.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Broncos were playing down to the level of
their opponent. That continued when, with less than two minutes to
go in the half, Elway was picked off by Greg Jackson for the Denver
quarterback's third interception of the game. Then Whelihan was
intercepted again, this time by linebacker John Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos capitalized on the last interception when wide
receiver Rod Smith caught a 13-yard touchdown pass. Denver finally
began to pull away, gaining a 21-10 lead at halftime. But it had
been ugly. &QL;

`BUG'S LIFE' FLIES HIGH AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The nationwide opening of ``A Bug's Life'' soared
past rivals for a record-setting victory at the U.S. box office
with an estimated $46.5 million at 2,686 theaters during the
Wednesday-Sunday holiday period, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The results gave the computer-animated comedy, co-produced by
Disney and Pixar, the best total ever for the five-day Thanksgiving
period, edging the 1996 record of $45.1 million for ``101
Dalmatians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life,'' which has received strong reviews, could
eventually match the $191.8 million total for ``Toy Story,'' the
first Disney-Pixar collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audiences absolutely love this movie,'' said Disney marketing
executive Chuck Viane. ``Everything points to it having terrific
playability, no ifs, ands or buts about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Viane noted that ``A Bug's Life,'' centered on an ant colony
battling marauding grasshoppers, was attracting all demographics
with one-third of the audience between 2 and 11 years old and
another third between 12 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Arthur Rockwell said Disney's marketing for ``A Bug's
Life'' had been particularly sharp and praised Pixar -- a newcomer
to Hollywood -- for generating a property that could match ``Toy
Story.'' ``It's quite an accomplishment for Pixar to have
back-to-back successes like this,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' opened Nov. 20 for a five-day exclusive run at
the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood and took in over $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   A trio of holdovers also performed impressively, led by
Paramount's second weekend of ``The Rugrats Movie'' with $27.6
million at 2,836 theaters to give the animated comedy a highly
respectable $58 million after 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service, projected ``Rugrats'' will become the first non-Disney
animated movie to top the $100 million mark, adding, ``That will be
an incredible coup for Paramount.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival studios have been spending hundreds of millions of dollars
to break Disney's stranglehold on the lucrative animation business.
Disney's Viane said there is enough demand for both ``A Bug's
Life'' and ``Rugrats'' to generate solid results, adding, ``The
marketplace always expands when there are several good movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney took the next two spots with its second weekend of
``Enemy of the State'' with $25.7 million at 2,435 sites, followed
by its fourth weekend of ``The Waterboy'' with $19.9 million at
2,782 locations. Along with the $2.3 million from ``I'll Be Home
For Christmas,'' Disney releases took in an impressive $95.2
million during the five days, or better than half the estimated
$185 million of overall business.
</P>
<P>
   And the victory for ``A Bug's Life'' made it five years in a row
that a Disney film had led the box office during the critical
Thanksgiving holiday period, following ``The Santa Clause,'' ``Toy
Story,'' ``101 Dalmatians'' and ``Flubber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney is just going to dominate this quarter,'' Rockwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   For rival Universal, however, the weekend brought more misery to
the troubled studio as its high-priced ``Babe: Pig in the City''
underperformed expectations with a fifth-place finish of $8.5
million at 2,384 theaters. Bucksbaum said the sequel, costing a
reported $90 million, was hurt by strong performances by ``A Bug's
Life'' and ``Rugrats'' and the negative publicity over delays in
finishing the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't enough room in the marketplace and the studio had
a difficult time highlighting the positive reviews because of the
delays,'' Bucksbaum said. ``We still think `Babe' will pick up some
steam in the coming weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal's third weekend of ``Meet Joe Black,'' another
high-cost project with lukewarm performance, finished sixth with $8
million at 2,525 screens, followed by Sony's third weekend of ``I
Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' with $6.4 million at 2,473
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Three offbeat comedies took the final spots in the Top 10 with
moderate returns -- Warner Bros.' ``Home Fries,'' starring Drew
Barrymore, with $5.1 million at 1,925 theaters; Artisan's
``Ringmaster,'' starring Jerry Springer, with $5 million at 1,312
sites; and PolyGram's ``Very Bad Things'' with $4.7 million at
1,260 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Gramercy's widened release of Academy Awards hopeful
``Elizabeth'' generated solid results in 11th with $4.2 million at
516 theaters. Fox Searchlight's Oscar contender ``Waking Ned
Devine'' continued to perform well in limited release with $251,792
at nine theaters and will expand on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Overall business was up an estimated 18 percent over the same
weekend last year. Year-to-date business has topped $6 billion,
about 10 percent ahead of the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' is likely to lead next weekend, traditionally a
slow moviegoing period, as the holiday shopping season kicks into
high gear. The only new major release will come from Universal with
its remake of ``Psycho,'' starring Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Universal has been without a hit for its past 19 movies
following ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park.'' Bucksbaum predicted
``Psycho,'' with a reported $20 million cost, will open with $10
million to $12 million next weekend.
